The outcome During the year, the Committee of that review as it affects annual bonus and longer term incentives is described more fully in received advice from Kepler the following sections of this Report.

Despite recent economic circumstances, Babcock has Committee in December 2008.
The choice of Kepler to advise it continued to deliver strong EPS growth and TSR performance.

To this end the Committee proposes to increase the Company Secretary.
Neither Kepler nor Inbucon provide or emphasis on performance-related pay and long-term incentive opportunities by increasing the provided other services to Group reward opportunities for superior performance, but without increasing rewards for average companies except in connection or median performance.

awards to be made in 2009 under the proposed new Performance Share Plan PSP, vesting at threshold for the element of the award to which it applies would be reduced from 25% as currently applies under existing L-TIP awards to 16.7% so that, despite the increased incentive opportunity under that plan for superior performance, the same percentage of salary would be paid for around median performance as would have been paid under the L-TIP.
At the same time, the proposed longer term EPS target for 2009 PSP awards will be made more stretching.
Similarly, whilst increasing the scope for performance-related annual bonus, the Committee is imposing in the current financial year a requirement on Executive Directors and certain senior managers for mandatory deferral of a significant part 40% of any future annual bonus earned into shares no such deferral was previously required.
The new bonus arrangements will also include a significant element attributable to non-financial performance metrics to ensure better linkage to Babcocks strategic objectives and management of longer term risks.
Babcock International Group PLC 50 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Remuneration report continued Balance of remuneration The balance of remuneration for Executive Directors is such that the major part of overall remuneration is subject to achieving performance conditions over both the short and long term.
The reward mix for the Chief Executive and the Finance Director is shown in the charts below, with long-term incentive awards being valued on a fair value basis.
The charts assume that the proposals for a new Performance Share Plan PSP are approved by shareholders at the Companys forthcoming Annual General Meeting in July and that PSP awards over shares have a value on grant equal to 150% of the Directors basic salary.
The charts are based on fair values of 72% of salary for the annual bonus including the mandatorily deferred share element now being introduced as described below and 59% of salary for the proposed Performance Share Plan.
Note: Based on remuneration proposals for 2009.
Internal relativity The Committee is sensitive to the need to set Directors remuneration having regard to pay and conditions in the Group as a whole and is satisfied that the approach taken by the Company is fair and reasonable in light of current market practice and the best interests of shareholders.
Basic pay Basic pay is considered in the context of total remuneration at companies that are comparable in terms of size, market capitalisation, revenues and number of employees and other companies in the support services sector.
Against these data sources taken as a whole, the Companys total remuneration fair value is around the median and basic pay is below median.
Basic pay is normally reviewed annually.
The normal annual review of Executive Directors pay for the year commencing 1 April 2008 resulted in an increase of 4%.
For the current year commencing 1 April 2009, the Committee has limited the annual increase to approximately 2% as follows: Basic pay Basic pay at 1 April 2009 at 1 April 2008 Director 000 000 P L Rogers Chief Executive 479.5 470.0 W Tame Finance Director 312.0 305.5 Performance-related rewards Annual bonus schemes Annual bonuses for 2008 09 were based on profit, cash flow performance and earnings per share growth, and were up to a maximum of 100% of base salary for Executive Directors.
The Committee decided to bring Mr Tames bonus potential into line with Mr Rogers, by increasing it from 80% to 100%, effective from 1 April 2008.
The annual bonuses payable to Mr Rogers and Mr Tame were structured as follows: a bonus of up to 20% of salary was dependent on hitting budgets for profit before tax and operating cash flow.
The balance of 80% of salary depended on growth in earnings per share, which was calculated before amortisation of acquired intangibles and exceptional items, with maximum pay-out for this element being achieved at 20% year-on-year growth.
Mr Rogers and Mr Tame earned maximum annual bonus for the financial year 2008 09 and, in accordance with past practice, this is to be paid in full in cash.
Following its remuneration review and to meet its framework for remuneration as described above, the Committee has increased the maximum bonus opportunity for 2009 10 for Executive Directors from 100% to 150% of base salary.
However, at the same time, the Executives will be required to defer 40% of any annual bonus earned i. e. worth up to 60% of salary if the maximum bonus is awarded into Babcock shares for two years.
For the financial year 2009 10 the Committee will set annual bonuses for Mr Rogers and Mr Tame principally by reference to achieving budgets 20% of bonus opportunity, growth in earnings per share before amortisation of acquired intangibles, but, unless the Committee otherwise decides, after exceptional items 60% of the bonus opportunity, with maximum bonus only for year-on-year growth of 20% or more.
In addition, the bonus for 2009 10 will include within the performance requirements accounting for up to 20% of the total bonus opportunity key Governance 34 60 Babcock International Group PLC 51 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 non-financial metrics that are directly related to the Groups key strategic objectives, risk factors and management challenges described in the Overview section on page 48 above.
It is the Committees intention to provide rewards that are fair to both executives and shareholders.
In light of this, and consistent with current investor sentiment the Committee will commit to review the ongoing financial impact of any prior year activities, and the role of individual executives in such activities, and may make appropriate adjustments to future individual bonus awards to reflect material new information or circumstances that might later have emerged from or about those activities.
Annual bonus schemes for divisional managing directors and certain senior Group executives will in future also provide for increased maximum bonus potential also with a requirement for deferral of 40% of any bonus earned into Babcock shares for two years.
For divisional Managing Directors the schemes for 2009 10 will include performance measures dependent on growth in divisional profits and or achievement of budgeted divisional profits and cash flow according to the objectives for the division concerned and will have non-financial metrics forming a significant part 20% of the bonus opportunity.
The Committee has discretion to reduce or extinguish bonuses in light of health, safety or environmental performance.
Annual bonuses are not pensionable.
Long-term incentives Since 2003, qualifying Directors and certain senior Group employees have been granted performance-related long-term incentives in the form of annual awards of nil-price options under the Babcock 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan L-TIP.
Before 2003 they were granted performance-related market-priced share options under the Babcock 1999 Approved and Unapproved Executive Share Option Schemes.
Following the 2008 09 remuneration review, the Committee is proposing, subject to shareholder approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting in July, to make share-based long-term incentive awards from 2009 onwards under a new Babcock Performance Share Plan 2009 PSP see further below.
It is the intention of the Company that shares needed to satisfy executive options for Directors and awards under the L-TIP and PSP will be purchased in the market to the extent not already held in the Groups employee share trusts at the date the options or awards are granted or are exercised, unless it is in the interests of the Company to do otherwise.
PSP awards may be granted in the form of nil-cost options.
PSP Awards may also be combined with an award of HMRC approved options under the proposed Company Share Option Plan CSOP see page 37 above, in which case the PSP award would be adjusted to take account of the CSOP award: it is not intended that Executive Directors will receive CSOP options this year, but may do so in future years.
Details of options and L-TIP Awards already held by Directors are set out on pages 56 and 57.
During the financial year to 31 March 2009, L-TIP awards were made to each of Mr Rogers and Mr Tame over shares having a market value on award of 100% of their qualifying basic salaries.
Awards were also made to a small number of other senior managers.
The vesting of the L-TIP awards depends on company performance.
Half of each award vests according to comparative Total Shareholder Return performance against a comparator group selected by the Committee and half on earnings per share EPS growth.
The performance criteria are set out in more detail on page 58.
For certain divisional senior managers, but not the Companys Directors, there has been a cash-based long-term incentive scheme focused on divisional performance and with particular features to aid retention.
The performance targets under that scheme were set by reference to divisional profit targets and return on capital employed or operating cash flow, as appropriate to the divisions business.
A similar scheme is in place for senior Group employees but not the Companys Directors based on EPS growth over the performance period.
Target awards under these cash-based schemes varied between participants but did not normally exceed 100% of salary for on-target performance, with maximum payout for out-performance capped at 150% of salary.
Awards under the scheme are not pensionable.
It is proposed that from 2009 this scheme will be replaced with future awards being made in the form of share-based incentives under the proposed PSP.
Babcock International Group PLC 52 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Remuneration report continued Proposed PSP from 2009 A summary of the principal features of the proposed PSP can be found in Appendix 1 to the Notice of Annual General Meeting pages 115 to 118 in this document.
Under the PSP, the Committee proposes to increase the maximum annual long-term incentive award for Executive Directors and certain other senior executives to 150% of salary, but with full vesting accompanied by a commensurate increase in the stretch in EPS performance.
In exceptional circumstances for example, on the recruitment of a new senior executive, awards may be made up to 200% of salary, but the Committee currently has no intention to grant awards of more than 150% of salary.
The proposed performance metrics for 2009 PSP awards would be broadly the same as for recent awards under the L-TIP subject to the increase in EPS growth requirement for full vesting mentioned above, with half of each award vesting according to comparative TSR performance and half according to EPS growth.
The Committee also proposes that the peer group for TSR comparison purposes for 2009 awards be the broader FTSE 350 group excluding financial services companies and investment trusts and to calibrate performance on a percentage out-performance basis rather than on a ranking basis.
Further, in the proposed targets for 2009 PSP awards, the Committee is proposing to reduce the percentage vesting at threshold for both the EPS and TSR elements from 25% to 16.7% so that the same percentage of salary is paid for achieving threshold performance as would be payable for existing L-TIP awards.
The increase in opportunity will be fully realised only for achievement of stretch performance, for which the Committee proposes to increase the EPS target.
The detailed proposed performance criteria for 2009 are set out on page 58.
For certain senior Group managers and divisional senior managers, it is proposed, as mentioned above, that the cash-based awards under the long-term incentive schemes for them will be replaced in the future by share-based awards under the PSP.
For divisional managers vesting would normally be determined according to divisional performance targets.
For senior Group managers the performance targets would be as for PSP awards made to Executive Directors or other targets appropriate to them.
Performance graph The graphs below were prepared by Kepler Associates.
They show the total shareholder return for a holding in the Companys shares for the period from 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2009 relative to a holding of shares representing respectively the FTSE All-Share Index excluding investment trusts and the FTSE 350 Support Services Sector.
The calculation of the return assumes dividends are reinvested to purchase additional equity.
This FTSE All-Share Index excluding investment trusts is the same index as has been used for this purpose in earlier Remuneration reports, as it is a broad index that allows comparison of the Companys performance against the performance of the stock market as a whole.
Support Services is the sector in which the Companys share price is reported.
Over the five-year period, the Company has substantially out-performed both indexes.
An investment of 100 in the Company on 1 April 2004 would have been worth assuming the dividends were reinvested in further Company shares 417 at 31 March 2009.

Mr Turners remuneration includes fees at the rate of 35,000 per annum from 1 June to 31 October 2008 and thereafter at the rate of 250,000.
The comparative remunerations for Mr Rogers and Mr Tame for the year to 31 March 2008 include part paid at the rate before the in-year remuneration reviews referred to in last years remuneration report and also for Mr Rogers an amount in lieu of pensions that predated the increase, in October 2007, of the pension supplement referred to under Directors pensions below.
That remuneration review resulted in an increase in basic salary of 6% with effect from 1 October 2007 for Mr Rogers and 7% with effect from 25 June 2007 for Mr Tame.
In addition, in the year to 31 March 2008, Mr Tames bonus was 80% as compared to 100% for the year to 31 March 2009.

For Mr Tame, the payment includes 25,000 in lieu of pension benefits on that part of his basic salary as exceeds the earnings cap for the pension scheme see detailed explanation under Directors pensions below and 11,000 in respect of expenses connected with accommodation.
For Mr Tame, benefits comprised medical insurance, home to work travel expenses and accommodation benefits.
For Mr Rogers, they comprised medical insurance.
For Sir Nigel Essenhigh, they comprised home to work travel expenses.
The fees for Lord Hesketh reflected his additional duties as Deputy Chairman.
Mr Rennocks and Mr Shahs fees reflected their additional duties as Chairmen of, respectively, the Audit and Risk Committee and the Remuneration Committee.
Bonus payments and benefits in kind paid to Directors are not pensionable.
Babcock International Group PLC 54 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Remuneration report continued Directors pensions audited Of the Directors, only Mr Tame currently participates in a Group pension scheme.
He receives a salary supplement for his earnings in excess of the scheme earnings cap see the table below.
Mr Rogers receives a supplement in lieu of any pension benefits, which is not taken into account for the purpose of bonus or share awards.
It is separately identified in the table on page 53 under Cash allowances.
In the year to 31 March 2008 a first step was made towards bringing the supplement up to a level closer to market practice for equivalent executives by increasing it from 8% to 14% of salary but which still left it significantly below market levels.
As part of its 2008 09 review of total remuneration, the Committee has completed the move and increased the supplement with effect from 1 April 2009 to 20% to bring it into line with market practice for senior executive directors.
The Companys policy is to remain competitive in the marketplace to attract and retain the calibre of employee it needs.
Subject to that, it is not the Companys policy to compensate Directors for changes to the taxation of pensions.
Babcock International Group Pension Scheme the Scheme Mr Tame is a member of the senior executive tier of the Babcock International Group Pension Scheme.
No other Directors are members of the Scheme or receive pension benefits from the Group.
The accrual rate for Mr Tame under the Scheme is one-thirtieth for each year of service, with pension being calculated on his base salary up to the Schemes earnings cap in the 12 months prior to retirement at age 60 or above.
Membership of the Scheme also entitles him to life assurance cover of four times base salary up to the earnings cap.
The earnings cap adopted by the Scheme is the same as the former statutory earnings cap, index-linked in the same way.
The Company takes out additional life assurance cover in respect of four times his salary in excess of the earnings cap.
Mr Tames pension entitlements under the Scheme defined benefit are set out in the following table: Increase in accrued Transfer benefits value of excluding Change in increase in Increase Accrued inflation accrued Transfer Transfer accrued in transfer pension at during the benefits after value at value at benefits less value less 31 March year ended allowing for 1 April 31 March Directors Directors 2009 31 March inflation 2008 2009 contributions contribution Director pa 2009 W Tame 28,578 4,926 3,743 405,486 467,680 43,665 56,314 1.
Inflation has been taken as 5% for the purposes of calculating increases in transfer values and pension earned.
The transfer value of the increase in pension accrued is calculated in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11, and is stated after deducting members contributions.
The figures in the above table make no allowance for the cost of death in service benefits under the Scheme.
The figures in the above table make no allowance for any benefits in respect of earnings in excess of the Inland Revenue earnings cap.
In calculating the above figures for Mr Tame no account has been taken of any retained benefits which he may have from previous employments.
No payments have been made to retired Directors in excess of the retirement benefit to which they were entitled on the date the benefits first became payable or, if later, 31 March 1997.
Other pension arrangements audited Before 1 April 2006, the Company provided a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme FURBS for Mr Tame in respect of his salary in excess of the earnings cap.
The Company contributed to the FURBS an amount equal to 20% of the excess including employers national insurance contributions, with Mr Tame making contributions into the Companys pension scheme on his full uncapped salary.
As from April 2006, this was replaced with a salary supplement of 15% of the excess including employers national insurance contributions, with Mr Tame contributing into the Companys pension scheme only on capped salary.
The value of this supplement in the year to 31 March 2009 was 25,000.

Directors interests in shares The table below shows the holdings of fully paid ordinary shares of 60p each of the Directors including family interests in the issued share capital of the Company.
The interests were beneficial interests.
Hitherto, the Board has encouraged Executive Directors to build and maintain, over time, a personal holding of shares equivalent in value to around a years basic pay.
Following implementation of the proposed changes to remuneration described elsewhere in this report, this will be increased to at least one and a half times salary.

The amount by which the market value of all shares acquired on exercise exceeded the aggregate exercise price.
Options vested according to comparative TSR performance over three-year performance periods.
They were not subject to re-testing.
The comparator group was the companies in the FTSE Engineering and Machinery Sector when the options were granted which was the sector in which the Companys shares were then listed.
There was no vesting unless the Company ranked above median performance, in which case 25% of the options vested.
Full vesting was for top quartile ranking with proportionate vesting on a straight-line basis for a ranking between those points.
The exercise price was set at the average of the mid-market closing price of the Companys shares for the three business days preceding the date of the grant.
This price was not discounted.
Directors must exercise vested options before the tenth anniversaries of the grant dates, or earlier if there is a change of control, they leave or die, failing which they will lapse.
There were no changes in the Directors share options between 31 March 2009 and 20 May 2009.

The performance conditions attached to the awards are described below.
All the L-TIP awards made to Directors to date have been made by the trustee of the Babcock Employee Share Trust as nil cost options.
The number of shares awarded had a value equal to the Directors qualifying annual salary at the date of the award using the average of the mid-market closing price of the Companys shares for the three business days preceding that date.
Subject to satisfaction of the performance criteria attached to LTIP awards see below, the Directors may call for the release to them of the award shares during the respective exercise periods.
Subject to the rules of the plan, an earlier release of shares under unvested awards may be allowed by the Remuneration Committee for example, in the event of a cessation of employment or a change in control, but unless the Committee otherwise decides of not more than a time-apportioned proportion and then only having regard to the Companys performance, though the Committee has discretion to allow a greater proportion to be released.
Performance measures attached to L-TIP awards and proposed PSP Performance under the L-TIP is and would under the PSP also be judged over the period of three financial years from the start of the financial year in which the award is made.
Performance is measured at the end of the period and is not re-tested.
Awards not vested as at 31 March 2009 20052008 awards For L-TIP awards made between 2005 and 2008, half of the shares vest based on comparative TSR performance and half according to growth in earnings per share EPS.
For the TSR element, a ranking immediately above median results in 25% of those shares vesting.
There is no vesting for ranking below that level.
A ranking in the upper quartile results in 100% vesting.
Rankings between these threshold levels result in proportionate vesting calculated on a straight-line basis between 25% and 100%.
The comparator group of listed companies for the 2005 and 2006 awards comprised AEA Technology, W. S. Atkins, Aggreko, Amec, Bodycote, Capita, Carillion, Cobham, Interserve, Laing John, Mitie, Mouchel-Parkman, PHS Group dropped in 2006, Rentokil Initial, Serco, VT Group and WSP Group.
The comparator group for the awards made in 2007 comprised AEA Technology, W. S. Atkins, Aggreko, Amec, Bodycote, Capita, Carillion, Cobham, Interserve, Mitie, Mouchel-Parkman, Rentokil Initial, Serco, VT Group, WSP Group, Weir Group, Ashtead Group, Alfred McAlpine and Davis Service Group.
For L-TIP awards made in 2008, the comparator group comprises the constituents of the FTSE 350 Support Services Index as at the date of grant this was a peer group in the same FTSE sector as the Company and was chosen pending the fuller review of longer term incentives described above.
The TSR calculation normally uses a 12-month average for share prices adjusted for dividends paid during the period.
The Company feels that this is the most appropriate period because a 12-month average ensures both that the short-term market volatility is excluded and that for each company a 12-month period will capture the impact of the announcement of results and payment of dividends.
A shorter period would not capture all these events and would not necessarily put all companies on an equal footing.
For the half of the 20052008 L-TIP awards where vesting depends on EPS growth, 25% of the shares vest if growth in EPS adjusted to exclude exceptional items and acquired intangible amortisation over the performance period is equivalent to a real i. e. growth in excess of the increase in the consumer prices index compound annual growth rate of 4%, with full vesting if this reaches 8%.
Vesting is on a straight-line basis for growth between those two points.
There is no vesting for compound annual earnings per share growth of below 4% real.
2009 awards subject to shareholder approval of the PSP For awards to be made in 2009 under the proposed PSP, it is proposed that half should vest according to comparative TSR performance the TSR element and half according to growth in earnings per share the EPS element.
The Committee considers the use of two measures, in these proportions, to be appropriate.
The TSR performance measure is dependent on the Companys relative long-term share price performance and so provides strong alignment with shareholders interests.
This is used in conjunction with EPS growth, which is the primary internal benchmark of financial performance and ties in with the Companys strategic goals.
For the TSR element, it is proposed that the TSR sector peer group would be the broader FTSE 350 excluding investment trusts and financial services due to the fact that Babcocks closest peers straddle multiple sectors, not just support services, and to make the calibration more robust.
The Company intends to use TSR percentage outperformance as a measure of performance rather than a ranking.
As with previous L-TIP awards, the TSR calculation would normally use a 12-month average for opening and closing share prices adjusted for dividends paid during the period.
For both the TSR and EPS elements, the Committee proposes to leave threshold vesting as a percentage of salary unchanged at what it was for the existing L-TIP Awards, i. e. 12.5% of salary for each element, which implies a reduced percentage of the award Governance 34 60 Babcock International Group PLC 59 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 vesting at threshold.
For TSR performance at median, 16.7% of the TSR element of the award would vest.
There would be no vesting for TSR performance below median.
Out-performance of the median by at least 9% p. a. would result in 100% vesting of the TSR element.
For out-performance of the median between 0% and 9% p. a. vesting would increase on a straight-line basis between 16.7% and 100%.
Participants will only be entitled to a vesting of shares under the TSR element if the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the recorded TSR is a genuine reflection of the underlying performance of the Company over the performance period.
For the other half of the 2009 PSP awards, the EPS element, 16.7% of this element would vest if earnings per share growth adjusted to exclude acquired intangible amortisation, but, unless the Committee decides otherwise, after inclusion of exceptional items over the performance period is equivalent to a real compound annual growth rate of 4%.
Real growth would be measured as growth in excess of the growth in the retail price index, rather than the consumer price index as used for previous L-TIP awards, thus bringing the Company in line with common practice.
The proposed real growth target required for full vesting will be increased from 8% as applied under the existing L-TIP Awards to 11% real growth p. a. Vesting would be on a straight-line basis for growth between those two points.
There would be no vesting for compound annual earnings per share growth of below 4% real.
The Remuneration Committee will have the discretion to review the performance conditions attached to future PSP awards prior to the start of each cycle to ensure they remain appropriate.
However, no material reduction in targets would be made without prior consultation with shareholders.
The charts below illustrate the proposed vesting schedules for each element of the proposed 2009 PSP award: It is also proposed that, in common with recent market practice, the share awards would carry the right to receive on vesting any dividends or, if the Committee so decides, a number of shares having a market value equivalent to the amount of the dividends when the dividend was paid that would have been paid in the period between grant and vesting, but only on the shares that actually vest.
Service contracts The following table summarises the key terms apart from as to remuneration, on which see above of the Directors service contracts or terms of appointment: Executive Directors Contractual Name Date of service contract Notice period retirement age P L Rogers 31 July 2003 amended by letters 12 months from Company, 65 Chief Executive dated 5 May 2004 6 months from Director and 3 April 2006 W Tame 1 October 2001 amended by 12 months from Company, 65 Finance Director letters dated 5 May 2004 6 months from Director and 3 April 2006 Babcock International Group PLC 60 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Remuneration report continued Mr G Campbell, former Chairman, who left the Board on 31 October 2008 also had a service agreement with the Company dated 31 July 2003 as amended by letters dated 5 May 2004 and 3 April 2006 which provided for termination by the Company on giving 12 months notice or by Mr Campbell by giving six months notice.
It also contained similar provisions relating to termination following a change of control as are described below for Mr Rogers and Mr Tame, though there was no right to any payment in lieu of bonus.
The agreement terminated on 31 October 2008 pursuant to a Compromise Agreement.
The Companys policy is that Executive Directors service contracts should be capable of being terminated by the Company on not more than 12 months notice.
If the Company terminates a Directors service contract other than following a change of control see below or by the exercise of the Companys option to pay salary in lieu of notice the Company will have regard to all the circumstances in determining the amount of compensation, if any, payable to him in connection with that termination.
The agreements for Mr Rogers and Mr Tame contain provisions relating to termination following a change of control.
Each contract provides that within 90 days of the occurrence of the change of control, Mr Rogers or Mr Tame as the case may be may terminate his employment forthwith.
If he exercises this right, he is entitled, for a 12-month period, to be paid on a monthly basis his basic salary plus 40% compared to a maximum entitlement under the annual bonus scheme of 150% in lieu of bonus and all other contractual entitlements.
From this there is to be deducted any amount that the Director receives by way of income, if it exceeds 10% of his Babcock salary, from other sources that he would not have been able to earn had he continued in employment with the Company.
If the Company terminates his appointment within 12 months of a change of control, he would be entitled to a termination payment equal to 100% of his annual salary plus 40% in lieu of bonus and all other benefits.

The expected time commitment of Non-Executive Directors is set out in their current written terms of appointment.
Outside directorships Before taking up any new outside appointment, an Executive Director must first seek the approval of the Chairman.
Any fees for outside appointments are retained by the Director.
