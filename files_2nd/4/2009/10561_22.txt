77 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Overview Annual Report 2009 Business review Governance Financial statements Remuneration report The Directors Remuneration report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee the Committee and has been approved by the Board.
Shareholders will be given the opportunity to approve the report at the Annual General Meeting on 23 April 2010.
The report has been drawn up in accordance with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 and the UK Listing Authority Listing Rules.
The Remuneration report is divided into two parts.
The first part contains commentary on remuneration policy, which is not required to be audited.
The second part contains the remuneration tables that have been audited in accordance with the relevant statutory requirements.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing Group policy on executive remuneration and for determining, on behalf of the Board, specific remuneration packages for the executive Directors and the Chairman.
The Committees terms of reference are available on our website.
During the year the members of the Committee were: Simon Heale, who is the Chairman of the Committee, Martin Flower, Tim Stevenson and Andrew Given.
Each of the non-executive Directors is regarded by the Board as independent.
Tim Stevenson was independent at the time of his appointment as Chairman of the Board.
The Committee met on seven occasions during the year.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
The Chief Executive Officer and the Director of Human Resources attend meetings of the Committee by invitation.
The Committee also had access to advice from the Chief Financial Officer.
No executive Director or other attendee is present when his or her own remuneration is under consideration.
Deloitte LLP was appointed by the Committee as its retained advisers in February 2007 and has provided advice on market practice and remuneration policy as well as Total Shareholder Return TSR analysis.
During the financial year, Deloitte LLP has also provided unrelated tax advice to the Company.
During the year, Imbucon provided TSR analysis relating to the Companys share plans.
Imbucon did not provide any other services to the Company.
Remuneration policy The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that remuneration packages offered are competitive and designed to attract, retain and motivate executive Directors and senior executives of the right calibre in order to run the Company successfully and to create value for shareholders.
The policy of the Committee is to ensure that a significant proportion of the total remuneration opportunity is performance-related and based on the achievement of measurable targets which are relevant to and support the business strategy.
This is in order to create a strong link between performance and reward which should be beneficial to shareholders, employees and the Company.
In assessing all aspects of pay and benefits, the Committee takes into account the packages offered by similar companies to ensure the remuneration packages for executive Directors are competitive against the market in which the Company competes for talent.
For the purposes of such analysis, comparator companies are chosen having regard to: the size of the company eg market capitalisation, turnover and number of people employed : the diversity and complexity of its businesses: and the geographical spread of its businesses.
The Committee also considers the level of pay throughout the Company when determining executive Directors remuneration.
The Committee believes that the current remuneration structures are appropriate and support the business strategy.
78 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Overview Annual Report 2009 Business review Governance Financial statements Remuneration report continued Main components of remuneration The table below summarises the Companys policies in respect of each of the key elements of executive Directors remuneration as they applied during the year.

79 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Overview Annual Report 2009 Business review Governance Financial statements Base salary The base salary for each executive Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the performance of the individual and having regard to practice in companies of comparable size and complexity in the FTSE 350.
Salaries are normally reviewed on an annual basis.
No increase to base salaries was made in 2009.
In line with the approach being taken across the organisation, executive Directors salaries will be increased in 2010.
In considering the level of increase, the Committee has been mindful of the general level of increase across the Company as well as the positioning of roles against the market.
The table below shows the salaries in 2009 and with effect from 1 January 2010.
Salary 2009 2010 Mark Robertshaw 440,000 450,000 Kevin Dangerfield 255,000 265,000 Base salary is the only element of the remuneration package that is pensionable.
Annual bonus The targets for the annual bonus are set by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the shortand long-term requirements of the Company.
Challenging goals are set, which must be met before any bonus is paid.
This approach is intended to align executive reward with shareholder return by rewarding the achievement of stretch targets.
The bonus scheme provides the opportunity for executive Directors to earn a bonus of up to 100% of basic salary if stretching performance targets are achieved.
For 2009, the bonus was based wholly on financial performance.
The targets for the awards were set to address the new demands placed on the business in the current economic climate and were based on underlying operating profit performance up to 60% of salary and cash conversion up to 40% of salary.
For 2010, the bonus will be based on profit before tax.
This incentivises the executive Directors to manage much more of the income statement to improve the earnings per share of the Group.
In addition to the achievement of the targets set, in considering any awards to be made the Committee also takes into account the quality of the overall performance of the Company.
The bonuses awarded to executive Directors in respect of 2009 were as follows: Mark Robertshaw 20% of salary 2008: 60%.
This award was made on the basis that in 2009 the underlying operating profit target was not achieved, but the cash conversion measure was partially satisfied, resulting in a bonus payment of 20% of salary.
Long-term incentive arrangements The Committee believes that share ownership by the executive Directors and senior executives helps align their interests with those of the shareholders.
Accordingly the Company operates a number of share schemes for the executive Directors and other senior employees, details of which are set out below.
Deferred Bonus Share Matching Plan In 2008 shareholder approval was gained for the introduction of a new long-term incentive plan, the Deferred Bonus Share Matching Plan.
This Plan now operates alongside the other long-term incentive arrangements.
To date, participants have been offered the opportunity to defer up to 50% of their annual bonus on a preor post-tax basis into Company shares.
Participants must hold the deferred shares for three years to be eligible for a matching award based on the pre-tax value of their deferred shares.
Matching shares may be earned at the end of three years in the event that stretching EPS targets have been met.
For the 2009 performance year, participants will be given the opportunity to defer up to 75% of their bonus under the Plan.
This is in order to provide participants with a meaningful opportunity to invest in Morgan Crucible shares.
This change is within the limits in the Plan rules approved by shareholders in 2008.
This approach will be reviewed for future award cycles.
80 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Overview Annual Report 2009 Business review Governance Financial statements Remuneration report continued As is set out in the table below, the targets for the 2010 matching awards will revert to referencing a growth above RPI as used in 2008.
EPS performance Matching shares RPI 15% pa 3x match RPI 10% pa 1.75x match RPI 7.5% pa 1x match RPI 5% pa 0.5x match RPI 4% pa 0.25x match RPI 4% pa 0x match There is straight-line vesting in between each point above.
The performance targets for awards made in 2009 did not reference growth above RPI.
Given the difficult economic climate at that time, the Committee considered the targets to be stretching.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP was approved at the 2004 Annual General Meeting and offers executive Directors and other senior executives the opportunity to receive shares as a reward for outstanding performance.
The scheme allows awards of up to 150% of basic salary, although in exceptional circumstances the Committee is able to make awards of up to 200% of basic salary.
The vesting of the awards is subject to the achievement of performance targets measured over the three-year period from the start of the year in which the award is made.
During the year, an award over 489,705 shares was made to Mark Robertshaw and an award over 283,806 shares was made to Kevin Dangerfield.
Due to the real economic uncertainty at the time the 2009 awards were made, the Remuneration Committee decided to recalibrate the focus of awards between internal financial targets and relative share price targets.
Consequently, awards made under the LTIP in 2009 were based wholly on the Companys TSR performance against the comparator group below.
If the Companys TSR places it at the median of the comparator group, 30% of the award will vest, with 100% of the awards vesting for performance at the upper quartile or above.
For performance between median and upper quartile, awards vest on a straight-line basis.
The Committee must also be satisfied that the Companys underlying financial performance justifies the level of vesting.
For 2010 awards, the Remuneration Committee believes it is appropriate to return to the previous split between TSR and EPS targets on the basis that the Company is now able to set robust three-year EPS targets which have a meaningful line of sight for participants.
The split between TSR and EPS targets provides the right balance between incentivising strong financial growth while taking into account the share price performance relative to peers.
Therefore, for awards to be made under the LTIP in 2010, 50% will be based on TSR against the comparator group ones leaf and 50% will be based on EPS growth above RPI.
Following a review during the year, the comparator group for the 2010 awards has been extended to include six new comparator companies.
This is to ensure that the comparator group is of a robust size and reflects the different markets in which Morgan Crucible operates.
The Committee must be satisfied that the Companys underlying financial performance justifies the level of vesting.
The awards made under the LTIP in 2007 and 2008 were based on the same measures and targets as will apply for the 2010 awards.
The vesting schedule for the 2010 awards is as follows: % of the award which vests % of the award TSR performance against which vests the sector comparator group EPS growth  performance 50% RPI 10% pa 50% Median-ranked performance 15% RPI 4% pa 15% Below-median-ranked performance 0% RPI 4% pa 0% Straight-line vesting applies between each point for both vesting schedules.
81 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Overview Annual Report 2009 Business review Governance Financial statements The TSR comparator group for the 20072010 awards is set out below: Bodycote Meggit Spectris Charter International Porvair Spirax-Sarco Chemring Group Qinetiq Tomkins Cobham Renishaw TT Electronics Cookson Group Ricardo Ultra Electronics Holdings Halma Rotork Umeco IMI Senior Weir Group Laird Group Smiths Group The original comparator group also included FKI and Foseco which have subsequently delisted.
Additional comparator companies for 2010 awards.
The details of awards held by all Directors are shown on page 84.
Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The ESOS was approved at the 2004 Annual General Meeting and offers executive Directors and other senior executives the opportunity to receive options granted at the market price of the Companys shares at the time of the grant.
There are two remaining awards to the executive Directors.
Mark Robertshaw has a vested option grant from 2004 that he has not exercised.
Kevin Dangerfield has an unvested option from 2001 that is subject to annual re-test for up to 10 years from the date of the grant see Directors share options table on page 83.
There is currently no intention to make awards under the ESOS in 2010.
Savings-related Share Option Scheme SAYE As UK employees, the executive Directors may also participate in the Savings-related Share Option Scheme on the same basis as other eligible employees and subject to UK legislation.
Scheme members save a fixed amount per month over three years and options have been granted with an exercise price at 80% of the market price at the date of grant.
Those Directors who received options under this scheme are shown in the table on page 85.
No performance conditions apply to these options as they are a tax-efficient mechanism for all employees to acquire shares in the Company at their own cost.
Other benefits Executive Directors are eligible to receive certain benefits including a car allowance, health insurance and, where appropriate, relocation and other expenses.
Shareholding guidelines In order to encourage alignment with shareholders, individual shareholding guidelines are operated for executive Directors and senior executives.
Under such guidelines, executive Directors are encouraged to build and maintain over time a shareholding in the Company equivalent to at least 100% of basic salary.
This policy is supported by the Deferred Bonus Share Matching Plan under which participants are encouraged to invest their bonus in Company shares.
Chairman and non-executive Directors Tim Stevenson was appointed as Chairman on 1 December 2006.
Since the date of his appointment his annual fee has been set at 125,000.
Non-executive Directors receive a basic annual fee of 40,000.
Additional payments of 4,500 per annum are made to the Senior Independent Director, 7,500 to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and 5,000 to the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
The Chairman and non-executive Directors are also entitled to reimbursement of expenses incurred in attending Board, strategy and other meetings.
No changes were made to non-executive fees during the year.
Annual fees paid to the Chairman and non-executive Directors are reviewed on a biennial basis.
A review was held in 2008 and, while no increases were recommended for the non-executive Directors, an increase for the Chairman was recommended.
At the request of the Chairman, the 2009 increase was deferred for 12 months.
Therefore, with effect from 1 January 2010 his annual fee will be increased to 140,000.
None of the non-executive Directors has a service contract with the Company although they do have letters of appointment which contain no obligations relating to any notice period.
There are no obligations on the Company to make any payments in lieu of notice to any non-executive Director.
The non-executive Directors do not participate in any of the incentive, share or share option plans.
Each of the non-executive Directors is subject to re-election by shareholders every third year after their initial confirmation by shareholders as a Director.
Should any non-executive Director serve for nine or more years they would be subject to annual re-election.
82 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Overview Annual Report 2009 Business review Governance Financial statements Remuneration report continued Service contracts Executive Directors are employed on contracts subject to 12 months notice at any time.
Contracts may be terminated on 12 months notice given by the Company or on six months notice given by the Director concerned.
Contracts end on each Directors anticipated normal retirement date.
The following table shows the date of the contract for each executive Director who served during the year.
Date of Date of Executive Director appointment service agreement Kevin Dangerfield 3 August 2006 15 August 2008 Mark Robertshaw 4 August 2006 15 August 2008 The service agreements for Mark Robertshaw and Kevin Dangerfield do not contain specific termination provisions.
In the event of early termination, the Company may be liable to pay an amount in damages having regard to salary, bonus and other benefits that would have been received had they served out their notice period.
The value of any termination payment made will be at the judgment of the Committee having regard to all relevant factors including ensuring that the full benefit of mitigation is obtained.
There is no automatic entitlement to bonus as part of the termination arrangements.
Company pensions policy The executive Directors participate in The Morgan Group Senior Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme which is a contributory, HMRC-registered, defined benefit, funded occupational pension scheme.
With effect from 6 April 2006 the basis of the scheme changed from final salary to career average and the normal pension age increased by five years.
The main features of the plan are: A normal pension age of 65.
Pension at normal pension age of two-thirds career average pensionable salary, subject to completion of 20 years employment 26 years and eight months for new members.
Life assurance of four times basic salary.
Pensionable salary is the members basic salary restricted to a scheme earnings cap of 123,600 for the 2009-10 tax year.
In addition, executive Directors received a pension allowance derived from employer contributions based notionally on the registered scheme pensionable salary in excess of the earnings cap.
The value of the pension allowance for each executive Director is set out in the Directors emoluments table on page 83.
External directorships With the approval of the Board in each case, and subject to the overriding requirements of the Company, executive Directors may accept external appointments as non-executive Directors of other companies and retain any fees received.
The total amount of fees received by Mark Robertshaw in respect of a non-executive Directorship was 35,000.
Performance graph The following graph shows the cumulative total shareholder return TSR for the Company for the five-year period to 4 January 2010 against the FTSE 350.
Both are rebased to 100 as at 5 January 2005.
The FTSE 350 is considered to be appropriate for comparison as it is a broad market index and the Company forms part of that index.

The award is structured as a market value option over 1,000,000 shares subject to the performance conditions that apply to awards under the Executive Share Option Scheme.
The performance measure for the Executive Share Option Scheme awards above was based on the Companys Total Shareholder Return performance against the FTSE 350.
Thirty per cent of the awards vest for achieved median-ranked performance with full vesting for  performance.
For performance between median and upper quartile, awards vest on a straight-line pro-rata basis.
The performance condition for the awards granted in 2006 was not met and these awards have therefore lapsed in full.
The share price at the year end was 157.7 pence and the high and low during the year were 192.3 pence and 70.3 pence respectively.

Investment shares represent those shares acquired with a portion of the bonus set out in the emoluments table on page 83 voluntarily deferred into the Bonus Deferral Share Matching Plan.
T his is the maximum number of shares based on the pre-tax value of the deferred shares that could be earned at the end of the performance period if the performance condition set out on page 79 is met in full.
In 2008 the executive Directors deferred their bonus payment on a gross basis and in 2009 deferral was on a net basis.
The flexibility to defer on either basis is within the Plan rules.
Note: Prior to 6 April 2010, the Committee is intending to amend the terms of the Investment shares in order to allow individuals to crystallise the tax due on their earned deferred bonus awards.
The net value of these awards will continue to be held until the normal vesting date.
No amendment will be made to the terms of the matching shares.

The accrued benefit entitlement for Mark Robertshaw and Kevin Dangerfield is the pension which would be paid annually on retirement based on service at the end of the year.
The transfer values for the pension benefits have been calculated on the basis set by the Trustee of the pension scheme.
The Trustee of the pension scheme is an independent body that is separate from the Company and they must calculate transfer values in accordance with legislation having taken actuarial advice from an independent adviser.
The assumptions used in the calculation of the transfer values depend on market conditions.
Over the year corporate bond yields fell and inflation expectations, as implied by government bond yields, rose.
Both movements increase the assessed transfer values.
The method for setting the assumptions used was also updated by the Trustee during the year on the advice of the actuary, following the introduction of new legislation.
This too increased transfer values.
These two factors were much more significant than the increase in accrued benefits over the year.
Members of the pension scheme had the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions.
Neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.
Mark Robertshaw and Kevin Dangerfield also received a pension allowance, details of which are set out in the Directors emoluments table on page 83.
