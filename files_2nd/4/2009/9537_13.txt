Remuneration Committee Role of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is a formal committee of the Board and has powers delegated to it under the Articles of Association.
Its remit is set out in terms of reference formally adopted by the Board which were last reviewed in November 2005.
A copy of the terms of reference is available on the Companys website.
The Committees main responsibilities are to: Make recommendations to the Board on the Companys executive remuneration policy: Determine individual remuneration packages within that policy for the executive Directors and certain senior executives: Oversee the operation of the Companys incentive schemes: Review Directors expenses: and Oversee the Companys executive pension arrangements, all of which it carries out on behalf of the Board.
The Committee is authorised to seek information from any Director or employee of the Group and co-opt any resources including external professional assistance it sees fit in order to fulfil its duties.
Minutes of Committee meetings are circulated to all Directors and supplemented by a verbal update from the Committee Chairman at the next Board meeting, identifying any material matters which arose from the Committees work.
The Committee presents a summary of its activities to shareholders and other interested parties by means of this report and the Committee Chairman attends the Annual General Meeting to answer any questions on the Committees activities.
Composition of the Remuneration Committee All independent Directors, with the exception of the Chairman of the Board, are eligible to become members of the Committee.
The Board is empowered to appoint or remove members.
Any two members of the Committee form a quorum.
The Committee comprised the following independent Directors during the year and to the date of this report: Member From To Roger Phillimore Chairman to 6 March 2009 20 September 2002 31 March 2009 Peter Godsoe 20 September 2002 To date Jonathan Leslie 2 July 2009 To date Michael Hartnall 8 May 2003 To date David Munro 21 September 2007 6 March 2009 Jim Sutcliffe Chairman from 6 March 2009 28 January 2009 To date Given their diverse backgrounds and experience, the Board believes that the Committee members are able to offer a balanced view on executive remuneration issues.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
Meetings of the Committee are attended by the Chief Executive, the HR Director and the Company Secretary, none of whom do so as of right and who do not attend when their own remuneration is being discussed.
Advisors to the Remuneration Committee Throughout the year, the Committee was assisted in its work by the London office of  LLP, an independent firm of remuneration consultants who were appointed by, and report to, the Committee but who also supported management in developing and implementing remuneration proposals, and in providing IFRS2 valuations for the Company.
During the year the South African practice of  was engaged by the Company to provide specialist support to the internal audit function.
The Committee is confident that this does not generate a conflict of interest for either party and that the sums payable in respect of each service would not compromise the objectiveness and impartiality of the other.
In making its decisions, the Committee consults with the Chief Executive and HR Director in relation to remuneration of executive Directors and senior executives.
In addition, the following advisors have been retained on behalf of the Company, and provide information to the Committee on relevant matters being considered by the Committee: Herbert Smith LLP legal services in respect of employment law and company share schemes.

Relations with shareholders The Committee is strongly committed to open and transparent dialogue with shareholders on remuneration matters.
The Committee consults extensively with key institutional investors and various representative bodies to obtain their views on, and support for, proposed changes to the remuneration packages of the Directors and senior executives.
During August 2009 a number of meetings were held with key institutional shareholders and with a representative body, the Association of British Insurers.
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and the Companys HR Director attended these meetings at which the Companys remuneration policy was outlined.
Feedback from these meetings was provided to the Committee and will be factored into the Committees future deliberations.
REMUNERATION POLICY AND PRACTICE Non-executive Directors The Board, with the benefit of independent professional advice, determines the fees of the Non-executive Directors.
When deciding an appropriate level of fee for the responsibilities taken on by the Non-executive Directors, the Board considers the responsibility and time commitment required to fulfil the role, taking into account the number of meetings required to be attended, the time required for reading Board and other papers, the duties associated with membership or chairmanship of Board Committees or in the case of Roger Phillimore chairmanship of the Board, and the overseas travel required of all Non-executive Directors by the Company.
Executive Directors and senior executives The Committees remuneration policy is geared towards providing a level of remuneration which attracts, retains and motivates Directors and senior executives of a suitable calibre to execute the Companys strategic plans but, at the same time, ensures remuneration is consistent with best practice and aligned with the interests of the Companys shareholders.
Importantly, no Director plays any part in setting his own remuneration.
In setting remuneration within this framework, the Committee seeks to give the individuals every encouragement to enhance the Companys performance whilst ensuring that they are fairly, but responsibly, rewarded for their personal contributions.
It also takes into account levels of pay and rates of annual increase elsewhere in the Group.
The Committees strategy is a carefully balanced blend of fixed and performance-related pay geared to deliver over the short, medium and long-term.
The Committee also has regard to the significant level of competition for experienced, talented managers in the mining industry, both globally and specifically within South Africa, and the need to ensure that the Company maintains an adequate retention hold over its key executives.

In order to ensure that there was no change in the overall incentive opportunity, executives were not eligible to earn matching awards on their deferred bonus.
EBIT targets have been replaced by absolute share price targets in view of the desire to focus on a clear measure of absolute shareholder value and given the uncertainties around future EBIT as a result of the current economic climate.
The face value of LTIP awards for executive Directors were unchanged: however an additional performance condition was applied to the final 25% of the award.
Planned future policy changes The Company does not anticipate any changes to the structure of executive Directors and senior executives remuneration packages in 2010.
In order to support a continuing focus on crucial short-term operating imperatives, the same annual bonus opportunity will apply as for 2009, coupled with the same 50% compulsory deferral into shares.
Executives will not be eligible to earn any matching shares on their deferred bonus, in order to ensure that there is no increase in the overall incentive opportunity.
The LTIP policy will be unchanged.
com 75 Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2009 Remuneration Committee continued Benchmarking methodology The Committee routinely analyses remuneration practices in two groups of comparable companies, the first being UK listed businesses of comparable size and scope to Lonmin, the second where appropriate to the role being assessed being direct international peers in the mining sector with whom the Company is in direct competition in the recruitment of experienced executive talent.
The aim of the Remuneration Committee is to ensure that our remuneration framework is competitive with the latter without being out of step with the former.
In this way, the Committee aims to avoid generating excessive reward for Lonmins Directors and senior executives whilst ensuring that the Companys reward structures are capable of reaching top quartile levels, where justified by performance.
Full details of each element of the Directors remuneration packages are set out on page 77 together with an analysis on page 78 showing the various elements of remuneration as a percentage of base salary.
Performance graphs The primary role of the Directors is to deliver value to shareholders and it is against this backdrop that their remuneration must be assessed.
The graphs below show the value, at 30 September 2009, of 100 invested in Lonmins shares five years previously, compared with the current value of the same amount invested at the same date in the FTSE 100 index, the FTSE All Share index and the FTSE Mining Sector, assuming dividends are reinvested in each case.
The Company is a constituent of all these indices and the Board believes that these comparisons most fairly illustrate the Companys performance in delivering value to shareholders relative to both the market as a whole and its UK listed peers.

In addition, the executive Directors received long-term share incentives as detailed elsewhere in this report.
A reconciliation of total remuneration for each executive Director serving at the end of the year is shown in the charts on the following page.
2 Benefits in kind comprise cars, fuel, healthcare and medical.
The costs of life assurance and income continuance insurance are not reflected as the Company is the named beneficiary of these policies, and they do not form part of the taxable pay of the Director concerned.
3 The figures disclosed relate to cash payments made in lieu of participation in the Companys pension arrangements.
4 50% of the net bonus is subject to compulsory deferral into shares and the executive Directors have voluntarily decided to defer a further 25% into shares.
5 Brad Mills employment was terminated on 7 October 2008.
In accordance with his service agreement, he received a payment of 1,365,491.
He also received a further payment of 386,880 in respect of bonus for the year ended 30 September 2008 which was reported in last years table of Directors remuneration.
Full details are disclosed on page 89.
6 Other comprises gross proceeds following vesting of share awards and options and also dividend equivalents.
7 The Directors total emoluments for the year do not include any fair value share option award charges.
8 Although the Groups reporting currency is US Dollars, these figures are stated in Sterling as the Directors emoluments are paid in this currency.
9 No Director received any expense allowances during the year.
Non-executive Directors fees The fees payable to the Non-executive Directors are set by the Board and are designed to ensure the Company attracts and retains individuals of the highest calibre and is in line with recognised best practice.
The Board commissions an independent review of Non-executive Directors fees every two years, the most recent of which was conducted in June 2009.
Following the 2009 review, no change was made to the Non-executive Directors base fees or the committee chairmanship and membership fees.
However, with effect from 1 July 2009, the Chairmanship Fee was increased to 200,000 per annum and a fee was introduced for the Senior Independent Director of 15,000 per annum.
com 77 Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2009 Make up of executive Directors remuneration The remuneration attributable to each of the two executive Directors serving at the year end in respect of the year was comprised of the following broad elements: Ian Farmer Alan Ferguson 9% 8% 1% 1% 23% 24% 28% 32% 34% 40% Base salary 487,600 Base salary 551,538 Annual bonus 759,981 Annual bonus 673,757 Long-term incentive plan 737,480 Long-term incentive plan 399,298 Pension 198,900 Pension 146,280 Benefits-in-kind 29,372 Benefits-in-kind 17,356 Notes to the charts 1.
Benefits in kind are stated at their taxable value or the cost incurred by the Company where not taxable.
2 The cash bonus amount is the pre-tax amount payable in respect of the year and is stated before deferral.
3 The LTIP is stated at fair value in a manner consistent with IFRS.
However, if the threshold conditions noted elsewhere in this report are not obtained, no payment will be made.
4 Pension is cash amounts paid to the executive.
Fixed pay for executive Directors and senior executives Base salary Whilst the Remuneration Committee tends to have regard to total compensation, including performance-related elements, individuals inevitably focus on headline base salary, especially at the point of recruitment, as this forms the major part of the guaranteed reward.
For this reason, the Company needs to offer salaries at around median market levels so that it is able to attract and retain suitable directors and executives but without paying more than is necessary.
Salaries are reviewed once annually, as at 1 October, taking into account annual performance review data.
Following his appointment as CEO, Ian Farmers salary was increased by 57% with effect from 28 September 2008.
Alan Fergusons salary was increased by 6% at 1 October 2008.
The salaries of senior executives and individuals in the United Kingdom increased by 5%.
The salaries of our general workforce in South Africa increased by 12.5% compared to inflation of 13.8%.
Senior executives and managers based in South Africa are offered a wage equating to the market norm of total cost to company TCTC, with all benefits in kind converted into a cash allowance within this structure.
Participation in short and longterm incentive schemes is in addition to TCTC.
Not including the executive Directors, at the end of 2009 the remuneration of 14 other senior executives, the majority of whom are employed in South Africa, fall within the purview of the Remuneration Committee compared to 26 executives at the end of 2008.
This reduction in numbers is as a result of the restructuring programme undertaken during 2009.
The base salaries of those individuals based in the United Kingdom and the TCTC remuneration of individuals employed in South Africa fall within the following bands: Salary band 000 Number of executives 100 to 150 3 150 to 200 3 200 to 250 6 250 to 300 1 300 to 350 1 These executives also participate in the same long-term and short-term incentive arrangements as the executive Directors although with lower grant levels.
Benefits in kind Benefits in kind for the executive Directors variously comprise the provision of a fully-expensed car, or cash car allowance, the provision of annual health checks and private medical insurance for the individual and his dependants.
Executive Directors and senior executives are provided with life assurance and access to a limited amount of independent financial planning and tax advice.
Finally, the Company purchases income continuance insurance in respect of all employees in the London office, including the UKbased executive Directors.
78 Directors Report Business Review Directors Report Governance Financial Statements Operating Statistics Shareholder Information 2009 Annual Report and Accounts Lonmin Plc Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2009 Pensions Pensions in context of total compensation The Committee wishes to provide executives with access to market-competitive pension provision, without exposing the Company to the potentially open-ended obligations associated with defined benefit pension provision.
The UK final salary pension plan, the Lonmin Superannuation Scheme the Scheme was closed to new entrants in April 2006 and for the future accrual of benefits in July 2007.
The Scheme commenced an orderly winding-up process in 2008, which is effectively complete.
It is expected that the trust which constituted the Scheme will be dissolved before the end of calendar year 2009.
Following the closure of the Scheme, UK-based executives have been provided with a pension supplement, expressed as a percentage of their base salary, which may be paid at the executives choice as a pension contribution or an additional taxable cash payment.
Ian Farmer and Alan Ferguson have elected for their entitlements of 30% of base salary to be paid in cash.
All employees with a final salary link in force at the date of closure of the Scheme have been provided with a salary supplement for five years from that date, in partial compensation for the loss of the link to future salary growth for their accrued benefits.
Ian Farmer benefits from this provision and currently receives a non-pensionable and non-bonusable salary supplement of 33,900 per annum.
The contractual lump sum death in service cover has been increased from four times salary to eight times salary for this group, to reflect the loss of value associated with the removal of the previous spouses pension, and income continuance insurance was extended to all employees in recognition of the withdrawal of the facility to claim an ill-health early retirement pension.
Defined contribution arrangements The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme, the Lonmin Retirement Plan, for the benefit of all its UK employees.
This is a registered arrangement structured as a group personal pension scheme.
The two executive Directors are not members of this scheme.
In South Africa the employing companies in the Group participate in an industry-wide defined contribution pension plan.
Pensions generally No element of any Directors remuneration other than base salary is pensionable.
Except as disclosed above, the Company has given no undertakings to arrange or bear the cost of any other pension benefits for any Director.
No former Director enjoys pension benefits in excess of those provided, in accordance with the provisions of the trust deeds and rules, to all members of the relevant scheme.
Life assurance From 1 July 2007, as a former member of the UK defined benefit pension scheme, Ian Farmer has been provided with life assurance benefits of eight times salary, as noted above, as a contractual benefit.
Alan Ferguson is entitled to life assurance benefits of four times annual salary under his contract of employment.
The Company has secured all of these benefits through life assurance policies written as excepted life arrangements.
Performance-related pay for executive Directors and senior executives Short-term incentive arrangements The Committee believes that participation in a short-term incentive scheme enhances the focus of the executive Directors and key senior executives by providing a meaningful incentive to outperform and ensures that the management team is appropriately focused on business-critical outcomes.
The Company provides the opportunity to earn an annual cash bonus through a balanced scorecard approach, assessing performance under three broad headings, being as follows the weighting generally attaching to each component is quoted as a percentage of overall bonus opportunity : % of bonus opportunity on Actual payment for the offer for target performance year % of bonus opportunity SHEC 20% Safety: improvement in lost time injury frequency rate 10.0% 0.00% Community: improvement on Social & Labour Plan targets 10.0% 10.00% Production and Growth 60% Platinum sales: 6 mth Pt oz target 10.0% 20.00% Platinum sales: 12 mth Pt oz target 12.5% 0.00% Capital development index 5.0% 8.24% Gross operating costs 10.0% 17.00% 1 Operating unit costs 12.5% 0.00% Metal in Progress inventory management 10.0% 10.00% 2 Personal objectives 20% 20.0% 17.50% Total 82.74% 1 Due to focus on cost savings in the year, the executive Directors had a one-off potential opportunity to double % in respect of Operating unit costs metric.
2 Average for Ian Farmer and Alan Ferguson.
com 79 Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2009 Performance-related pay for executive Directors and senior executives continued Short-term incentive arrangements continued As explained earlier in this report, the Companys remuneration policy is designed to provide a robust link between reward and performance.
This is clearly demonstrated by the corporate balanced scorecard result of 65.24%.
The bonus elements and relative weightings detailed above were selected as these best captured the steps needing to be taken to improve the delivery of value to shareholders and all were capable of objective measurement and independent verification.
The Directors and senior executives also had the opportunity to earn bonus from achievement of personal objectives comprising 20% of the total bonus opportunity.
The average total bonus pay-out for Ian Farmer and Alan Ferguson was 82.74% of target.
For each individual element, three levels of attainment are set.
For 2009 these were: Threshold: the minimum level of attainment for which the Committee felt payment could be warranted, with generally 50% of the target amount for that element being payable.
Target: normally based on the Companys budget, at which 100% of the bonus for that element becomes payable.
Stretch: representing a significant level of outperformance and also acting as a cap on the bonus due for that element, with 200% of the target amount for that element being payable.
This was a one-off widening of the range applied to each element in previous years, which was 75% threshold, 100% target and 150% stretch and was approved by the Committee in the light of the significant operational challenges facing the company in a difficult trading environment.
Although stretch for each element was 200%, the total overall bonus payable was capped at 150% of target.
The scheme design provides for payment for the year ending 30 September 2009 of 167% of base salary to executive Directors for overall performance at the target level with the maximum stretch bonus therefore being capped at 250% of base salary.
All results have been independently reviewed including, where appropriate, scrutiny by the external auditors and the Committee has subjected the scorecard to a detailed assessment before authorising payment.
At the beginning of the financial year, it was agreed that of the resulting net bonus 50% would be settled in cash and 50% would be deferred in to shares.
Both executive Directors have however voluntarily decided to defer a further 25% of their net bonus.
Therefore, of the actual resulting net bonus 25% is being settled in cash and 75% is being deferred in to shares for three years.
Of necessity, the design of bonus plans will evolve from year to year, in line with the Companys strategic needs.
The Committee monitors the competitive environment and will devise amended or new plans in future years to ensure that the Company can continue to recruit, retain and motivate the most able senior executives, and that they are given the clearest possible incentive to deliver exceptional value to shareholders.
After consideration, the Committee have decided that the same approach should operate for 2010 except that the range between threshold and stretch for each element will revert to 75% to 150%.
Deferred Annual Bonus Plan DABP In 2008 and earlier years, executive Directors were offered the opportunity to participate in the DABP, pursuant to which a minimum of one-third of the net cash bonus due to each executive was invested in the DABP, with the ability to elect to invest any greater amount up to the whole of their net bonus.
The funds invested were used to buy Lonmin shares in the open market via the Companys employee benefit trust.
At the date the shares are purchased, the trustees make a Matched Award to the executive which, subject to the attainment of performance conditions, could enable matching of the number of shares bought by the executive of up to one for one for 2007, two for one, on an after tax basis.
The two performance conditions are RTSR and Earnings before Interest and Tax EBIT for awards up to 2007 and are RTSR and absolute share price for 2008.
These measures were chosen because the Committee felt they best reflected both the key imperatives on management at the relevant time and also provided an equal focus on the delivery of value to shareholders over the longer term.
Further discussion of how the Committee implements the EBIT performance condition is given on page 84.

Where there is a mandatory bonus deferral, such an amount is forfeitable should the executive leave during the three year performance period, other than for good leaver reasons.
In return, the Matched Award is made on the basis of two shares for each Invested Share acquired.
Half of the shares subject to the Matched Award will normally vest at the end of the performance period, subject to the employee remaining with the Group and to the extent that the related Invested Shares are retained.
One quarter of the shares subject to a Matched Award will vest subject also to satisfaction of a Relative TSR performance condition and a further quarter subject to an EBIT target.
The employee will also be able to apply the remainder of their bonus to acquire Invested Shares without risk of forfeiture that will be matched on a 1:1 basis, subject to satisfaction of the same RTSR and EBIT performance conditions.
For bonuses in 2008, the Remuneration Committee determined that the DABP would be operated based solely on a voluntary deferral on the terms set out above, save that the Committee determined that an absolute share price target would be substituted for the EBIT target.
As reported above, the matching element of the Plan is not being used for bonuses in respect of the year ending 2009.
The Committee does not disclose the EBIT or share price targets, where applicable, for reasons of commercial sensitivity and because of regulatory constraints but will do so retrospectively at the conclusion of the relevant performance period.
It believes the profit growth targets and the new share price target to be stretching, yet realistic.
On 2 December 2008, awards were made under this Plan to the executive Directors and to a number of senior executives.
The mid-market closing share price on that date was 647p.
Details of the awards are included in the table of Directors interests.
On 17 December 2008, 50% of the Matched Awards granted on 15 December 2005 vested being the half of the award subject to the EBIT test.
The outcome of the EBIT half was linked to the underlying audited EBIT for the year ended 30 September 2008 of $963m.
Based on this EBIT, growth in EBIT relative to 2005 was above the 60% level required at stretch resulting in 100% vesting for this part of the award.
For the RTSR half of the award, Lonmin finished below threshold and therefore 0% of that half of the award vested.
com 81 Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2009 Performance-related pay for executive Directors and senior executives continued Co-Investment Plan CIP The CIP was adopted by shareholders at the 2007 AGM.
In summary, this plan permits the Committee to invite selected executives to invest in Lonmin shares in return for the grant of a Matched Award over twice the number of Invested Shares.
There has only ever been one participant, Brad Mills, who made an investment of 2.5m in May 2007.
The Matched Award vested in part in October 2008 within the overall settlement made on termination of his employment, as detailed in the table of directors share interests on page 87.
It is not currently felt appropriate to operate the CIP in respect of any other executives, but the plan may be re-activated should the Committee judge this to be appropriate.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP is designed to ensure that the Company can offer long-term incentives to executive Directors and senior executives.
The Committee believes that it is vital to be able to offer such incentives to ensure that those best placed to deliver value for shareholders have a direct personal interest in so doing.
The annual granting of LTIP awards is intended to provide participants with the opportunity to earn sufficient reward, by delivering value to shareholders, such that they are motivated to stay in the Groups employment.
An award under this Plan entitles the recipient to receive shares at no cost, subject to attainment of stretching performance conditions which are detailed further below.
The two performance conditions are RTSR and Earnings before Interest and Tax EBIT for awards up to 2008 and are RTSR and absolute share price for 2009.
The Committee believes that the two components of the performance condition provide an appropriate incentive to focus on the short and longer term drivers of shareholder value.
As with the DABP the Committee feels unable to publish the EBIT or share price targets, however, it is satisfied that they should prove stretching, yet realistic, and there will be full retrospective disclosure.
The performance conditions are summarised below: % of Basis of component of Year of award performance conditions Performance conditions Performance award released 2006 50% RTSR TSR relative to a group of Threshold median 35% 20 comparator companies Target 75th percentile 60% Stretch 90th percentile 100% 50% EBIT EBIT: audited profit for FY2008 Threshold 35% Target 63% Stretch 100% 2007 50% RTSR TSR relative to a group of Threshold median 20% 20 comparator companies Target 75th percentile 70% Stretch 90th percentile 100% 50% EBIT EBIT: audited profit for FY2009 Threshold 20% Target 60% Stretch 100% 2008 50% RTSR TSR relative to a group of Threshold median 20% 20 comparator companies Target 75th percentile 70% Stretch 90th percentile 100% 50% EBIT EBIT: audited profit for FY2010 Threshold 0% Stretch 100% 2009 50% RTSR TSR relative to a group of Threshold median 20% 20 comparator companies Target 75th percentile 70% Stretch 90th percentile 100% 50% Share Price Lonmin Plc share price on Threshold 20% London Stock Exchange Stretch 100% For 2009, awards were made to the executive Directors and a number of senior executives on 14 September 2009 when the closing mid-market share price was 1732p.
The Committee determined that the face value of the Awards made to each of the executive Directors should be maintained, to provide the maximum possible incentive to deliver the Companys performance improvement.
However, the final 25% of base salary the Incentive Award should only be payable if the price of Lonmin shares exceed the stretch level applicable to the Base Award.
The award made to Ian Farmer was equivalent to 150% of base salary 125% Base Award and 25% Incentive Award and Alan Ferguson received an award equivalent to 100% of base salary 75% Base Award and 25% Incentive Award.
The Base Award is subject to the performance conditions as described in the table above.
The Incentive Award is subject only to absolute share price targets which are more stretching than those applied to the Base Award.
Whilst the awards to executive Directors are 100% subject to performance conditions, the awards made in 2009 below board only were 50% subject to performance conditions and 50% subject to continued employment on the third anniversary of the date of grant in line with common market practice in South Africa.

The same performance targets apply to this award as for the 2008 DABS.
An award was also made to one senior executive on 28 September 2009.
The closing mid-market share price on this date was 1703p.
On 18 November 2008, awards made under the LTIP on 30 September 2005 vested.
Lonmin finished 8th in the comparator group of 16 companies and therefore 38% of the award vested.
On 18 August 2009, awards made under the LTIP on 17 August 2006 vested.
For the EBIT half of the award, 61% vested.
The outcome of the EBIT half of the award was linked to the underlying audited EBIT for the year ended 30 September 2008 of $963m and share of joint venture profits of $18m.
The vesting scale required a threshold of $775m at which 35% would vest, target of $1,000m at which 63% would vest and stretch of $1,250m at which 100% would vest with straight-line interpolation between these points.
Brokers EBIT forecasts at the time the performance targets were set ranged from $695m to $1,490m with an average consensus of $980m.
Stay & Prosper Plan The Committee regularly reviews the incentive arrangements offered to managers, particularly in South Africa where there has historically been severe competition for talent in the mining sector, to ensure the Group is able to provide an appropriate level of reward and incentive whilst remaining consistent with current UK best practice.
The Stay & Prosper Plan was implemented in 2005 to provide a significant retention tool whilst also providing sufficient incentive opportunity to align the interests of managers with those of shareholders.
The Plan consists of two components: a performance award which is subject to satisfaction of specific performance conditions and a retention award which is subject to continued employment on the third anniversary of the date of grant.
Vesting of the performance award in good leaver situations is subject to the discretion of the Committee whilst the retention award will normally lapse but the Committee may exercise its discretion.
Awards are linked to a notional number of shares which are awarded at nil cost and participants receive shares or cash based on the prevailing market value of that proportion of the total award that vests at the end of three years.
Initially, the plan was operated on a cash-settled basis only, but since the January 2009 AGM, awards may at the discretion of the Committee be settled in newly-issued shares.
All awards vesting in 2009 were share-settled and this remains the Committees policy.
The executive Directors are not permitted to participate in this Plan.
The performance conditions for the performance award are summarised below: Year of award Retention performance Performance condition Performance % of performance award released 2006 50% 50% EBIT: audited profit for FY2008 Threshold 20% Target 54% Stretch 100% 2007 50% 50% EBIT: audited profit for FY2009 Threshold 20% Target 60% Stretch 100% 2008 February 50% 50% EBIT: audited profit for FY2009 Threshold 20% Target 60% Stretch 100% 2008 March 50% 50% Matrix based on saleable platinum 0% 100% ounces and direct unit cost per platinum ounces for FY2010 2008 July 50% 50% EBIT: audited profit for FY2010 Threshold 0% Stretch 100% 2008 November 50% 50% EBIT: audited profit for FY2010 Threshold 0% Stretch 100% 2009 September 50% RTSR TSR relative to a group of Threshold median 20% 20 comparator companies Target 75th percentile 70% Stretch 90th percentile 100% 50% Share Price Lonmin Plc share price on Threshold 20% London Stock Exchange Stretch 100% The main award was made on 14 September 2009 to senior managers based in South Africa on terms substantially unchanged from those of the prior year.

com 83 Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2009 Performance-related pay for executive Directors and senior executives continued Stay & Prosper Plan continued On 16 August 2009, awards made under the Stay & Prosper Plan on 16 August 2006 vested.
51% of the performance award with an EBIT performance condition vested which together with the retention award gave an overall vesting of 76% of the total award.
The outcome of the performance award was linked to the underlying audited EBIT for the year ended 30 September 2008 of $963m and share of joint venture profits of $18m.
The vesting scale required a threshold of $775m at which 20% would vest, target of $1,000m at which 54% would vest and stretch of $1,250m at which 100% would vest with straight-line interpolation between these points.
Scarce Skills Retention Plan This plan was used for a one-off award made in 2006 to 74 key individuals below board level who were identified as having rare and valuable skills necessary to the Companys future vision and who were felt to be at significant risk of poaching by our global competitors.
The vast majority of participants were based in South Africa.
Awards comprised a notional share-based award which was settled in cash provided the individual was still employed by the Company three years after the award.
There was no performance condition and no good leaver provisions.
The awards made in 2006 vested on 14 July 2009 and cash totalling R5.139m net was paid to the remaining 31 participants.
The executive Directors did not participate in this Plan and, other than in 2006, there have not been and the Committee does not envisage that there will be, any further awards made under this Plan.
Performance condition philosophy The Committee considers the appropriateness of proposed performance conditions prior to approving the grant of each award.
With the exception of awards made under the Stay & Prosper and the Scarce Skills Retention Plans, each of the Plans mentioned above uses relative total shareholder return as part or the whole of the performance condition.
The Committee believes that this measure links the actual returns delivered to shareholders with the remuneration earned by the executives through the successful delivery of our strategy.
In addition, the Committee believes that this test provides a measurable and objective reflection of true performance for shareholders in light of the variability introduced into reported results by metal prices and exchange rates particularly between the South African Rand and the US Dollar.
Prior to 2009, in order to provide an effective and robust link between the business needs and the remuneration of the Companys executives and managers, the EBIT test was introduced for awards made under the CIP, DABP, LTIP and the Stay & Prosper Plan.
The Committee believes that growth in EBIT is a key operational metric by which the business is measured.
The EBIT targets used are based on audited numbers shown in the published accounts of the Company and so provide total transparency and a link between performance and pay.
Where the Group acquires new businesses, the EBIT impact would normally be excluded from the assessment of performance conditions by the Committee, unless the targets had previously been adjusted specifically to include acquired profits or losses.
The Committee would also have regard to the cost of capital associated with such acquisitions, to ensure that shareholder value was properly taken into account in this context.
During 2009 the significant dislocations in the financial and PGM markets made forecasting EBIT three years forward exceptionally challenging.
The Committee perceived that there was a significant risk that any forecasts could prove to be materially incorrect and either result in excessive reward or gross unfairness to the plan participants and by extension, shareholders.
After considering a range of possible performance conditions, the Committee decided to introduce an absolute share price target.
The Committee is aware from the meetings with key institutional shareholders that some do not like the use of absolute share price targets.
These views have been taken into consideration but the Committee still views an absolute share price target as both the fairest metric, and the one most appropriate to the Companys needs.
For reasons of commercial sensitivity, the threshold and stretch targets are not being published, but there will be full retrospective disclosure.
The Committee is confident that the targets are stretching yet realistic, and that shareholders will have achieved an attractive return of their investment should the share price reach the threshold level at which any executive reward would become payable.
Performance conditions are assessed using independently verified data.
Relative TSR is assessed by  LLP, acting on behalf of the Committee, using data normalised into US Dollars sourced from Datastream or other independent providers.
EBIT assessment utilises the audited financial results of the Company.
Grant price methodology The price used to determine the number of shares awarded under the DABP, LTIP and Stay & Prosper Plan is calculated using the average Lonmin share price on the FTSE 100 for the final twenty working days of the last complete calendar month before the date of award.
84 Directors Report Business Review Directors Report Governance Financial Statements Operating Statistics Shareholder Information 2009 Annual Report and Accounts Lonmin Plc Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2009 The comparator group of companies The Remuneration Committee regularly reviews the comparator group used for the Companys long-term incentive arrangements to ensure that it remains relevant to the Companys stated strategy and therefore aligns executives appropriately with shareholders.
Since 2006, the Committee has used a group of twenty metals and mining companies to provide a more statistically sound and broadly based comparator group.
These companies are as follows: African Rainbow Minerals Gold Fields Limited Anglo American plc Impala Platinum Holdings Limited Anglo Gold Ashanti Limited Johnson Matthey plc Anglo Platinum Ltd MMC Norilsk Nickel Antofagasta plc Rio Tinto plc Aquarius Platinum Stillwater Mining BHP Billiton plc Teck Cominco Exxaro Resources Umicore First Quantum Minerals Vale Gold Corp Xstrata plc Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS These legacy schemes expired in March 2007 and, although an ESOS is contained within the rules of the Shareholder Value Incentive Plan, the Committee has not made, and does not intend to make, any grants under that scheme.
Awards made since 1994 have been subject to performance conditions.
Details of these conditions for the Companys various tranches of executive share options that remain outstanding are as follows: Options granted in or after 1998 but before 2002: total return to shareholders must be greater than the total return on the Mining Sector of the FTSE Actuaries Share Indices over any consecutive thirty six month period.
Options granted in or after 2002: total return to shareholders must be greater than that on the Mining Sector of the FTSE Actuaries Share Indices in one of the periods of three, four, five or six years following the date of grant, in each case relative to a fixed base year.
The performance conditions attaching to all outstanding options have been attained and these options duly became exercisable.
Sharesave The Company historically offered an HMRC approved Savings Related Share Option Scheme to all UK-remunerated employees, including the executive Directors.
Under this Scheme, the participant enters into a savings contract and in return is granted an option over the Companys shares to be funded by the balance on their savings account at the end of the contractual savings period.
The option price may, at the Committees discretion, be at a discount of up to 20% to the prevailing mid-market price at the date of invitation.
With the exception of the 2005 awards, the Company has historically granted all such options with a 20% discount, including those held by Ian Farmer.
The Sharesave Scheme expired in March 2007 although options granted prior to that date continue to subsist.
Share schemes generally Except under the Sharesave Scheme, no options have been granted that have an exercise price at a discount to the market price at the time the exercise price was set.
No options or awards of any kind have been granted to Non-executive Directors.
Directors are strongly encouraged to hold the shares issued to them upon the exercise of options and awards.
Dilution Options granted under ESOS and Sharesave with the exception of the December 2005 award are satisfied with new-issued shares.
Awards under the CIP, LTIP or DABP are satisfied either with shares purchased in the market by the Companys offshore employee benefit trust or the issue of new shares.
Awards under the Scarce Skills Retention Plan were cash-settled.
Awards under the Stay & Prosper Plan can be settled in shares or cash at the Committees discretion.

com 85 Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2009 Directors shareholding obligation Ultimately, the Committee believes that the most powerful way to ensure that the actions of the Directors are best aligned with shareholders interests is for the Directors to build up and retain personally significant holdings of the Companys shares.
As a matter of policy, the Board expects all Directors to maintain a shareholding including vested but unexercised share incentives equal in value to 100% of their base salary or, in the case of Non-executive Directors, base fees and 150% in the case of the Chief Executive.
In this way, shareholder value becomes a paramount principle underlying all Board decisions, since real personal wealth will be at stake.
Failure to achieve these targets may result in exclusion from participation in some or all of the incentive schemes that the Company operates.
At the end of the year, by reference to the share price at that date 1674p directors share ownership levels were as follows: Shareholding at 30 September 2009 Guideline Shareholding policy as a % of base salary fees Ian Farmer 150% of base salary 180 Alan Ferguson 100% of base salary 58 Karen fide Segundo 100% of base fees 71 Peter Godsoe 100% of base fees 137 Sivi Gounden 100% of base fees 281 Michael Hartnall 100% of base fees 126 Jonathan Leslie 100% of base fees David Munro 100% of base fees 258 Roger Phillimore 100% of base fees 152 Jim Sutcliffe 100% of base fees 152 Directors shareholdings The beneficial interests of the Directors in office during the year are shown below: 1 30.09.09 30.09.08 Executive Directors Ian Farmer 58,985 35,821 Alan Ferguson 17,007 5,790 Non-Executive Directors Sir John Craven 30,000 30,000 Karen fide Segundo 2,108 1,725 Peter Godsoe 4,106 3,360 Sivi Gounden 8,384 6,860 Michael Hartnall 4,888 4,000 Jonathan Leslie 0 David Munro 7,700 6,300 Roger Phillimore 22,750 3,614 Jim Sutcliffe 4,536 3,712 Former Director Brad Mills 260,596 260,596 Notes 1.

Non-Group directorships No executive Director holds any executive directorship or appointment outside the Group.
It is both the Companys policy and generally a requirement of the individuals contract of employment that no executive Director may take up such an appointment without the approval of the Board.
The Board believes that, in the right circumstances, the holding of non-executive directorships and similar appointments by executive Directors can be useful and appropriate if they help those involved gain additional skills and experience or promote the interests of the Group and do not necessitate an excessive time commitment.
The Board would not normally agree to an executive Director taking on more than one non-executive directorship of a FTSE 100 company or the chairmanship of such a company.
Whilst it would be considered on a case-by-case basis, any individual holding such a role outside the Group would generally be permitted to retain any fees or other payments relating to that appointment.
Service contracts The Company complies fully with the provisions of the Combined Code relating to service contracts.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for settling any payment to be made when an executive Directors employment ends and has full regard to the provisions of the Combined Code and other components of best practice in this area.
One-off arrangement On 22 October 2009 the Company announced that it intended to move its operational headquarters from London to Johannesburg.
Alan Ferguson has confirmed that he will not relocate to South Africa as part of this move and will therefore relinquish his position and resign from the Board at a future date.
He has committed to remain in his present role until at least 31 December 2010 and the Committee believed it was appropriate and in the Companys best interests to offer him a one-off non-pensionable cash retention payment of up to 125% of his current base salary subject to satisfactory individual performance through the period of transition from London to Johannesburg.
Half of the retention payment will be paid at the date of termination with the remaining half payable as soon as practicable after the first full year or interim announcement of results following the termination date.
He will not be eligible to receive an LTIP award in 2010.
88 Directors Report Business Review Directors Report Governance Financial Statements Operating Statistics Shareholder Information 2009 Annual Report and Accounts Lonmin Plc Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2009 Severance arrangements As disclosed last year, Brad Mills employment with the Company terminated on 7 October 2008 and he ceased to be a Director on 9 October 2008.
Under the termination provisions of his contract of employment, Mr Mills received a payment of 1,365,491 less legally required deductions on the termination of his employment and a further payment of 386,880 less legally required deductions in respect of bonus for the financial year ended 30 September 2008.
These payments were made in lieu of those which would have been received by Mr Mills during his contractual notice period and, as such, the Company was bound to make these payments without reduction.
Mr Mills also participated in a number of share-settled incentive and retention schemes.
Following extensive discussions, and taking into account the performance of the Company and the length of time that awards had been held, the Remuneration Committee resolved that Mr Mills would receive 165,000 shares in the Company and a cash payment of 191,000, in each case subject to applicable taxation and other deductions.
These amounts represented the vesting proportions applied to each of Mr Mills awards and a cash payment in respect of dividend equivalents on the shares which vested and other cash-settled matters.
Mr Mills requested, and the Remuneration Committee agreed, that the cash sum in lieu of dividends be reduced and the number of shares increased by an equivalent amount, and these variations are included in the figures above.
The agreed vesting levels resulted in Mr Mills forfeiting over half of the awards which had been made to him under the incentive and retention schemes.
Full details of Mr Mills share awards are set out in the table on page 87.
