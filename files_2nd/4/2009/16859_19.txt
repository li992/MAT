58 VT Group Annual report and accounts 2009 Remuneration report for the year ended 31 March 2009 This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
It also describes the Groups compliance with the Combined Code of Corporate Governance in relation to remuneration for the current and forthcoming financial years.
The report has been approved by the Board for submission to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.
The Companys auditors have audited the report to the extent required by the relevant legislation.
The chairman of the Remuneration Committee will attend the AGM and will be available to answer shareholders questions regarding the contents of this report.
Remuneration Committee In accordance with the Combined Code, the remuneration of the executive Directors is determined by the Remuneration Committee the Committee on behalf of the Board.
The Committee also reviews and monitors remuneration for other senior executives below the Board and oversees the operation of the Companys share schemes.
The Committees terms of reference are available on the Companys website, www.
Details of the composition of the Committee during the year are contained in the Corporate governance report on page 53.
By invitation, Remuneration Committee meetings are also attended by the Chief Executive and the Group HR Director.
No person is present during any discussion directly relating to his or her own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee has appointed Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS as independent advisers.
HNBS does not provide any other services to the Company.
A description of the relationship between the Company and HNBS is available on the Companys website.
The Committee also received advice during the year from Hymans Robertson for UK pensions and Advaita Consulting for US pensions.
Remuneration policy The Companys policy continues to be to provide for each of its executive Directors a remuneration package which is adequate to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the appropriate calibre, whilst at the same time not paying more than is necessary for this purpose.
The Companys policy is reviewed regularly to ensure that it remains appropriate for the Companys current circumstances and prospects and takes due account of developments in market and best practice.
The remuneration package for executive Directors and other senior executives is structured to ensure that a significant proportion of total remuneration is payable subject to the achievement of challenging targets, designed to improve shareholder value.
When setting remuneration for executive Directors, the Committee also has regard to the pay policy throughout the Group.
The following comprise the principal elements of executive Directors remuneration: Base salary Benefits, including pension, company car and fuel, healthcare and private telephone costs Participation in the annual performance-related bonus plan Participation in the Companys long-term incentive plans, as described below, under which awards vest subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions set by the Committee with the primary aim of encouraging the generation of returns to shareholders The Committee ensures that the incentive structure for executive Directors does not raise environmental, social, governance or other operational risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
More generally, with regard to the overall remuneration structure, there is no restriction on the Committee which prevents it from taking into account matters relating to risk in these areas.
Base salary Base salaries for executive Directors are reviewed annually, usually in April.
When conducting the most recent review of base salaries, the Committee considered as it has done in previous years salary levels for executive directors in groups of a similar size and within similar industries to the Group, as well as the Directors personal experience and performance, general economic conditions and pay policy throughout the Group.
The Committee determined that, in light of the current Group restructuring programme, the salaries of the top seventy executives would be frozen.
The salaries of the executive Directors employed at the time of publication effective for the year beginning on 1 April 2009 are: P J Lester 500,000 no increase since 1 April 2008 C J Cundy 250,000 no increase since 1 April 2008 P J Harrison 300,000 no increase since 1 April 2008 P J McIntosh 237,000 no increase since 1 April 2008 VT Group Annual report and accounts 2009 59 Annual bonus Executive Directors, in common with other executives in the Company, are eligible to participate in the annual bonus plan.
The level of bonus paid is determined annually by the Committee and depends on the achievement of a combination of challenging profit, cash flow, strategic and personal targets set by the Committee.
In the year ended 31 March 2009, executive Directors had the opportunity to earn up to 100 per cent of salary in annual bonus.
A bonus of up to 70 per cent of salary was determined by the achievement of financial targets based on profit and cash conversion of which up to 75 per cent was eligible for deferral under the Deferred Annual Bonus Scheme DABS see below.
The payment of any bonus in excess of 70 per cent was based on exceptional divisional or corporate financial performance in excess of stretch targets and again based on profit and cash conversion and or on individual performance against specified personal objectives, and payable only in cash, i. e. it was not eligible to be deferred under the DABS.
The bonuses paid, which are set out in the table on page 62, reflect part achievement of the challenging financial targets relating to the bonus opportunity on the first 70 per cent of salary.
No portion of the remaining 30 per cent bonus opportunity for exceptional performance was paid to the executive Directors, save for 10 per cent of salary paid to P J Lester reflecting part satisfaction of his individual performance objectives.
For the year ended 31 March 2010, the annual bonus will be structured in broadly the same manner, save that in light of the Group restructuring programme, all financial targets will relate to the performance of the Group as a whole i. e. there will be no bonus targets set for individual divisions.
Group financial performance will again be measured against a sliding scale of challenging Group profit and cash conversion targets.
Deferred Annual Bonus Scheme DABS Under the DABS, approved by shareholders at the 2005 AGM, executive Directors and other members of the Group Executive Committee are required to defer 40 per cent of any eligible bonus payment into VT Group shares for a period of three years.
Individual executive Directors may also elect to defer a further 35 per cent of eligible bonus under the same arrangement.
At the end of the three-year period, matching shares will be awarded depending on the extent to which adjusted earnings per share EPS targets have been achieved over the three-year period as shown below.
EPS growth over three years Number of matching shares awarded Less than RPI 5% p. a. Nil RPI 5% p. a.
3:1 Between the above points Straight line It is currently intended that the DABS will continue to operate in the manner set out above, with EPS targets used to ensure that participants are encouraged to deliver strong earnings growth.
Other long-term incentive plans Prior to the year ended 31 March 2008, the Companys policy was to make awards to executive Directors under the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP and two share option plans approved and unapproved.
Following a review of the long-term incentive provision conducted by the Remuneration Committee, the executive share option and LTIP plans were replaced by a single Performance Share Plan PSP with accompanying changes to the performance conditions to which future DABS awards would be subject.
These plans are summarised in greater detail below.
LTIP The LTIP approved by shareholders in 2003, provided for annual conditional awards to be made over VT Group shares worth up to 50 per cent of base salary.
The executive Directors, except P J Harrison, still hold conditional awards under this plan which have yet to complete the vesting period.
The shares are held in trust and are released after three years subject to the extent to which a Total Shareholder Return TSR performance target is met over the vesting period.
The comparator group for measuring performance has been the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
If the Company is ranked at the median at the end of the performance period, 50 per cent of shares will be released, with full vesting for upper quartile performance or above.
No shares will vest if the Company is ranked below the median.
No awards were made under the LTIP in 2008 09 and no further awards will be made.
Statutory information How we run the Group Explaining the Group Overview of the year 60 VT Group Annual report and accounts 2009 Remuneration report for the year ended 31 March 2009 continued Share option plans Until the year ended 31 March 2007, the Company operated two share option plans a UK Inland Revenue approved plan and an unapproved plan, approved by shareholders in 1999 and 1996 respectively, under which Directors and other executives were eligible to participate at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Options were granted at the market value determined immediately before the grant.
Annual awards did not normally exceed one times base salary.
Options under the Companys schemes can normally be exercised only on the achievement of a real EPS growth-based performance condition.
For the last award granted under these schemes, the performance condition applied was real growth in adjusted EPS of at least the Retail Price Index RPI plus 3 per cent per annum over three consecutive years.
If this target is not met at the end of the three-year period, the options lapse i. e. there is no re-testing facility.
All options granted previously have satisfied their performance conditions and are all therefore exercisable in full.
No share option awards were made in the year ended 31 March 2009 and no further awards will be made.
PSP The VT Group 2007 PSP is, together with the DABS, the primary share-based long-term incentive plan now in operation.
The PSP was approved by shareholders in 2007 and provides for annual awards of conditional shares to be made to executive Directors and other eligible executives worth up to a maximum, in normal circumstances, of 100 per cent of salary 200 per cent in exceptional circumstances.
These awards will vest after three years subject to the satisfaction of performance targets based on adjusted EPS growth 50 per cent of awards and in relative TSR performance 50 per cent of awards, thereby providing a balanced incentive to senior executives to deliver both outstanding returns to shareholders and strong earnings growth.
The vesting schedule that applies to awards granted thus far is as follows: TSR performance relative to the FTSE 250 Number of PSP EPS growth over Number of PSP excluding investment trusts shares vesting three years shares vesting Below median Nil Less than RPI 5% p. a. Nil Median 15% RPI 5% p. a.
50% Between the above points Straight line Between the above points Straight line It is currently intended that the PSP will continue to operate in the manner set out above.
Assessing performance under long-term incentive plans Performance under the TSR targets in the LTIP and PSP is independently calculated by Hewitt New Bridge Street on behalf of the Remuneration Committee.
Under the DABS, PSP and share option plans, the Remuneration Committee will obtain external guidance as regards the extent to which the adjusted EPS targets are satisfied.
Share ownership guidelines To align further the interests of executive Directors and shareholders, executive Directors are encouraged to build a shareholding in VT Group worth 100 per cent of salary.
Directors service agreements All executive Directors service contracts are of no fixed term and are subject to 12 months notice of termination from the Company.
Non-executive Directors are normally appointed for a three-year term which can be extended at the Boards discretion.
All appointees are subject to regular re-appointment by shareholders.
Details of the Directors contracts are set out in the following tables: Executive Directors Date of appointment to the Board Date of contract Notice period P J Lester 16 November 1998 14 May 2002 12 months C J Cundy 8 September 1999 5 January 2004 12 months P J Harrison 19 November 2007 19 November 2007 12 months P J McIntosh 22 January 2008 22 October 2003 12 months VT Group Annual report and accounts 2009 61 Date of original Date of Period of Non-executive Directors Notice period appointment re-appointment appointment M M E Jeffries 16 May 2005 23 July 2008 To AGM 2011 3 months D M Barclay 19 May 2003 26 July 2006 To AGM 2009 1 month Baroness Blackstone 27 January 2004 25 July 2007 To AGM 2010 1 month Lord Boyce 28 July 2004 25 July 2007 To AGM 2010 1 month A F Given 5 September 2002 26 July 2006 To AGM 2009 1 month 1 D A Thorpe 31 January 2003 26 July 2006 Resigned 1 month I P Tyler 12 May 2008 12 May 2008 To AGM 2011 1 month Notes 1 Resigned from the Board on 12 May 2008 Non-executive Directors fees The fees of the non-executive Directors other than the Chairman whose fees are set by the Remuneration Committee are set by the Board on the recommendation of the executive Directors, and are reviewed annually.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Companys bonus or share option schemes, nor do they receive a pension.
With effect from 1 November 2008, the non-executive Directors received an annual base fee of 45,000 with additional fees of 7,500 for chairing the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
The Senior Independent non-executive Director received an additional fee of 6,250 from 1 November 2008.
The Chairmans fees are 187,500 per year with effect from 1 November 2008.
The increases in non-executive Directors fees that were implemented as a result of the most recent annual review took into account their respective time commitments, responsibilities and contributions to the Group.
Policy on external appointments for executive Directors The Board believes that the Group can benefit from its executive Directors holding appropriate non-executive directorships of companies or independent bodies.
Such appointments are subject to the approval of the Board.
P J Lester is a non-executive Director of Chloride Group plc.
He takes holiday from VT Group when meetings occur and retains the fees of 36,500.
He has a contractual agreement that he can use one day per month for non-executive duties.
