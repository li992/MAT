The gain on exercise of share options of the directors includes cash bonuses of 638,000 arising out of the exercise of options during the year.
The cost of these cash bonuses is included in administrative expenses.
Directors fees Fees receivable by Nigel McNair Scott in his capacity as Chairman of Avocet Mining Plc are shown in the financial statements of that Company.
Share options The Group operated two share option schemes during the year.
The Helical Bar 1999 Share Option Scheme operates in respect of the grant of share options which exceed the Inland Revenue limit of 30,000.
Under this scheme the aggregate market value of shares issued or issuable to an individual under this and other option schemes may not exceed eight times his annual earnings.
Remaining share options granted over 1,356,405 shares are included in note 30.
These options have satisfied their performance criteria and may be exercised before their expiry dates.
Directors remuneration report Helical Bar plc report & accounts 2009 The Helical Bar 1999 Approved Share Option Scheme is an Inland Revenue approved scheme.
Under the terms of this scheme options up to 39 a maximum value of 30,000 per individual may be granted.
Remaining share options granted over 21,200 shares are included in note 30.
The performance criteria of the two schemes require total shareholder return over a set period to exceed a certain percentile of the aggregate performance of companies in the Real Estate Sector Index of the FTSE All-Share Index.
For the approved scheme the relevant period is three years and the 50th percentile.
For the unapproved scheme the relevant period is five years and 25th percentile.
These share option schemes have been replaced by the Performance Share Plan, details of which are included on pages 41 and 42, and future share option grants will only be made in exceptional circumstances and only following consultation with principal shareholders on the key terms of those options.

In order that the number of shares required by the ESOP to satisfy share awards be reduced, the Group agreed with employees that the number of shares acquired on the exercise of those options be reduced.
To ensure that employees were not disadvantaged by the reduction, the exercise prices applied on the exercise of the options were correspondingly reduced.
This market price varied between 233p and 398p during the year.
The gain on exercise of share options includes a cash bonus of 20p per 1p share in accordance with the matter referred to under special dividend below.
Special dividend In order to compensate option holders for the payment of a special dividend or a distribution of capital, the Board has, under the terms of the Helical Bar 1999 Share Option Scheme the Scheme, the authority to adjust the number of shares subject to option or the exercise price of those options.
The Group is currently unable to increase the number of shares under option in sufficient quantity to satisfy the requirement to compensate option holders for the special dividend of 100p paid in April 2002.
An adjustment to the exercise price of the existing options would result in an increased national insurance cost to the Group.
Accordingly, the Board has considered alternative ways of compensating option holders and, as a result, the Group will compensate holders of options at the time the special dividend was declared, on the dates they exercise their options by 20p per 1p share previously 100p per 5p share, equivalent to the special dividend.
In the year under review compensation of 638,411 was paid following the exercise of options over 3,192,055 1p shares.
Directors remuneration report Helical Bar plc report & accounts 2009 Performance Share Plan 41 At the 2004 Annual General Meeting the Group received approval for the adoption of a Performance Share Plan PSP.
General The operation of the PSP is supervised by the Remuneration Committee the Committee.
The PSP is capable of delivering shares to an executive after a period of not less than three years, other than in exceptional circumstances and with the approval of the Committee, subject to meeting pre-specified performance targets.
Eligibility All employees of the Group and its subsidiaries including directors who are required to devote substantially the whole of their working time to the business of the Group who are not under notice nor within six months of any contractual retirement ages will be eligible to receive invitations to participate in the PSP at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Grant of awards Awards may be made within the six weeks following approval at a general meeting, the announcement by the Group of its results for any period, or the removal of any statutory or regulatory restriction which had previously prevented an award being granted or any other times considered by the Remuneration Committee to be exceptional.
No awards may be made more than ten years after the adoption of the PSP by the Group.
The Remuneration Committee will formally review the operation of the PSP after no more than five years.
An award consists of the right to acquire shares in the Group for either no payment or payment of a nominal sum.
Awards are neither transferable nor pensionable.
Limit on individual participation No awards may be granted over shares in any financial year whose value is greater than three times an employees annual rate of salary.
Exercise of awards Other than in exceptional circumstances, an award will vest no earlier than the third anniversary of its grant to the extent that the applicable performance conditions see below have been satisfied and the participant is still employed by the Group.
Once exercisable, awards will then remain capable of exercise for a period of normally no more than six months.
The Remuneration Committee has set demanding performance conditions for the vesting of shares.
There are two performance conditions, one based on absolute growth in the Groups net asset value per share and the other based on the gross total property return per share relative to other property funds as determined by IPD but excluding those funds worth less than 50m at the start of the three year period.
Performance will be measured over the three years following grant.
Participants will not normally be permitted to sell shares received through the PSP, other than to meet taxation and national insurance contributions liabilities, until they own shares to the value of 2 x salary for directors and 1 x salary for other executives.
For the growth in net asset value, the fully diluted triple net net asset value as at the start of the financial year in which a grant takes place will be compared to the value three years later having added back dividends.
Applicable conditions a Absolute net asset value per share having added back dividends condition Annual compound increase after three years % of award vesting 15% p. a. or more 66.7 Between 7.5% p. a. and 15% p. a.
Zero If UK inflation RPI is higher than 3% per annum over the three year period then the required compound increases will be raised by the excess over the 3% per annum average.
b Total property return v IPD property funds condition Ranking after three years % of award vesting Upper quartile or above 33.3 Between median and upper quartile Pro rata between 3.3 and 33.3 Median 3.3 Less than median Zero Provided the net asset value per share having added back dividends increases over the three year period.
Share awards will be cancelled where the gross return falls below the IPD median and where the growth in triple net asset value is below 7.5% per annum over the three year period.
Directors remuneration report Helical Bar plc report & accounts 2009 Alignment with shareholders interests 42 The Remuneration Committee has analysed the potential gains that may be made by executives directors and those below Board level through the PSP and other incentive arrangements currently in place.
It has concluded that the share of the increase in the value of the Group measured as the increase in the net asset value plus cash returned as dividends to shareholders that could accrue to all executives through the Groups long and short-term incentive and bonus plans excluding gains on share options granted before December 2002 at the point at which the maximum awards vest might be of the order of 20%.
At this point, in absolute terms, the Group will have increased its triple net asset value by at least 15% per annum with the Groups relative performance placing it in the top quartile of IPD, over the three year period.
Relationship to the Groups share option schemes The PSP has replaced future share option grants which will only be made in exceptional circumstances and only following consultation with principal shareholders on the key terms of those options.
Vesting of Awards During the year the performance conditions relating to the second award, granted on 6 July 2005, were considered.
The three year performance period to 31 March 2008 showed that the net asset value per share, calculated in accordance with the terms of the PSP, had increased by 18.4% p. a.
During this three year period the total return of Helicals property portfolio, as determined by IPD, had increased by 16.4% p. a. compared to the upper quantile of the IPD Benchmark of 9.9%.
Accordingly, the performance criteria applicable to this award were met and the shares vested in full and 1,159,125 shares, after deduction of shares sold to pay income tax, were transferred to award holders on 19 September 2008.
The value of the shares on that date which were attributable to the directors is included in the table of the Remuneration of Directors on page 38.
The share of the increase in the value of the Group that accrued to all executives through the Groups long and short-term incentive and bonus plans over the three year performance period to 31 March 2008 was under 20%.
It is expected that one third of the shares awarded on 4 July 2006 will vest at the end of the performance period on 4 July 2009.
It is currently expected that no shares will vest in respect of the share awards made on 6 July 2007 and 14 July 2008.
Helical Bar 2002 Approved Share Incentive Plan On 24 July 2002 the shareholders approved the Helical Bar 2002 Approved Share Incentive Plan the Plan.
Under the terms of this Plan employees of the Group are given up to 3,000 of free shares in any tax year.
Participants in the Plan may purchase additional shares up to a value of 1,500 which is matched in a ratio of 2:1 by the Group.
Provided participants remain employed by the Group for a minimum of three years they will retain the free and matching shares.
Shares allocated to, or purchased on behalf of, the directors under the rules of the Plan were as follows: 2 July 30 September 6 January 2008 2008 2009 at 281.25p at 299.0p at 296.75p Michael Slade 1,867 520 486 Nigel McNair Scott 1,867 520 486 Gerald Kaye 1,867 520 485 Michael Brown 1,867 520 486 Matthew Bonning-Snook 1,867 516 482 Jack Pitman 1,867 520 486 Shares held by the Trustees of the Plan at 31 March 2009 were 250,000 2008: 233,460.
