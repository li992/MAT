Directors Remuneration Report Opening statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Dear Shareholder, I am pleased to present to you the Remuneration Committees report on Directors remuneration for the year to 31 December 2009.
This past year has been a turbulent one for global markets and there have been significant challenges for us to meet during this difficult period.
The fall in the oil price from the very high levels seen in 2008 combined with a lower demand for oil and the reduction of credit lines available to the industry has had a negative impact on both turnover and profit margins.
The Companys executives have focused on the containment of costs and the management of our order book to ensure that resources remain available for continued growth and investment.
It is pleasing that having come through this difficult period we have entered 2010 by signing a number of new contracts and we look forward to a better year in 2010.
The current economic outlook has continued to emphasise the important role that remuneration committees have to play in designing appropriate remuneration packages to recruit, retain and motivate executive talent, whilst providing an appropriate balance between risk and remuneration.
In monitoring and reviewing the Companys remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee has taken into account general market conditions and input from major institutional shareholders, as well as to the challenges and opportunities facing the Company going forward.
The Remuneration Committees intention is to provide packages for the Executive Directors that are appropriately balanced between base salary and bonuses: in last years Remuneration Report, we committed to a further review of the balance between base pay and bonus.
The principles continue to be that base salary should be competitive in the market: and that bonus should be linked to the achievement of predetermined and measurable targets for the Company overall and for personal performance.
The results of benchmarking exercises in 2009 indicated that the total remuneration of the Executive Directors was lower than that of the market as defined by a comparator group of 13 companies in oilfield services and oil and gas production.
As stated in last years report, the mix between base salary and bonus was significantly different.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed its remuneration policy in 2009 and agreed key principles which are set out on page 47.
These remuneration principles provided the foundation for the arrangements in place this year, and will be the basis on which we will agree remuneration going forward.
The Remuneration Committee after taking account of the underlying performance of the Company, the direction given by the Executive Directors in driving key change initiatives across the Company and recognising the need to ensure that the remuneration of the Executives is better aligned with the strategy of the Company and competitive norms, has revised the base salaries of the CEO and CFO with effect from 1 January 2010.
The results of these revisions are shown in the section on Base Salary below.
It is the Committees intention to benchmark these salaries again during 2010 either to validate that the new levels remain competitive or to determine what revisions may be required.
With regard to the variable components of pay: the multiplier for the Annual Bonus opportunity has been reduced from 1.75 to 1.00 in order to better align the pay mix of the Executive remuneration packages with current market practice: the quantum of the Annual Bonuses paid to Executive Directors for the year 2009 is shown on page 49: the Remuneration Committee, having considered advice from Mercer, who have acted as independent compensation consultants, to apply Relative TSR as the performance measure for the PSP, has decided to maintain Earnings per Share growth as previously approved by shareholders: and, the quantum of the PSP awards to Executive Directors is shown on page 55.
Brian Fredrick Remuneration Committee Chairman 26 March 2010 Lamprell plc Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Annual Report & Accounts 2009 46 Corporate governance Introduction This report and the recommendations of the Remuneration Committee have been approved by the Board and will be submitted to shareholders for approval at the 2010 AGM.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and the Company applied the provisions of the Combined Code relating to remuneration throughout the year ended 31 December 2009.
The regulations require the auditors to report to the Companys shareholders on the auditable part of the Remuneration Report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act.
This report has therefore been divided into two parts setting out the audited and non-audited information respectively.
A separate resolution to approve the Remuneration Report will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
Information not subject to audit Composition of the Remuneration Committee The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee Committee provide for it to determine, and agree with the Board, the policy for the remuneration of Lamprells Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and such other members of the executive management as it is designated to consider.
The full terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Companys website www.
During the year ended 31 December 2009, the members of the Committee were Mr Fredrick Chairman, Mr Raynaut and Mr Goodall.
Mr Fredrick assumed the position of Chairman on 11 June 2009 from Mr Raynaut.
The Board deems all of the current members of the Committee to be independent Non-Executive Directors in accordance with the Combined Code.
The Committee met five times during 2009 with all members of the Committee at the date of each meeting in attendance.
Advisers to the Committee Mercer was asked to undertake an Executive Benchmarking exercise in 2009 and provided proposals on how to adjust Executive Remuneration packages.
Mercer also reviewed Lamprells current PSP for Executives and made recommendations, which were not accepted by the Committee, for the application of TSR as a relative measure for this plan and for other changes to the terms of the plan.
Separately, Mercer also conducted an End of Service Gratuity Valuation under the provisions of the IFRS.
The Committee consults with the Non-Executive Chairman and the Chief Executive as appropriate, and both may be asked to attend meetings by request.
By request, the Committee is also supported by the Company Secretary and other employees, although no individual is involved in discussions around their own remuneration.
Remuneration policy The remuneration policy of the Company has been designed with the aim of enabling the recruitment, motivation and retention of Executive Directors and senior managers of the highest calibre.
The remuneration structure should support the needs of the business in a competitive marketplace.
UK shareholder guidelines will be followed to the highest possible extent consistent with the needs of the business.
The reward policy determined by the Committee aims to drive business performance and maximise shareholder value through the use of a mixture of fixed and variable pay.
It is based on the following key principles: remuneration packages should be balanced between base salary and bonuses: base salary should be competitive: bonus should be linked to the achievement of predetermined and measurable targets for the Company and personal performance: Health and safety standards are of paramount importance and any accident which causes serious injury or a fatality that occurs in a facility operated by the Company or any subsidiary will be taken into consideration for the payments of any performance bonus: and, PSP shares shall align the interests of senior staff to shareholders.
The Committee views Executive remuneration from a total compensation perspective, taking account of all elements of reward.
The total compensation opportunity for Executive Directors should be market competitive to enable the recruitment and retention of the required talent and experience.
However, a high proportion of remuneration should be variable and, therefore, at risk and the reward policy should support the creation of shareholder value.
Lamprell plc Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Annual Report & Accounts 2009 47 Directors Remuneration Report continued During the year, the Company commissioned a review of the pay and benefits of all employees below Senior Management level in all its operations.
The findings of that review and the resulting adjustments to compensation were taken into account by the Committee in its consideration of the remuneration of the Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and Vice Presidents for the year.
Mercer benchmarked Executive Directors Total Remuneration and all its components against a group of comparator companies of a similar size and engaged in relevant activities: Hargreaves Services plc Salamander Energy plc Wellstream Holdings plc Melrose Resources plc Hunting plc Energy XXI Bermuda Limited Fortune Oil plc JKX Oil & Gas plc Gulfsands Petroleum plc Premier Oil plc Emerald Energy plc Venture Production plc Afren plc As a secondary reference point, the Mercer study also had reference to the remuneration framework of the following UK-listed oil equipment and services sector companies: Petrofac Limited Noble Corporation Rowan Companies Inc. Transocean There are three main elements of the remuneration package for the Executive Directors: basic annual salary and benefits, including a pension equivalent: annual cash bonus payments: and, share-based long-term incentives.
The table below summarises these elements and their key features: Positioning against Component Quantum market Purpose Delivery Other key features Base salary Varies by role Upper quartile Provides the fixed Monthly cash Reviewed annually and individual element of the payment package Annual Individual maxima, Market Median To drive and reward Annual cash Based on annual performance with Executive Directors annual performance payment performance against bonus plan capped at 100% of of individuals, teams pre-determined base salary and the Company.

The charts below illustrate the relative proportions of pay at risk variable and not at risk fixed at different levels of performance based on a projected value methodology.

Elements of Remuneration Base salary Policy: upper quartile base salary to provide market competitive package following Mercer review The Company has historically positioned the base salaries of the Executive Directors below the median for the competitive market, with a substantial proportion of their remuneration therefore being performance-related.
However, after a review of the overall package, especially in the light of a highly volatile market in 2009, the Committee decided to adjust the CEO and CFO basic salaries to be competitive at the upper quartile of the market, largely to recognise the following: The results of the benchmarking exercises undertaken by Deloitte L. L. P. the Committees previous advisors in 2007 and 2008 had indicated anomalies between the base salaries and bonus amounts paid by the Company, and that of its comparator group, with base salaries significantly lower and variable pay through bonus significantly higher than the comparator group.
The results of the benchmarking exercise undertaken by Mercer in 2009 came to similar conclusions to the exercises undertaken by Deloitte.
The Committee considers that too high a level of pay which is at risk could lead to the loss of key Executive Directors in difficult economic circumstances when continuity is most important.
Changes to the roles and responsibilities of Nigel McCue, who assumed the role of CEO from 1 May 2009, and Scott Doak, the CFO who assumed all responsibilities previously undertaken by the Director of Corporate Communications who left the Company on 1 January 2009.
The table below shows the base salaries of each current Executive Director effective as at 1 April 2009, and those that will apply from 1 January 2010: Base salary Base salary Name Position from 1.4.
2010 % increase Nigel McCue Chief Executive Officer, former Chief Operating Officer $415,500 $785,662 89% Scott Doak Chief Financial Officer $354,393 $ 472,153 33% Peter Whitbread Former Chief Executive Officer $378,000 $378,000 0% Annual bonus Policy: bonus to provide competitive total cash opportunity The Executive Directors and senior management can receive annual bonus payments based on the achievement of net profit targets and individual objectives, which are reviewed by the Committee at the start of the financial year.
The Committee has an overriding discretion to consider, if deemed necessary, performance on environmental, social and governance issues when determining the annual bonus payments for the Executive Directors.
In view of the Companys financial performance during 2009 the Committee has determined that no bonuses will be paid.
The Committee keeps the remuneration arrangements under review and has determined it appropriate that the key principles of the annual bonus plan for financial year 2010 should be as follows: the annual bonus opportunity will be capped at a maximum of 100% of base salary for the Executive Directors: and payout of 60% of the bonus will be based on financial targets, with the remaining 40% dependent on the achievement of personal objectives.
Lamprell plc Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Annual Report & Accounts 2009 49 Directors Remuneration Report continued Long-term incentives Policy: competitive rewards to recruit, retain and motivate individuals of a top calibre Long-term incentives are provided to eligible employees under the provisions of three different share based plans: The Lamprell plc Executive Share Option Plan This plan provides for Options over Lamprell shares to be granted at market value to eligible employees.
The Options will normally vest after three years and be exercisable up to the 10th anniversary of the date of grant.
The Lamprell plc Retention Share Plan This plan provides for the conditional allocation of shares to eligible employees selected by the Board.
Awards will normally vest and the shares be released, together with any accumulated dividends, if determined by the Board, two years after the date of grant.
The Lamprell plc 2008 Performance Share Plan The main features of the PSP are that Awards over Lamprell shares can be made, on an annual basis, to Executive Directors and other key individuals.
The Awards will take the form of a promise to deliver free shares, but may be structured in an economically equivalent form subject to an assessment of local tax and regulatory issues.
Awards will normally vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant of the award, subject to any applicable performance conditions having been satisfied.
The PSP is intended to be the Companys primary long-term incentive vehicle for Executive Directors and senior management.
Executive Directors will not normally be granted Options under the Executive Share Option Plan or receive Awards under the Retention Share Plan.
However, for retention purposes, Nigel McCue and Scott Doak were each granted Options in March 2009.
The Committee believes that the performance conditions for vesting of PSP awards should strike a balance between achieving alignment with shareholder returns and reward for delivery of strong underlying performance, the latter point being more in the control of senior management.
First awards under the PSP will be made with respect to the year ended 31 December 2009 and their vesting will be subject to achieving EPS growth relative to predefined targets, as the Committee considers EPS to be one of the key measures of the Companys success.
The intended EPS targets and their associated vesting levels are as follows straight-line vesting applies between the hurdles : EPS growth over three-year period Percentage of award vesting less than 15% 0% 15% 25% 45% or more 100% The Committee regularly reviews both the overall suitability of the Companys share-based remuneration, the level of awards made under the plans operated, and the performance conditions attached to those awards.
Any value earned under the Companys long-term incentive plans is not pensionable.
Pension Policy: in line with local market practice Under employment law in the UAE, the Executive Directors participate in a terminal gratuity scheme operated by the Company as a pension equivalent.
This is operated as a cash payment based on the length of service and final salary of the Executive Director and the value of these cash provisions is c. 8% of base salary.
Under the terms of the local UAE labour law the terminal gratuity accrues benefit to an employee as follows: 21 days per annum for the first five years of employment 30 days per annum for the remainder of their employment The benefit accrues for incomplete years on a pro rata basis, is calculated using the current base salary and has a maximum benefit amounting to two years of the annual base salary.
Lamprell plc Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Annual Report & Accounts 2009 50 Corporate governance Other remuneration elements The Executive Directors also receive other benefits including car allowances, housing allowances, utilities for housing, school fees for children up to the age of 18 years old, annual airline tickets, medical and life insurance, petrol costs and club memberships.
The cash value of the benefits received by each Executive Director in 2009 is shown in the table on page 53.
Directors contracts The policy set out below provides the framework for contracts for the Executive Directors.
It is the Companys policy that Executive Directors should have contracts with a rolling term providing for a maximum of one years notice.
Consequently, no Executive Director has a contractual notice period in excess of 12 months.
Aspect of contract Policy Notice period on termination by the Company or the 12 calendar months Executive Director Termination payment Up to one times annual basic salary, plus benefits but excluding bonus.
The Company may elect to pay sums in lieu of notice in three separate tranches: 50% within seven working days of the Termination Date: 25% three months after the Termination Date: and 25% six months after the Termination Date.
Vesting of long-term incentive scheme awards In line with the rules of the relevant equity incentive scheme generally pro-rated for time and performance for good leavers Pension Based on existing arrangements and terms of the UAE Labour Law with respect to terminal gratuity The general policy on termination is that the Company does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations, i. e. no ex-gratia payments are made.
The Committee will seek to ensure that there have been no unjustified payments for failure, and as such none of the Executive Directors contracts provides for liquidated damages, longer periods of notice on a change of control of the Company, or additional compensation on an Executive Directors cessation of employment.
The table below sets out the details of the Executive Directors service contracts: Director Date of contract Effective date Peter Whitbread 11 September 2006 11 September 2006 Nigel McCue 16 May 2008 16 May 2008 Scott Doak 10 December 2006 1 March 2007 Outside appointments for Executive Directors Any outside appointments must be approved by the Board.
It is the Companys policy that remuneration earned from such appointments may be kept by the individual Executive Director.
The external appointments of the Directors are noted below.
During 2009 Peter Whitbread received CAD$23,000: Nigel McCue received CAD$33,338 and 80,120: and Scott Doak received 10,400 in respect of these appointments.
