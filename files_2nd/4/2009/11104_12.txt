Remuneration Report This report contains the information required by the Companies Act 1985 and the relevant parts of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
The Board of Directors report that the Company has complied with these regulations throughout the year under review.
Information not subject to audit Introduction and Overview of the Year The Remuneration Committee has undertaken a number of significant initiatives during the past year to ensure that remuneration structures for executive directors and senior management are appropriate to the prevailing, and more challenging, economic conditions facing the Company.
These initiatives focused on offering fair reward for performance, whilst also delivering an appropriate balance between those rewards and returns to shareholders.
The Committee was particularly concerned to ensure that Next would continue to offer consistently attractive remuneration packages to enable the Group to retain and to attract the highest quality people.
This overview summarises the main developments in the year: more detailed information on the Groups remuneration arrangements are then set out later in this report.
During the year the Remuneration Committee: conducted a major review of senior executive remuneration benchmarked against comparable companies within the retailing sector, with the support of independent consultants, Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS.
The key conclusions of this review were that, whilst the basic structure of salary, short term and long term bonuses was generally appropriate for the Group, the basis on which targets were set for determining performance related pay needed to be modified: in August 2008, consulted with Nexts top 10 shareholders representing over 42% of shares in issue, the Association of British Insurers and RiskMetrics on behalf of the National Association of Pension Funds to determine whether Nexts leading shareholders would support the Committees proposals for restructuring future performance targets and the basis on which new long term incentive plan LTIP awards would be made.
A briefing note was sent to each leading shareholder, which was then supplemented by individual discussions with either the Committee chairman and or HNBS.
This exercise confirmed that a substantial majority of shareholders consulted were supportive of our proposals: in September 2008, restructured performance targets for the remainder of the year to January 2009.
No changes had retrospective effect or altered first half performance measurement.
Revised profit targets for bonuses were set for the second half year and potential bonus payments were capped at a maximum of 50% of the level which would have been earned had the revised profit target been in place for the full year.
The revised profit target required pre-tax profits and pre-tax earnings per share EPS for the Group to exceed 427 million and 215 pence per share respectively before any bonus became payable to executive directors: thereafter, the level of bonus was based on the excess of pre-tax EPS over 215 pence per share.
The maximum 50% bonus would only be payable if pre-tax EPS were at least 232 pence per share.
As the revised targets were set during the financial year the Committee determined that no bonus would be payable for the first half year: determined that a similar approach be adopted for the 2009 10 annual performance award, with performance measured on a full year basis against target ranges set by the Committee.
The Committee decided that the Chief Executives maximum potential annual bonus should be increased to 150% of salary from the previous level of 100%.
However, in keeping with the Committees focus on retention and performance, any bonus payable in excess of 100% of salary would be paid in shares, deferred for two years and satisfied by share issues from the Next Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT.
The Committee has set 2009 10 performance targets which will be disclosed in its 2010 Report: implemented revised arrangements for issue of LTIP awards.
To reduce the volatility inherent in the total shareholder return TSR performance measure, the Committee determined it would be more appropriate to make reduced LTIP grants twice a year, once in March and again in September after the announcement of Nexts annual and interim results.
This change would also enhance the portfolio effect for participants of more frequent, but smaller LTIP awards.
The Committee also decided that the EPS underpin should be modified from the previous growth requirement of RPI to one which was more appropriate to the current economic environment and the specific performance of Next against its comparator group.
Whilst the TSR performance condition is to be retained, the financial underpin for each future LTIP award will be in line with general market practice and reflect the Committees assessment of the Companys underlying performance.
The Committee will be rigorous in its assessment and believes it will result in an equally challenging threshold before any award would vest.
In January 2009, determined that an annual salary award of 1% be made to executive directors, in line with the wider Company award.
27 Remuneration Report While the Company is confident with respect to the long term prospects of the business, the present economic outlook means that it is likely to be much more difficult to achieve significant earnings growth in the next few years.
The Committee carefully considered the changes to remuneration policy summarised above and is satisfied that appropriate and effective incentive structures have been put in place.
These should assist in retaining Nexts executive directors and senior management and incentivising them to deliver superior performance.
The objective remains to increase shareholder value in the medium to long term by ensuring that managements interests are fairly aligned with those of shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee The Committee determines the remuneration of the Groups Chairman and executive directors, and reviews that of senior executives.
The members of the Committee who served during the year are listed in this Annual Report.
The Committee members have no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no director is permitted to be involved in any decisions as to his or her own remuneration.
Remuneration policy The remuneration packages of directors are reviewed by the Committee at least annually on the same basis as other employees of the Group.
The review takes into account market practice and performance of the individual and of the business.
Other factors taken into account include the experience and responsibility of the individuals concerned, together with the Groups wider pay structures.
From time to time, the Committee commissions benchmarking exercises by independent consultants covering all aspects of directors remuneration including share incentives and other performance related reward plans.
The Committee also receives information from various independent sources on directors remuneration and draws on members collective experience from other board positions.
The components of the Groups remuneration packages are detailed below.
Remuneration is structured to ensure that no one component or measure dominates and that interests are aligned over different time periods with other employees and shareholders.
Remuneration policy does not conflict with the Companys approach to environmental, social and corporate governance matters and the Committee believes that the current arrangements do not encourage directors to take undue business risks.
Packages include basic salary, annual bonus based on pre-tax EPS, a long term incentive plan based on total shareholder return and participation in Nexts pension plan.
It also includes optional participation in a risk reward investment plan.
Salary Directors salaries are set by reference to those prevailing in the market, particularly within other major retail companies, and according to individual performance, experience and responsibility.
The normal review date is January and the 2009 award for the executive directors and the Group as a whole was a 1% increment.
Annual performance related bonus The executive directors participate in an annual performance related bonus scheme which is based on formulae determined by the Committee measuring the performance of the business.
The performance measure is annual pre-tax EPS.
For the six months to July 2008, this had to increase by 5% prior to any bonus becoming payable.
The formula for this period also included an upper limit of 50% of salary and EPS growth had to reach a demanding level of at least 10% for the maximum bonus to be earned.
As there was no growth in EPS in this period, no bonus was payable for this period.
For the six months to January 2009, revised performance targets were set on a prospective basis only, with no bonus being payable if pre-tax profits were below 427m and pre-tax EPS were 215 pence or less.
A maximum bonus of 50% of salary was payable if pretax EPS exceeded 232 pence, with a pro-rated award for earnings in this range.
Based on pre-tax EPS of 221.2 pence per share, the actual bonus payable is 18.2% of salary, equal to an aggregate of 351,000 for the executive directors.
For future periods, a similar methodology will be applied.
Annual performance targets will be set by the Committee based on a range of factors, including consensus analysts profit forecasts and the Companys own internal budgets for the relevant period.
Whilst these will not be disclosed in advance for reasons of commercial sensitivity, the targets and performance against them will be disclosed in the relevant years Remuneration Report.
28 Remuneration Report The Chief Executives maximum annual bonus potential will be increased from 100% to 150% of basic salary to reflect the Committees decision to keep the bias of pay on performance.
This brings the potential bonus more into line with the Companys retail sector competitors and similarly sized companies more generally.
However, any bonus awarded above the existing 100% of basic salary limit will be payable in shares, deferred for a period of two years and would be forfeited if he voluntarily resigns prior to the end of that period.
Maximum bonus potential for other executive directors will remain at 100% of basic salary.
Long term incentive plan The current plan was approved by shareholders at the 2006 Annual General Meeting.
Until April 2008, invitations to participate were issued annually to executive directors and senior executives.
As noted above, to reduce the inherent volatility of the total shareholder return TSR performance condition, the Committee decided to adopt a biannual, rather than annual, grant policy from September 2008 for long term incentive plan LTIP awards.
Previously, annual awards to the Chief Executive, other executive directors and senior management were 200%, 150% and 120% of basic salary respectively.
Under this new policy, the Chief Executive, other executive directors and senior management will receive grants of 100%, 75% and 60% of basic annual salary respectively every six months in or around March and September each year.
The first biannual award, equal to 50% of the previous annual award made in March 2008, was made in respect of the three year performance period ending July 2011 as detailed below.
Under the plan, performance is measured over periods of three years, which commence in February and August each year, by comparing TSR against approximately 20 other UK listed retail companies.
If no entitlement has been earned at the end of a three year performance period then the award for that period will lapse and there is no retesting.
For awards made from September 2008 onwards, the EPS underpin attached to LTIP awards, which operates in addition to the median to upper quintile TSR performance targets, is replaced by a more conventional underpin.
Specifically, the Committee will have regard to the performance of the Company in light of underlying economic and other circumstances, including EPS performance of the Company and of other UK retailers over the period.
The comparator group of companies for the three year performance period to January 2009 was as follows: Alliance Boots Home Retail Group Marks & Spencer N Brown Body Shop JJB Sports Matalan Signet Burberry J Sainsbury MFI Furniture Tesco Carpetright Kesa Morrisons W H Smith DSG Kingfisher Mothercare Woolworths Findel The Committee determines which companies are to be added to or removed from the comparator group for future performance periods.
For periods ending January 2010 onwards Body Shop, MFI Furniture and Matalan have been removed from the comparator group and replaced by Debenhams, Carphone Warehouse and French Connection.
For periods ending January 2011 onwards Alliance Boots has been removed from the comparator group.
For periods ending January 2012 onwards ASOS, HMV and Halfords have been added to the comparator group and Woolworths has been removed.
Following the merger of Boots Group with Alliance Unichem on 31 July 2006, data for Boots Group is used prior to the merger date and data for the merged entity thereafter.
Similarly, following the demergers of GUS and W H Smith data for the appropriate demerged entity Home Retail Group and W H Smith is used after the date of the demerger.
The Committee considers that the comparator group consists of UK listed companies which are most comparable with Next in size or nature of their business.
The Committee believes that comparison against a group of retail companies is more likely to reflect the Companys relative performance against its peers, thereby resulting in appropriate awards being made.
29 2004 Remuneration Report The graph below shows relative TSR of the Company over five years when compared with the FTSE All Share index and FTSE General Retailers index.
This illustrates the Companys performance against a wide all-share UK index and against other companies in the same sector.
Next plc Performance Chart 2004-2009 Total Shareholder Return 250 200 150 100 50 0 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Re-based to 31 January 2004 100 Next plc FTSE All Share FTSE General Retailers If TSR is below the median ranking company there will be no entitlement to any of the award.
Median performance earns an entitlement to a minimum percentage of the maximum award.
For performance above the median the entitlement will rise, with the maximum award being earned for performance which places the Company at or above a pre-determined ranking in the comparator group.
Irrespective of where Company performance ranks, no award will vest for any plan commencing prior to April 2008 unless the Companys EPS has increased by at least the increase in the Retail Price Index over the period.
For plans commencing after July 2008, the Committee will confirm if the relevant performance conditions, including the economic underpin, have been met before any award vests.
The maximum award allowed under the current rules of the plan is 200% of basic salary 300% in exceptional circumstances.
For the performance period commencing February 2005 the maximum award was 100% of basic salary.
Prior to 2008, the Committee generally restricted the maximum potential share award below that possible under the rules of the plan.
As disclosed last year, in 2007, an independent benchmarking exercise by HNBS indicated that the level of awards was inconsistent with market practice.
Accordingly, the Committee concluded that the level of awards to be made for periods commencing after January 2008 should be moved in line with current market levels.
This reduced the level of award that vests at the median performance level from 30% to 20% and increased the performance required at which the maximum award will vest to the upper quintile of the comparator group.
30 Remuneration Report Details of potential awards granted for outstanding performance periods and the performance criteria for maximum awards based on a comparator group of approximately 20 companies are as follows: Performance periods Maximum potential award % of maximum potential Ranking for commencing granted % of basic salary award at median ranking maximum award Directors Other employees 1 February 2006 & 2007 100% 80% 30% Upper quartile 2 February 2008 150% 120% 20% Upper quintile 3 August 2008 75% 60% 20% Upper quintile 1 Incremental awards were made to Mr Angelides, bringing his maximum share award to an equivalent of 130% of salary for the performance period commencing February 2006.
The additional 30% award was also contingent on his remaining with the Group for a five year period to January 2009.
2 The maximum potential award made to Mr Wolfson for the performance period commencing February 2008 is 200% of basic salary.
3 The maximum potential award made to Mr Wolfson for the performance period commencing August 2008 is 100% of basic salary.
The Committee has discretion as to whether entitlements earned are payable in Next shares or cash and to date it has allowed participants the choice.
Entitlements earned are not pensionable and are based on salary and share price at the start of the performance period.
Individuals included in the plan have not received grants under the management share option scheme in the same year.
Risk Reward investment plan The risk reward investment plan was first implemented in 2004 in order to provide a retention incentive for executive directors and senior employees who were being targeted by Nexts competitors.
A similar plan with additional retention provisions was put in place after shareholder approval was obtained at an Extraordinary General Meeting in July 2005.
Shareholders also approved the implementation of further plans at the 2006, 2007 and 2008 AGMs, but the Committee decided it was not appropriate to offer this incentive in any of the three years to January 2009.
The Committee considers that, notwithstanding the lack of returns realised or expected from the previous two plans launched in 2004 and 2005, this incentive structure is a potentially valuable way to retain and align the interests of key directors and senior management with those of shareholders.
Accordingly, authority will be sought from shareholders at the 2009 AGM to implement a new risk reward investment plan if the Committee considers it appropriate, which will be broadly similar to that implemented in 2005.
Further details of the proposed Plan are set out in Appendix 2 to the AGM Notice on pages 93 to 95.
Full details of the 2005 Plan were included on page 22 of the 2006 Remuneration Report, the main elements of which are summarised below.
In July 2005 following approval by the Committee, the Group made a special contribution of 1,198,000 to the Next 2003 Employee Share Ownership Trust the ESOT to acquire listed warrants issued by Goldman Sachs Jersey Limited.
These warrants are held on revocable trusts for executives who made personal investments totalling 499,000 including 266,000 by executive directors from their own resources in financial contracts, the success of which is based on the market price of Next shares in July 2009.
The returns on the warrants and the financial contracts are materially the same and will vary between a minimum of zero if the final share price is then 20.50 or less and a maximum of approximately five times the initial investment.
The maximum value will only be achieved if the final share price is at or above 25.00.
On maturity of the warrants, any returns accruing to the ESOT will only be distributed either in Next shares and or cash to those participants who have remained with Next.
31 Remuneration Report Based on an average Next share price of 14.93 over the three months to July 2005, the Companys share price would need to increase by July 2009 at the equivalent of an annual compound growth rate of 8.3% adjusted for the difference between assumed dividends payable and actual dividends paid in order for there to be any return on the initial investment.
In order to achieve maximum value the annual compound growth rate would need to be 13.8%.
In addition, the Group also acquired 172,368 warrants direct from Goldman Sachs Jersey Limited in order to hedge its potential employers National Insurance contributions liability in respect of the plan.
The risk reward plan that was implemented in July 2004 concluded in July 2008 and no returns accrued to participants on its maturity.
Based on a share price of 12.83 on 23 March 2009, Nexts share price must increase by more than 60% in the period to July 2009 for any returns to accrue under the 2005 plan.
Management share options The management share option plan was approved by shareholders in 2005 and will be due for renewal in 2015.
The plan provides for options over shares, exercisable between three and ten years following their grant, to be allocated to Group employees excluding main board directors and senior executives who participate in Nexts LTIP at the discretion of the Committee.
Options can either be approved where the beneficiary may qualify for tax relief or unapproved.
The total number of options which can be granted is subject to shareholder approved limits and there are no cash settlement alternatives.
Options are set at the prevailing market price at the time of grant.
The maximum total market value of shares i. e. the acquisition price of shares over which options may be granted to any person during any financial year of the Company is three times salary, excluding bonuses and benefits in kind.
This limit may be increased to five times salary in circumstances considered by the Committee to be exceptional, for example on the grant of options following recruitment.
Grants are generally made annually.
The exercise of options is subject to a performance condition where the percentage growth in the Groups EPS over a three year period must exceed RPI plus a further 3% per annum.
In the light of current economic circumstances, the Committee has determined that a growth related performance condition is no longer appropriate and a new performance condition should be applied for future option grants.
For the April 2009 award, the Committee has reviewed Nexts internal budgets and current analysts forecasts and determined this performance condition should be that post-tax EPS in the year to January 2012 has to be no less than 133 pence per share.
The Committee believes that this performance threshold will be no less demanding than the previous EPS growth condition applied to previous grants.
If the performance condition for any option grant is not met at three years from the date of grant, the options lapse.
No options were granted to directors or changes made to existing entitlements in the year under review.
No employee has received option grants under the scheme and been included in Nexts LTIP in the same year.
The Company monitors and has complied with dilution limits in its various share scheme rules.
Currently, share based incentives are satisfied from shares held by the ESOT see Note 29 on page 75.
The Committee may recommend further on-market share purchases be made by the ESOT to satisfy outstanding and future option grants.
The Board has also approved the use of market purchases into treasury where necessary for the future settlement of these obligations.
Sharesave options The sharesave option scheme was approved by shareholders in 2000 and expires in 2010.
A resolution to renew the sharesave option scheme will be proposed at the 2009 AGM.
Invitations to participate are generally issued annually to substantially all employees.
The scheme operates on a save-as-you-earn principle and is subject to a maximum contribution limit of 250 per month per employee.
Options are granted at the prevailing market rate less a discount of 20% and are exercisable three, five or seven years from the date of grant.
A similar scheme is operated by the Company for its employees in the Republic of Ireland.
Sharesave options granted to directors in the year under review are detailed on page 37.
32 Remuneration Report Group pension plan Executive directors are eligible for membership of the Next Group Pension Plan the Plan which has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs and consists of defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The trustee of the Plan is a limited company, Next Pension Trustees Limited the Trustee.
The Board of the Trustee includes members of the Plan, a pensioner member and an independent director who is also the Chairman of the Trustee.
Two of the directors are member nominated directors and cannot be removed by Next: the other directors, including the independent director, are appointed by and can be removed by Next.
All directors of the Trustee receive a fee for their services, including those directors who are also employees of Next.
Pensioner and member representatives have been elected as member nominated directors.
No director of the Company is a director of the Trustee.
The Plans investments are kept separate from the business affairs of the Next group and the Trustee holds them in trust.
Responsibility for investment of the Plans funds has been delegated by the Trustee to professional investment managers.
From October 2008 the Group initiated a salary sacrifice scheme whereby members from either section can elect to receive a reduced gross salary in exchange for enhanced employer pension contributions.
The participation of members in the salary sacrifice scheme does not result in any overall increase in costs to the Group.
Defined contribution section Employees of the Group can join the defined contribution section of the Plan.
Members elect to pay either 3% or 5% of their pensionable earnings which is matched by the Company.
For death prior to retirement, a lump sum of three times the members basic salary at the previous April is payable along with the current value of the members fund.
Defined benefit section The defined benefit section of the Plan was closed to new members in 2000 but is being continued for the benefit of existing members.
This section provides members with a retirement benefit of one sixtieth or one eightieth depending on chosen member contribution rate of final pensionable earnings for each year of pensionable service.
This section also provides a lump sum death in service benefit and dependants pensions on death in service or following retirement.
For death prior to retirement a spouse civil partners pension of 60% of the members prospective pension is payable.
A lump sum of up to three times the members final pensionable earnings plus a return of the members contributions with interest is also payable.
For death after retirement a spouse civil partners pension of 60% of the members pre-commutation pension is payable.
A lump sum equivalent to the balance of five years pension is payable if death occurs within five years of retirement.
If death occurs after leaving service but before the pension becomes payable i. e. as a deferred pensioner, a spouse civil partners pension of 60% of the accrued deferred pension is payable along with a lump sum equal to the members own contributions with interest.
Childrens pensions are only payable on death in service.
In the case of ill-health retirement only the accrued pension is payable.
All benefits are subject to Plan limits.
Increases to pensions in payment are at the discretion of the Trustee although pensionable service post-1997 is subject to limited price indexation.
For all current Plan members, pensionable earnings are comprised of basic pay, overtime and, prior to 1 October 2006, annual performance bonuses.
No other items of remuneration are taken into account.
From 1 October 2006, sales and profit related bonuses are no longer taken into account and the normal retirement age under the Plan was increased from 60 to 65.
Members contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings, whilst the Company currently makes contributions at the rate of 17.5%.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit sections financial position was undertaken as at 31 March 2008 and concluded that the Plan had a 15% deficit of assets compared with actuarial liabilities.
The deficit in the Plan at 24 January 2009 calculated in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards was 69.1m: further details are given in Note 23 to the financial statements.
Certain members whose accrued or projected pension fund value exceeds their personal lifetime allowance are provided with benefits through an unfunded, unapproved arrangement where they so elect.
The relevant members contribute towards the additional cost of providing these benefits by paying 5% of pensionable earnings into the Plan.
Specific information in respect of executive directors pension entitlements is detailed below.
33 Remuneration Report Service contracts Each of the executive directors has a rolling service contract which is terminable by the Company on giving one years notice.
The Committee will ensure that in the event of any termination payment being made to a director full account will be taken of that directors duty to mitigate any loss and where appropriate the Committee may seek independent professional advice prior to authorising such payment.
Apart from service contracts no director has had any material interest in any contract with the Company or its subsidiaries.
Other benefits Executive directors receive benefits which may include the provision of a fully expensed company car or cash alternative, private medical insurance, annual subscriptions to appropriate professional bodies and staff discount when purchasing the Groups merchandise.
Other employees are also eligible for certain of these benefits.
No executive director currently holds any non-executive directorships outside of the Group.
Non-executive directors Remuneration of the non-executive directors of the Company is determined by the Chairman and the executive directors.
Remuneration consists of a basic fee for services in connection with Board and Board Committee meetings.
Additional fees are paid for the roles of Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, Chairman of the Audit Committee and Senior Independent Non-executive Director.
Letters of appointment for the Chairman and non-executive directors do not contain notice periods, however they are appointed in the expectation that they will serve for a minimum of six years, subject to satisfactory performance and successful reelection at Annual General Meetings.
Non-executive directors receive a discount when purchasing the Groups merchandise but do not participate in any of the Groups bonus, pension, share option or other incentive schemes.

Mr Wolfson was the highest paid director in the current and previous year.
The Company also paid a pension under the unfunded, unapproved arrangement to a former director of the Company of 34,593 2008: 33,754.
Long term incentive plan The total shareholder return of the Company for the three year performance period which matured in January 2008 ranked twelfth in the comparator group of 22 listed retail companies.
As this was below the median position, no award vested.
A further three year performance period of the plan matured in January 2009.
The Companys TSR over this period ranked tenth in the group of 22 other listed retail companies.
Accordingly, an award of 40% of the maximum is expected to vest, which is payable in Next shares or cash at the Companys discretion.
The awards will be settled during 2009 and, based on the share price of 1283p on 23 March 2009, awards to directors would be as follows: January 2009 January 2008 Actual no.

35 Remuneration Report The LTIP performance periods which mature in January 2010 and 2011 and July 2011 respectively are not yet complete and no entitlement has yet been earned.
A charge of 1,669,000 2008: 514,000 has been made in the accounts in respect of the estimate of the amount for awards relating to the year, of which approximately 692,000 2008: 110,000 related to the executive directors.
The directors held the following potential awards over shares under the LTIP for which the performance period was not completed as at 24 January 2009: Maximum no.
Save for the changes noted above to performance conditions for plans commencing after July 2008, there have been no other changes to awards under the LTIP during the year.
Directors pension entitlements All executive directors are members of the defined benefit section of the Next Group Pension Plan.
Directors and some senior managers receive an enhancement from the Plan, increasing the accrual of their retirement benefit up to two thirds of their final pensionable earnings on completion of 20 years pensionable service at age 65.
The lump sum payable on death in service for directors and some senior managers is enhanced to four times pensionable salary.
Pension entitlements of the executive directors who held office during the year are as follows: Change in Transfer value Increase in Age at Years of Accrued accrued of accrued transfer value January pensionable annual annual annual pension less directors 2009 service pension pension 2009 2008 contributions 000 000 000 000 000 S A Wolfson 41 14 234 33 2,393 1,985 374 C E Angelides 45 16 206 21 2,670 2,309 337 D W Keens 55 22 314 20 6,338 5,698 617 A J Varley 58 25 132 128 2,909 5,746 2,850 Years of pensionable service shown above may include bought in service from the transfer of other pension entitlements into the Plan.
Mr Wolfson and Mr Angelides have elected to join the unfunded, unapproved pension arrangement and the accrued annual pension set out above includes their membership of that arrangement.
Mr Varley ceased to contribute to the Plan from 31 October 2008 as part of his divorce arrangements.
At this date he became a deferred pensioner of the Plan and stopped accruing pensionable service.
His pension is therefore no longer linked to salary, but his accrued pension as at 31 October 2008 will instead be increased in line with statutory deferred revaluation.
He remains in the service of, and a director of, Next plc.
As at 31 October 2008 Mr Varley transferred out of the Plan all benefits relating to his pre-6 April 1997 service, except for those which relate to his Guaranteed Minimum Pension entitlement.

The transfer value of Mr Varleys remaining pension entitlement as at 24 January 2009 has been calculated based on his deferred pension and market conditions at that date: this is in line with the approach used for the active members of the Plan.
The transfer value of his deferred pension at 31 October 2008, based on January 2009 market conditions, was 56,000 lower, at 2,853,000, due to his younger age at that date.
