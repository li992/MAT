In previous years, annual bonuses have been uncapped in line with market practice in the banking sector.
Capping Annual bonus paid in cash to be capped at 100% of salary.
annual bonuses will help protect against excessive cash rewards being paid for short-term performance.
Any annual bonus earned over 100% of salary will be deferred into shares for two years.
In previous years, between 50% and 65% of any annual bonus earned over 100% of salary was paid in cash in the year earned and only 35% to 50% of any annual bonus earned over 100% of salary was deferred into shares for two years.
The new proposal will better link short-term bonuses and performance to sustainable longer-term shareholder value by delivering a higher proportion of annual bonuses in deferred shares.

However, last years award was subject to growth, adjusted earnings per share EPS growth and EPS growth and TSR growth relative to comparator strategic performance targets.
The Committee believes that the current performance targets are too heavily weighted towards a narrow set of financial incentives.
In addition, relative TSR provides a poor line of sight for management and may result in significant payouts even if shareholder value has been destroyed.
The Committee is introducing a balanced scorecard of measures that reflect absolute improvements in shareholder value, underlying financial performance and the achievement of our strategic priorities.
This will provide management with a clearer line of sight to value drivers that are within their control and influence.
The Committee also believes that a balanced scorecard is the most effective way of assessing the overall health, success and risks of the business.

The targets for the 2009 LTIP award are: Absolute TSR The Committee chose an absolute TSR measure because it believes management should be rewarded for positive absolute returns in excess of shareholder expected level of return i. e. cost of capital.
The Committee is conscious that absolute TSR could result from general market movements.
However only one third of the award is subject to this measure and is used in balance with other measures of long-term success.
The Committee considered using relative TSR, however, it was deemed not to be an appropriate incentive measure as good relative TSR could still result in negative shareholder returns and employees have less control or influence over a relative TSR.
