qxd:Layout 1 29 5 09 11:52 Page 62 62 Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2009 Directors report Remuneration report The significant change in the economy has impacted not only on the performance of the Company, but also the decisions taken by the Remuneration Committee during the year.
Based on the Companys performance in 2008 09 and current market conditions, no salary increases or annual bonus payments were awarded to executive directors during the year.
Looking ahead, we will continue to ensure pay for performance is central in all our decisions.
For maximum bonus to be earned in 2009 10, executive directors will have to achieve an additional stretch target, which is above that for the rest of the Company, and is approximately 40% greater than the operating plan target.
Furthermore, at least 90% of the operating plan target must be achieved before any bonus payment against individual objectives is made.
This, together with the challenging Performance Share Plan targets, means that the senior remuneration strategy remains highly geared towards share incentive plans, continuing to align executive directors reward to that of shareholders.
