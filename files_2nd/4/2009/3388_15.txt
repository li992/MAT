Business overview Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 39 Directors Remuneration Report This report sets out the information required by the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008.
The Report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and describes how the Board has applied the principles and complied with the provisions relating to directors remuneration in the 2008 Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
As required by the Regulations, the Directors Remuneration Report will be submitted to shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting on 17 March 2010.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on certain parts of the Directors Remuneration Report and to state whether, in their opinion, those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Accounting Regulations.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for the audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION Remuneration Committee During the year under review the Remuneration Committee comprised: Mr I F R Much Committee Chairman Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss The Rt Hon Lord Freeman Mr K C Scobie resigned 25 March 2009 The Committees principal responsibilities are: determining, agreeing with the Board and reviewing from time to time the overall policy for the remuneration of the Chairman, the executive directors, the Company Secretary and certain other senior executives in the Group, and their individual remuneration packages and any changes thereto: approving the terms and conditions of employment, and any changes thereto, of the executive directors: approving any compensation payments for executive directors: approving the design of, and determining targets for, any performance-related pay schemes operated by the Group: reviewing the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and the Companys shareholders: providing oversight of potential remuneration-related risks arising across the Group: and overseeing any major changes in employee benefits structures across the Group.
None of the Committee members has any personal financial interest in the matters reserved for the Committee nor do they have any conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships, and they are not involved in the day to day running of the Groups business.
Therefore, they are regarded by the Board as independent.
The Committee met six times during the year.
The Chairman and Chief Executive attend meetings by invitation but are not present during any discussions relating to their own remuneration.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Companys website or on request from the Company Secretary.
Advisers During the year the Committee received advice on remuneration matters from Hewitt New Bridge Street.
The Committee also consults internally with the Chief Executive and the Company Secretary.
Remuneration policy for executive directors The Committees policy is to provide executive remuneration packages which are competitive, but not excessive, by reference to market rates across comparator companies, reflect the performance of the business against financial objectives, and which take into account the individual contribution and performance of each executive director.
Remuneration packages comprise the following elements: i base salary and benefits, including pensions: ii annual bonuses linked to the Groups financial performance: and iii awards of share-based incentives linked to the long term growth of the Group.
The Committee aims to align the interests of executive directors with those of shareholders, by ensuring that a significant proportion of remuneration is performance-related.
This is achieved through the performance-related elements of annual bonuses and share-based incentives.
Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2009 40 Corporate governance Directors Remuneration Report continued Key decisions reached by the Committee during the year in relation to ongoing remuneration arrangements for the executive directors are summarised below.
Base salary: The Committee considered, in particular, the performance of the Group, the prevailing economic conditions and the need to maintain market competitive salary levels.
Against this background, base salary increases for the executive directors were limited to 5% with effect from 1 April 2009.
Pension provision: The Committee has agreed that with effect from 1 April 2010, the executive directors will cease to participate in the Groups defined benefit pension scheme, and will instead, for all future service, receive a salary supplement of 20% of base salary.
Whilst these levels of contributions enhance the short-term fixed costs to the Company relative to the existing defined benefit pension arrangements, there is clearly an advantageous and offsetting transfer of investment risk to the individuals.
As a result of these two changes, the overall level of fixed pay for the executive directors in the forthcoming year will be closer to, but still below, the median of the market benchmarks used by the Committee benchmarks which take into account both market capitalisation and turnover, and which have therefore increased less for the Group than would have arisen if based solely on market capitalisation.
Annual bonus: Executive directors will be required to receive 40% of any bonus earned in 2010 in the form of deferred shares an increase from 25% in 2009.
All other key aspects of the bonus scheme remain unchanged.
Share awards: Subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting, share awards worth at grant up to 125% of base salary will be granted to the executive directors in 2010 within an increased normal annual award limit of 150% of salary.
Awards will continue to be subject to highly challenging earnings per share growth targets.
More details on each of these changes are outlined below.
Comparator groups The constituents of the sector-based comparator group utilised by the Committee for remuneration benchmarking purposes during the year were as follows: Charter International plc Rotork PLC Chloride Group PLC Spectris plc Halma p. l. c. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc IMI plc Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Meggitt PLC VT Group plc Melrose PLC The Weir Group PLC QinetiQ Group PLC The Committee also considered general comparator groups based on FTSE 250 companies with a similar market capitalisation and turnover.
Base salaries and benefits The executive directors base salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee, and adjustments made, if appropriate, taking into account individual performance and comparable salary levels in the comparator groups set out above.
The Committee refers to published salary surveys and data provided by its remuneration advisers, Hewitt New Bridge Street, and also reviews the remuneration information presented in the annual reports of companies in the comparator groups.
The executive directors current base salaries are as follows: Dr D J Price 420,000 2008: 400,000 Mr P A Rayner 262,500 2008: 250,000 The executive directors base salaries will next be reviewed on 1 April 2010.
The Committee also considers and approves the base salaries for nineteen other senior executives, and reviews salaries for the next tier of management at each of the Groups businesses.
The Committee therefore has due regard for salary levels across the Group in applying its remuneration policy.
The main taxable benefits for executive directors are fully-expensed company cars and private medical insurance.
Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2009 Business overview Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 41 Annual bonuses During the year under review, the Company operated an annual performance-related bonus plan for the executive directors, with key characteristics as follows: a maximum bonus potential for the executive directors of 100% of base salary: three quarters of the bonus potential linked to two separate financial performance conditions, namely earnings per share and cash flow with equal weighting.
The conditions, which are set by the Committee, take into account a number of factors including budget, market expectations, long term growth prospects and the previous years out-turn.
No bonus is payable for achievement of less than 90% of target, with bonuses being earned thereafter on a straight-line basis up to the maximum for 110% or better achievement of target: one quarter of the bonus potential may be achieved in connection with the satisfaction of personal objective criteria set at the beginning of the financial year.
These comprise a mixture of short term and longer term objectives linked to the delivery of the Companys strategic plan.
No part of this element of bonus is payable unless threshold performance of both the financial conditions described above is achieved.
The personal objectives set for the executive directors during the year were linked to the following strategic objectives: growth of the Groups order book, and development of the Groups sales and marketing capabilities: formation of the new International Division, and establishment of joint ventures: delivery of margin improvements and increased cash flow generation: management of capital projects: improvements in the Groups environmental performance: and strengthening of the Groups balance sheet: one quarter of any bonus payable is deferred as a conditional award of the Companys shares, with vesting subject to continued employment save in good leaver scenarios three years from the award of bonus: and the payment of any bonus remains ultimately at the discretion of the Committee.
The table below summarises the bonuses earned by the executive directors, as a percentage of base salary, in respect of the current and last years the figures in brackets are the maximum percentages that could have been achieved : 2009 2008 Bonus percentage received for: D J Price P A Rayner D J Price P A Rayner Earnings per share performance 35.63 37.5 35.63 37.5 19.1 22.5 19.1 22.5 Cash flow performance 37.5 37.5 37.5 37.5 22.5 22.5 22.5 22.5 Achievement of personal objectives 21.0 25.0 21.25 25.0 10.5 15.0 12.7 15.0 Total 94.13 100.0 94.38 100.0 52.1 60.0 54.3 60.0 The Committee continues to set highly challenging bonus targets for the achievement of maximum bonuses.
Despite the outstanding levels of EPS growth and returns to shareholders delivered by the Group in recent years, the executive directors have not received maximum bonuses in any of the last four years as evidenced by the chart below.
Year 2009 2008 2007 2006 1 Growth in underlying EPS 33% 43% 56% 53% Return to shareholders in year 70% -23% 41% 145% Executive D J Price P A Rayner D J Price P A Rayner D J Price P A Rayner D J Price P A Rayner Maximum bonus potential % of salary 100% 60% 60% 60% Bonus paid % of salary 94.13% 94.38% 52.1% 54.3% 46.1% 44.6% 58.5% 58.5% 1 Source: Statutory accounts for the years ended 31 October 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006 The basic structure of the bonus scheme will remain unchanged for the current financial year, namely with a maximum bonus potential of 100% of base salary.
However, in order to reflect emerging best practice, the proportion of any bonus earned by the executive directors to be satisfied by the award of deferred shares will increase from 25% to 40%.
Bonuses will continue to be determined by a mixture of earnings per share, cash flow and personal objectives.
Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2009 42 Corporate governance Directors Remuneration Report continued Long term incentives Performance share plan The Company operates the Chemring Group Performance Share Plan for the executive directors and other key members of the senior management team who influence the performance and prospects of the Group.
The key features of the plan are currently as follows: conditional awards can be made of the Companys shares worth no more than 100% of base salary each year: awards will vest three years after grant subject to the extent to which a demanding performance condition has been achieved over a single three year performance period with no ability to re-test the performance condition.
The performance condition is based on the growth of the Companys earnings per share in excess of RPI over three consecutive financial years.
The Committee considers an earnings per share condition to most closely align the interests of participants with those of the Companys shareholders: the vesting schedules for awards granted to date are as follows: Total earnings per share growth per annum not compounded over three financial years Threshold vesting Full vesting Awards made prior to 23 January 2007 RPI 5% 33% vests RPI 15% Awards made on 24 January 2007 RPI 7.5% 33% vests RPI 20% Awards made on or after 23 January 2008 RPI 10% 25% vests RPI 30% No shares vest for growth below the threshold vesting target.
Vesting is calculated on a straight-line basis for growth between the threshold and full vesting targets: earnings per share is calculated on a fully diluted and normalised basis, as specified by the Committee prior to grant: and market purchase shares or new issue shares including treasury shares may be used to satisfy awards.
To the extent that new issue shares or treasury shares are used, these will count towards the usual share usage dilution limits 10% in ten years for all schemes and 5% in ten years for discretionary executive schemes.
Participation in the plan is extended at the discretion of the Committee to the executive directors and senior management of the Group, both in the UK and overseas.
The following awards were made under the plan during the year: Total number of Number of participants Date of award shares awarded receiving awards 21 January 2009 150,404 31 24 June 2009 12,653 3 Total 163,057 34 Details of the awards made to executive directors during the year are set out on page 46.
The Committee remains committed to ensuring that it offers a suitably attractive pay package to its senior executives, aligned to shareholders interests through the use of significant levels of potential variable pay triggered by exceptional levels of performance.
The performance share plan was originally introduced when the Company was a Small Cap company and the maximum award level was set accordingly.
As an established FTSE 250 company, the existing maximum award of 100% of base salary is now below market norms, and the Board will therefore be seeking shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting on 17 March 2010 for an increase in the potential maximum level of future awards under the plan as follows: in normal circumstances, to permit maximum awards over shares worth up to 150% of base salary for an individual: and in exceptional circumstances, such as on recruitment, to permit maximum awards over shares worth up to 200% of base salary.
If these changes are approved, the initial grant policy will be for no awards worth more than 125% of base salary to be made in normal circumstances.
Any proposed change from this policy in future years will be disclosed by the Committee in the Directors Remuneration Report.
Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2009 Business overview Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 43 In considering the performance condition for awards which will be made in 2010, the Committee has considered the forward prospects for the defence industry around the world in the context of possible tightening of Government budgets caused by the recent financial crisis, whilst acknowledging that the outlook for the Group remains good.
As a consequence, it is intended that the target for full vesting of awards worth up to 100% of salary will reduce marginally to RPI 25%.
However, the Committee will continue to use a target of RPI 30% for full vesting of any award made above the existing 100% of base salary limit.
The following vesting schedule will therefore apply for awards made in 2010: Total earnings per share growth per annum Percentage of the total number of shares not compounded over three financial years under an award that vest Less than RPI 10% Nil RPI 10% 25% RPI 25% 100% for awards of up to 100% of base salary RPI 30% 100% for awards of up to 125% of base salary These targets remain among the most demanding performance criteria anywhere and reflect the Committees ongoing commitment to setting appropriately challenging targets for executives to pursue.
The Committee reviews, from time to time, the basis of the performance condition but continues to believe that the earnings per share metric mostly closely aligns the interests of executives and shareholders, and therefore remains an appropriate metric for the Group.
During the year under review, the Company purchased 78,301 2008: 160,000 treasury shares at a cost of 1.5 million for use in the plan.
115,170 shares were transferred from treasury to participants in the plan during the year on vesting of the award made on 23 March 2006.
The executive directors are expected to build-up, over a five year period following appointment, and maintain a shareholding in the Company equivalent to one years base salary.
Both of the executive directors currently hold shares significantly in excess of this requirement.
Other participants in the plan are expected to retain a shareholding equivalent to 25% of their basic salary following vesting of the awards.
Other schemes The Company operates all-employee savings-related share schemes in the UK the Chemring Group 2008 Sharesave Plan and the USA the Chemring Group 2008 US Stock Purchase Plan.
There are no performance criteria for these arrangements, and options are issued to all participants in accordance with UK HM Revenue and Customs and US Internal Revenue Service regulations.
The Company previously operated a long term incentive scheme known as the Chemring Group PLC Share Based Incentive Scheme.
This scheme is not being utilised at present.
The Company complies with the dilution guidelines contained within Executive Remuneration ABI Guidelines on Policies and Practices.
At 31 October 2009, awards outstanding and issued under all share schemes during the previous ten years amounted to 3.43% of the ordinary share capital of the Company.
At 31 October 2009, awards outstanding and issued under executive share schemes during the previous ten years amounted to 3.17% of the ordinary share capital of the Company.
Performance graph The following graph shows a comparison of the Companys total shareholder return TSR over the last five financial years against a broad equity market index, as required by the Regulations.
The FTSE 250 Index has been selected by the Committee for this comparison because it provides the most appropriate measure of performance of listed companies of a similar size to the Company.
The other points plotted are the values at intervening financial year ends.
Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2009 Value 44 Corporate governance Directors Remuneration Report continued Pensions Dr Price is currently a member of the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme the Staff Scheme.
This is an approved final salary scheme, which is contracted out of the State Second Pension, and which provides, at retirement, a pension of up to two-thirds of salary, subject to Inland Revenue limits.
The Staff Scheme also provides life assurance cover, dependants pensions and lump sum payments on death-in-service.
Members of the Staff Scheme are required to make monthly contributions to the scheme at the rate of 8% of pensionable salary.
Dr Prices pension under the Staff Scheme accrues at 1 80th of final pensionable salary for each year of membership, and he also accrues a cash lump sum at 3 80ths of final pensionable salary for each year of membership.
On death-in-service, Dr Prices dependants would receive a lump sum payment of two times base salary and, in addition, a 50% spouses pension would be payable.
Dr Price is subject to an earnings cap equivalent to the cap applied by HM Revenue and Customs prior to April 2006 in respect of his membership of the Staff Scheme.
Mr Rayner was a member of the Chemring Group Executive Pension Scheme until it merged with the Staff Scheme on 6 April 2009, at which time he became a member of the Staff Scheme.
Mr Rayners benefits under the Staff Scheme accrue in an identical manner to that in which Dr Price accrues benefits under the Staff Scheme, as set out above, save that Mr Rayner is not contracted out of the State Second Pension and a two-thirds spouses pension is payable in respect of his service accrued to 31 January 2004, reducing to 50% for service accrued thereafter.
Mr Rayner is also subject to an earnings cap.
Both Dr Price and Mr Rayner have a normal retirement age of 65.
The Committee has previously referred to the fact that the current pension arrangements for the executive directors under the Staff Scheme 1 80ths accrual rate only as far as the notional earnings cap are well below market norms, and as explained above, this is a contributory factor in the relatively low level of their overall fixed pay.
The Committee has therefore agreed that with effect from 1 April 2010, the executive directors will cease to participate in the Staff Scheme, and will instead, for all future service, receive a salary supplement of 20% of base salary.
Service contracts Dr Price has a rolling service contract dated 4 April 2005.
This provides for termination by either party on twelve months notice.
The Company may however terminate without notice, and make a payment in lieu of notice equal to the sum of the salary due for the unexpired notice period plus the fair value of any contractual benefits.
Any such sum may be paid in instalments, and in these circumstances there is a requirement to mitigate loss.
Mr Rayner has a rolling service contract dated 27 August 1999.
The Company may however terminate without notice and make a payment in lieu of notice equal to the sum of twelve months salary plus the value of any contractual benefits.
There are no other provisions relating to compensation on early termination.
It is the Committees general policy that all new executive directors appointed in the future will have service contracts with the Company which are terminable on a maximum of twelve months notice.
The service contracts will contain provisions permitting the Company to make any termination payments by instalments, and will require directors to mitigate their loss in such circumstances.
Policy on outside appointments With the specific approval of the Board in each case, executive directors may accept external appointments as non-executive directors of other companies, provided that they do not detract from their responsibilities to the Group, and may retain any related fees paid to them.
Neither of the executive directors currently holds any such external appointments.
Nonexecutive directors Mr Scobie has a service contract with the Company which will expire at the conclusion of the Companys Annual General Meeting in March 2010.
The Board has previously announced that it has commenced the search for Mr Scobies successor when he retires, and his current contract will therefore be extended on a rolling-basis until a successor is appointed.
Mr Scobies remuneration under the contract, part of which is paid to his company for consultancy services, is 131,250 per annum.
He is required to devote such time to his role as is reasonably necessary for the proper performance of his duties.
Mr Evans, The Rt Hon Lord Freeman, Mr Much and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss have letters of appointment covering, amongst other items, their terms of appointment and expected time commitment.
These letters of appointment provide for three year appointments, unless terminated earlier by and at the discretion of either party upon three months written notice.
The Rt Hon Lord Freeman, Mr Much and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss are currently serving their second three year terms as non-executive directors, which will expire on 25 May 2012, 30 November 2010 and 30 April 2010 respectively.
Mr Evans current three year appointment as a non-executive director will terminate on 30 March 2012.
The basic fee payable to each of the four non-executive directors is 42,000 per annum.
The Rt Hon Lord Freeman and Mr Much each receive an additional fee of 7,000 per annum, in respect of their Chairmanship of the Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee respectively.
During the year Mr Much was appointed as the Senior Independent Director but he receives no additional fee for this role.
Fees for the non-executive directors are determined annually by the Board, having regard to the practice of other companies and the particular demands of the Group.
The Company provides private medical insurance for Mr Scobie, Mr Evans and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss, and their respective spouses.
The non-executive directors do not participate in the Companys pension, bonus or share-based incentive schemes.
However, Mr Evans does receive a pension from the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme, which he accrued during his former employment with the Company.
