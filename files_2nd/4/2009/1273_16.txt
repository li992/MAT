Membership of the remuneration committee Membership of the committee comprises exclusively non-executive directors of the company all of whom with the exception of Sir Richard Broadbent only by reason of his chairmanship of the Board are considered to be independent.
The committee is chaired by Nick Buckles and the other members are Angie Risley, Simon Batey and Sir Richard Broadbent.
With the exception of Angie Risley, whose membership of the committee commenced on 22 April 2009, all members served on the committee for the year under review.
The committee met six times during the year: details of each members attendance record are disclosed in the Board and Board committee attendance table which appears on page 99 in the corporate governance report.
Committee meetings are also attended by the chief executive except for those items relating to any aspect of his remuneration and on occasions by Alison OConnor, director - human resources.
The company secretary acts as secretary to the committee.
Remit of the committee The remuneration committee is responsible for all aspects of remuneration as they affect the executive directors and the most senior level of management below the Board.
Detailed terms of reference, which appear on the companys website, www.
co. uk, are well established and are periodically reviewed and amended as necessary.
During the year the company received independent advice and support from Towers Watson.
The key responsibilities of the committee are: a Determining and agreeing with the Board and keeping under review a remuneration policy for both directors and senior management.
b On the basis of proposals put forward by the chief executive, having consulted the chairman, determine the remuneration packages of the executive directors, and all others where the total remuneration package including pension and bonus exceeds a value to be determined by the Board from to time: consider any proposals for the introduction of new pension arrangements, including the termination of any existing material arrangement, and make recommendations to the Board.
c Agreeing targets and benefits in respect of any executive performance related pay scheme having due regard to the interests and expectations of the shareholders and ensuring that targets set are sufficiently challenging and that the rewards represent a fair and highly motivating incentive and are commensurate with industry peer pay comparator group practice.

i Approving the directors remuneration report for subsequent approval by the Board.
Remuneration policy It is the responsibility of the remuneration committee to set the remuneration of the executive directors and senior executives in accordance with the broad policy established by the Board.
The main thrust of the Boards remuneration policy is to establish and operate a compensation framework which is conducive to the recruitment and retention of high calibre directors and senior managers for the benefit of the companys shareholders.
Considerable emphasis is placed on performance-driven compensation where targets are aligned with the companys strategic objectives and targeted shareholder returns.
In setting the framework for remuneration the committee has regard to the pay levels and structures operating within FTSE 250 companies from the transport and other sectors which comprise the peer pay comparator group established by the committee.
Reference is also made by the committee to pay arrangements operating within its UK-based direct competitors.
Remuneration review As reported last year the committee had concluded, following an extensive review based upon independent advice from Towers Watson, that basic salary levels for its executive directors were materially out of line with the base salary levels at peer group companies whether broadly or narrowly defined.
It concluded at that time that The committee is clear that it is not in the interests of the company to continue indefinitely paying salaries to its senior executives that are well below the median of its competitors and its peer group.
It intends therefore as a matter of policy to seek to close the gap that has developed as quickly as possible.
The committee determined, after consultation with shareholders and mindful of the need to strike a balance between internal priorities and the general economic climate, to approve only modest increases in base salaries.
In considering the pay review for 2010 the committee remains mindful of the continuing difficult economic conditions and the general level of interest and concern over executive salaries.
Taking this, as well as the continuing mismatch of salaries into account, the committee concluded that it would again be appropriate to implement modest increases in the base salaries of the executive directors with effect from 1 January 2010 as follows: Base salary Increase Base salary 1 Jan 2009 1 Jan 2010 David Martin 494,000 4% 514,000 Steve Lonsdale 328,000 4% 341,100 Steve Clayton retired 22 April 2009 288,000 N A N A It does however continue to be the committees objective to ensure that executive salaries are aligned as quickly as possible with the median position within the companys peer pay comparator group, as indicated in last years remuneration report.
Remuneration structure a Base salary Each of the executive directors is paid a basic annual salary which is reviewed on 1 January each year.
The salaries of the executive directors were increased effective from 1 January 2010 as detailed in section 4 above.
b Performance-related bonus Each of the executive directors has the opportunity to earn additional remuneration under a performance-related bonus scheme: this opportunity is capped at a maximum bonus of 100 per cent of base annual salary.
Of the bonus potential, 70 per cent is driven by group financial performance and 30 per cent by personal performance against a number of qualitative objectives agreed with each director at the beginning of each year.
With regard to the financial performance element, the structure for 2009 was as follows: i Earnings before interest and tax EBIT maximum of 50% of base salary Bonus as % of base salary at 1 January 2009 160m 0 180m 20 210m 50 ii Earnings per share EPS maximum of 20% of base salary Bonus as % of base salary at 1 January 2009 48p 0 53p 8 61.5p 20 EPS excludes goodwill impairment, intangible asset amortisation and exceptional items.
EBIT includes the contributions from associate companies but excludes unbudgeted acquisitions and exchange rate movements.
The qualitative element continues to focus on specific aspects of strategy including financing, rapid response to adverse market conditions, pensions, property and the continued development of a high calibre management team supported by a robust succession plan.
On the basis of the definitions above, adjusted EBIT for the year ended 31 December 2009 was 163.1 million and adjusted EPS for the year was 57.6 pence.
This, together with the performance of the directors against their personal performance targets gave rise to bonus payments as follows: 2009 2008 David Martin 222,794 375,360 Steve Lonsdale 140,000 239,300 Steve Clayton retired on 22 April 2009 and was paid a bonus of 48,960 in respect of 2009 2008: 209,200.
The non-executive directors do not participate in the performance-related bonus scheme.
90 | Arriva plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Directors statements Directors statements c Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP is a share-based plan and comprises a conditional award of shares of a value equivalent of 200 per cent of the executive directors basic salary as at 1 January preceding the date of an award: awards are normally made each March following the announcement of the groups preliminary results for the preceding financial year.
Awards comprise a blend of two elements with each element providing the opportunity for each executive director to earn up to one half of the conditional share award.
Each element operates as follows: i Total Shareholder Return element TSR This element provides the opportunity to earn up to one half of the initial total conditional award and is based on the groups TSR performance when ranked against the TSR performance of those companies comprising a peer comparator group.
For this purpose the peer comparator group consists of companies excluding the company and investment companies whose shares comprise the FTSE 250 at the beginning of each three-year measurement period.
Performance is measured over three consecutive financial years 1 January 31 December, the first year of the measurement period being the year in which the conditional share award is made.
In order for shares to vest under this element, the TSR performance of the group must achieve, as a minimum, the median TSR performance of the peer comparator group: achievement of the median position will generate the vesting of 25 per cent of this element of the award, and this will increaseon a linear basis to 100 per cent of this element on the achievement of upper quartile performance.
The TSR performance is independently calculated and verified by Alithos Limited.
ii The EPS element This element also provides the opportunity to earn up to one half of the initial conditional award: vesting of the shares is on a linear scale with 10 per cent vesting if EPS increases to a level which is four per cent per annum in excess of the increase in the Retail Price Index RPI over the three-year measurement period: vesting will increase on a linear scale to a maximum of 100 per cent of this element on EPS performance achieving or exceeding 13 per cent per annum in excess of the growth in RPI.
The vesting of the shares conditionally awarded in 2007 had as the performance measurement period the three years ended 31 December 2009.
The TSR over the period did not achieve the threshold for vesting and therefore this element of the award lapsed with no benefit arising.
With regard to the EPS element of the conditional award, EPS for the year ended 31 December 2009 was 58.8 pence compared with EPS for the year ended 31 December 2006 of 44.4 pence, an annualised increase of 9.82 per cent.
The annualised growth in RPI over the same three year period was 2.46 per cent, resulting in a vesting of this element of the conditional award of 43.6 per cent.
Year of award Performance measurement period Vested 2003 3 years ended 31 December 2005 March 2006 2004 3 years ended 31 December 2006 March 2007 2005 3 years ended 31 December 2007 No vesting 2006 3 years ended 31 December 2008 March 2009 2007 3 years ended 31 December 2009 March 2010 2.
For awards made before 2006 vesting was dependent on the performance of the groups EPS when compared with the growth in RPI and also the TSR of the group when compared to that of a peer comparator group comprising the constituent companies of the FTSE 250 excluding the company and investment companies.
The degree of vesting was on a sliding scale of 25 per cent to 100 per cent with no shares vesting unless the companys TSR was at least equal to the median TSR of the peer comparator group.
However, irrespective of TSR performance, vesting of the awards in any event was subject to the growth in the companys EPS exceeding the growth in RPI by at least six per cent over the measurement period.
For awards made in 2006 and subsequently, the performance targets have been separated into two distinct elements, TSR and EPS, with both elements capable of delivering vesting of up to 50 per cent of the total award without being subject to mutual dependency.
The company operates share retention guidelines which require each executive director to retain 50 per cent of any vested shares until such time as a holding equivalent in value to basic annual salary has been achieved.
The non-executive directors do not participate and have not participated in the LTIP.
Changes in the interests of the executive directors in conditional share awards made under the LTIP in the year ended 31 December 2009 were as follows: Movement in conditionally awarded shares audited information Balance Not at Awards subsisting at vested 31 Dec 1 January 2009 Awarded during year Vested during year in year 2009 Share Share price at price at Value of date of date of shares at No.
d Share option schemes None of the executive directors has any residual interest in the companys share option schemes.
The non-executive directors do not participate and have not participated in any of the companys share option schemes.
Benefits in kind for each director comprise a company car and or car allowance, fuel, medical insurance and telephone costs.
A pension of 5,000 2008: 5,000 was paid to a former director.
The fees payable to the non-executive directors comprise a basic fee and an additional fee to recognise specific further responsibilities, such as Board committee chairmanship.

Under the terms of the articles of association the fees payable to the non-executive directors are limited to 400,000 per annum in the aggregate: this level was established following approval by the shareholders at the AGM held on 23 April 2004, and the articles permit the directors to increase this cap annually in line with the increase in the index of UK wage inflation.
93 Directors remuneration report continued As at December 2009, in accordance with the indexation provisions, the cap on the aggregate level of non-executive directors fees was 477,560.
Subject to shareholders approval of the revised articles of association at the AGM to be held on 6 May 2010, it is proposed that this cap be increased to 500,000, again subject to annual inflation indexation.
Each non-executive director has been appointed for a fixed-term not exceeding three years and, following the implementation of the Companies Act 2006, those appointments are normally renewable, with the agreement of both parties, for a term of appointment of three years, subject to six months notice from either the company or the director.

94 | Arriva plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Directors statements Directors statements With effect from 1 December 2009 a change to the future pension accrual terms under the Arriva Passenger Services Pension Plan the Plan, of which David Martin is an active member, was implemented.
The change introduced a freezing of pensionable salary for all active members for a period of four years to be followed by the capping of future pensionable salary increases to a maximum of one per cent per annum.
The capping of pensionable salary will continue until the technical provisions deficit under the Plan is certified by the actuary to have been eliminated.
David Martin has the opportunity to elect to take an annual cash sum, paid monthly in arrears on a basis that is cost neutral to the company, in lieu of any future pension accrual.
No future executive director external appointees to the Board will be eligible for a final salary-based pension arrangement, but instead will receive a cash contribution equal to 25 per cent of basic salary.
h Service contracts Each of the executive directors has a service contract dated 19 April 2006: the contracts are subject to 12 months notice from the company and six months notice from the director.
Each contract contains covenants restricting the ability of the director, within a period of six months from termination, from competing with the company.
The contracts make specific provision with regard to termination payments which are quantified as the sum of: i The directors basic pay at the date of termination: ii The amount of bonus estimated to be payable in respect of the year in which notice is served, but in any event capped at a maximum of 40 per cent of basic pay: and iii The value of the benefits in kind.
Additionally, in the case of termination by the company, the company will seek to procure that the director is credited with an additional 12 months service in his respective pension scheme.
Should the director terminate the contract within six months of a change of control of the company he will receive a termination payment equal to 50 per cent of the termination payment described above.
i External Board appointments The Board generally supports executive directors accepting one appointment outside the company.
Before accepting such appointments the director s involved must receive the prior approval of the Board.
In considering such cases the Board will always satisfy itself that such appointments will not detract from the executive directors expected contribution to the company, nor that such appointment will create any conflict of interest: any fees earned by an executive director in such a capacity will be assigned to the company.
Neither of the executive directors currently holds an external directorship appointment.
