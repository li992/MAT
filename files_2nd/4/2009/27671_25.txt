The figures included in the sections of this report headed Directors Emoluments for 2008 and 2009 on page 168 and Directors interests under employee share plans on page 175 have been audited by KPMG Audit Plc as required by the Large & Mediumsized Companies and Groups Accounts & Reports Regulations 2008.

Remuneration Committee The Committee is a committee of the Board.
Its full terms of reference are published on the Companys website.
The Committee is responsible for: Determining the remuneration, incentive arrangements, benefits and any compensation payments of the executive directors Determining the remuneration of the Chairman of the Board Monitoring and approving the level and structure of remuneration of the executive directors of the Company and its principal operating subsidiaries, the Group Company Secretary, senior executive employees as identified by the Board, those who perform a significant influence function or whose activities have, or could have, a material impact on the risk profile of the Company or as defined for compliance with regulations collectively Senior Employees in accordance with the policy Reviewing, monitoring and approving, or recommending for approval, the Companys share incentive arrangements and awards.
Remuneration policy for executive directors The Company embraces the principles of the Combined Code relating to directors remuneration and complies with its provisions.
These are the guiding principles that the Committee has applied during 2009 and intends to continue to apply: To take account of appropriate benchmarks, while using such comparisons with caution and recognising the risk of an upward ratchet of remuneration levels with no corresponding improvement in performance.
Members of the UK FTSE100 Index provide the benchmark for UK based executive directors, with particular reference to subsets of that data within the financial sector and by market capitalisation To be sensitive in determining, reviewing, monitoring and approving matters under its remit in relation to pay and employment conditions around the Group where relevant To make a significant percentage of total maximum potential rewards in the form of sharebased incentives, to align the executive directors interests closely with those of shareholders To provide an opportunity for remuneration packages to be in the upper quartile of the comparator group through payments under shortterm and longterm incentive schemes if superior performance is delivered To focus attention on the main drivers of shareholder value by linking performancerelated remuneration to clearly defined objectives and measurable targets To design remuneration arrangements that will attract, retain and motivate individuals of the exceptional calibre needed to lead the Groups development.
The Committees policy is influenced by the need to be competitive with other international financial services groups, while avoiding any excess.
This includes its approach to setting the fixed elements of remuneration at or below appropriate median levels.
It has reviewed this policy and considers it to be appropriate.
The Committee has discretion to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance ESG issues when setting the remuneration of executive directors and senior management.
It aims to ensure that the incentive structures for executive directors and senior management do not raise ESG risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
It also takes cognisance of the FSA Remuneration Code and the Walker Review recommendations insofar as applicable to insurance groups.
Wherever it considers appropriate, the Committee seeks the views of institutional investors on any significant changes to remuneration structures applicable to the executive directors or affecting the Companys share incentive arrangements.
Membership of the Committee The following independent nonexecutive directors served on the Committee during the year: Name of nonexecutive director Position Period on the Committee Rudi Bogni Chairman May 2005 to date Nigel Andrews Member November 2002 to date Russell Edey Member June 2007 to date Richard Pym Member May 2008 to date The Committee renewed the appointment of Alan Judes as its independent adviser for 2009, through his consultancy Strategic Remuneration.
A copy of his letter of engagement is on the Companys website.
Any work that the Company wishes Alan Judes to do on its behalf, rather than for the Committee, is precleared with the Committee Chairman with a view to avoiding conflicts of interest.
Work undertaken for the Committee includes attending meetings of the Committee and advising the Committee in connection Old Mutual plc Old Mutual plc 16 163 3 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Shareholder information Financials Governance Risk and Responsibility Business review Management statements Fast read GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUEd with benchmarking of the total reward package for executive directors and other senior members of staff, the design of shortterm incentive and longterm incentive arrangements, valuation of share options, updating the Committee on trends in compensation and governance matters and accompanying the Chairman of the Committee at meetings with shareholder representatives to discuss proposed remuneration structures.

Fees for 2009 amounted to 72,000 excluding VAT of which 20,000 excluding VAT, was in respect of the services provided to the Company.
Don Schneider and Kevin Stacey of Group HR assisted the Committee during the year.
Group HR provides supporting materials for matters that come before the Committee, including comparative data and justifications for proposed salary, benefit, bonus and share awards and criteria for performance targets and appraisals against those targets.
It uses the services of external advisers as necessary.
The Committee Chairman has access to and regular contact with Group HR independently of the executive directors.
During 2009, the Committee met five times.
The Board accepted the recommendations made by the Committee during the year without amendment.
The Committee meetings were also attended by the Group Chief Executive other than when his own remuneration was being discussed, Kevin Stacey and Chris Collins, the then Chairman of the Board.
Don Schneider also attended all meetings following his appointment as HR Director.
The Group Company Secretary, Martin Murray, acted as Secretary to the Committee.
The Management Remuneration Committee MRC The MRC oversees executive remuneration governance at the tiers immediately below director and Group Executive Committee level provided such executives fall outside the designated group of employees reviewed individually under the Committees terms of reference.
The MRC approves remuneration arrangements and pay review decisions recommended by subsidiary remuneration committees.
It is chaired by the Group Chief Executive and comprises three members of the Group Executive Committee, including the Group Finance Director.
It is supported by Group HR, which supplies supporting materials and analysis in a similar format to those supplied to the Committee.
All minutes of MRC meetings are noted at the Committee and the MRC can escalate matters for decision by the Committee as appropriate.
The MRC has adopted the following detailed remuneration principles to ensure that the principles agreed by the Committee are properly implemented at the Groups main subsidiaries: Principles adopted by the MRC are that remuneration must be: Viewed in conjunction with wider people management practices to support a consistent approach to achieving desired culture and behaviour Performancerelated and linked to delivery against valuecreating objectives Benchmarked to reliable and relevant market data specific to each region and sector.
In addition: Remuneration design should be considered a key business competence and resourced accordingly Incentive payments must be based on performance measures that account adequately for the risks taken in producing the profits Incentives must be based on objectives that reward the creation of a sustainable business and longterm value creation and should not be prejudiced by shortterm objectives Deferrals should be linked to the realised profitability of the business on which the incentive is based Uncapped incentive arrangements will only be agreed if: Funding of awards for bonus and longterm incentive awards is an acceptable percentage of the profit: and Bonus pools have not been struck above the level at which cost and risk can be allocated Individual performance objectives aligned to business plans, and individual performance ratings, must be agreed annually Underperformance should be dealt with formally according to local policies.
Alignment with strategy and shareholders The graph at the top of the next page shows the total shareholder return to 1 January 2010 on 100 invested in shares in Old Mutual plc on 1 January 2005 compared with 100 invested in the FTSE100 Index.
The other points are the comparative returns at the intervening financial year ends.
In the opinion of the directors, the FTSE100 Index is the most appropriate index against which to measure the Companys total shareholder return, as it is an index of which Old Mutual plc is a member and is located where the Company has its primary listing.
In reviewing performance, the Board and the Committee also consider a variety of other sectorspecific comparators.

The terms of these are considered by the Committee to provide a proper balance of responsibilities and security between the parties.
The Companys policy is to fix notice periods for executive directors at a maximum of 12 months.
Compensation for loss of office is tailored to reflect the Companys contractual obligations and the obligation on the part of the employee to mitigate loss.
The Company can terminate the service contracts of the two executive directors, Julian Roberts and Philip Broadley, on 12 months notice.
Their current contracts are dated 23 January 2009 and 10 November 2008 respectively.
If not terminated earlier, these contracts may continue until the directors attain the age of 65 7 June 2022 for Julian Roberts and 31 January 2026 for Philip Broadley.
Neither Julian Roberts nor Philip Broadleys contracts contain any provisions quantifying compensation payable on early termination.
Executive directors remuneration during 2009 The Committee reviews the structure of the executive directors remuneration packages annually to satisfy itself that the balance between fixed and variable remuneration and shortterm and longterm incentives and rewards remains appropriate.
The overall makeup of the remuneration packages for the executive directors in 2009 was as follows: Julian Roberts, Group Chief Executive Element Quantum Additional information Basic salary 830,000 Paid monthly in cash.
Reviewed with effect from 1 January each year, taking into account market benchmarks.

The shortterm incentive for 2009 was based on achievement of Group financial targets, as well as delivery of individually agreed objectives.
Longterm 576,000 The value shown represents the expected value of the bonusmatching incentive award granted under the Performance Share Plan on a twoforone basis.

In respect of the share options and bonusmatching restricted share awards granted in 2007, the IFRS EPSbased targets were not met and the share options and bonusmatching restricted share awards lapsed on 11 March 2010.
For bonusmatching awards and the restricted share Joining Award granted to Philip Broadley in 2009, a target of Return on Average Equity RoAE was added to the IFRS EPS measure so that targets for longterm incentive awards reflect the two major measures of profitability and capital management applied across the Group.
Equal weight is attached to the two metrics for the vesting of any award and vesting of each is attained against the three tiers specified below.
Onethird of each award vests on attainment of the RoAE and EPS targets at each tier, with prorata vesting between tiers, after tier one has been attained.
Targets are tested on a onceonly basis after three years from the year prior to the grant and any award or part thereof that does not vest then lapses.
The targets are set out in the table below: Return on Average Equity Tier 1 % Tier 2 % Tier 3 % RoAE required 10 11 12 Real growth in adjusted operating profit IFRS earnings per share Growth factor above UK RPI Stock Market growth Tier 1 % Tier 2 % Tier 3 % 50% 9.0 12.0 15.0 0% 0.0 3.0 6.0 Growth will be calculated by the value of 100 invested as follows: 33.33 in the FTSE100 index average price over Q4 2008 66.67 in the JSE ALSI index average price over Q4 2008 against the value of that investment in calculated by reference to the average price converted into, in the case of the JSE ALSI component by reference to the average daily exchange rates for the period on the respective indices over Q4 2011.

Normal awards will recommence in 2012.
Subject to attainment of the agreed targets, all the awards under the OMSIP will vest in two equal parts, three and four years from the dates of grant.
If the plan is approved at the Annual General Meeting on 13 May 2010, it is envisaged that awards under the OMSIP will be made as soon as practicable thereafter.

The targets for the OMSIP award are set out below.
Rationalising Objective The Committee will require the executive directors to rationalise the Group by achieving initiatives in accordance with and supportive of the Group strategy statement.
These performance conditions were chosen to focus the attention of management on achieving the strategy that has been adopted by the entire Board for rationalising the business.
The Board has identified a set of initiatives which relate to the restructuring of the business and has set expectations for what is required under each of these initiatives.
At an appropriate time in the planning stage for each initiative, the Committee, in consultation with the Board, will set more detailed targets for what satisfactory performance through to exceptional performance means in relation to each initiative.
The Committee will measure the outcome based on the agreed performance levels at the point the initiative is achieved this could be at any time during the measurement period.
Comprehensive retrospective disclosure and explanation of vesting decisions will be provided annually in the following Remuneration Report.
The assessment made by the Committee will be by reference to the predetermined targets, and will take into account the quality of execution, in particular in relation to risk and sustainability.
Component Objective Measurements Significant Rationalise the Group by Based on Committee evaluation of the following three factors: Rationalising achieving strategic initiatives 1.
Total value released relative to available benchmark transactions Initiatives in accordance with the 2.
Quality of execution including risk, reputation and other nonfinancial impacts Group strategy statement to 3.
Amount available to reduce debt from the proceeds of rationalising streamline the Group, unlock value and reduce debt At the end of the threeyear measurement period, the Committee will assess the sum of the evaluations of the individual initiatives when determining total achievement of this component and may exercise discretion to reduce the vesting level of the award when factoring in total achievement toward debt reduction and any new information arising which suggests a different performance assessment.
Outcomes will be disclosed in the Remuneration Report in the year following the achievement of objectives.
The Committee has chosen these methods because of the commercial sensitivity of disclosing more than summary information in advance and because it gives the Committee the time and discretion to judge performance with the benefit of additional information emerging during the whole of the performance period.
Financial performance of the LongTerm Savings Business The financial metrics within the OMSIP are intended to provide an incentive based on a selection of key financial measures that best reflect the financial performance and success of the business over the performance period.
The chosen measures balance profitability, returns and scale growth: Annual compound growth in NCCF 1 2 3 Vesting % Cumulative Growth in IFRS AOP Return on Equity AUM Weighting 40% 40% 20% Below Threshold Nil Below 30% Below 15% Below 2% pa Threshold 20% 30% 15% 2% pa Threshold to Maximum |Interpolated| Maximum 100% 70% 18% 6% pa 1 Growth in Adjusted Operating Profit AOP excluding LongTerm Investment Return on a constant currency basis over the three year performance period 2 IFRS AOP over aggregate equity allocated to the LongTerm Savings business for 2012 3 The ratio of the Net Client Cash Flow NCCF over Assets under Management AUM will be calculated on a simple average basis over the full three years 17 170 0 Old Mutual plc Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 2.
Absolute TSR TSR will be measured on an absolute basis, 50% in ZAR and 50% in GBP and will be averaged at the start Q4 and end Q4 of the threeyear performance periods.
Old Mutuals TSR growth will then be compared with the vesting schedule set out below to determine the vesting outcome: Vesting percentage Absolute TSR growth p. a.
Below threshold 0% Less than 10% Threshold 20% 10% Threshold to Maximum Interpolated 10% to 20% Maximum 100% 20% The Committee must be satisfied that the Companys TSR performance reasonably reflects its underlying financial performance over the period.
Threshold performance is aligned with Old Mutuals cost of equity and the maximum is aligned with performance in excess of the historic upper quartile performance within the insurance sector.
The Committee considered the use of a relative TSR measure, but believes that absolute TSR reflects a fairer measure of shareholder value, given the current circumstances of the Group.
Relative TSR is undermined by the difficulties of finding a relevant peer group for Old Mutual given: The South African weighting of the business and the shortage of comparably sized South African peers Currency issues arising from Old Mutuals particular geographic spread The current business mix of insurance, asset management, and banking The envisaged strategic transformation of the Group during the measurement period.
Shortterm incentive targets for performance year 2010 The respective weightings attached to the Group metrics shown as a percentage of base salary for the executive directors shortterm incentive for 2010 are as follows: Mr J Roberts Mr P Broadley Metric Group % Group % IFRS earnings Adjusted Operating Profit per share 56.25 37.5 Return on Equity 56.25 37.5 Subtotal 112.5 75 Personal objectives 37.5 75 In his role as Group Finance Director, Philip Broadley is responsible to the Board for all financial matters including management control over the internal audit and risk functions.
The financial elements of his bonus therefore have a lower weighting than line management executives and more emphasis is placed on personal objectives.
The following chart depicts the overall makeup of the executive directors respective remuneration packages for 2010, assuming ontarget rather than maximum delivery on shortterm incentives and an expected value for longterm incentives.

17 172 2 Old Mutual plc Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Shares under award or option at Name of Plan Description 31 December 2009 The OMSA This plan was designed in the context of the Groups plans to promote black 5,250,344 BroadBased economic empowerment BEE in its whollyowned South African and Namibian Employee Share businesses by means of an opportunity of ownership of Old Mutual shares for all Plan permanent staff of those businesses who were not in any of the Companys other share schemes, through a oneoff award of shares.
Grants of share awards in connection with the South African BEE transactions were made in October 2005 and in connection with Namibian BEE transactions in April 2007.
There is currently no intention for further awards to be made to South African or Namibian employees under this plan.
During the restricted period, a participant may not dispose of or transfer any of his or her restricted shares or any interest in them.
The OMSA Senior The purpose of the SBP is to help Old Mutual South Africa and Old Mutual Namibia 20,346,564 Black Management to attract and retain senior black managers in light of the increased competition for Share Plan SBP talented and experienced black management.
It provides for the award of restricted shares and the grant of share options.
Grants are made in addition to the normal annual share incentive allocations under the OMSA Management Incentive Share Plan described below.
A participant may not dispose of or transfer his rights to the option or the shares related to it without the directors written consent and any attempt to do so would result in the option lapsing.
During the restricted period, a participant may not dispose of or transfer any of his restricted shares or any interest in them.

Total shares held under award or option at 31 December 2009 222,738,097 Change of control Under the rules of the respective schemes, in the event of a change of control of Old Mutual plc: Restricted shares and options granted under the SRP would vest in full Performance shares and options granted under the PSP would vest: i to the extent that the performance criteria to which such options are subject have been met: and ii on a prorata basis to reflect the reduction in the length of the original performance period, although the Committee does have discretion to disapply the length of service prorating for compassionate reasons Options granted under the SOP and awards granted under the RSP would vest in full Options granted under the MISP would vest: i to the extent that the performance criteria to which such options are subject have been met and ii on a prorata basis to reflect the reduction in the length of the original performance period Restricted share awards granted under the MISP and the OMSA BroadBased Employee Share Plan would vest in full Options and restricted share awards granted under the OMSA Senior Black Management Share Plan would vest in full Options granted under the SAYE and Sharesave would become exercisable to the extent of the savings accumulated.
The Committee has reviewed the operation of the current share incentive schemes, including how discretion is exercised and the grant levels currently applicable, and considers these to be appropriate to the Companys current circumstances and prospects.
Old Mutual plc Old Mutual plc 17 173 3 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Shareholder information Financials Governance Risk and Responsibility Business review Management statements Fast read GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUEd Employee Share Ownership Trusts The Group operates a number of Employee Share Ownership Trusts ESOTs, through which it collateralises some of its obligations under employee share schemes.
At 31 December 2009, the following shares in the Company were held in ESOTs: Old Mutual plc Trust Country Shares held in trust 1 Capital Growth Investment Trust Zimbabwe 1,552,369 2 Old Mutual plc Employee Share Trust Guernsey 18,959,521 3 OMN BroadBased Employee Share Trust Namibia 904,224 3 OMN Management Incentive Trust Namibia 2,234,800 4 OMSA BroadBased Employee Share Trust South Africa 28,705,690 4 OMSA Management Incentive Trust South Africa 82,505,037 4 OMSA Share Trust South Africa 23,048,439 Total 157,910,080 1 The Capital Growth Investment Trust is used to satisfy restricted share awards or Deferred Delivery Shares in Zimbabwe under a locally run scheme.
Any surplus shares held in trust because of nonvesting are taken into account when purchasing shares in respect of future grants.
2 The Old Mutual plc Employee Share Trust is used to satisfy awards under the RSP, SRP and PSP excluding South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe.
Its strategy is to hold shares approximately equal to the number of shares awarded, but not yet vested, at any time.
Any surplus shares held in trust because of nonvesting are taken into account when purchasing shares in respect of future awards.
3 The OMN BroadBased Employee Share Trust and the OMN Management Incentive Trust were established during 2006 to subscribe for and hold shares in the Company in connection with its Namibian BEE ownership transactions.
The OMN BroadBased Employee Share Trust holds shares for the purposes of the Namibian awards under both the OMSA BroadBased Employee Share Plan and the OMSA Senior Black Management Share Plan, while the OMN Management Incentive Trust holds shares for Namibian awards under the OMSA MISP.
Awards to white employees in Namibia under the OMSA MISP are settled by the OMSA Share Trust.
4 The OMSA BroadBased Employee Share Trust and the OMSA Management Incentive Trust were established during 2005 to subscribe for and hold shares in the Company in connection with its South African BEE ownership transactions.
The OMSA BroadBased Employee Share Trust holds shares for the purposes of both the OMSA BroadBased Employee Share Plan and the OMSA Senior Black Management Share Plan, while the OMSA Management Incentive Trust holds shares for the OMSA MISP.
Awards to white employees under the OMSA MISP and all awards that have been granted to South African and Namibian employees under the restricted share plan and share option and deferred delivery plan are settled by the OMSA Share Trust.
The strategy has historically been to ensure that sufficient shares were acquired to match at least 90 percent of the obligations of each share incentive grant.
However, as a result of the requirements of the Companys BEE transactions in South Africa and Namibia, it was necessary to place shares allotted as part of the transactions in the relevant BEE employee share trusts immediately, in order to cover the total annual share grant allocations likely to be made to black participants in terms of the BEE transactions up to 2014 and 2016 respectively.
The general practice of the ESOTs shown in the table above save for the BEErelated trusts is not to vote the shares held at shareholder meetings, although beneficiaries of restricted shares may in principle give directions for those shares to be voted.
However, with respect to the OMSA BroadBased Employee Share Trust, the OMSA Management Incentive Trust, the OMN BroadBased Employee Share Trust and the OMN Management Incentive Trust, the Trustees may, because of BEE considerations, vote any unallocated shares held in these trusts as well as those shares held in respect of any unexercised share options.
The beneficiaries of any restricted shares allocated by these BEE employee share trusts are entitled to vote their relevant shares.
Options granted under the SOP for employees outside South Africa and Namibia, Sharesave, SRP, PSP and SAYE are currently intended to be settled by the issue of new shares rather than using shares held in an ESOT.
Dilution limits For the purposes of calculating dilution limits, any awards that are satisfied by transfer of preexisting issued shares such as shares acquired by market purchase through ESOTs and any shares comprised in any option that has lapsed are disregarded.
The Company has complied with these limits at all times.
At 31 December 2009, the Company had 2.14% of share capital available under the 5% in five years limit applicable to discretionary share incentive schemes and 5.55% of share capital available under the 10% in 10 years limit applicable to all share incentive schemes.
The issued share capital figure used for this calculation has not been reduced to reflect shares bought back into treasury by the Company.
Subsidiaries share incentive schemes The Companys separatelylisted subsidiaries, Nedbank Group Limited and Mutual & Federal Insurance Company Limited whose listing came to an end in February 2010 when it became wholly owned by the Old Mutual Group, have their own share incentive schemes, which are under the control of the Remuneration Committees of their respective boards and are not further addressed in this Report.
None of the past or present executive directors of the Company has any interest under any such subsidiary share incentive schemes.

Executive directors shareholding requirements The Committee has established guidelines on shareholdings by executive directors of the Company.
Under these, the Group Chief Executive is expected to build up a holding of shares in the Company equal in value to at least 150% of annual base salary within five years of appointment: the equivalent figure for the other executive director is 100% of annual base salary.
For the purposes of the calculations, unvested restricted share awards are excluded.
The following table shows Old Mutual plc shares held by the executive directors at 31 December 2009 including holdings by connected persons compared to the shareholding requirements prescribed by these guidelines.

Terms of engagement Chairman and nonexecutive directors Chris Collins retired as Chairman on 31 December 2009.
His replacement, Patrick OSullivan, entered into an engagement letter with the Company in August 2009 setting out the terms applicable to his role as Chairman from January 2010.
Under these terms, subject to: a 12 months notice given at any time by either the Company or Patrick OSullivan, b his being duly reelected at any intervening Annual General Meetings, and c the provisions of the Companys Articles of Association relating to the removal of directors, Patrick OSullivans appointment may continue until his 70th birthday, namely 15 April 2019.
The other eight nonexecutive directors are engaged on terms that may be terminated by either side without notice.
However, it is envisaged that they will remain in place on a threeyear cycle, in order to provide assurance to both the Company and the nonexecutive director concerned that the appointment is likely to continue.
The renewal of nonexecutive directors terms for successive threeyear cycles is not automatic, with the continued suitability of each nonexecutive director being assessed by the Nomination Committee.
In the absence of exceptional circumstances, the Board has determined that nonexecutive directors engagements will not be extended beyond the end of their third threeyear cycle.
The original dates of appointment and the dates when the current appointments of the nonexecutive directors are due to terminate are as follows: Date current Date of original Date of current Current term appointment appointment appointment as director terminates Nigel Andrews 1 June 2002 1 June 2008 3rd 1 June 2011 Mike Arnold 1 Sep 2009 1 Sep 2009 1st 1 Sep 2012 Rudi Bogni 1 Feb 2002 1 Feb 2008 3rd 1 Feb 2011 Russell Edey 24 June 2004 24 June 2007 2nd 24 June 2010 Reuel Khoza 27 Jan 2006 27 Jan 2009 2nd 27 Jan 2012 Bongani Nqwababa 1 April 2007 1 April 2007 1st 1 April 2010 Lars Otterbeck 14 Nov 2006 14 Nov 2009 2nd 14 Nov 2012 Richard Pym 1 Sep 2007 1 Sep 2007 1st 1 Sep 2010 17 176 6 Old Mutual plc Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Remuneration Chairman and nonexecutive directors The Companys policy on remuneration for nonexecutive directors is that this should be: Feebased Marketrelated having regard to fees paid and time commitments of nonexecutive directors of other members of the FTSE100 Index Not linked to share price or Company performance.
