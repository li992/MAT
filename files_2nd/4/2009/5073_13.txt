Business Review eaga Annual Report and Accounts 2009 33 Remuneration Report This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 8 to SI 2008 410 and has been approved by the Remuneration Committee and the Board.
The Remuneration Committee comprises four Independent Non-Executive Directors: Quintin Oliver, Malcolm Simpson, Roger Aylard and is chaired by Tracy Clarke.
The Remuneration Committee is governed by formal terms of reference which are reviewed annually and available from the Company Secretary upon request.
The Remuneration Committee continues to focus on ensuring that in designing and implementing the Companys executive compensation strategy: the interests of shareholders are protected and enhanced: the unique ethics and characteristics of eaga, developed through its ownership structure are maintained: and the view of all shareholders, customers, Partners and other stakeholders in the business receive appropriate attention.
The Company has a strong desire to be responsible in its approach to executive pay whilst ensuring that the remuneration policies are sufficient to attract and retain appropriately qualified and highly motivated Executive Directors.
Role of the Remuneration Committee The Committee is responsible for approving and monitoring the specific remuneration packages and terms and conditions of employment of the Companys Executive Directors and certain other senior managers.
The Committee, in consultation with the Chief Executive, is responsible for determining which senior managers are included for this purpose, such determination to be approved by the Board as a whole.
The Committee is also responsible for agreeing eagas overall remuneration policy and has oversight of the governance process for remuneration generally.
The Committee has delegated responsibility for setting the Chairmans remuneration.
Non-Executive Directors remuneration is set by the Executive Directors in consultation with the Chairman.
The Committee is responsible for the appointment of independent external advisors to give advice on all matters relating to executive remuneration.
During the year the Committee has taken advice from Hewitt Associates Limited trading as Hewitt New Bridge Street and KPMG LLP including advice on employee and management share incentive plans and Directors Remuneration packages.
The Company had no other relationship with either firm.
There were six meetings held of the Committee in the year to 31 May 2009.
Remuneration Policy The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that the total remuneration package for the Executive Directors is soundly based, internally consistent, externally competitive and fully aligned with the interests of shareholders for both the short and long-term.
No Director takes any part in the decision regarding their personal remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee has agreed a balanced executive remuneration framework, which includes typical market incentives.
The Committee considers that this framework is appropriate for the purpose of recruiting and motivating executive talent and comprises: basic salary: annual cash bonus: long-term incentive schemes Management Incentive Plan and Share Incentive Plan : retirement benefits: and other benefits.
34 Business Review eaga Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Remuneration Report Continued Basic Salary The current basic annual salaries paid to the Executive Directors are as follows: Drew Johnson 370,000 Ian McLeod 250,000 Dave Routledge 250,000 Up to his date of resignation, John Cloughs basic annual salary was 370,000.
Upon his retirement John Clough did not receive any further payments or compensation from the Company.
The Executive Director basic salaries are reviewed annually using external benchmarking against comparable companies to ensure that they remain externally competitive, taking into account the requirements of the roles, the performance of individuals, the size of the Company and its complexity.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the Executive Directors base salary during December 2008 using third party independent consultants and increases were proposed.
Having last received a salary increase in April 2007, base salaries for Executive Directors had fallen behind market median by some margin and an 8% increase was applied to bring the Directors more in line with that median based pay and also reflect the growing size and complexity at eaga.
Upon appointment as Chief Executive Officer, Drew Johnson received an increase to base salary to reflect his new responsibilities.
Annual Cash Bonus The Remuneration Committee has approved an annual cash bonus for Executive Directors up to a maximum of 100% of annual basic salary for the delivery of exceptional performance against a balanced scorecard of results.
Certain senior managers, as agreed with the Board, have a maximum opportunity of up to 50% of annual basic salary upon also delivering exceptional performance.
The annual cash bonus scheme has been implemented in 2009 for certain senior managers in the business.
The bonus to be awarded depends on the achievement of respective Divisional and Group EBITA targets together with a number of individual personal objectives including leadership, health and safety and risk management.
The incumbent Executive Directors have, to date, elected not to participate in the annual bonus plan.
However, in light of a refreshed vision, the growth of the business and the challenge ahead, the Executive Directors have elected to participate for the year commencing 1 June 2009.
It is expected that any newly appointed Executive Directors would also participate in the annual cash bonus plan at the appropriate levels as approved by the Committee.
Long-term Incentive Schemes Management Incentive Plan MIP The MIP allows the granting of performance shares to Executive Directors and certain senior managers.
Under normal circumstances the maximum market value of shares over which individual awards could be made is 100% of salary.
In exceptional circumstances the Committee has the authority to award up to 200% of salary.
The Executive Directors have elected not to participate in the MIP believing that their personal shareholdings align their long-term interests with those of other shareholders.
However, it is expected that any newly appointed Executive Director would participate in the MIP.
Performance conditions have been reviewed during the period and the Remuneration Committee are satisfied that these continue to be appropriate.
Business Review eaga Annual Report and Accounts 2009 35 In total 1,366,245 nil cost options were awarded to certain senior managers in October 2008 and will vest subject to the performance conditions set out below.
The vesting of any awards made under the MIP will be subject to the achievement of Group performance targets intended to enhance shareholder value.
Half of any award will vest depending on TSR Total Shareholder Return, being the change in share price plus dividends paid performance relative to the FTSE mid 250 excluding investment trusts and half of the awards against eps performance.
The Committee believes the use of these targets will improve the financial performance of the Company and deliver value to shareholders.
The performance period will be three years beginning at the start of the financial year during which awards are made.
The start and end points used to establish the vesting of awards will be based on the average of the quoted daily closing share price in the three months preceding the beginning and end of the relevant performance period.
In normal circumstances, no awards will become vested before the third anniversary of the date of grant.
The vesting under each part of the award will be as follows: TSR performance relative to the FTSE mid 250 excluding investment trusts Percentage of award Below median 0% 2 At median 16 3% 2 Between median and upper quartile 16 3% to 50% on a straight line Upper quartile 50% eps Performance compound annual increase Percentage of award Below 10% 0% At 10% 10% 10% to 20% 10% to 50% straight line Above 20% 50% As required by the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups Regulations 2008, the Company reports performance measured by TSR against an appropriate market index.
The Committee has determined that the FTSE mid 250 without Investment Trusts is the appropriate market index.
This comparison of TSR performance is illustrated in the following graph: Total Shareholder Return eaga plc 120 FTSE mid 250 excluding investment trusts 100 80 60 40 20 0 7 June 2007 31 May 2008 31 May 2009 Source: Datastream Percentage 36 Business Review eaga Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Remuneration Report Continued The performance of the Group in terms of business growth in revenues and EBITA is further illustrated below: 800 50 Revenue EBITA 45 700 40 600 35 500 30 400 25 20 300 15 200 10 100 5 0 0 2006 2007 2008 2009 Share Incentive Plan SIP The Company operates an HMRC approved SIP for the benefit of all qualifying Partners, including the Executive Directors.
All qualifying Partners are beneficiaries of the eaga Partnership Trust ePT.
ePT is the vehicle in which shares in the Company and other assets are held on trust for the benefit of all qualifying Partners.
The activities of ePT are subject to a constitution and trust deed and are independent to the Company.
ePTs affairs are managed by a board of trustees including: independent trustees, Partners elected by the eaga Partners Council and one trustee nominated by the eaga Board Nomination Committee.
ePT waived its interim and final dividends relating to the year to 31 May 2008, amounting to 2.8m.
These funds have been used by the Company to finance the first free share award under the SIP.
On 31 October 2008, the Company awarded 2,269,903 nil cost shares to Partners in the business.
The accounting charge required for the nil cost shares issued to Partners in the year is 1.6m and further set out in note 7 of the financial statements.
To fund the award of these shares, the Group via a SIP Trustee, purchased 2.2m Ordinary Shares on 27 October 2008 at a cost of 2.7m.
Until these shares vest with the individual, they are shown as own shares held in trust, as shown in note 28 to the financial statements.
The SIP has been well received by Partners with over 90% participation in the SIP.
The incumbent Executive Directors declined to participate in the SIP in the current year.
The cost of implementing and administering this plan is borne by ePT.
Retirement Benefits The Executive Directors are members of the Companys group personal pension plan, a defined contribution scheme, under which the Company makes an annual contribution or salary supplement of up to 15% of basic salary.
This may be supplemented by each member as desired, and as permitted under current pension legislation.
Annual bonuses, were they to be awarded, would not be pensionable.
Revenue m EBITA m Business Review eaga Annual Report and Accounts 2009 37 Other Benefits Other benefits include fully expensed company car or equivalent cash allowance, permanent health insurance and life assurance.
The range of benefits and their value are considered to be broadly in line with similar companies in the FTSE mid 250.

Contracts do not provide additional compensation for severance as a result of a change of control.
The Non-Executive Directors have entered into letters of three year appointment with the Company which may be terminated by three months notice on either side.
External Appointments The Company recognises that its senior executives and the Company can benefit from its Executive Directors serving in a personal capacity as Non-Executive Directors of other companies.
Subject to approval by the Board, Executive Directors are permitted to hold one external Non-Executive directorship and retain any fees received for holding such a position.
Such appointments will only be approved if there is no potential conflict of interest and the time commitments do not interfere with the Executive Directors duties and performance.
Currently Dave Routledge holds a Non-Executive appointment on a pro-bono basis for the Employee Ownership Association, a not for profit organisation dedicated to the development and expansion of employee ownership.
