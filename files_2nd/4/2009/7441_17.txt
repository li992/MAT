As required by law, the information provided in the table in the section entitled Long-Term Incentive Plan and the table on Directors total remuneration and accompanying notes has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP as it contains the information upon which the auditors are required to report to the Companys shareholders.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The Remuneration Committee was chaired by Jorge Born Jr. until 1 June 2009 and, from that date by Sir Malcolm Field.
Jorge Born Jr. and Sir Malcolm Field served as members of the Committee throughout 2009, together with Nigel Moore.
All of the members of the Remuneration Committee are independent Non-Executive Directors.
The duties of the Remuneration Committee are to determine and agree with the Board the broad policy for the remuneration of the Executive Directors, the other members of the Executive Committee and the Company Secretary, as well as their specific remuneration packages including pension rights and, where applicable, any compensation payments.
In determining such policy, the Remuneration Committee shall take into account all factors which it deems necessary to ensure that members of the senior executive management of the Group are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage strong performance and are rewarded in a fair and responsible manner for their individual contributions to the success of the Group.
The composition of the Remuneration Committee and its terms of reference comply with the provisions of the Combined Code and are available for inspection on the Companys website at www.
com The Remuneration Committee was advised during the year on remuneration matters generally by Kepler Associates who did not provide any other services to the Group during the year.
REMUNERATION POLICY The Remuneration Policy of the Group as applied by the Remuneration Committee did not change in the year under review.
The principal objectives of the Groups policy are to attract, retain, and motivate its executives and senior management and to align management incentives with the creation of shareholder value.
The Group seeks to achieve this alignment over both the short and long term through the use of annual performance-related bonuses which reward the achievement of a balanced mix of financial and operational performance measures, and Total Shareholder Return TSR which measures performance for the awards made under the Long-Term Incentive Plan.
This policy will continue to be applied by the Remuneration Committee in respect of the current financial year.

The maximum bonus percentages are set out in each Executive Directors service contract and or as subsequently determined by the Remuneration Committee and have been set to ensure that the majority of the remuneration is performance based.

Awards made under the Plan to Executive Directors are subject to a normal limit, capping awards to an annual value not exceeding six times salary at the date of grant excluding interest on the deferred proportion of the award.
Details of LTIP awards held by Executive Directors as at 31 December 2009 are given in the table below.
Maximum Awards Interests in awards vested Interests in the LTIP at made during during the the LTIP at 31 12 2008 the year year 31 12 2009 Eduardo Hochschild $4m $4m Miguel Arambur $1.8m $1.8m Ignacio Rosado $1.5m $1.5m 56 Gov Governance ernance A Accou ccoun nt ts s Going forward, the Committee intends to make LTIP awards on an annual basis in keeping with established market practice, subject to the limit specified above.
The vesting of initial awards under the Plan is subject to the Companys TSR over a three-year period to 31 December 2010, relative to a tailored peer group of listed international gold and silver mining companies the Comparator Index.
At the start of the plan, the comparator index comprised the following companies: Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd, Alamos Gold, AngloGold Ashanti Ltd, Apex Silver Mines Ltd, Barrick Gold Corp, Cia des Minas Buenaventura SA, Couer dAlene Mines Corp, Eldorado Gold Corp, Gold Fields Ltd, Goldcorp Inc, Highland Gold Mining Ltd, Iamgold Corp, Kinross Gold Corp, Minefinders Corp, Newmont Mining Corp, PAN American Silver Corp, Petropavlovsk Plc, Polymetal and Silver Standard Resources Inc. During the year, one of these companies, Apex Silver Mines was fide-listed and was therefore removed from the comparator index.
25% of the maximum cash payment vests if the Company achieves median TSR performance, 75% of the maximum cash payment vests at upper quartile TSR performance and the whole award vests at upper decile TSR performance.
Vesting occurs on a straight-line basis for TSR performance between median and upper quartile and between upper quartile and upper decile.
Awards are subject to two clawbacks in relation to a whole, or part of an, award : firstly, if based on a discretionary assessment by the Remuneration Committee, the overall underlying business performance of the Company during the performance period is not satisfactory: and secondly, if there are failures relating to safety, environment, community and legal compliance that the Remuneration Committee considers would entitle it to exercise its discretion.
On a change of control, awards made under the LTIP may vest early unless a replacement award is made, but would be pro-rated to take account of the proportion of the period from the award date to the normal vesting date completed prior to the change of control, and the extent to which performance conditions applying to the award have been met.
In respect of the year under review, the Companys TSR was above the median of that of the Comparator Index.
In respect of the period from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2009, the Companys TSR is below the median of the Comparator Index.
REVISED REMUNERATION ARRANGEMENTS FOR EDUARDO HOCHSCHILD In early 2010, after the end of the financial year, the Remuneration Committee agreed revised remuneration arrangements for Eduardo Hochschild.
Under these new arrangements, Eduardo Hochschild is paid an annual base salary of $1.1m excluding any entitlement to statutory profit sharing under Peruvian law and an annual pension supplement of $200,000.
In consideration for this increase in base salary, Eduardo Hochschild has agreed to waive his current and future participation in the LTIP and entitlement to an annual bonus in respect of 2010 and subsequent years.
These arrangements take effect from 1 January 2010.
DIRECTORS SERVICE CONTRACTS As previously described, the contractual arrangements for those Executive Directors appointed prior to the IPO in 2006 differ to those for the Executive Directors appointed since the IPO.
Eduardo Hochschild and Roberto Daino are employed under contracts of employment with the Company and Compaa Minera Ares S. A. C. Ares, a Group company, dated 16 October 2006 as subsequently amended.
The contracts have no fixed terms and may be terminated on 12 months notice in writing.
In setting the notice period for termination at 12 months, the Remuneration Committee has reduced the likelihood of having to pay excessive compensation in the event of termination at the Companys behest and, to this end, a provision for immediate dismissal with no compensation payable in the event of unsatisfactory performance is included in each Directors contract.
Miguel Arambur and Ignacio Rosado were appointed Directors of the Company with effect from 1 January 2009 and are employed under contracts of employment with Ares effective 1 August 2002 and 25 January 2005 respectively.
The contracts are subject to Peruvian law and, as such, have no fixed term and may be terminated i by the executive on 30 days notice and ii by Ares without notice.
Under Peruvian law, termination by Ares other than termination for certain prescribed reasons such as gross negligence gives rise to an entitlement to compensation of no less than 1.5 times the monthly base salary for each year of service completed, up to a maximum of twelve months base salary.
