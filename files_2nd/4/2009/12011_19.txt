The awards marked # relate to the Companys Restricted Share Plan RSP and the awards marked relate to the Companys Performance and Co-investment Plan PCP which succeeded the RSP in 2007.
Details of the PCP and the performance conditions applicable to these Awards are set out in section iii Long-Term Incentive Plan on page 44 of this report.
70% of the 2005 RSP Award vested on 26 September 2008 at a market price of 592.13p per ordinary share as the performance criterion had been partially met.
The balance of the share awards of 30% lapsed on 26 September 2008.
Bob Baty, a former director of the Company who retired on 31 July 2006, also received on 26 September 2008 8,586 ordinary shares of a total value of 51,000 at that date market price of 592.13p each which vested from a total original award of 12,266 ordinary shares adjusted as referred to below made on 27 September 2005 at a market price of 356.67p each pursuant to the provisions of the RSP.
The balance of the shares awarded to Bob Baty lapsed on 26 September 2008.
As reported in last years annual report the number of shares awarded to him had been adjusted pro rata to his period of employment with the Company during the Restricted Period of the award.
The performance criterion applicable to the 2005 and 2006 RSP Awards was: the total shareholder return TSR achieved by the Company in the performance period must be greater than that of the company at or nearest to but not above the 50th percentile position of the comparator group.
If the TSR performance condition is met then 50% of an award will vest with 100% vesting if the Company achieves the position equal or closest to, but not above, the 75th percentile position of the comparator group.
The achievement of a position between the 50th and the 75th percentile positions will result in vesting in steps reflecting the number of companies within that third quartile of the comparator group.
The comparator group currently consists of nine of the water only, water and sewerage, electricity and gas companies in the FTSE Utilities Index and quoted on the London Stock Exchange.
The TSR of each company in the comparator group is measured by Hewitt Associates Limited assuming that all dividends are reinvested and is calculated by taking the average market value of each companys shares for the whole of March before the beginning of the relevant three-year performance period and comparing this to the average market value of the same shares for the whole of March at the end of the three-year period.
Based upon independent remuneration consultants advice this method of measurement is considered to be fair and transparent to participants in the scheme and also an accurate measure of actual performance.
The above performance criterion was chosen by the Remuneration Committee because it was considered to be an appropriate measure of the Groups performance which also aligned itself to the interests of shareholders.
None of the 2006 RSP Award will vest in September 2009 as the performance criterion has not been met.
During the year the Directors received dividends on the above shares in accordance with the conditions of the RSP as follows: Colin Drummond 16,146: David Dupont 16,146: Chris Loughlin 7,151.
