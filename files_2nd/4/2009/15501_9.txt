DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT This report, which has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Combined Code, has been approved by the board of directors for submission to shareholders for approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The section under the heading Directors Remuneration has been subject to external audit.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The remuneration committee RemCo is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations to the Board regarding the broad policy relating to the total remuneration paid to the directors and members of senior management of the Company: it meets regularly, at least twice annually, to review and set all elements of the remuneration paid to the executive directors of the Company, including pension rights, and monitors the level and structure of remuneration for other senior management of the Company.
It also exercises all the powers of the board in relation to the operation of the Companys share incentive schemes, including the grant of options and the terms of those grants.
The Committee is comprised of three non-executive directors, Keith Stella Chairman of the Committee, Peter Nutting and Michael Pavia.
Although he is Chairman of the Company and as such is not an independent director, Mr Nutting continues to make an important contribution to the affairs of the RemCo and the Committee considers it would be contrary to the interests of the Company to require him to relinquish that role.
The Committee met formally five times during the year and details of attendance at these meetings are provided in the Corporate Governance Report on page 23.
The Committee additionally met informally on a number of occasions during the year, generally by conference call, principally to discuss the proposed new remuneration arrangements for Mr Wigoder, which are referred to below.
During the course of the year, the Committee engaged the services of Hewitt New Bridge Street Consultants, a firm of independent remuneration consultants, to provide the Committee with advice in connection with proposed new remuneration arrangements for Mr Wigoder.
Hewitt New Bridge Street did not carry out any other work for the Company.
Legal advice to the Committee has been provided by Nabarro LLP, who are appointed by the Company and also provided legal services to the Company during the year.
The legal advice provided to it by Nabarro LLP was discrete and the Committee is satisfied that the services provided did not create any conflict of interest.
If a conflict of interest were to arise in the future, the Committee would appoint separate legal advisers from those used by the Company.
REMUNERATION POLICY The overall remuneration policy is designed to ensure that the executive directors of the Company and other senior managers in the Company are fairly and responsibly rewarded for their individual contribution to the overall performance of the Company, in a manner that ensures that the Company is able to attract, motivate, and retain executives of the quality necessary to ensure the successful management of the Company.
The Companys remuneration policy is based on the principle that the fortunes of the directors and senior management are aligned with those of the shareholders, and this is achieved in the case of the chief executive as a result of his significant shareholding in the Company and in the case of the chief operating officer, finance director and all other members of the senior management team by the grant of share options.
Changes in the remuneration of the executive directors are decided by the Committee in consultation with the chief executive.
COMPONENTS OF REMUNERATION Each of the three executive directors of the Company, Mr Wigoder as chief executive officer, Mr Lindsay as chief operating officer and Mr Houghton as finance director, receives a basic salary.
26 TELECOM PLUS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS BUSINESS Mindful of the requirements of the Combined Code and good corporate governance, during the year the Committee started work on the drafting of a new service contract for Mr Wigoder together with a revised remuneration package that includes a bonus element with both short term and long term performance conditions.
Negotiations over the terms of these proposals are continuing and had not been concluded by the financial year end.
It is expected that, once agreed, the revised arrangements will be brought into effect, retrospectively, from 1 April 2009.
In the meantime, Mr Wigoder has agreed to waive any entitlement to a bonus for the year ended 31 March 2009.
Mr Lindsays remuneration was last reviewed in March 2008 whilst serving the Company as Commercial Director which was not a board appointment.
Although his remuneration was not revised again at the time of his promotion to the Board as Chief Operating Officer in November 2008, under the terms of the review undertaken in March 2008, Mr Lindsay became entitled to receive a contractually guaranteed bonus of 47,000 of which 16,000 is attributable to the period after his appointment to the Board and it was agreed his annual basic salary would be increased to 182,000 from 1 April 2009.
He has not received, nor is contractually entitled to be paid, any other bonus.
Mr Houghtons remuneration was agreed with him when he joined the Company as Head of Finance in September 2008, and has similarly not been reviewed or revised following his appointment to the board as Finance Director in February 2009.
Under the terms of his service contract, Mr Houghton is not entitled to receive, and has not been paid, any bonus.
Whilst the RemCo recognises there are, therefore, currently no performance related pay elements in place for either Mr Lindsay or Mr Houghton, the Committee will look to consider the introduction of suitable changes once the revised remuneration arrangements for Mr Wigoder have been finalised.
Each of Mr Wigoders, Mr Lindsays and Mr Houghtons service contracts provides for pension contributions equal to 10% of basic salary to be paid by the Company.
Mr Wigoder, Mr Lindsay and Mr Houghton were also provided with private health insurance during the year.
Each of Mr Lindsay and Mr Houghton has additionally been granted certain share options, the details of which are described later in this report.
The non-executive directors receive fees for their services, the details of which are described below.
The level of these fees was unchanged during the year.
The policy with regard to fee structure is to reflect time commitment and responsibility of the various roles, although in the case of the non-independent non-executive directors their fees are also set after taking into account the size of their shareholdings and the quantum of dividend income received.

SHARE OPTION PLANS The Company has two share option plans.
The first is available to employees, and the second is available to Distributors of the Company.
Subject to serving the requisite probationary period, all employees are eligible to participate in the Companys employee share option plan and be issued with options over shares in the Company, the number of shares being related to their seniority and length of service.
As stated in its report last year, the RemCo has revised its policy with respect to the imposition of performance conditions.
As a result, reflecting the requirements of the Combined Code and current best practice, except in exceptional circumstances, performance conditions will be imposed on any future grants agreed to be made either to executive directors of the Company or to those senior executives who are not board members but whose status and role can reasonably be regarded as giving them a significant influence over the Companys ability to meet its strategic objectives: the RemCo also determined that it would not seek to impose performance conditions retrospectively, that is to say, to options previously granted or to those contractually promised.
28 TELECOM PLUS REPORT AND ACCOUNTS BUSINESS Full details of the share options held or granted to directors during the year are set out in the table below: 31 Exercise 1 April March price per Exercisable 2008 Granted 2009 Share from Expiry date Andrew Lindsay 30 Aug 2007 75,000 - 75,000 171p 30 Aug 10 29 Aug 17 12 Jun 2008 - 217,400 217,400 330.5p 12 Jun 11 11 Jun 18 Chris Houghton 10 Dec 2008 - 50,000 50,000 340p 10 Dec 11 9 Dec 18 Richard Hateley 12 July 2006 50,000 - 50,000 127p 12 Jul 09 11 Jul 13 4 Jan 2007 25,000 - 25,000 199.25p 4 Jan 10 3 Jan 14 30 Aug 2007 25,000 - 25,000 171p 30 Aug 10 29 Aug 17 In accordance with the rules of the share option scheme, all of the share options held by Mr Hateley lapsed when his employment with the Company terminated on 15 May 2009.
In the case of both Andrew Lindsay and Chris Houghton, all of the options currently held by them were granted pursuant to contractual promises made at the time they originally joined the Company neither of which was a board appointment and on terms that performance conditions would not be imposed in respect of these grants.
In addition, terms were included in the contract with Mr Lindsay to ensure he would not be financially disadvantaged by the phased granting of his share options.
In the light of these original contractual promises and consistent with the policy stated above, the RemCo has considered that it would be inappropriate to impose performance conditions in contravention of the terms contractually agreed, but has stipulated that appropriate performance conditions will be imposed on any later or further grants made to either Mr Lindsay or Mr Houghton subsequent to their appointment to the Board.
Before making future grants of share options with performance conditions, the RemCo will determine, if necessary after taking external advice, the criteria to be applied for the performance conditions, consistent with the requirements of the Combined Code, having regard at the relevant time to the Companys circumstances and its prospects, and prevailing market practice and trends.
It continues to be the view of the committee and of the board that it would not be in the interests of the Company to seek to impose performance conditions on awards made to other, more junior, employees whose individual performance is unlikely to have a direct impact on the long term success or strategic direction of the Company.
The Networkers and Consultants Share Option Plan exists to provide both further incentives and rewards to those Distributors who have been most successful in gathering new customers for the Company.
These Distributors, though not employees of the Company, are nevertheless essential to its future successful growth and prosperity, and it is the opinion of the Committee that this Plan is in some cases an important factor in their motivation.
As stated, these Distributors are not employees and are not involved of the management of the Company: individually, therefore, none is able to influence the Companys ability to meet its strategic objectives and for this reason it is felt inappropriate to impose any performance conditions on the grant of options made to Distributors under this Plan.
