His basic annual salary from 1 May 2008 to 30 April 2009 was 972,043.
Mr Labroue also participated in the mandatory French retirement benefit arrangements.
In line with French practice, Mr Labroues pensionable salary was the annual gross remuneration received by him over the three preceding years, excluding profit sharing plans, any termination payments and any exceptional compensation received by him.
Under his service contract, Mr Labroues employment could have been terminated on not less than six months notice given by either party.
Kesa Electricals SAS could have required Mr Labroue not to serve out his notice but in that case Kesa Electricals SAS had to maintain his contractual remuneration and benefits save for bonus and incentive arrangements during the notice period.
In addition to notice, if certain conditions were met, Kesa Electricals SAS was required under French law to make a further payment to Mr Labroue as compensation for the termination of his employment.
This payment was not likely to exceed 12 months remuneration.
Simon Herrick Simon Herrick has a service contract with Kesa Electricals plc dated 15 March 2005.

12 Shareholding guideline It is one of the tenets of Kesas reward strategy that shareholders and Directors interests be aligned.
To reinforce this, the Remuneration Committee expects that over a period of years Executive Directors will build a personal holding in Kesa shares.
To underpin this commitment, the Committee expects that, while the guideline holding remains unfulfilled, Executive Directors will not dispose of any shares vesting to them under any of the Kesa incentive plans save for any disposals necessary to meet tax liabilities arising from them, until they hold shares worth the following percentage of their base salary.
CEO 150 per cent of base salary Other Executive Directors 100 per cent of base salary Executive Committee Members 50 per cent of base salary 13 Directors interests The beneficial interests of the Directors, which include holdings by their spouses or other related parties, together with non-beneficial interests in the ordinary shares of the Company, are shown below.
