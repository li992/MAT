Directors remuneration report Directors remuneration report The directors present their remuneration report which covers the remuneration of both executive and non-executive directors and certain senior executives.
The report has been approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
The first section of the report contains unaudited information and the second section audited information.
The report will be subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in April 2010.
Section 1: Unaudited information The role of the Remuneration Committee The Committee reviews and approves the annual salaries, bonus arrangements, service agreements and other employment conditions of the executive directors and certain members of the senior executive management team designated by the Board.
In so doing it takes due account of pay and conditions in the Group as a whole and receives information on pay proposals for other employees throughout the Group.
It also approves the design of, and determines targets for, any performance related bonus pay schemes operated by the Group, approves the total annual payments made under such schemes, reviews the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and shareholders and approves the award of long-term incentives.
The Committee has delegated responsibility for setting the remuneration of the Chairman.
The full terms of reference of the Committee are published on the Companys website www.
Membership and operation The Committee comprises all non-executive directors including the Chairman and is chaired by Stanley Musesengwa.
The Group Chief Executive is usually invited to attend all meetings but neither he nor the Chairman attend when their individual remuneration is being discussed.
The Committee met five times during the year.
Other directors and employees of the Company who attended some, or all, of the meetings during the year and provided advice and services to the Committee were Pamela Broughton Group VP Personnel, Graham Myers Group Financial Controller Treasurer and Louise Scott Company Secretary.
All have the appropriate qualifications and experience to advise the Committee on aspects of the Groups policies and practices.
Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS has been appointed by the Committee to provide independent advice on remuneration policy and practice.
During the year, HNBS attended two meetings of the Committee in connection with the remuneration review, details of which appear later in this report.
Policy on directors and senior executives remuneration The key objectives of Crodas executive remuneration policy are: n to ensure that individual rewards and incentives are comparable with those provided by similar companies having regard to the Groups turnover, business sector and market worth and the need for skills to manage international businesses n to enable the Group to attract and retain high calibre people n to give full consideration to the relevant principles on directors remuneration set out in the 2008 Financial Reporting Council Combined Code n to ensure a balance between fixed and performance related remuneration, the latter being related to objective measurement of the financial performance of the Company.
The Committee believes that the interests of shareholders and directors are more closely aligned by the operation of short-term incentives which encourage the achievement of stretching profit targets and under which rewards may be delivered in the form of cash and shares, combined with share-based long-term incentives that reward performance against three year earnings per share and relative total shareholder return targets.
In designing an appropriate incentive structure for the executive directors and senior executive management team, the Committee endeavours to set challenging performance criteria that are aligned with the Groups strategy for the business and the enhancement of shareholder value.
In line with the Association of British Insurers ABIs Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee ensures that the incentive structure for executive directors and senior executive management will not raise environmental, social or governance ESG risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
More generally, with regard to the overall remuneration structure, there is no restriction on the Committee which prevents it from taking into account corporate governance on ESG matters and it takes due account of issues of general operational risk when structuring incentives.
2009 remuneration review As explained in last years report, HNBS provided advice on salary levels in the market place for consideration as part of the annual pay review of the executive directors and senior executives carried out in November 2008.
Increases for 2009 were awarded on the back of the record performance in 2008, which was achieved in spite of the difficult economic environment, and which saw dividends increased for shareholders.
Following on from that review, in 2009 the Committee commissioned HNBS to carry out a detailed review of the total remuneration packages of the executive directors and senior executives.
HNBS reaffirmed the Committees belief that it is difficult to identify a sufficient number of companies who have operations directly comparable with those of the Company.
Consequently, the remuneration packages were benchmarked, as had been done previously, against a group of international general manufacturing companies, similar in terms of size including twelve month average market capitalisation and turnover and scope of international operations, and a separate group of companies with comparable market capitalisations and international scope to those of Croda Executive and Finance Committee members were also benchmarked against survey data.
As an overall comment, pay was found to be within expected market ranges.
Consequently it was decided that the broad remuneration package would remain consistent with prior years.
27 Directors remuneration report No amendments will be made in 2010 to the performance measures, or the range of targets, for the long term incentive schemes as the Committee considered them to remain suitably challenging.
More particularly, maintaining the current range of performance targets for the purposes of our long-term incentive plans was considered by the Committee to result in tougher targets given that the base year from which future performance will be measured is at record levels and the current economic outlook remains challenging.
During the year, the Committee also resolved that it would be appropriate to accelerate the vesting of the awards made in 2007 under the Croda International Bonus Co-Investment Plan BCIP.
The 2007 BCIP awards performance period ended on 31 December 2009 and, since the extent of vesting is clear, the Committee considers it appropriate to make a minor amendment under the plan rules to accelerate the vesting of these awards to ensure that they are the subject of favourable tax treatment.
This amendment will result in early vesting prior to the end of the current tax year on 5 April 2010.
However, to ensure that the interests of shareholders are protected, a formal claw-back agreement has been entered into which will operate for the period between early vesting and the normal vesting date.
Whilst not directly relevant to Croda, the Committee has also noted the key conclusions of the Financial Services Authority Code and Walker Review during the year and has concluded that Croda continues to take into account the principles of sound risk management when setting pay.
In order to encourage an open and constructive dialogue with our major investors and the main shareholder protection bodies, the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee wrote to them prior to the New Year to inform them of the Committees decisions and proposals in relation to remuneration policy for 2010.
As part of this dialogue, the Committee discussed the possibility of increasing the BCIP matching ratio for executive directors and members of the Executive and Finance Committees from its current level of one matching share being awarded for each share purchased from net annual cash bonus, to two shares being awarded.
This would ensure a consistent approach to BCIP matching awards for all participants.
Despite widespread support for this proposal from the Companys institutional investors that were consulted, the Committee decided that it was not an appropriate time to amend the current remuneration policy full details of the operation of the BCIP are set out on the following page.
Due account was also given to the more general feedback obtained and the Committee will ensure that its remuneration policy is kept under review.
Components of executive directors remuneration Basic salary The salaries are paid monthly in cash and are reviewed annually with effect from 1 January.
Following the 2009 remuneration review described above, and having taken account of another year of outstanding performance by the Company, its executives and the results of the HNBS benchmarking exercise, the Committee has increased the annual base salaries of executive directors with effect from 1 January 2010: Basic salary at Basic salary at Executive director 31 December 2009 1 January 2010 % increase M Humphrey 546,000 560,000 2.6 M S Christie 303,000 309,500 2.1 Performance-related annual bonus The Company operates bonus schemes for its executive directors and senior executives.
Bonus payments are not pensionable.
The 2009 bonuses for executive directors were calculated by reference to the amount by which the income for the year, which is defined as the Group EBITDA for continuing operations before exceptional items and any charges or credits under IFRS2 Share based payments less a notional interest charge on working capital employed during the year the 2009 Income, exceeded the income for 2008 calculated on the same basis the base income.
Bonuses for 2009 are payable on a graduated scale once the 2009 Income exceeds the base income by inflation defined as the harmonised index of consumer prices CPI, with maximum bonuses due at CPI plus 8%.
Income is measured after providing for the cost of any bonuses.
The target range set for 2010 is considered equally challenging to that set in prior years given the high base income that was delivered in 2009 and continuing uncertain economic conditions.
The maximum bonuses due in 2010 have been set at CPI plus 11.35%.
The Committee has the discretion to take safety, health and environmental performance into consideration in determining the overall level of individual bonus payments and can reduce the bonus award if it considers it appropriate to do so.
The maximum amount of bonus payable to the executive directors is 100% of salary with the net element of any bonus in excess of 50% of salary being compulsorily invested in the BCIP.
Bonuses earned by each director in respect of 2009 are included in the table of directors remuneration on page 32 and represent 100% of basic salary, based on achievement in excess of the maximum bonus targets set at the start of the year.
The maximum bonus opportunities have been set at these same levels for 2010.
The performance targets will require out-performance of the 2009 Income before bonuses become eligible for payment.
The Committee remains comfortable that the structure of the annual bonus does not encourage the pursuit of strategies that may involve inappropriate risk-taking and that the mandatory reinvestment of net bonuses in excess of 50% of salary into shares in any year is considered to strengthen further alignment with shareholders and foster a longer-term link between annual performance and reward.
Long-term incentives Long-term incentives are provided to executive directors through two long-term incentive plans, the BCIP and the Croda International Long-term Incentive Plan LTIP, which were both adopted in 2005.
These replaced the Senior Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS.
It is the Committees policy, subject to unforeseen circumstances, that these will comprise the sole long-term elements of the total remuneration package of executive directors for the foreseeable future.
It is also the Committees policy to continue exercising its right to decide the number of LTIP awards to be granted to each executive director subject to plan limits.
28 Directors remuneration report Directors remuneration report BCIP The BCIP operates in conjunction with the annual bonus schemes and allows participants to invest a proportion of their net annual cash bonus in Company shares.
Participants have to agree to hold the invested shares for three years in return for which they receive a conditional award entitling them to additional shares subject to the achievement of the BCIPs performance condition.
The maximum number of shares over which an award can be granted to an employee in a single year is limited to shares having a market value not exceeding 100% of the employees salary.
The level of awards differ between participants, with executive directors and members of the Executive and Finance Committees receiving one matching share for each share invested whilst other participants receive two matching shares.
It is compulsory for members of the former group, whose gross bonus could exceed 50% of their annual salary, to invest the excess over 50%, net of tax, in shares unless they are within three years of anticipated retirement date.
For the first awards which were made in 2006, the vesting of 100% of the award was conditional on Crodas earnings per share before exceptional items exceeding CPI over the three year performance period.
This performance condition was met.
A revised performance condition adopted in 2007 for awards made after 2006 is structured to require the achievement of a challenging sliding scale of adjusted earnings per share growth EPS targets in excess of retail price inflation RPI : 2006 Awards Post 2006 Awards Adjusted EPS growth over the Proportion of award vesting Adjusted EPS growth over the Proportion of award vesting three year period three year period Less than CPI No vesting Less than RPI 12% No vesting CPI 100% RPI 12% 30% RPI 24% 100% Straight-line vesting occurs between these points If the performance target is met the shares will be transferred to the employee.
If the employee does not retain their invested shares until the release date their award lapses.
It is intended that the same performance target will be applied to any BCIP awards made in 2010 and the matching ratio will continue to remain at one matching share being awarded for each share purchased from net annual bonus for executive directors and members of the Group Executive and Finance Committees.
In view of the forthcoming increase to the marginal rate of income tax the Committee has accelerated vesting of the BCIP awards made on 26 April 2007 which would otherwise not vest until 26 April 2010.
This will maintain a more beneficial tax treatment prior to the end of the current tax year 5 April 2010 for those executives affected by the tax rate increase.
The extent of vesting is already established, as it is based on a three year performance period which ended on 31 December 2009.
The rules of the BCIP scheme allow amendments for tax reasons without the requirement to obtain shareholder approval.
This proposal formed part of the consultation with shareholders and was supported.
LTIP Participation in the LTIP is limited to executive directors and senior executives.
Annual awards of shares are made based on varying percentages of salary with the maximum entitlement being shares having a market value of 100% of the employees salary.
Awards are subject to performance conditions measured over a period of not less than three years.
The target for awards made prior to 2007 was set so that awarded shares would vest if the growth in Crodas EPS exceeded CPI plus 3% each year over the three year performance period, with 50% vesting at this level and the maximum 100% vesting for performance of CPI plus 9% each year.
For performance between these two levels, the awards would vest on a straight-line basis.
The maximum performance target was met in respect of the 2005 and 2006 awards.
A revised performance condition for awards made from 2007 onwards is split into two separate parts, each with a separate performance condition.
Half of any LTIP award will vest based on a condition measuring the Companys relative total shareholder return TSR against the constituents of the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
There are a limited number of direct competitors to Croda and the Committee was mindful of the dangers inherent in operating a relative TSR-based performance condition with a comparator group comprised of only a small number of companies.
The FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts was, therefore, considered an appropriate comparator group by the Committee.
Vesting will take place on the following sliding scale: Rank of the Companys TSR against the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts Vesting % TSR part Below median 0% Median 30% Upper quartile 100% Between median and upper quartile 30% - 100% pro rata 29 Directors remuneration report The remaining half of the awards vest based on the same EPS growth condition that is set for the BCIP, with 30% of this part of the award vesting for EPS growth of RPI 12%, rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting for EPS growth of RPI 24%.
2005 & 2006 Awards Post 2006 Awards Adjusted EPS growth over the Proportion of award vesting Adjusted EPS growth over the Proportion of award vesting three year period EPS part three year period EPS part Less than CPI 9% No vesting Less than RPI 12% No vesting CPI 9% 50% RPI 12% 30% CPI 21% 100% RPI 24% 100% Straight-line vesting occurs between these points Straight-line vesting occurs between these points If the performance target is met, the shares will be transferred to the employee.
Awards made in 2010 will remain in line with awards made in 2009 for executive directors in terms of the quantum of awards expressed as a multiple of salary and the performance targets.
The Committee believes that this is entirely appropriate given the strong trading performance delivered in 2009, Crodas share price growth during the course of a turbulent year for global stock markets and the need to retain and motivate the highly performing and well regarded management team.
Senior Executive Share Option Schemes Following the adoption of the BCIP and the LTIP, the operation of the Senior Executive Share Option Schemes has been discontinued except in relation to options already granted.
The only options now outstanding were granted between 2000 and 2003.
The options were granted subject to performance conditions which required basic EPS before exceptional items to grow at RPI plus 7% per annum over the performance period for 100% of the options granted to be exercisable.
The performance conditions have been satisfied in full.
Mike Humphrey is the only director who holds these options and details of his options are shown in the table on page 34.
It is the Companys current intention to satisfy awards under the BCIP and the LTIP and the exercise of share options primarily from shares held in the Employee Share Ownership Trust, treasury shares and shares purchased in the market and not by the issue of new shares.
Details of shares held for this purpose are given in note 25 on page 79.
Share ownership policy The Company has adopted share ownership guidelines which apply to all executive directors and members of the Group Executive Committee and the Group Finance Committee.
Executives are required to build up a target shareholding of shares with a market value equivalent to 100% of salary from time to time through a combination of share purchases and the retention of incentive shares.
On the exercise of SAYE and executive share options or the vesting of LTIP and or BCIP awards, executives are required to retain shares from the shares awarded representing 50% of the net of tax gain until the target is met or exceeded.
The target is expected to be reached within five years.
Both executive directors have holdings well in excess of the target shareholdings.
Pension and other benefits Croda has a number of different pension plans in the countries in which it operates.
Pension entitlements for Crodas executives are tailored to local market practice, the length of service and age of the participants.
The principal pension plans in the UK are defined benefit schemes which provide a pension based on a proportion of final salary.
The Company is flexible in the manner in which pension provision is made for executive directors with the aim of balancing the needs of the director against the liability of the Company.
Hence, it makes contributions by direct contribution to the Croda defined benefit pension scheme or by way of a cash supplement in lieu of pension benefits to enable the funding of personal pension arrangements.
Other customary benefits such as company cars or car allowances, health benefits, the UK SAYE Scheme and the Croda Share Incentive Plan which are available to all eligible UK employees, are made available to executive directors.
Benefits in kind are not pensionable.
The Committee reviews the individual components and the balance of these components from time to time.
Components of senior executives remuneration There are nine members of the Group Executive Committee and Finance Committee in addition to the two executive directors.
The reward structure for these senior executives is broadly similar to that of the executive directors although there are some differences in LTIP participation.
Service contracts and external appointments Policy The Committees policy on executive directors service contracts is for them to contain a maximum notice period of one year.
In respect of termination, the Committees policy is to deal with each case on its merits, in accordance with the law and any further policy adopted by the Committee at the time.
In the event of early termination, other than for cause, the relevant directors then current salary and contractual benefits would be taken into account in calculating any liability of the Company.
For clarification, the Companys policy is that no entitlement to unearned bonus will be taken into account when determining payments on early termination.
The principal contractual benefits provided in addition to salary are the provision of a car, pension, medical insurance and life assurance.
Annual bonuses and long-term incentives are non-contractual and are dealt with in accordance with the rules of the relevant schemes.
30 Directors remuneration report Directors remuneration report Specific contracts Mike Humphrey entered into a new service contract on 21 December 2005 which is terminable by the Company on one years notice and by Mike Humphrey on six months notice.
The Company may also terminate the contract at any time with immediate effect and Mike Humphrey would be entitled to receive compensation equivalent to twelve months salary plus the value of his pension benefits valued at 20% of basic salary, bonus entitlement 50% based on the assumption that performance targets are deemed to have been achieved and the value of other benefits, payable in equal monthly instalments for twelve months or, if less, the remaining period of any notice period not yet completed.
Such payments would discontinue or reduce to the extent that he obtained alternative employment i. e. any such payments would be phased and subject to mitigation to the extent that any alternative employment was commenced.
The Committee has engaged with its major institutional investors and shareholder protection bodies on the issue of the Chief Executives legacy contract during the year under review.
The Committee is aware of the recommendations of the 2008 joint ABI and NAPF statement and the more recent NAPF policy update but has not felt it appropriate to seek to renegotiate the terms of this contract at a time when the Chief Executive has presided over a sustained period of very strong performance, over a matter which is a legacy issue.
As noted above, the contracts of any future executive director appointments, as a matter of policy, would not include provisions on termination for any unearned bonus and, indeed, the Committee is committed to setting future contracts after having due regard to current and emerging best practice guidelines in this area.
Sean Christie has a service contract dated 15 December 2006 with substantially the same terms as those of Mike Humphreys contract except that there is no entitlement to bonus on termination by the Company with immediate effect.
External appointments Executive directors are permitted to accept external non-executive appointments with the prior approval of the Board.
It is normal practice for executive directors to retain fees provided for non-executive appointments.
During the year Sean Christie was a nonexecutive director of Cherry Valley Farms Limited for which he received fees of 25,000.
Apart from service agreements and share schemes, no director has had any material interest in any contract with the Company or its subsidiaries requiring disclosure under the Companies Act 2006.
Policy on non-executive directors remuneration The Board is responsible for determining the policy on, and level of, the remuneration of non-executive directors.
The aim is to attract non-executive directors who through their experience can further the interests of the Company through their stewardship and contribution to strategic development.
The Boards policy is to provide cash fees at a level commensurate with companies of Crodas size, not to grant share options to non-executive directors and to encourage non-executive directors to establish a holding of Croda shares.
Components of non-executive directors remuneration Non-executives pay comprises cash fees, paid monthly.
All non-executive directors are reimbursed for travel and related business expenses reasonably incurred in performing their duties.
Non-executive directors fees are determined on the basis of current fee levels in similar businesses and are reviewed by the Board at least every two years.
The Chairmans fees are determined by the Remuneration Committee and since 1 January 2009 these have been 153,000.
The fees of the remaining non-executive directors are determined by the Chairman and the executive directors.
Since 1 January 2009 the basic annual fee for a non-executive director has been 41,000, with an additional 6,000 for chairing a committee and the Senior Independent Director receiving an additional 3,000.
Terms of appointment The Chairman and non-executive directors have letters of appointment for an initial fixed term of three years subject to earlier termination by either party on written notice.
In each case, this term can be extended by mutual agreement.
They have no entitlement to contractual termination payments.
The dates of their initial appointments are set out below: Original appointment date M C Flower 16 May 2005 M C Buzzacott 2 August 2004 S Musesengwa 7 May 2007 P N N Turner 1 June 2009 31 Directors remuneration report Total shareholder return: Croda International vs FTSE 250 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 31 12 2004 31 12 2005 31 12 2006 31 12 2007 31 12 2008 31 12 2009 Date Croda International FTSE 250 In the opinion of the directors the FTSE 250 is the most appropriate index against which the total shareholder return of the Company should be measured because it is an index of similar sized companies to Croda International Plc.

32 Directors remuneration report Total Shareholder Return Rebased Directors remuneration report Pension rights Prior to 6 April 2006, Mike Humphrey accrued pension benefits under the Croda International Supplemental Scheme CISS.
He will be entitled on retirement at age 60 to a pension equal to his accrued pension at 5 April 2006 accrued at a rate of two-thirds of his annual pensionable remuneration as at 5 April 2006, pro-rated by the ratio of his actual service accrued prior to 5 April 2006 and prospective service to age 60, increased to age 60 at the rate which applies to all preserved pensions in the CISS.
If Mike Humphrey retires before age 60 a reduced pension is payable unless retiring at the Companys request.
In the event of death, a pension equal to two-thirds of the directors pension would become payable to his surviving spouse.
Mike Humphreys pension in payment is guaranteed to increase in line with the rate of inflation up to a maximum of 10% per annum.
During 2009, Mike Humphrey was paid 109,200 2008: 104,004 in addition to his basic salary to enable him to make independent provision for his retirement.
Sean Christie accrues pension benefits under the CISS with an accrual rate of 1 60th and an entitlement to retire at age 65.
If Sean Christie retires before age 65 a reduced pension is payable unless retiring at the Companys request.
In the event of death, a pension equal to 50% of the directors pension would become payable to his surviving spouse.
Sean Christies pension in payment is guaranteed to increase in line with the rate of inflation up to a maximum of 2.5% per annum.
Both Mike Humphrey and Sean Christie are also entitled to death in service benefits from the CISS.

2 The figure represents the difference between the total accrued pension at 31 December 2009 and the corresponding pension at the beginning of the year.
3 The figure represents the difference between the total accrued pension at 31 December 2009 and the corresponding pension at the beginning of the year after an adjustment to exclude inflation was provided as required under paragraph 9.8.
4 Transfer values are quoted on the basis recommended by the scheme actuary for valuation of accrued benefits if the member had transferred benefits to another approved scheme on the relevant date.
The increase in transfer value between 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2009 takes account of changes in market conditions over the period.
5 The figure represents the difference between transfer values of the accrued benefits at 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2008, less contributions paid by the director.
6 The figure represents the transfer value of the increase in accrued benefits over the period, adjusted for inflation, less contributions paid by the director.
7 Following the change to the basis for the calculation of cash equivalent transfer values reported last year, the trustee of the CISS amended the basis further with effect from December 2009.
In the light of changes in market conditions, and based on actuarial advice, the trustee of the CISS amended the basis by reducing the assumed discount rate by 0.5% p. a.
In addition, the mortality assumptions were updated to allow for expected improvements in life expectancy.
In the case of Mike Humphrey, the transfer value figure as at 31 December 2009 would have been around 10% lower, reflecting the fact that Mike Humphrey is closer to the age at which his pension is payable on an unreduced basis.
In the case of Sean Christie, the transfer value figure as at 31 December 2009 would have been around 30% lower if the basis had not been amended.
Members of the CISS have the option to pay voluntary contributions.
Neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in this table.
