An ordinary resolution for the approval of this report will be put forward at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
REMUNERATION AND MANAGEMENT ENGAGEMENT COMMITTEE The Company has five non-executive directors.
The Remuneration and Management Engagement Committee comprises the whole Board.
The fees of the Chairman are 25,000 per annum, of Mr Niven Chairman of the Audit Committee are 18,000 per annum and of the other directors are 16,000 per annum.
Post year end, the Remuneration and Management Engagement Committee has recommended an increase in fees payable to the directors to reflect the increased size of the Company and the increasing responsibilities faced by directors.
The Board of directors has agreed that with effect from 1 March 2010 the fees will be 30,000 per annum for the Chairman, 24,000 per annum for Mr Niven and 20,000 per annum for the other directors.
POLICY ON DIRECTORS FEES The Boards policy is that the remuneration of non-executive directors should be fair and should reflect the experience of the Board as a whole.
The non-executive directors fees are determined within the limits set out in the Companys Articles of Association and they are not eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share benefits, share options, long-term incentive schemes or other benefits.
It is intended that this policy will continue for the year ending 31 December 2010 and for subsequent years.
The maximum level of fees payable, in aggregate, to the directors of the Company is currently 125,000 per annum.
The directors are proposing to increase this level to 150,000 and an ordinary resolution to this effect will be put at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
They believe that this will give them the required flexibility when considering the future Board requirements of the Company.
DIRECTORS SERVICE CONTRACTS The directors do not have service contracts with the Company and no director is entitled to compensation on loss of office.
The directors have appointment letters which do not state any specific term.
However, they are subject to re-election by shareholders at a maximum interval of three years.
