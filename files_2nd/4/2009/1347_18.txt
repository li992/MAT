The Committee implements its remuneration policies by the design of reward packages for executive directors comprising the appropriate mix of salary, performance related annual cash incentive bonuses and share Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 directors remuneration report continued The performance criteria vary by year of award and are as follows: Performance criteria measured over three years Award date Financial year EPS % of award TSR % of award Status 17 8 05 2005 6 2007 8 EPS between 7.7p 12.5% vested From date of grant versus FTSE 250 Index EPS target met in full and 50% of the to 9.1p 50% vested 12.5% at median: 50% at upper quartile award vested.

50% vested 12.5% median: 50% at upper quartile For performance between the lower and upper EPS ranges and, where applicable, also the lower and upper TSR ranges, vesting of the award is scaled on a straight-line basis.
EPS for the purpose of the awards was based on the pro t before tax, exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles less a notional 30% tax charge for awards made for years up to 2006 7.
Thereafter awards have been based on EPS computed using the same pro t fide nition less the actual tax charge included in the accounts.
The Remuneration Committee considers it most appropriate to measure TSR performance relative to the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts rather than a speci c comparator group of companies because there are few direct comparators to the Company listed in London and because the Company is a FTSE 250 company.
Following consultation with the Companys major shareholders in 2008, the Committee reintroduced a TSR performance target for its 2008 9 PSP awards in addition to an EPS target.
Given the cyclical nature of our business the Committee intends to vary the proportion of the performance criteria represented by EPS and TSR over the cycle between 50% 50%, 75% 25% and 25% 75%.
For the forthcoming 2009 10 PSP awards, the Committee intends that vesting will be based as to 75% on TSR and 25% on EPS.
As agreed by the Nomination and Remuneration Committees prior to Joe Phelan joining the Group, Joes 2009 10 PSP award will be enhanced by around 15% $80,000 above the award of 100% of base salary awarded to other executive directors at his level to compensate him for incentives lost when he left his previous employment.
