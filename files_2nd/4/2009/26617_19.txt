Discretionary bonuses The bonus pool is determined by the profitability of the business for the financial year after a charge on surplus capital.
The success of the business is therefore the direct driver of compensation levels the greater the long-term success of the business the greater the rewards for employees.
Employees are measured against both business objectives and competencies, with performance reviews to assess the employees contribution and potential.
Business objectives include building the sustainable profitability of the Company and managing risk within the governance framework.
The purpose is to increase the effectiveness and potential of every Man employee by ensuring that individual objectives are aligned with overall business and department goals.
Senior employees also receive part of their bonus in shares through the Man Group share plans to align them with the shareholders and the future performance of the Company.
Where applicable sales executives are eligible for sales commission based on assets raised.
Following a policy review a number of changes have been made to commission arrangements effective 1 April 2009.
From this date: To increase the discretionary component of compensation and to target a reduction in redemptions, 30% previously 20% of commission raised will be deducted and scored against achievement of target redemption levels and personal objectives: Commission payments will be made semi-annually previously quarterly : and Commission will be deferred into Company shares in the Deferred Share Plan on a scale based on total compensation levels.
Benefits Core benefits are provided to all employees globally, and are driven by local regulations and market practice.
While benefits are specific to location, they generally include retirement, medical cover, life and sickness assurance, and holiday benefits.
On top of this, we provide our employees with a range of additional benefits according to local market.
The Company also seeks to encourage employee share ownership as set out below.

The matching award can be exercised for no payment after four years provided that the employee is still employed by the Group.
The scheme operates on a four to one matching basis.

The current trustees, who are not connected with the Group, are Roanne Trust Company Jersey Limited and Trustcorp Jersey Limited.
The trustees acquire shares in the market, which they will sell on at the prevailing market price on deferred payment terms.
In the case of executive directors, such assistance is subject to prior approval by the Remuneration Committee.
As at 31 March 2009, no directors were receiving such assistance.
Man Group plc 56 Annual Report 2009 Remuneration Report continued Executive directors remuneration policy The Group aims to attract, motivate and retain high calibre executive directors, and align executive remuneration with the interests of the shareholders by paying competitive base salary and benefits, together with bonus and long-term incentive awards which are linked to: the achievement of individual objectives, which are directly aligned to the strategy of the Group and building sustainable profitability: the achievement of the Groups key financial targets as set out in the Financial Review : the creation of long-term shareholder value: ongoing oversight of a robust risk management framework: qualitative assessment of people leadership: and contribution to corporate and social responsibility.
The Company operates in the alternative investment management sector and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 index.
The majority of the Companys competitors are unlisted.
In the alternative investment management sector recruitment and retention of talent is critical and for this reason it is important that the remuneration structure is competitive and enables the Company to attract and retain high calibre executives and employees within this specialised sector.
It is market practice in the alternative investment management industry for the total remuneration package of executives to contain a high proportion of variable pay which is closely aligned with the return to investors.
For this reason, awards under the Companys incentive plans in Company shares constitute a large proportion of the executive directors total remuneration.
This aligns the interests of executive directors and senior executives with the Groups shareholders through the promotion and encouragement of share ownership, and is subject to return on equity and growth in diluted EPS performance targets.
In assessing the competitiveness of remuneration, base salaries, bonuses and long-term incentives have been reviewed against available external market data.
In addition, there is a review of internal relativities within the Company.
These market and internal reviews cover the individual elements of compensation and total compensation.
Whilst the fixed component of remuneration is sufficiently high to allow the Company to operate a flexible bonus policy, to retain incentivisation through the application of its remuneration policy on an annual basis, the Remuneration Committee seeks to give a high proportion of total compensation in the form of variable bonus payments and long-term incentives.
Given the existing share and option plans the Remuneration Committee has, as last year, consciously decided to maximise the non-cash component of executive directors remuneration permitted under the Plan Rules.
Executive directors are required to invest 100% of the amount of their post-tax cash bonus in Company shares before being granted the PSP matching award which constitutes the majority of their long-term incentive award.
As a result, as in 2008, in order to take up the PSP matching award the cash bonus must be invested in Company shares.
These long-term incentives are subject to challenging performance conditions.
The Remuneration Committee has not used its discretion this year to change previously established performance criteria.
The performance conditions for the long-term incentive plans are earnings per share in excess of RPI and post-tax return on capital measured over a three-year performance period.
The performance conditions are not linked to short-term share price movements.
Instead, performance conditions are based on long-term creation of shareholder value.
The performance targets to be met are absolute targets.
They are not relative targets which are easier to achieve when comparator companies have poor results.

Service contracts The Group has service contracts with its executive directors.
The service contracts do not have a fixed term but provide for termination on the expiry of not more than 12 months written notice by either party or at the end of the month during which Peter Clarke has attained the age of 60 and Kevin Hayes has attained the age of 65.
The effective dates of the service contracts are: Peter Clarke 1 April 1997 and Kevin Hayes 31 May 2007.
The service contracts contain no contractual entitlement to any fixed amount of bonus or right to participation in any of the Groups share-based incentive schemes, participation in which is at the Remuneration Committees discretion.
To protect the Groups business interests, executive directors service contracts contain non-compete covenants designed to be applicable to the extent permitted under the law of the relevant jurisdiction.
Under their service contracts, external appointments require Board consent.
The executive directors service contracts do not include any fixed provision for termination compensation.
The treatment of equity awards on termination is covered under the relevant shareholder approved plan rules.
The Remuneration Committee is mindful of the need to consider what compensation commitments, if any, are appropriate in the event of the termination of executive directors service contracts, bearing in mind the Groups legal obligations and the individuals ability to mitigate their loss.
The Remuneration Committee must approve in advance any proposed termination payments.
As stated in the Directors Report, the Company has purchased and maintained throughout the year directors and officers liability insurance in respect of itself and its directors.
Base salary Base salary ranges are established by reference to those prevailing in the employment market generally for executives of comparable status, responsibility and skills.
Particular regard is paid to base salary levels within other leading companies in the financial services sector and the need in many cases to secure the services of senior executives who have international experience and flexibility in job location.
These comparisons are made with the assistance of available independent remuneration surveys.
The previous and current base salaries for the Man Group executive directors are shown in the table below.
Peter Clarke Kevin Hayes Base salary at 1 June 2008 $925,000 $625,000 Base salary at 1 June 2009 $925,000 $625,000 As a US dollar denominated Company, with effect from 1 June 2008 the directors salaries were set in US dollars.
Salaries were reviewed but no increase will be made at 1 June 2009.
Man Group plc 58 Annual Report 2009 Remuneration Report continued Pension and benefit provision All executive directors are eligible to participate in the Groups pension arrangements generally operating in the jurisdiction in which they work.
Alternatively, the Group will, at the executive directors request and subject to applicable limits and regulations, make a contribution of up to 10% of pensionable base salary to a private pension plan nominated by the director.
Full information is provided in the Audited Remuneration Report.
Other benefits provided are set out below.
Provision Policy Private medical insurance Family private medical insurance is provided Life assurance Provides a lump sum payment in event of death: this is set at 4 x base salary subject to a Notional Earnings cap of 123,600 Permanent health insurance Insurance provides 50% of base salary less state benefits in the event of inability to carry on normal duties Holiday pay 30 days paid holiday Assisted purchase scheme See page 55 Other benefits Flexible benefits are provided and can be purchased from base salary Performance related cash bonus All executive directors and senior executives are eligible for an annual performance-related cash bonus, which is non-pensionable.
Although the Remuneration Committee does not consider it appropriate to establish any maximum percentage of base salary payable by way of annual bonus, total bonuses available across the Group for distribution to eligible employees including executive directors are determined by reference to the pre-tax profit after making certain adjustments, including a charge for the capital allocated by the Group to the operation of that business and any credit usage.
Bonuses for executive directors are discretionary.
In considering the appropriate level of bonus for each director, the Remuneration Committee considers: a Strategy assessment measured by the extent to which the individual has achieved Company strategic objectives: b Financial assessment measured by the extent to which the Group has achieved its financial targets: and c Qualitative assessment measured by the extent to which the individual has achieved their agreed personal objectives for the year.
The bonus of each executive director, as determined by the Remuneration Committee against these measures on an individual basis, is shown in the table on page 57.
Bonuses for senior executives below Board level are discussed with the Remuneration Committee and reviewed by it.
Although the bonus is paid in cash, executive directors must defer a portion of the bonus into shares as a precondition of receiving conditional awards of matching shares under the PSP see below.
In 2008 the executive directors deferred 100% of their bonus to take up matching awards made available to them under the PSP.
Long-term share-based incentive schemes Man Group has always sought to facilitate significant equity ownership by directors and senior management, principally through schemes which encourage and assist the purchase of shares with their own money or by way of bonus deferral.
The Board and employees worldwide together currently own an estimated 3% of the Companys share capital, either directly or through employee trusts established and funded for this purpose.
The Board alone directly holds 1% of the issued capital.
The Employee Trusts are included in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Executive directors are currently eligible to participate in the PSP, Assisted Purchase Scheme and ESOS, in each case at the Remuneration Committees discretion.
Both the Board and the Remuneration Committee believe that it is inappropriate to use short-term share price movements as a measure of management performance: true long-term shareholder value will be created through long-term growth in EPS and the maintenance of high levels of post-tax return on capital.
For this reason, these two measures form the basis of the performance criteria applicable to the Groups long-term share-based incentive schemes.
The Remuneration Committee is not aware of any listed companies of substantial size whose main business activities are comparable in nature and scale to that of Man Group, and accordingly the Remuneration Committee does not see any merit in trying to benchmark performance criteria against any other companies.
The Remuneration Committee sets performance conditions to achieve absolute returns, not relative returns, for its shareholders.

For all grants from June 2006 and onwards 50% of each option will vest if the Companys underlying EPS growth in the single three year performance period matches or exceeds the growth in RPI plus 5% per annum, with the entire option vesting at RPI plus 10% per annum.
For all grants prior to June 2006, 50% of each option will vest if the Companys underlying EPS growth matches or exceeds the growth in RPI plus 3% per annum, with the entire option vesting at RPI plus 6% per annum.
Performance criteria are calculated from the end of the financial year prior to the grant of option.
No re-testing of the EPS performance targets will take place for options granted since 2005.
Accordingly, if the targets attached to any option are not reached after three years, the option will lapse.
The Remuneration Committee considers underlying EPS that is earnings from net management fee income, which therefore excludes net performance fee income and exceptional items to be an appropriate target.
The effect of performance fee income is excluded as it can be volatile when comparing between accounting periods.
Long-term incentive plans performance conditions The performance conditions are measured on the performance achieved over a three year performance period.
The shares and options subject to these performance conditions are set out in the Audited section of the Remuneration Report on pages 62 and 65.
The ROE for 2009 is 13.5% see Financial Review on page 67 and underlying EPS is 42.0 cents.
On this basis it will be correspondingly more difficult to achieve these maximum targets for vesting over the next two years.
Therefore the Group still believes that performance conditions are challenging.

Non-executive directors receive a base fee for Board and Board Committee membership and additional fees for additional responsibilities as shown in the table below.
They do not participate in any share option or share incentive schemes.
Fees have been benchmarked to the market and no changes to fee levels were made during the year.
The Chairmans remuneration is recommended by the Remuneration Committee and approved by the Board.
Neither the Chairman nor the non-executive directors take part in discussions or vote on their own remuneration.
Non-executive directors have formal letters of appointment.
These do not contain any notice provisions or provision for compensation in the event of early termination.
The Chairman has a contract with the Company which provides that his appointment as Chairman is terminable on three months notice: there are no notice provisions relating to his appointment as director.
The Boards policy is to appoint non-executive directors for an initial three year term, subject to retirement by rotation and reappointment by shareholders at the AGM, which may be followed by a further three years by mutual agreement.
Any further extension will be by exception and will be subject to rigorous review.
Any director serving for more than nine years is subject to annual retirement and reappointment by shareholders at the AGM.
The initial date of appointment of the nonexecutive directors to the Board, the start date of their current term of appointment and their fee levels are given in the table below.
