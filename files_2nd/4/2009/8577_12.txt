that is at risk in the total remuneration package.
In addition to the above, the remuneration policy for the Senior Executive Group is based on the following key principles: a significant proportion of remuneration should be tied to the achievement of specific stretching performance conditions which align remuneration with the creation of shareholder value: performance is measured over clearly specified time horizons, over the short, medium and long-term, and encourages executives to take action in line with the business strategy without taking excessive risks: and individuals should be rewarded for success and steps should be taken, within contractual obligations, to prevent rewards for failure.
Payments to directors on termination will only reflect contractual obligations.
When developing remuneration policy, the Committee obtains advice from the key advisers outlined on page 53.
The Committee also considers the wider context of the Group when taking decisions.
Components of reward The reward package for the Senior Executive Group consists of a combination of fixed and variable elements intended to provide motivation and reward for short, medium and long-term performance and to retain key executives over the longer term.
Each component is intended to fulfil a different function within the remuneration framework as set out in the table below.

The Trustees of the ITV Pension Scheme updated the transfer value factors over 2009 to allow for increasing evidence that people are living longer than previously expected which has contributed to the increase in the transfer value to 31 December 2009.
The increase in the transfer value also includes the effect of fluctuations due to factors beyond the control of the Company and directors, such as stock market movements.
