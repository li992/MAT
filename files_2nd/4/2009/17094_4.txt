10 Directors Report and Accounts Remuneration report Introduction from Charles Gurassa Whitbread is a people business and its success is dependent on the skills and enthusiasm of the people who work in our businesses.
It is important that our employees are appropriately incentivised and rewarded to continue to deliver outstanding service to our customers and value to our shareholders.
This year we have restructured the remuneration report with the intention of making it more user-friendly and I hope that you will fi nd this new structure helpful.
Immediately below this introduction you will fi nd the TSR graph and a summary of key facts and information about Whitbreads remuneration policy.
This is then followed by a section of questions and answers.
The usual tables outlining directors remuneration, pension arrangements and share scheme participation are at the back of this remuneration report.
The remuneration report will be the subject of a shareholder resolution to be proposed at the AGM.
In accordance with Part 3 of Schedule 7a of the Companies Act 1985, those parts of this report that have been audited are clearly marked as audited information.
In view of the economic environment we have made some changes to our remuneration policy for 2009.
The highlights are listed below: Senior executives, including the executive directors, will not receive a salary increase in 2009: The level of bonus executive directors can earn this year has been reduced.
The on-target bonus has decreased from 87.5% to 77% of salary and the maximum bonus has decreased from 175% to 167% of salary: The range at which bonus is payable compared to budgeted profi t has been widened and the level of performance for maximum payments has been signifi cantly stretched above budget: The EPS targets for the 2009 LTIP awards have been set without reference to the Retail Price Index and at levels that require considerable growth over our 2009 10 budget: and The Committee has established a shareholding guideline for senior executives.
It believes that key executives within Whitbread should have a signifi cant level of shareholding to align them with the Groups shareholders.
Executive directors will be required to build a shareholding of at least 100% of salary within fi five years and senior executives at least 50% of salary.
TSR Graph this is a graph showing the total shareholder return with dividends reinvested in the holdings of the Companys shares against a hypothetical holding of shares in the FTSE 100 Index over a fi five-year period.

co. uk annualreport0809 15 Directors pension entitlements audited information None of the executive directors are accruing benefits under any company pension arrangements other than those disclosed below.
No elements of the executive directors pay packages are pensionable other than base salaries.
Neither the Chairman nor any of the non-executive directors are entitled to participate in any of these pension arrangements.
Defined benefit The defined benefit pension entitlements of the executive directors are as follows: Increase, Transfer value of Accumulated Increase in before inflation, increase, before accrued benefits, accrued benefits in accrued benefits inflation, less any 26 February 2009 during the year during the year directors contributions Alan Parker 128,990 6,142 The transfer value of each directors accrued benefits at the end of the financial year is as follows: Movement, less directors 26 February 2009 29 February 2008 contributions 1 Alan Parker 2,945,158 2,319,169 625,989 Transfer values represent a liability of the pension fund, not a sum paid to the individual.
1 The movement in the transfer values during the year reflects a change in the Trustees basis for calculating transfer values, in line with regulatory changes during the year, as well as the changes in market conditions which define the assumptions to be used in calculating transfer values and the value of the change in the directors accrued benefits during the year.
Alan Parker is entitled to a defined benefit pension under the Whitbread Group Pension Fund as set out in the table above.
He also has an entitlement to a cash sum at retirement in lieu of his benefits from the Whitbread Group Unapproved Pension Scheme.

Patrick Dempsey received employer contributions of 16,666 into the Companys money purchase scheme between his appointment to the Board and the year-end.
# These awards were technically made on 1 March 2009, but are shown as having been awarded during the year for consistency with past and future years.
Participation in the LTIP is available to executive directors and senior executives.
The LTIP aligns the long-term interests of participants with those of the Company and its shareholders and is designed to deliver superior performance from participants and to improve shareholder value.
The LTIP rewards executives with shares rather than cash benefi ts.
Awards are subject to a three-year performance period prior to vesting.
The 2005, 2006 and 2007 awards were made as part of the Whitbread Leadership Group Incentive Scheme.
Executive directors were entitled to an award based on 25% of salary at the threshold level of performance, 62.5% at on target performance and 125% at stretch performance, with a straight line operating in between.
The 2006 award made to Christopher Rogers refl ected the fact that he was a recent joiner with a low level of equity incentives and was not made as part of the Leadership Group Incentive Scheme.
The intention was that he should be appropriately incentivised to deliver excellent shareholder value.
The awards made in 2008 and 2009 were calculated as a percentage of the directors base salary.
In both years Alan Parker received an award to the value of 125% of his base salary and Christopher Rogers received an award to the value of 100% of his base salary.
In 2009 Patrick Dempsey received an award to the value of 100% of his base salary.

co. uk annualreport0809 17 Share Options audited information The Remuneration Committee has no current intention of granting any further executive options.
The last grant made under the Companys executive share option schemes was a one-off grant made on 23 May 2005 as disclosed in the 2004 05 Annual Report and Accounts.
The performance target for this option required Whitbread to have earnings per share growth of RPI plus 4% per annum over the three consecutive financial years which commenced on 4 March 2005.
There was no opportunity to retest the performance condition.
Options granted between 1997 and 2000 could not be exercised unless either adjusted EPS growth exceeded RPI plus 6% over any three consecutive years during the life of the option or TSR exceeded the average of the FTSE 100 Index over the same period.
For options granted between June 2000 and June 2003, the performance conditions required that the Companys adjusted earnings per share exceeded RPI plus 12% measured over any three consecutive years out of the ten year performance period.
For options granted in 2004, the performance target required Whitbread to have an adjusted earnings per share growth of RPI plus 12% in 2006 07 compared to that for 2003 04.
Performance conditions have been satisfied in respect of all options granted between June 1997 and May 2005 and all of these options are currently exercisable.

The awards are not subject to performance conditions and will vest in full on the release date subject to the director remaining an employee of Whitbread at that date.
If the director ceases to be an employee of Whitbread prior to the release date by reason of redundancy, retirement, death, injury, ill health, disability or some other reason considered to be appropriate by the Remuneration Committee the awards will be released in full.
If the director ceases to be an employee of Whitbread for any other reason the proportion of award which vests depends upon the year in which the award was made and the date the director ceases to be an employee.
If the director leaves within the fi first year after an award is made none of the award vests, between the fi first and second anniversary 25% vests and between the second and third anniversary 50% vests.
