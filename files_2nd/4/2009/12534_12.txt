Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements 38 REMUNERATION REPORT Compliance This report has been prepared in accordance with schedule 8 of the Companies Act 2006 and the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008.
As required, this report is being put to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM for an advisory vote.
The sections within this report that have been audited by Deloitte LLP are indicated.
Throughout 2009 the company complied with the provisions of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance the Code regarding best practice on the design of performance-related remuneration.
Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee normally meets at least four times a year and determines the remuneration of the executive directors and senior management.
The Committee is composed entirely of non-executive directors and comprises Mr J R W Orange, who chairs the Committee and is the companys senior independent non-executive director, and Messrs J Darby, D C Lindsell and Professor D G Roberts.
The Board considers that the membership of the Committee is compliant with the Code recommendations, on the basis that it considers Mr J R W Orange to be independent, notwithstanding his length of service.
Mr M W Welton, the companys Chairman, is not a member of the Committee, but attends meetings by invitation.
Mr S C Lockett is not a member of the Committee but attends meetings by invitation, except when his own remuneration is being discussed, to ensure that the Chief Executive is fully aware of discussions concerning remuneration policy and the remuneration packages of its most senior management.
No director of the company is involved in determining his own remuneration.
The determination of the remuneration of the nonexecutive directors is a matter reserved for Board decision.
The Committee acts within its agreed written terms of reference and complies with the relevant provisions of the Code in implementing its remuneration policy.
The terms of reference are published on the companys website www.
The role of the Committee includes: considering and determining the remuneration policy for the Chairman, executive directors and senior management: within this agreed policy, considering and determining the total compensation package of each executive director of the company: considering and advising on the general principles under which remuneration is applied to employees of the company: determining the quantum and performance conditions for awards to be made under the companys long-term incentive schemes: and determining the policy for pension arrangements, service agreements and termination payments to directors and senior management.
The principal focus of the Committee in 2009 has been to ensure that the remuneration packages of the senior executives are set at levels which are sufficient to retain and attract high quality individuals in what remains a competitive market.
The Committee takes independent advice from Hewitt New Bridge Street, a leading firm of remuneration consultants, which is appointed as an adviser to the Committee.
Hewitt New Bridge Street is a trading name of Hewitt Associates Ltd who do not provide any other services to the company.
During the period under review, the Committee sought the assistance of the Chairman and the Chief Executive on matters relating to directors and senior managements performance and remuneration.

Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements 39 Total shareholder return continued The mid-market closing price of the companys shares at 31 December 2009 was 11.05 31 December 2008: 9.85.
The intra-day trading price of the companys shares during 2009 was between 5.93 and 14.33.
The report is divided into two parts: Part A, which is not subject to audit, provides an overview of the companys current remuneration policy for all employees including the executive directors.
Part B, which is audited, shows how the remuneration policy has been applied to executive directors for the year under review and contains tables detailing the directors emoluments for the year ended 31 December 2009, their accrued pensions and their interests under the companys long-term incentive arrangements.
Part A: Remuneration policy The companys remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages which ensure that employees are fairly and responsibly rewarded for their contributions.
The Committee supports the principle of superior remuneration for superior performance.
The aim is to provide remuneration packages which are sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the quality required to achieve the groups objectives and thereby enhance shareholder value.
The Committee takes account of the level of remuneration paid to all employees for comparable positions in similar companies within the industry, as well as pay and conditions throughout the remainder of the group.
The main components of executive directors remuneration are basic salary, an annual performance-related cash and share bonus scheme with a deferred element, benefits, eligibility to participate in the companys long-term incentive schemes and all-employee share schemes and pension provision.
The underlying principle of the companys remuneration policy is to find an appropriate balance between fixed and performance-related elements.
In respect of its senior management, the approach is that the greater part of total remuneration should be delivered through performance-related incentives.
These incentive schemes are designed to align the interests of executives with those of shareholders and establish a clear link between pay and performance.
In line with the Association of British Insurers Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee will ensure that the companys remuneration policy will not raise environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
More generally, the Committee will ensure that the overall remuneration policy does not encourage inappropriate operational risk.
The Committee intends to undertake a review of the companys remuneration structure during 2010 to ensure that it continues to support the business strategy and fairly rewards employees for their performance.
Base salary The remuneration policy applied to executive directors is to position base salaries between the median and upper quartile for comparable positions in similar companies within the industry.
All other employees receive a competitive salary, which targets a salary level positioned at the upper quartile for comparable positions in companies within the industry.
The objective is to ensure that the base salary, when taken together with the rest of the package, provides a competitive but performance-driven remuneration package.
The Committee believes that this positioning is appropriate given the competitive marketplace that exists within the industry in which it operates.
While salary is reviewed by reference to market conditions, the performance of the company and the performance of the individual, the Committee would not regard this element of remuneration as directly performance-related.
The salaries of the executive directors as at 1 January 2010 are as follows: Percentage Salary increase Position from 2009 S C Lockett Chief Executive 435,000 0.0 R A Allan Director Asia 300,000 0.0 A R C Durrant Finance Director 320,000 0.0 N Hawkings Operations Director 300,000 0.0 A G Lodge Exploration Director 300,000 9.1 In light of the conditions in the wider economy, the Committee concluded that it was appropriate for the base salaries of the majority of executive directors to remain unchanged for 2010.
Mr A G Lodge received a salary increase in recognition of his development in his role since appointment in April 2009.
The increase of 9.1 per cent brings his salary into line with that of the Operations Director and Director Asia.
Base salary is supplemented by a number of additional non-pensionable incentive plans, which are designed to reward employees for their performance against challenging corporate objectives which support the long-term growth of the company and focus strongly on creating long-term value.
Each element is discussed in detail below.
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements 40 REMUNERATION REPORT continued Annual bonus scheme A discretionary bonus, which is non-pensionable, may be paid to all employees on the achievement of a challenging range of corporate targets that are set by the Committee each year.
The total annual bonus potential for executive directors is 100 per cent of base salary.
Other employees can earn an annual bonus payment of up to a maximum of 45 per cent of base salary.
An essential element of the companys policy is that, in addition to being an incentive to enhance short-term performance, annual bonuses should also operate to enhance long-term performance and be an effective recruitment and retention mechanism in a competitive market environment.
Accordingly, a proportion of all employees bonuses may, at the discretion of the Committee, be paid as shares, the receipt of which is deferred for three years.
For executive directors annual bonuses, the Committees policy is that 50 per cent is payable immediately in cash, and the remaining half is payable in shares and deferred for three years.
For executive directors only, the deferred element of the annual bonus is contingent upon the relevant beneficiary remaining in employment for the three years from the date of the award, but is not dependent on any further performance-related measures.
The annual bonus scheme for the 2010 financial year has a similar structure to that of 2009 and the same maximum award level.
The performance measures for 2010 are a combination of targets relating to production and development: finance and organisation: exploration: and health, safety, environment and security.
The weighting for each target will be determined by the Committee shortly after the publication of the 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements.
Long-term incentives The company currently operates an all-employee Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, a Share Incentive Plan, a Save As You Earn Scheme for UK-based and expatriate employees only and a historical Asset and Equity Plan AEP.
The Committee also has the discretion to grant Conditional Share Awards to new employees.
Details of the Share Incentive Plan, the Save As You Earn Scheme and the AEP are set out in Part B of this report.
Long Term Incentive Plan The LTIP, an all-employee plan, was approved by shareholders at the 2009 AGM.
The first awards were made in 2009 and will mature at the end of 2011.
The LTIP has been introduced to meet the following objectives: to provide a long-term all-employee scheme, which motivates all employees and provides a longer-term perspective to the total remuneration package: and to create a balance between rewarding employees for delivering returns to shareholders through absolute share price growth and rewarding operational performance through comparative TSR performance.
Absolute share price performance provides alignment between the interests of shareholders and employees via share price performance.
Comparative TSR was selected as the other performance condition as it ensures that the company has delivered competitive returns with respect to the companys most relevant competitors over the performance period, irrespective of general market conditions and movements in the oil price.
Awards under the LTIP comprise three elements: Equity Pool Awards and Performance Share Awards that vest after the expiry of a three-year performance period, and a potential Matching Award that vests at the expiry of a further three-year performance period, commencing at the end of the three-year performance period for Equity Pool and Performance Share Awards.
The performance period for Equity Pool Awards and Performance Share Awards will usually run from 1 January, but in the case of awards granted in 2009, the performance period runs from 1 June 2009 to 31 December 2011.
Equity Pool Award The Equity Pool Award comprises a number of participation points which are allocated to employees at the discretion of the Committee.
The performance condition relating to the Equity Pool Award requires the compound annual growth in the companys market capitalisation over the performance period to be at least 10 per cent.
If it is, a notional pool of value will be created as follows: Notional pool of value created as a percentage of the increase Compound annual growth in the equity pool in the compound annual growth Less than 10 per cent 0 per cent 10 per cent 1 per cent More than 10 per cent but less than 20 per cent Between 1 per cent and 2.5 per cent on a straight-line basis 20 per cent or more 2.5 per cent Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements 41 Equity Pool Award continued The Committee must also be satisfied that the notional pool of value to be created on the above basis is reflective of the underlying financial and operational performance of the company.
In their assessment, the Committee will take account of, amongst other things: return on invested capital: reserve replacement: cash flow: earnings per share: health and safety: and may scale back the size of the notional pool accordingly in the event that overall performance is unsatisfactory.
The notional pool of value will be allocated to employees pro-rata to the number of participation points they hold and converted into a number of shares.
The maximum benefit that an individual may receive will normally be limited to 100 per cent of salary, except where the compound growth rate exceeds 20 per cent, in which case the Committee may increase the limit on such a proportionate basis as it determines to be fair and reasonable.
Performance Share Award The Performance Share Award is over a number of Ordinary Shares in the company, with a value on grant of up to 150 per cent of salary, and is subject to a TSR performance condition.
Performance shares will not vest unless the companys TSR performance over the three-year performance period is at least at the median of a comparator group comprising approximately 35 listed companies in the oil and gas sector, whereby the shares subject to the Performance Share Award will vest as follows: TSR position of the company relative to the comparator group Percentage of shares which vest Below median 0 per cent Median 25 per cent Between median and up to upper quartile Between 25 per cent and 100 per cent on a straight-line basis Within upper quartile 100 per cent The number of shares arising out of the vesting of an employees Equity Pool Award and Performance Share Award will be aggregated and 50 per cent of those shares will be transferred to the employee while the balance will be deferred the Deferred Award.
For executive directors and certain other members of senior management there is a compulsory deferral period of three years, in return for the grant of a Matching Award over further shares.
For all other employees the Deferred Award will vest six months after their deemed grant date, unless the employee elects to defer the vesting for three years in return for a grant of a Matching Award.
Matching Awards The maximum number of shares subject to a Matching Award shall not exceed 250 per cent of the number of shares subject to the relevant Deferred Award.
Matching Awards are subject to a TSR performance condition on the same terms as those applying to the Performance Share Awards except that full vesting will only occur if the companys TSR relative to the comparator group is at a position within the upper decile.
If the companys TSR is at least at the median of the comparator group then the shares subject to the Matching Award will vest as follows: TSR position of the company relative to the comparator group Percentage of shares which vest Below median 0 per cent Median 25 per cent Between median and up to upper decile Between 25 per cent and 100 per cent on a straight-line basis Within upper decile 100 per cent Details of the awards granted to executive directors under this plan are set out in Part B: Outstanding long-term incentive awards.
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements 42 REMUNERATION REPORT continued Executive directors contracts of service Details of the service contracts of the executive directors of the company are as follows: Unexpired term Contract date Notice period of contract Potential termination payment S C Lockett 9 December 2003 12 months Rolling contract 12 months salary and benefits R A Allan 9 December 2003 12 months Rolling contract 12 months salary and benefits A R C Durrant 1 July 2005 12 months Rolling contract 12 months salary and benefits N Hawkings 23 March 2006 12 months Rolling contract 12 months salary and benefits A G Lodge 20 April 2009 12 months Rolling contract 12 months salary and benefits Save for automatic termination when each executive director becomes 60 years of age, the executive directors have rolling service contracts and are subject to re-election by shareholders under the companys Articles of Association and the provisions of the Code.
The service contract of each executive director may be terminated on 12 months notice in writing by either side, in accordance with current market practice.
In such an event, the compensation commitments in respect of their contracts could amount to one years remuneration based on base salary, annual bonus and benefits in kind and pension rights during the notice period.
There are provisions for earlier termination by the company in certain circumstances.
If such circumstances were to arise, the executive director concerned would have no claim against the company for damages or any other remedy in respect of the termination.
There are no other provisions, such as liquidated damages clauses, which expressly provide for compensation in the event of early termination or enhanced provisions in the event of a change of control.
The Committee would apply general principles of mitigation to any payment made to a departing executive director and would consider each case on an individual basis.
External appointments Executive directors are entitled to accept non-executive appointments outside the company providing that the Boards approval is sought.
Mr A R C Durrant currently holds one external non-executive directorship with Clipper Windpower plc and is entitled to retain the fees earned connected therewith 2009: US$64,860 and 2008: US$76,300.

The companys Articles of Association provide that the remuneration paid to non-executive directors is to be determined by the Board within the limits set by the shareholders.
Fees for non-executives are reviewed at least every two years, having regard to the size of the company and the time commitments of the non-executives.
The basic fee for each of the non-executive directors excluding the Chairman at the end of 2009 was 40,000 per annum.
An additional fee of 8,000 per annum is paid per committee chairmanship.
Mr J R W Orange is provided with an additional set fee of 2,000 per annum in respect of his position as senior independent non-executive director.

Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements 44 REMUNERATION REPORT continued Pension schemes The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme in the UK, together with a defined benefit pension scheme the Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan the Scheme.
The Scheme was closed to new members in 1997.
Mr S C Lockett is a member of the Scheme, subject to the earnings cap.
The Scheme is a funded, registered final salary scheme, which provides a pension on broadly a fiftieths accrual basis of up to two-thirds salary at the normal pension age of 60.
Benefits are actuarially reduced on early retirement before age 60 and pensions in payment increase in line with the lower of inflation or 5 per cent per annum.
The company has operated its own cap on pensionable earnings since April 2006, when the external cap was removed.
In the Scheme, the cap is determined at 1 January each year and, for the year to 31 December 2009, this was set at 117,600 increasing to 123,600 for the year to 31 December 2010.
In the companys money purchase pension arrangement, the cap is determined at 6 April each year and, for 2008 09 this was set at 117,600 increasing to 123,600 for April 2009 10.
The company has agreed to provide Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan, A R C Durrant, N Hawkings and A G Lodge with a pension substantially as if they were contributing members of the Scheme and, in regard to service completed subsequent to their appointment as directors, not subject to the earnings cap the pension promise.
The additional value of this target pension provision, relative to the standard terms applied to employees, is made available at the directors option in the form of either an enhanced scale of pension contributions or a non-pensionable salary supplement.
As at the year-end, Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan and N Hawkings had elected to receive pension contributions.
Mr A R C Durrant had elected to receive a salary supplement and Mr A G Lodge had elected for a combination of the two.
Messrs A R C Durrant and A G Lodge received a salary supplement, during 2009, of 56,736 and 22,540 respectively.
Messrs R A Allan, N Hawkings and A G Lodge are members of the companys group personal pension plan.
During 2009, the company contributed 24,420, 24,420 and 12,927 respectively to this plan on their behalf.
In addition, in respect of the pension promise, the company contributed 36,080 into each of Messrs R A Allan and N Hawkings pension funds with the group personal pension plan.
Mr S C Lockett has established his own personal pension plan, to which, during 2009, the company contributed 56,280 in regard to the pension promise.
This is in addition to the company contributions paid into the Scheme on his behalf.
The accrued pension entitlements of the directors who were members or deemed members of the Scheme during 2009 are as follows: b d e g a Transfer value c Transfer value Increase from f Increase Accrued in respect Accrued in respect d to b less Transfer value in accrued pension as at of a as at pension as at of c as at contributions of increase pension 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December by director in accrued excluding 2009 2009 2008 2008 during 2009 benefit inflation 000 pa 000 000 pa 000 000 000 000 S C Lockett 66.6 839.3 54.0 393.2 421.1 124.8 9.9 R A Allan 32.1 491.1 24.8 236.6 237.7 93.3 6.1 A R C Durrant 24.9 392.3 18.5 187.7 186.6 86.7 5.5 N Hawkings 18.8 274.6 13.4 120.1 137.7 68.7 4.7 A G Lodge 3.4 59.0 43.7 59.0 3.4 Notes: The amounts of accrued pension under a and c represent the accrued pension entitlements of the director as at the stated dates.
The transfer values under b, d and f have been calculated in line with the Occupational Pension Schemes Transfer Values Amendment Regulations 2008 SI 2008 1050.
The principal reasons for the increases under e are changes in financial assumptions used to calculate the transfer values.
The amounts under f represent the increase in value of the directors benefits in terms of the value, on the transfer value basis in force at the end of the year, of the excess of the end-year accrued benefits over the start-year accrued benefits as revalued by price inflation less contributions by the directors.
The values stated above correspond with the target level of final salary pension provision: in practice, the pension benefits for these directors are principally established through individual money purchase arrangements and salary supplements.
Thus, in the case of Mr A R C Durrant, who has elected not to receive enhanced pension contributions, the companys pension obligation will be met entirely by the payment of salary supplements.
In addition to the current provision noted above, Mr R A Allan is entitled to a deferred pension under the Scheme in respect of a prior service period with the company between September 1986 and November 1999.
Members of the Scheme have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions: none of the directors have elected to do so.
The following payments were made to a former director of the company in respect of unfunded pension liabilities: Amount of unfunded Amount of unfunded pension paid during 2009 pension paid during 2008 J A Heath 32,818 32,526 Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements 45 Annual bonus scheme Following a review of the 2009 targets as published in the 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements, the Committee agreed that the health, safety, environment and security target 10 per cent of the total maximum award had been achieved, and agreed a 75 per cent award out of the maximum 90 per cent in relation to the finance and organisation, production and development, exploration and new business targets.
This resulted in a total award of 85 per cent of salary 42.5 per cent paid as cash and 42.5 per cent deferred in shares as indicated above for performance against the above targets 2008: 55 per cent of salary, paid as 27.5 per cent cash and 27.5 per cent deferred shares.
The number of deferred bonus shares awarded in 2008 and 2009 were adjusted following the rights issue which took place in May 2009.
The adjusted numbers are quoted in the table above.
Outstanding long-term incentive awards Asset and Equity Plan AEP The AEP expired in 2009 and the award granted in 2008, which will mature at the end of 2010, is the last award remaining under the plan.
The AEP has two plans: the asset pool and the equity pool.
The asset pool is created by reference to the increase in the net asset value per share of the company over a three-year period and the equity pool is created by reference to the increase in equity value per share of the company over a three-year period.
In both cases, no pool is created where the compound annual growth in the relevant measure asset value or share price is below 10 per cent per annum.
At 10 per cent compound growth per annum, 1 per cent of the growth becomes the pool.
At 20 per cent compound growth per annum, 2.5 per cent of the growth becomes the pool.
The size of the pool increases on a straight-line basis between these two points.
In addition, the vesting of awards is subject to the Committee being satisfied that there has been satisfactory improvement in the performance of the company.
In relation to the 2006 AEP Award based on performance over 2006, 2007 and 2008, an independent external valuation of the asset pool was undertaken and the Committee determined the 2006 vesting level as set out in the table below.
50 per cent of the awards were released in cash and 50 per cent in deferred shares.
The minimum vesting threshold for the equity pool was not achieved, resulting in this part of the award lapsing.

Details of outstanding AEP Awards 2007 award As at 31 December 2009, a total of 5,840.67 participation points have been allocated under the 2007 award.
829.50 participation points have been awarded since the date of grant, as time-apportioned compensatory awards to employees who have joined the company during the three-year performance period and 491.80 participation points have been forfeited due to participants leaving the employment of the company.
The increase in aggregate participation points reflects the decision to extend the award to all global employees.
The executive directors have been allocated the following points under the 2007 award: Number of participation points S C Lockett 320 R A Allan 210 A R C Durrant 210 N Hawkings 210 1 A G Lodge 46.7 Notes: 1.
Mr A G Lodge received compensatory points under the 2007 award following his appointment to the Board on 20 April 2009.
The equity pool of the 2007 award was calculated by comparing the market value calculated by reference to the average share price for the three months prior to the date of award 1 January 2007, with the market value similarly calculated to 31 December 2009.
An independent external valuation of the asset pool of the 2007 award will take place following the publication of the year-end results.
If it is determined that the minimum vesting threshold has been achieved, half of any executive directors vested award will be received in shares and the other half in the form of an award of Deferred Shares, which will vest three years later.
2008 award As at 31 December 2009, a total of 7,252.60 participation points have been allocated under the 2008 award.

Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements 47 Details of outstanding AEP Awards continued Details of Deferred Shares and Matching Awards granted to directors under the Asset and Equity Plan are set out below: No.
There are no performance criteria for the Deferred Shares.
Matching Awards granted are the maximum award possible under the Matching Award scheme, subject to performance criteria based on TSR against a comparator group of approximately 35 listed companies in the oil and gas sector.

Share Incentive Plan SIP Under this plan, UK-based and expatriate employees, including executive directors, may make contributions to acquire shares in the company Partnership Shares.
If an employee agrees to buy Partnership Shares, the company currently matches the number of Partnership Shares bought with an award of shares Matching Shares, on a one-for-one basis.
Should an employee leave the SIP scheme before the end of the three-year holding period they will lose the right to the Matching Shares, unless they leave due to injury, redundancy, TUPE transfer, retirement, death or the sale of the company.
In the case of the award of Matching Shares, the company has not required performance criteria to be fulfilled, as the purpose of the plan is to encourage all employees to become shareholders in the company.
The company invites all company employees to make contributions to acquire Partnership Shares on a monthly basis.
During 2009, Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan, A R C Durrant, N Hawkings and A G Lodge contributed the maximum monthly amount of 125 to the plan.
Shares held beneficially in this plan by the directors during the financial year were as follows: Total Total Matching Partnership Partnership Shares and Matching Shares awarded in Shares purchased in 2009 at prices Shares acquired 2009 at prices between 693p held on between Shares held on between 693p and 1303p, 31 December 1 January and 1 January 2009 and 1303p vesting in 2012 2009 24 March 2010 S C Lockett 3,561 145 145 3,851 68 R A Allan 3,552 145 145 3,842 68 A R C Durrant 1,014 145 145 1,304 68 N Hawkings 1,014 145 145 1,304 68 A G Lodge 73 73 146 68 Sourcing of shares and dilution limits The company uses the Premier Oil plc Employee Benefit Trust to satisfy the obligations of the Executive Share Option Scheme, the AEP, the LTIP and the directors deferred bonus shares.
