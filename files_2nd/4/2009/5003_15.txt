In addition to the TSR condition, no awards will vest, irrespective of TSR performance, unless the Companys EPS growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index over the three-year period.
For this purpose, following the introduction of IFRS, the EPS growth will be based on adjusted EPS as disclosed in the Annual Report, except that the Committee may adjust this figure in exceptional circumstances where this is appropriate.
The calculation of TSR performance is performed by Hewitt New Bridge Street, in their capacity as advisers to the Committee.

It is based on the accrued pension increase 2 after deducting the Directors contribution.
The change in transfer value 7 includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and Directors, such as stock market movements.
It is calculated after deducting the Directors contribution.
