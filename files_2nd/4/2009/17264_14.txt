Wolseley plc 67 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Remuneration report continued Capital reorganisation and share issue Following the capital reorganisation and share issue which was completed during April 2009, the Committee reviewed, in accordance with the rules of each of the Companys share schemes, the appropriate adjustments to be made to re ect the dilutive effect of both transactions.
The calculations were made in accordance with HM Revenue and Customs recommendations HMRC.
Such calculations were reviewed by the Companys auditors, who performed speci c procedures to recalculate the adjustments made to outstanding awards, on the basis that the Directors of the Company deemed the adjustments to be fair and reasonable.
After adjustments had been made to outstanding awards to re ect the capital reorganisation, a further adjustment was made using the theoretical ex-rights price calculation TERP as agreed with HMRC.
All outstanding awards made under the Companys share plans were multiplied by a TERP factor of 2.398177677 and the respective option prices and market prices at allocation were multiplied by a factor of 0.416983283.
These formulae were designed to minimise the effect of the capital reorganisation and the share issue upon outstanding awards and, subject to roundings, ensured that the overall value of outstanding awards was the same after adjustment.
The adjustments made to the share incentive awards granted to employees across the Group during the 2008 09 financial year, allowing for lapses of awards in accordance with the scheme rules, which occurred after the relevant dates of grant and prior to the capital reorganisation and share issue, are shown below: Number of Original adjusted awards number of Original award options Adjusted award Date of grant share awards option price outstanding in option price Scheme award options granted pence April 2009 pence Wolseley plc 2002 Long Term Incentive Scheme October 2008 3,315,432 287.25 782,014 1197.78 Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 October 2008 23,796,393 320 5,693,384 1334 Savings Related Share Option Schemes April 2009 9,492,134 168 2,252,630 701 UK and Ireland Employee Share Purchase Plan April 2009 3,269,857 178 718,450 743 Wolseley European Sharesave Plan April 2009 1,916,272 178 458,473 743 Directors interests in shares audited Director share ownership The interests of the Directors in of ce at 31 July 2009, and A share ownership programme was introduced with effect of their connected persons, in the ordinary shares of the from 1 August 2004.
