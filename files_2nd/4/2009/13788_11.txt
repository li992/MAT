The aim is to provide remuneration packages which are sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the quality required to achieve the Groups objectives and thereby enhance shareholder value.
The Committee takes account of the level of remuneration paid to Executive Directors and senior managers of comparable public companies and best practice standards.
It is the intention that this policy will continue to apply for 2010 and subsequent years subject to ongoing review as appropriate.
The main details of the Executive Directors Service Agreements relating to base salary, annual bonus, share plan awards, pensions and other benefits for 2009 are as set out below: Service agreements The Service Agreements for the Executive Directors are for no fixed term and may in normal circumstances be terminated by either party on giving six months notice.
The Company reserves the right and discretion to pay the Executive Director in lieu of notice.
If the Company terminates the employment of an Executive Director by exercising its right to pay in lieu of notice, the Company is required to make a payment equal to the aggregate of basic salary and the cost to the Company of providing other contractual benefits which excludes bonus for the unexpired portion of the duration of any entitlement to notice.
If, within 12 months of a change of control, the Company terminates the employment of an Executive Director in breach of the terms of his Service Agreement in circumstances where the Company is not entitled to terminate the Executive Directors employment, the Executive Director will be entitled to payment of a fixed sum equal to six months base salary not including accrued bonus.
In return for the payment of such a fixed sum, the Executive Director agrees to waive, release and discharge any entitlement to further or additional compensation of any kind whatsoever.
Date of contract Notice period James Menzies 29 11 06 Six months Mike Buck 29 11 06 Six months Nick Cooper 29 11 06 Six months Salary The annual base salaries of the Executive Directors for the year to 31 December 2009 were as follows: Salary s James Menzies 315,000 Mike Buck 237,930 Nick Cooper 262,500 The salary of each Executive Director is subject to regular review by the Remuneration Committee and such a review took place in December 2009.
With the exception of Mike Buck, base salaries were not raised in 2009.
It is expected that approximately 33% of Executive Directors remuneration will be fixed with the remaining performance related.
Bonus Each of the Executive Directors is eligible for a discretionary annual bonus up to a maximum of 100% of their base salary.
The bonus may only be payable to the extent that individual and corporate performance targets set by the Remuneration Committee are achieved in the relevant year.
39 Corporate governance Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2009 Remuneration report continued Bonus continued Performance targets cover the following areas: Share price performance Business development Operational delivery Finance Performance share plan PSP In accordance with the Companys Performance Share Plan PSP and at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, all eligible employees including Executive Directors may be awarded Share Options in the Company Awards.
The Committee supervises the operation of the PSP including the levels of awards made to employees and Executive Directors.
During the year, as approved by the Shareholders at the 2009 Annual General Meeting, a new deferred bonus scheme replaced the PSP for certain employees but not directors, recognising that the PSP continuing to apply to all employees was not appropriate.
The PSP is intended to facilitate the retention and incentivisation of employees of the Group and to align their interests with those of shareholders by enabling employees, including Executive Directors, to receive shares in Salamander, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions and continued employment.
At 31 December 2009, a total of 3,860,196 options over ordinary shares representing 2.5% of the Companys issued share capital of 152,781,255 ordinary shares at the year end were outstanding and granted to eligible employees including the Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the PSP provides an appropriate degree of flexibility in the way in which a share based incentive arrangement can be operated by the Group, while giving due consideration to best and market practice.
The maximum value of shares over which awards may be granted under the PSP to an Executive Director in any financial year will not normally exceed 100% of that individuals base salary.
In circumstances where the Committee considers it appropriate to do so, including the recruitment or retention of an employee, the Committee by exception may exceed this 100% limit at its discretion.
Awards vest on or following the third anniversary of the date of grant once the Committee has determined the extent to which the applicable performance condition see below has been satisfied and provided the participant remains an employee with the Group.
Awards, once vested, will normally remain capable of exercise for a period of twelve months.
Awards granted to all employees, including the Executive Directors, will vest based on Salamanders relative total shareholder return TSR performance against an industry-specific peer group of companies drawn from the constituents of the FTSE 250, FTSE Small Cap and AIM listed companies in the Oil and Gas Producers sector with market capitalisations in excess of 100 million at or around the date of grant.

30% of the Award will vest if the Companys TSR performance ranks the Company at the median of the peer group, 100% of the Award will vest if the Company ranks in the upper quartile and there will be straight line vesting between 30% and 100% if the Company ranks between the median and the upper quartile of the peer group.
Further information regarding Share Based Payments is included in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements.
Benefits Executive Directors receive a defined pension contribution or salary supplement in lieu of pension contributions equal to 15% of their salary, private medical cover and life assurance of up to four times salary.
