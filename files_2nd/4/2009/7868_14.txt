68845 IMI AR pp36-60:Layout 1 22 3 10 16:29 Page 46 remuneration report Overview During the year the Remuneration Committee reviewed the remuneration policy with particular emphasis on ensuring alignment with the business strategy for the creation of shareholder value and appropriate consistency with current market and best practice guidelines.
Some special measures were adopted in 2009 after shareholder consultation and approval at the annual general meeting.
These measures were in response to the unusually volatile and uncertain economic conditions.
For 2010 the committee has decided to revert for the most part to previous incentive arrangements but to maintain a freeze on executive directors salaries for a second year in a row.
A summary of the measures taken in 2009 and the changes to be made in 2010 is set out below: Base salaries: reflecting the wider initiatives to control fixed costs across the Group, no base salary increases were awarded to the executive directors and the other most senior executives in 2009.
No base salary increases for executive directors have been awarded in 2010.
Annual bonus: in recent years, IMI has used a selection of bonus metrics to support the corporate strategy.
This continues and the relevant bonus metrics for 2009 were operating profit before tax and exceptional items, profit drop through percentage reflecting the priority of minimising the impact on profit of reduced revenues, and cash conversion percentage to ensure that cash is managed effectively across the Group.
Additionally, some non-financial measures including health and safety and improvements in ethics and compliance processes are included in the annual incentive plan.
The same metrics will be used in 2010 except that return on sales will replace profit drop through.
For all executive directors, the level of bonus normally payable for achieving target performance was reduced from 60% of salary to 40% in 2009, and the level of stretch performance above target required for maximum bonus was increased.
The maximum bonus potential for 2009 was reduced from 150% to 130% of salary for the Chief Executive and from 125% to 115% of salary for the Finance Director.
The committee has restored maximum bonus potential for 2010 to 2008 levels in light of the Group's trading performance, but has set the on-target bonus at 50% of salary rather than the previous 60%.
Separately, the committee has increased Roy Twites bonus maximum from 100% to 115% of salary in 2010 in recognition of his current Board and operational responsibilities and individual performance.
Finally, the power to seek claw-back of bonuses in certain circumstances was introduced in 2009 and will be retained in 2010.
Share Matching Plan: changes in relation to this co-investment plan were introduced in 2009 as follows: i to allow a higher level of match to be available on voluntary deferral of bonus: ii to permit executives to make additional voluntary contributions from their own monies up to their maximum bonus potential : and iii to change the performance metrics to be applied to the matching awards by adopting a mix of alternative targets including three consecutive annual targets based on the primary financial metrics for annual bonus.
The plan will continue to operate in this way for the 2009 awards, but it is intended to revert to three year economic value added targets for 2010 matching awards.
Performance Share Plan: in response to the difficulty in 2009 in setting a robust three year earnings per share target, awards made under this plan in 2009 were solely subject to a relative total shareholder return performance condition for previous grants 50% of the awards were based on relative total shareholder return TSR performance and 50% on earnings per share performance.
For awards to be made in 2010 it is intended to revert to using a combination of earnings per share and TSR but also to adopt a new performance measure, return on operating capital employed, for 25% of performance share awards to incentivise sustained working capital improvement: earnings per share will be the measure for 50% of the total award opportunity, total shareholder return for 25% and return on operating capital employed for the remaining 25%.
Share ownership guidelines: these were increased in 2009 to 125% of salary for executive directors previously 100% to be achieved by 30 June 2011 for the current executive directors and, for new appointments, within five years of joining the Board.
All of the executive directors had exceeded their share ownership guideline as at 31 December 2009.
Share awards under the Share Matching Plan formerly the Deferred Bonus Plan, Performance Share Plan and the legacy Deferred Share Plan due to be released over the Easter bank holiday period in 2010 were amended to allow for release in the week before Easter.
Implementation of an executive retirement plan: this is an unregistered defined contribution pension plan for UK senior managers, designed to give more flexibility to senior staff in planning for their retirement.
The first contributions will be made in 2010 following the sacrifice of certain cash-based remuneration by executive directors and other participants see page 54 for more details.
At the 2010 annual general meeting shareholder approval is sought to amend the Share Matching Plan and the Performance Share Plan so that the awards can, at the Remuneration Committees discretion, be settled as employer contributions to the executive retirement plan or other pension and employee benefit trust arrangments or in cash.
This is subject to the requirements of the share ownership guidelines.
46 Remuneration Report 68845 IMI AR pp36-60:Layout 1 22 3 10 12:10 Page 47 Composition The members of the Remuneration Committee throughout the year were Bob Stack Chairman from 12 June 2009, Kevin Beeston Chairman until 12 June 2009, Terry Gateley, Anita Frew and Norman Askew, the Companys non-executive Chairman.
In accordance with the Combined Code, all of the foregoing non-executive directors were regarded by the Board as independent and Norman Askew was considered independent on his appointment as Chairman of the Company.
Role The Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration policy and rewards for the Chairman and the executive directors.
The committee also reviews the packages of those at the next most senior level of management.
A copy of the Remuneration Committees terms of reference is available from the corporate governance section of the IMI website.
Advice received The committee consulted the Chief Executive, Martin Lamb, regarding the remuneration policy and the packages of the other executive directors and senior managers.
It also received the advice and services of the Finance Director, Douglas Hurt, the Group Human Resources Director, Matt Huckin and the Company Secretary, John OShea, who is secretary to the committee.
None of these executives was involved in determining their own remuneration.
Independent remuneration advisors, Hewitt New Bridge Street have been appointed by the committee to provide advice on directors remuneration to the committee.
These advisors also attended certain meetings at the request of the committee.
Fees paid in the year in respect of work for the committee were 230,000.
During the year Hewitt New Bridge Street also provided advice to the Group Human Resources Director in relation to the implementation of the committees decisions.
The terms of engagement with the committees advisors are available on request from the Company Secretary.
Non-executive directors remuneration and terms of appointment The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined, after reference to external benchmarks, by the Chairman and the executive directors.
The non-executive Chairmans remuneration is determined by the Remuneration Committee in his absence.
The policy on non-executive remuneration is to pay an appropriate level on a comparative basis for their time and work on the Board and its committees.
They do not participate in any bonus or employee share schemes of the Company and no part of their remuneration is conditional upon the performance of the Company.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is shown in the table on page 55 and was last revised in November 2007.
Annual remuneration in 2009 was as follows: Chairman 195,000.
Non-executive directors including committee membership fees 45,000.
Additional remuneration for chairing a committee 10,000.
Additional remuneration for the senior non-executive director 5,000.
No changes in these remuneration levels are proposed for 2010.
The Board has established a shareholding guideline for non-executive directors, each of whom is encouraged to build up a holding of at least 7,500 shares, or 10,000 shares in the case of the Chairman, within a reasonable period of appointment.
All of the non-executives held the relevant number of shares at the year end see table of directors interests on page 59.
The normal period for initial appointment and first renewal is three years.
The appointment of the Chairman is set to run until May 2011.
After six years, renewal is considered on an annual basis and this currently applies to Terry Gateley.
Appointments are made under a letter of agreement subject to retirement by rotation and removal under the Companys articles of association.
There are no provisions for the Company to give notice or pay compensation in relation to the early termination of the appointment of the Chairman or any non-executive director.
There is a provision in the appointment letters to the effect that a non-executive director is normally expected to give at least one months prior notice of termination to the Company.
The dates and unexpired terms of the letters of appointment for the non-executive directors, which are available for inspection at the annual general meeting and at the Companys registered office, are as follows: Date of letter Unexpired term as at Date of appointment of appointment 31 December 2009 as a director N B M Askew 14.05.08 1 year 4 months 14.05.05 K S Beeston 12.06.09 1 year 2 months 08.03.05 A M Frew 29.01.09 2 years 2 months 02.03.06 T M Gateley 12.06.09 10 months 01.11.03 R J Stack 12.06.09 1 year 6 months 13.06.08 IMI plc Annual Report 2009 47 68845 IMI AR pp36-60:Layout 1 24 3 10 11:54 Page 48 remuneration report Executive directors remuneration and terms of appointment Statement of policy The Company aims to ensure that remuneration generally and incentives in particular provide strong links between individual performance and shareholder interests.
The remuneration policy also recognises that the Company operates in global and highly competitive markets with the vast majority of its activities outside the UK.
The policy is to provide competitive remuneration packages to attract, motivate, reward and retain executives of the calibre required, and to align their interests with those of shareholders by relating a significant element of the remuneration package to specific short and long term performance measures.
The Remuneration Committee considers it to be important to maintain the flexibility to respond to individual circumstances.
However, its normal approach has been to pay salaries within appropriate market competitive ranges, combined with realistic potential for above market total compensation if performance is outstanding.
Remuneration comprises basic salaries, annual performance bonuses and benefits in kind, pension arrangements or a cash allowance and participation in a share matching plan and a performance share plan.
In setting the remuneration of each executive director, the Remuneration Committee takes into account their role and responsibilities, skills and individual performance and makes reference to market rates as evidenced by published studies and comparisons with international UK-based groups of a similar size and complexity.
In connection with this the committee considered benchmarking data prepared by Hewitt New Bridge Street.
The committee uses such data with caution in view of the risk of an upward ratchet of remuneration levels.
It also has regard to pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group.
The committee has the discretion to take account of environmental, social and corporate governance matters when setting the remuneration of the executive directors.
The policy of the committee is to set performance conditions for incentives which are both stretching but also reasonably attainable in the environment in which the Company is then operating.
The charts below show the fixed and performance related elements of the Chief Executives remuneration at both target and maximum based on the proposed 2010 incentive arrangements assuming maximum personal investment in the share matching plan and excluding the impact of changes in share price.
This supports the committees policy that a significant proportion of remuneration should be performance related.
The mix of remuneration for the other executive directors is broadly comparable, although their maximum bonus potential and maximum matching plan awards are lower.
Chief Executive Chief Executive Target remuneration Maximum remuneration 29% Fixed pay salary 16% Fixed pay salary 71% Variable pay 84% Variable pay annual bonus and long-term annual bonus and long-term incentive awards incentive awards Consistent with the policy on service contracts, the executive directors service contracts are subject to termination on one years notice by the Company or the executive.
Contractual retirement age for directors is 65.
These contracts do not 48 Remuneration Report 68845 IMI AR pp36-60:Layout 1 20 3 10 07:09 Page 14 include any specific provision for compensation payable upon early termination.
It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee to limit any compensation which might be paid in the event of early termination of an executive directors contract to the legal minimum, taking into account mitigation and other relevant factors.
The dates of the contracts and period to normal retirement age for those serving as executive directors during the year are as follows: Period to normal Date of retirement age as Date joined appointment Date of service at 31 December Group to Board contract Notice period 2009 M J Lamb 31.10.86 18.07.96 24.01.08 12 months 15 years 1 month D M Hurt 01.05.06 01.07.06 01.10.06 12 months 11 years 6 months D C Nicholas 08.03.04 08.03.04 01.10.06 12 months 5 years R M Twite 26.09.88 01.02.07 01.02.07 12 months 22 years 5 months D C Nicholas retired as a director on 1 September 2009.
Base salary Salary reviews for the executive directors are conducted annually with any increases effective from 1 January.
Salaries are set by the Remuneration Committee taking into account external benchmark data looking at UK listed companies of similar size, complexity and international presence, the executives role, responsibilities and individual performance and pay conditions elsewhere in the Company.
The normal policy is to pay salaries within appropriate market competitive ranges for each role.
Reflecting the wider initiative to control fixed costs across the Group, the executive directors salaries were not increased in the annual reviews conducted in either December 2008 or December 2009.
The salaries for the 2010 financial year will therefore remain as follows: M J Lamb - 656,000.
The committee acknowledges the leadership example shown by the executive directors and certain other senior executives in accepting a salary freeze for two consecutive years.
Annual bonus Executive directors are awarded annual performance bonuses.
Maximum bonus is only payable if the stretching targets set by the Remuneration Committee are met.
Details of the structure and metrics are given on page 46 in the section headed Overview.
The committee retains power to reduce or withhold annual bonus payments in exceptional circumstances and following best practice in 2009 it introduced the power to seek claw-back of bonuses in certain cases where the bonus should not have been paid in the first place.
Under the rules of the newly introduced executive retirement plan ERP, directors and senior managers may waive their bonus entitlement.
The Remuneration Committee may then choose, at its discretion, to make a contribution into the executive retirement plan on their behalf.
The Chief Executive waived his 2009 bonus entitlement and the Company has exercised its discretion to make contributions to the ERP during 2010.
IMI plc Annual Report 2009 49 68845 IMI AR pp36-60:Layout 1 22 3 10 15:42 Page 50 remuneration report Long term incentive arrangements The Company operates two share incentive plans for executive directors: 1. the Share Matching Plan formerly the Deferred Bonus Plan which is a co-investment arrangement: and 2. the Performance Share Plan which is a conventional long term incentive plan.
Share Matching Plan The Share Matching Plan SMP runs in conjunction with the annual incentive plan and is linked to the achievement of the share ownership guidelines for executive directors and senior executives.
Under the SMP individuals may defer up to 100% of their maximum annual bonus potential into shares subject to annual approval by the Remuneration Committee.
The committee intends to allow such a level of investment in 2010.
By investing in the SMP, matching shares may be earned, which vest after three years, subject to the achievement of stretching performance conditions.
It is intended that awards made under the share matching arrangements, which are settled in shares, will be satisfied through shares purchased in the market.
The executive directors and senior executives are subject to share ownership guidelines.
To the extent that an individual does not meet their shareholding guideline, then up to 50% of the annual bonus opportunity will be paid in the form of shares and a matching award will be made under the share matching plan at a lower level.
If the individual meets the shareholding guideline, then the taking of bonus in shares will be encouraged through participation in the SMP with matching at a higher level.
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to apply discretion in awarding bonuses and performance shares and may exercise this freedom should an executive not achieve their share ownership guideline within a reasonable period.
For awards made in 2008 and previous years, the maximum level of match was 1:1 for the other executive directors and 1.25:1 for the Chief Executive.
From 2009, matching awards allowed for a higher level of match up to 2:1 for shares that are voluntarily purchased through the investment of deferred bonus or other monies.
The lower levels of match apply to up to 50% of annual bonus that is to be compulsorily paid in shares where an executive has not met their share ownership guideline.
With the exception of awards made in 2009, the matching share awards are subject to economic profit, also known as economic value added EVA, based performance conditions over a three year performance period.
Where EVA performance conditions apply to the awards they were tiered with linear progression within each band.
The calculation of EVA is based on segmental operating profit after tax, with appropriate adjustment for restructuring costs, less a capital charge on the invested capital in the business reflecting IMIs cost of capital.
Further details of the performance conditions attaching to existing awards are set out in the notes to the table on page 57.
For the matching awards granted in 2009 the EVA performance condition was replaced with a series of performance measures, as summarised in the operating section on page 46 headed Overview and the notes to the table on page 58.
The first SMP awards were made in 2006 dependent upon performance over the three year period to 31 December 2008 and vested in 2009 at 100% of maximum.
The 2007 SMP awards will vest in 2010 at 63.5% of maximum.
Performance Share Plan The Performance Share Plan PSP allows for share-based awards worth up to the maximum of 100% of annual salary.
Details of the awards made under the PSP are contained in the table of directors awards on page 57.
The vesting of awards is subject to the satisfaction of stretching performance conditions over a three year period.
Our policy is for PSP awards, which are settled in shares, to be satisfied through shares purchased in the market.
For awards made in and before 2008, one half of the award is subject to an earnings per share EPS performance condition and the other half to a comparative total shareholder return TSR target.
EPS was chosen as an appropriate measure because it rewards absolute growth in underlying earnings and because the Remuneration Committee believed it worked well in combination with TSR which is a comparative measure.
TSR is well understood and accepted as a performance measure for long-term incentives and links rewards to shareholder value.
Details of the performance conditions attached to awards granted under the PSP are shown in the notes to the table on page 57.
The first PSP awards were made in 2005 and were based on performance for the period 2005 to 2007.
These awards vested in 2008 at 50% of maximum nil vesting for the TSR element and full vesting for the EPS element.
The PSP awards made in 2006 vested in 2009 at 70.1% of maximum 20.1% for TSR and 50% for EPS and the 2007 awards will vest in 2010 at 44.7% of maximum 25.1% for TSR and 19.6% for EPS.
In response to the difficulty in setting a realistic three year EPS target in 2009, awards granted under the plan in 2009 were only subject to a relative TSR performance condition.
It is intended to revert to a mixture of measures for awards to be made in 2010 with EPS accounting for 50% of the award, TSR for 25% and a new measure, return on operating capital employed, for the remaining 25%.
50 Remuneration Report 68845 IMI AR pp36-60:Layout 1 20 3 10 07:09 Page 16 The TSR comparator group for awards made in 2008 and 2009 and for awards to be made in 2010 are shown below: Name Country Name Country Amada Japan Johnson Matthey United Kingdom Atlas Copco A Sweden Manitowoc United States BBA Aviation United KingdomMeggitt United Kingdom Bodycote International United Kingdom Metso Corporation Finland Borgwarner United StatesNSK Japan Charter United Kingdom Parker-Hannifin United States Cobham United KingdomPentair United States Cookson Group United KingdomRotork United Kingdom Eaton United States Sandvik AB Sweden Emerson Electric United States Seco Tools B Sweden Fanuc Japan SKF B Sweden Flowserve Corp United StatesSMC Japan GKN United KingdomSpectris United Kingdom Halma United Kingdom Spirax-Sarco Engineering United Kingdom Heidelberg Druck Germany Sulzer AG Switzerland Honeywell United StatesTHK Japan IDEX Corp United States Tomkins United Kingdom Illinois Tool Works United States Tyco International United States Ingersoll-Rand United States Weir Group United Kingdom Invensys United Kingdom Yaskawa Electric Japan Country is shown as country of primary listing.
Note: Enodis and FKI had been included in the comparator group but were taken out because they had delisted.
The 2010 comparator group will be the same as it was in 2009 subject to any delistings.
TSR is defined as the movement in the share price during the performance period on a local currency basis with adjustments to take into account capital adjustments and changes and dividends which are assumed to be reinvested in shares on the ex-dividend date.
The vesting schedule for the element of awards subject to the TSR performance condition is as follows: Ranking Vesting Upper quartile top 25% or above 100% Between median and upper quartile Pro-rata between 25% and 100% Median 25% Below median 0% IMI plc Annual Report 2009 51 68845 IMI AR pp36-60:Layout 1 22 3 10 15:43 Page 52 remuneration report Long term incentive arrangements continued Performance Share Plan continued To ensure that TSR reflects improvement in the underlying performance of the Company the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the financial performance of the Company over the performance period warrants the level of vesting as calculated under the TSR condition.
In the event that the Remuneration Committee is not satisfied in this respect on the vesting of a PSP award it has committed to disclose the factors that it reviewed and give a commentary on its decision.
The performance condition for one half of the intended 2010 PSP awards will be based on the Companys compound annual earnings per share growth over a three-year period.
The Remuneration Committee sets the EPS targets in respect of each annual award at the level it considers appropriately stretching given the conditions in which the Company is operating.
The vesting schedule for the awards subject to the EPS performance condition proposed to be granted in 2010, which is the same as for the 2008 awards, is as follows: Compound EPS growth Vesting 15% per annum 100% Between 6% and 15% per annum Pro-rata between 25% and 100% 6% per annum 25% Less than 6% per annum 0% The EPS measure for 2010 PSP awards will be based on IFRS earnings per share subject to certain adjustments including the elimination of the after tax cost of restructuring, acquired intangible amortisation and impairment, other income and financial instruments excluding economic hedge contract gains and losses.
The vesting of the final 25% of the 2010 PSP awards will depend on IMIs average return on operating capital employed ROOCE over the three years from 2010 to 2012, and will be calibrated as follows: Average ROOCE Vesting 32% 100% Between 25% and 32% Pro-rata between 25% and 100% 25% 25% Less than 25% 0% UK SAYE plan The Company operates an HM Revenue and Customs approved savings-related share option scheme which is open to the majority of the Groups UK employees, including the executive directors, and allows the grant of options to all participants at a discount of up to 20% below the market price.
Such schemes are not subject to performance conditions and offer tax incentives to encourage employees to use their own money to purchase shares in their employers business or group.
UK All Employee Share Ownership Plan Executive directors also participate in an All Employee Share Ownership Plan which is open to the majority of the Groups UK employees.
In 2010 shares to a value equal to the lesser of 3,000 and 0.6% of each participants basic salary will be acquired at market value by the trustee of the plan in respect of their participation during 2009.
The plan is not operated subject to specific performance conditions but the level of shares awarded to participating employees is set taking into account performance, in particular that of the UK operations of the Group.
Eligible employees are also able to invest up to 1,500 annually in a tax-efficient manner in purchasing partnership shares under the plan.
Each of the executive directors makes the maximum contribution from their salary towards partnership shares under the plan.
Up to two matching shares may be awarded for every one partnership share acquired under the plan, although the policy to date has been not to award any matching shares.
52 Remuneration Report 68845 IMI AR pp36-60:Layout 1 22 3 10 15:44 Page 53 Share Option Plan A share option plan for senior employees was established in 2009 but awards under it are not made to executive directors or others who receive PSP awards.
Share ownership guidelines The shareholding guidelines were increased in 2009 to 125% of salary for all the executive directors to be achieved by 30 June 2011 or, for new appointments, within a five year period after joining the Board.
All of the executive directors met the guidelines at the year end.
The levels of holdings at the end of 2009 were as follows: Level of share ownership at 31.12.09 using average December Executive director share price and 2009 salary M J Lamb 314% D M Hurt 219% R M Twite 182% Share dilution The Association of British Insurers has set recommended guidelines on the number of new issue and treasury shares that can be used under a companys share plans.
The guidelines are 10% of the issued share capital in any 10 year period for all share plans, with an inner limit of 5% in 10 years for executive schemes.
IMI operates within these limits and its standing as at 31 December 2009 was 2.5% and 3.8% respectively.
Pension entitlement Executive directors except for Douglas Hurt participate in the IMI Pension Fund.
Their normal retirement age under the Fund is 65, although Martin Lamb may elect to retire and receive a pension at any time after age 57 without any actuarial discount and Roy Twite may retire at any time after age 60 without actuarial discount.
On death after retirement, a dependants pension is provided equal to two-thirds of the members pension for Martin Lamb and David Nicholas, and 50% of the members pension for Roy Twite.
Should Martin Lamb or David Nicholas die within the first five years of retirement, a lump sum is also paid equal to the balance of five years pension payments.
For Roy Twite, the dependants pension is increased to 100% of the members pension for the remainder of the five year period.
Pensions in payment, in excess of any guaranteed minimum pension, are increased each year in line with price inflation up to a maximum of 5% in respect of pension built up before 1 January 2006, and 2.5% in respect of pension built up after 1 January 2006.
IMI plc Annual Report 2009 53 68845 IMI AR pp36-60:Layout 1 22 3 10 15:46 Page 54 remuneration report Pension entitlement continued Martin Lamb opted-out of the IMI Pension Fund in April 2006 and receives a taxable cash allowance equal to 35% of his basic salary instead of accrual for future service from that date, although accrued benefits generally continue to be linked to final salary inflation and Fund benefits were preserved in relation to ill-health retirement, death-in-service and termination after age 50 for redundancy or otherwise at the Companys insistence.
Douglas Hurt and Roy Twite each received a taxable cash allowance equal to 35% of their basic salary instead of pension benefits Roy Twite having opted-out of the IMI Pension Fund from 31 January 2007, retaining a deferred pension in respect of pensionable service to that date.
David Nicholas retired as an employee on 11 December 2009 on attainment of age 60 receiving a pension without actuarial discount in accordance with the rules.
The policy regarding pension arrangements for new appointments will be flexible to take account of the individual position, the cost of pension arrangements to the Company, including in particular the cost of defined benefits, and the alternative forms of pension provision.
However, the norm would be not to offer defined benefits to new executive directors.
The executive retirement plan ERP was introduced in 2010 as a tax efficient means for UK senior managers to save for retirement outside of the registered pensions regime, and the associated HMRC limits on pension savings, which apply under the registered regime.
Executive directors are entitled to receive a taxable cash allowance instead of pension benefits.
They may waive some or all of this cash allowance, and any annual bonus award, and the Remuneration Committee may then choose, at its discretion, to make a contribution into the ERP, which is an unregistered defined contribution arrangement structured as an offshore trust.
Such contributions to the ERP in respect of executive directors are determined on a basis that is intended to be cost neutral to the Company.
Subject to amendments to the SMP and PSP being authorised at the 2010 annual general meeting, it will be possible for awards to be settled in the form of employer contributions to the ERP.
In 2010 Douglas Hurt and Roy Twite sacrificed their cash allowances payable in lieu of pension benefits and the Company has exercised its discretion to make contributions to the ERP.
Martin Lamb has similarly sacrificed 43% of his cash allowance payable in lieu of future accrual in the IMI Pension Fund, as well as his 2009 annual bonus entitlement, and the Company has also exercised its discretion to make contributions to the ERP during 2010.
Save as indicated below, the remainder of this report has been audited.
External appointments Executive directors may accept one external appointment with the consent of the Board, and are normally allowed to retain fees from external non-executive directorships.
Martin Lamb was appointed a non-executive director of Severn Trent Water plc on 29 February 2008 and received fees in the year to 31 December 2009 of 42,500 2008: 35,351.
2 M J Lamb has waived his bonus entitlement and the Company has made discretionary contributions into the executive retirement plan described on page 54.
3 D C Nicholas retired as a director on 1 September 2009 and retired as an employee on 11 December 2009.
Remuneration shown above as salaries for non-executive directors includes fees of 205,000 2008: 240,000.
No compensation for loss of office was paid to or receivable by any director in 2009 and none was payable in respect of the retirement of David Nicholas.
Benefits in kind provided to executive directors consist of the provision of private health care arrangements and all employee share ownership plan awards.
All executive directors elected for a cash alternative, instead of a company car.
Sums paid by way of taxable allowances in the above table include cash allowances instead of company car and pension benefits.
