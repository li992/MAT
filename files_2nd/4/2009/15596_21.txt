Vesting will normally be conditional on the achievement of specified performance targets related to the return on capital employed in the us business over the seven-year plan.
the targets are set out under table 7.
2 the maximum number of shares which may be awarded under the us Ltip is two million shares to the us ceo and 1.5 million shares to any other participant.
an award of two million shares was made to tim mason, us ceo, in november 2007. awards may be adjusted to take account of any dividends paid or that are payable in respect of the number of shares earned.

the profit pool will be capped at 10% in any one year and is expected to be approximately 5% of cumulative eBit over the four measurement years 2010 11 to 2013 14. the portion of an award which may vest will be determined by reference to the value of the eBit pool as well as performance against the roce hurdles for the relevant year, as outlined in the table above.
to the extent that the roce hurdles for any one year are met either in full or in part, but there is insufficient value in the profit pool to fund the vesting of awards, then the actual vesting in that year will be scaled back so that the profit pool is not exceeded.
that portion of the award that has not paid out in that year due to the profit pool being restricted may vest in future years, provided that the profit pool in any later year permits this.
4 the targets for the us Ltip have been based on the business plan in respect of the initial phase of the us business.
the remuneration committee has the responsibility to review these targets in light of the scale and scope of the us business in order to ensure that they remain appropriate and challenging.
