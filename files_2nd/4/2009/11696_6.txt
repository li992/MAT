AGE CHANGED DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued PSP awards will vest subject to the achievement of 3-year targets based on cumulative profit before tax PBT for the Group.
During the year awards made to all employees across the Group including executive directors were based on 3-year Group PBT.
The cumulative Group PBT targets that apply to the awards made in 2009 are as follows: Cumulative PBT over 3 years % of total Award shares vesting 145 million 100% Between 85 million and 145 million Between 25% and 100% pro rata 85 million 25% Less than 85 million Nil The Companys policy is that PSP awards will be satisfied using shares purchased in the market via the Companys employees share trust.
During the year the executive directors received PSP awards over shares worth 100% of their basic salary.
Cumulative PBT targets are proposed for 2010 also, but with a revised target range of 255 million 25% vesting and 285 million 100% vesting.
SHARE OPTION PLANS The Board believes that share ownership encourages employees to contribute further towards improvements in the Groups performance.
To this end, the following share option plans have been established by the Company.
A regular savings plan the Sharesave Plan, which is open to executive directors and employees of the Group and under which options, granted at an initial discount of up to 20% against the quoted market price, are normally exercisable on completion of a three-year SAYE contract.
An HMRC Approved Discretionary Plan the Approved Pan under which all employees, including full-time directors of the Company or any subsidiary, who do not have and have not had within the previous twelve months a material interest in the Company, are eligible to participate.
Participation is at the discretion of the Board, acting in accordance with the recommendations of the Committee.
Under the Approved Plan, options are granted at the prevailing quoted market price and may usually be exercised between three and ten years from the date of the grant.
The maximum award of options to any employee pursuant to the Approved Plan is 30,000.
The Company adopted its first Approved Plan in 1996 and a new Approved Plan at the AGM in September 2005.
An Unapproved Discretionary Plan Unapproved Plan, which is similar to the Approved Plan, although certain rules of the Approved Plan are not included e. g. the exclusion of employees who have a material interest in the Company.
The Company adopted its first Unapproved Plan in 1996 and a new Unapproved Plan at the AGM in September 2005.
The maximum award of options under the Unapproved Plan to any employee in each year is 200% of salary or in exceptional circumstances as determined by the Committee 400% of salary.
A Discretionary Unapproved Scheme 2000 2000 Unapproved Scheme which was discontinued in August 2005.
Under the 2000 Unapproved Scheme options were granted at the prevailing quoted market price and became exercisable vest as to 25% each anniversary after the grant over a four-year period.
Under this scheme options were granted up to a limit such that unvested options may not exceed four times annual remuneration.
Although the 2000 Unapproved Scheme has been discontinued outstanding options previously granted survive until exercise or lapse.
In granting options under the Approved Plans and the Unapproved Plans, the Board may include objective performance targets or other conditions as it thinks t and has included such performance conditions based on growth in earnings per share EPS of 15-18% above the Retail Prices Index RPI over a three-year period in all grants under the 1996 Approved Plan and 1996 Unapproved Plan prior to 2005.
Under the 2000 Unapproved 23 PACE PLC ANNUAL REPORT Scheme performance conditions of 6% per annum compound above RPI were applied to the grant of options thereunder.
Initial performance targets for the 2005 Approved and 2005 Unapproved Plans set in 2005 required a minimum growth in EPS of a compound 3% per annum above growth in ination over a three year period at which level there is 25% vesting.
Compound growth of 6% per annum above ination is required for 100% vesting, with vesting on a sliding scale between these two target thresholds.
In setting targets for option grants during 2006, the Committee was mindful of the need for targets to reect a return to profitability and significant improvements in earnings.
Accordingly, during the financial year ending 2 June 2007 all options granted were subject to performance conditions based on growth in the pre-tax profits of the Group PBT over a period of three financial years with 25% of options vesting at 6.9 million PBT in the third financial year and 100% of options vesting at 17.2 million PBT in the third financial year, with vesting on a sliding scale between these two target thresholds.
These target thresholds were approved after adjustment by decision of the Committee having taken external advice to take account of the shortened financial year ending 31 December 2007.
During the 7-month period ending 31 December 2007, the Committee continued to adopt performance conditions based on PBT and options granted to employees during the period were subject to conditions such that 25% of options would vest at 20 million PBT in the third financial year and 100% of options vesting at 30 million PBT in the third financial year ending 31 December 2009.
During the year ending 31 December 2008 the Committee adopted performance conditions based on cumulative growth in EPS requiring a minimum growth in EPS of 4% per annum above ination over a three-year period at which level there is 25% vesting.
Cumulative growth of 8% per annum above ination is required for 100% vesting.
During the year ending 31 December 2009 the Committee adopted similar performance conditions for option grants but increased the EPS growth required for maximum vesting from RPI 8% to RPI 15% per annum as a result of its remuneration review concluded in 2009.
The Committee believes EPS to be appropriate to help enhance alignment of the senior executive with shareholder interests whilst still maintaining focus on profitability across the senior management team.
The Committee considered these targets to be stretching for the Company, reecting its stage of growth at the time of the award.
These options remain exercisable only after 3 years from the date of grant.
In order to assess whether the performance conditions have been met, the Committee will utilise the earnings gures derived from the audited financial statements of the Group adjusted to exclude exceptional or other items that the Committee determines appropriate to ensure they reect underlying long term performance.
As a result of the introduction of the Performance Share Plan as the Companys primary long-term incentive, option awards in 2010 and in subsequent years will be targeted at the Companys most senior executives and be based on a xed number of options rather than value related to an individuals performance and contribution subject always to the discretion of the Committee to utilise other award criteria in exceptional circumstances.
Furthermore, the Committee proposes to adopt a similar approach regarding the setting of cumulative EPS performance targets as in 2009, and these will remain unchanged for option grants in 2010.
A separate share option plan has been established for the benefit of the Groups US employees.
Such plan operates within the overall limit on issue of new shares of 10% of the Companys issued share capital applicable to all the Groups employee share schemes.
The Pace Americas Sharesave Plan is based on the Pace Sharesave Plan rules and is designed to satisfy the US Internal Revenue Service requirements for such saving-for-shares plans.
MINIMUM SHAREHOLDING Following the review of the Groups remuneration policies completed in February 2009 the Committee introduced individual shareholding target requirements for members of the Executive Committee including executive directors in the region of 1 x salary with a requirement subject to a discretion of the Committee for such executives to retain a portion of any net awards ie after tax and exercise cost of new vested share-based incentives until the target shareholding level is reached.
