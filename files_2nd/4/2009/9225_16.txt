He is a member of the Executive Section of the LPP and started receiving his pension from the LPP on 1 September 2009.

The transfer value figures below have been provided by the independent actuarial advisers appointed by the Trustees of the LPP, in accordance with the LPPs agreed transfer value policy.

A transfer value represents a liability of the LPP but not a sum paid or due to the individual.
