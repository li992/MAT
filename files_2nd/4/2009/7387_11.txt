the policy for remuneration of Executive Directors was benchmarked against employment and remuneration polices across all employees.
64 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009 Remuneration Committee report continued Remuneration policy 2009 Overall policy The Remuneration Committees policy during the year under review was to set the main elements of the remuneration package at the following quartiles in comparison to the Companys Comparator Group: Annual bonus Potential total short-term Potential annual Potential total Base salary potential Pension Benefits in kind remuneration available share awards compensation value Lower Quartile Upper Quartile Lower Quartile Lower Quartile Median to Upper Quartile Median to to Median to Median to Median Upper Quartile Upper Quartile This supports the performance based culture of the Company.
Fixed costs are minimised and total The policy in respect of long-term short-term remuneration will only reach and exceed the median if the performance-based bonus incentives and potential compensation is earned for the relevant financial year.
value is an extension of the policy on total short-term remuneration.
Executives will only receive a market competitive package if the annual bonus and long-term incentives are earned.
With the difficult global economic backdrop to 2009 and the banking industry turmoil, there has been much focus on executive pay as a potential causal factor in the banking crisis.
This has had widespread coverage and has generated significant political pressure for change to the practices of the financial services industry in particular.
This culminated in the publication of the Walker Review in November 2009, making a number of new recommendations of principle to be applied to remuneration in the financial services sector from the 2010 reporting year onwards.
In addition, there have been a number of associated publications from shareholder bodies and institutional investors clarifying their expectations for remuneration in 2009 and a draft revised UK Corporate Governance Code has been issued for consultation.
In formulating the application of its policy for 2009 and future years, the Remuneration Committee has been cogniscent of the evolving landscape in remuneration developments.
The Remuneration Committee is confident that its policies remain effective and robust.
2009 Comparator Group During 2009 the Company updated its Comparator Group to ensure that it remained appropriate for the Company on an ongoing basis, reflecting the increase in size and further internationalisation of the Company and reacting to the significant consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry that had affected a significant proportion of the previously selected Comparator Group companies.
The constituents of the Companys Comparator Group CG for benchmarking remuneration during 2009 were as follows: Name Name Name Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc Hospira Inc. Sanofi Aventis AstraZeneca PLC Impax Labs Inc Sepracor Inc. BTG PLC King Pharmaceuticals Inc. Shire Pharmaceuticals PLC Crucell NV Merck KgaA UCB SA Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings Mylan Inc Valeant Pharmaceutical International Forest Laboratories Inc Novartis AG Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc Grilfols SA Prostraken Group PLC Factors the Remuneration Committee took into account when selecting the 2009 CG included: the industry within which the Company operates, specifically taking into account both the international nature of the Companys business and its competitors: the international nature of the Companys current executive team and potential recruits to that team: the market capitalisation, turnover and number of employees of the Company: and the UK listing environment of the Company.
Governance and financial results 65 Throughout this report, references to quartiles are to quartiles in the Comparator Group.
The 2009 Comparator Group was used as the total shareholder return performance condition comparator group for awards granted in 2009 under the Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP and will also be used for the 2010 LTIP Awards.
The Company has historically used the same comparators for both benchmarking remuneration and the performance condition for awards granted during the relevant year, and will continue to do so in 2010.
Ongoing review The Remuneration Committee continues to review the remuneration policy on an annual basis to ensure it remains appropriate for the financial year under review.
Factors taken into account by the Remuneration Committee include: market conditions affecting the Company: the recruitment market in the Companys sector: changing market practice: changing views of institutional shareholders and their representative bodies: and the current economic climate.
The Remuneration Committee has oversight of the main reward structures throughout the Company and was involved in the Company review mentioned above.
Following both this Company review and the Committees specific review for Executive Directors the Committee is satisfied that the Companys incentive structures are consistent with the risk profile of the Company set by the Board and also encourage a long-term sustainable view to be taken by participants.
One of the features of the Companys remuneration which the Committee believes is particularly relevant in this context is the availability of plans encouraging wide share ownership at all levels of management.
It is the current intention of the Remuneration Committee to apply the 2009 policy in 2010.
2009 Balance between fixed and variable performance-based compensation The chart below demonstrates the balance between the potential fixed and variable performance-based compensation for each Executive Director for the year ended 31 December 2009.
Fixed compansation Variable performance is calculated as: compensation is calculate as: Salary Maximum bonus available Benefits Fair market value of maximum Pension contribution potential LTIP award Said Darwazah 39.4% 60.6% Mazen Darwazah 40.8% 59.2% Elements of Executive Directors remuneration Base salary Policy 2009 and 2010 Lower quartile to median The Companys remuneration policy is to set the levels of base salary for the Executive Directors below the median to support a performance based culture.
When determining the base salary of the Executive Directors the Committee takes into consideration: the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity, in particular the lower quartile and median salary levels of those comparable companies within the pharmaceuticals industry and the Comparator Group: the performance of the individual Executive Director: the individual Executive Directors experience and responsibilities: and pay and conditions throughout the Company.
66 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009 Remuneration Committee report continued The following tables summarises the base salary of Executive Directors: Median Rise 2009 2010 in Comparator Name Salary Salary Rise Group Said Darwazah $630,000 $630,000 0% 7% Median $1,082,000 Lower quartile $804,000 Mazen Darwazah $420,000 $420,000 0% 11% Median $500,000 Lower quartile $432,000 After reviewing the above criteria, the Committee elected not to increase Executive Directors salaries for 2010.
It remains the Committees ongoing policy that, save in exceptional circumstances, only modest rises in base salary should be required.
Annual performance related bonus Policy 2009 and 2010 Upper quartile bonus potential Bonus payments are not pensionable.
The following tables summarise the main features of the Companys executive bonus plan.

It is possible for exceptional performance to earn up to a total maximum bonus of 200% of salary.
The maximum bonus potentials for 2010 will remain the same as those applied for 2009.
The bonuses for 2009 have been paid on the basis of the level of the achievement of the performance targets.
The table below shows the principal performance targets used for 2009 and their percentage satisfaction.
Percentage of maximum Percentage bonus potential satisfaction of Percentage of subject to target bonus target salary payable Said Darwazah Profit after tax 50% 96% 48% Operational milestones 30% 16% 5% Personal business targets 20% 100% 20% Total 73% Mazen Darwazah Profit after tax 50% 96% 48% Operational milestones 30% 33% 10% Personal business targets 20% 75% 15% Total 73% The targets for the annual bonus plan are reviewed and agreed by the Remuneration Committee each year to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and position of the Company and in order to ensure that they continue to remain challenging.
Underlying performance targets for Executive Directors bonuses were reviewed during 2008 to ensure that they remained in line with the Groups overall business strategy in 2009.
The Committee applied the same parameters in 2009 and it is the opinion of the Committee that the overall nature of the conditions remains appropriate for the requirements of the Group in 2010.
Governance and financial results 67 Share incentives Policy 2009 and 2010 Upper quartile The Remuneration Committees policy is to provide annual share grants to senior executives at a maximum of the upper quartile level compared to the Comparator Group.
Ongoing share incentives are provided to the Executive Directors solely through the LTIP.
The Remuneration Committee believes that share awards under the LTIP enable the Company to provide a competitive incentive and retention tool which is also cost effective in respect of both shareholder dilution and income statement expense.
Furthermore, the proposed grant of awards with 1 the attached performance condition ensures that the Companys comparative Total Shareholder Return TSR performance against the Comparator Group is at least at the upper quartile before executives receive the full benefit of their share incentives.
This structure demonstrates the Remuneration Committees desire to correlate incentive arrangements with the achievement of substantial performance.
The Remuneration Committee granted the following awards to executive directors during 2009.
UQ in CG Percentage percentage Name of salary of salary Said Darwazah 127.3% 283% Mazen Darwazah 114.5% 176% In 2009 the Company introduced a new Management Incentive Plan.
The levels of LTIP awards made in 2009 therefore reflect the smaller population of participants in the LTIP.
The following table summarises the main features of the LTIP in 2009 and its proposed operation during 2010.
Maximum annual grant face value as percentage of salary and performance condition Maximum annual grant 300% current normal operating maximum set by the Remuneration Committee 200%.
The Awards will be subject to comparative TSR performance against the Comparator Group.
20% of Awards will be released for median performance with full release occurring for upper quartile comparative performance.
The Remuneration Committee will also ensure that the underlying financial performance of the Company is consistent with its TSR performance.
When considering this underlying financial performance the factors taken into account by the Remuneration Committee will include profit after tax, revenue growth and the achievement of operational milestones.
Said Darwazah Mazen Darwazah 2 Maximum grants for 2010 face value as a percentage of salary 200% 200% The following table sets out the level of release of current subsisting LTIP awards if the Companys performance measured as at 31 December 2009 continued until the end of the relevant performance period.
Percentage of Award released if performance measured as at 31 December 2009 continued to the end of the relevant LTIP Grant Company TSR ranking against CG performance period 2007 LTIP Grant Fourth of 17 companies 100% 2008 LTIP Grant Ninth of 17 companies 20% 2009 LTIP Grant Second of 20 companies 100% It should be noted that the real value received by the Executive Directors under the share incentive arrangements will be dependent upon the degree to which the performance conditions are satisfied at the end of the three year performance period and the share price of the Company at that time.
1 Total Shareholder Return TSR is a measure showing the return on investing in one share of the Company over the performance period the return is the value of the capital gain and reinvested dividends.
It is normally used comparatively and the Company which achieves the best return is ranked number one.
2 Face value for awards under the LTIP face value is the aggregate market value of the shares subject to the award at the date of grant.
68 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009 Remuneration Committee report continued Basis of performance condition selection and measurement Comparative TSR was selected as the performance condition for the proposed awards by the Remuneration Committee as it ensures that the executives have outperformed their peers over the measurement period in delivering shareholder value before being entitled to receive any of their awards irrespective of general market conditions.
The Remuneration Committee will provide a full explanation and justification at the time of the release of the award and why it believes that the underlying financial performance of the Company is consistent with this TSR performance.
The Remuneration Committee determines whether the performance conditions for share awards are satisfied.
The Committee has appointed  LLP to assist in the ongoing calculation of TSR in accordance with the rules of the LTIP.
The Committee will approve these figures prior to the release of any award.
Dilution In accordance with the guidelines set out by the Association of British Insurers ABI the Company can issue a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital in a rolling ten year period to employees under all its share plans and a maximum of 5% of this 10% for discretionary share plans.
Under the LTIP rules, grants of no more than 3% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company may be awarded in the first three years following the Companys IPO, undertaken in 2005.
The following table summarises the current level of dilution resulting from Company share plans following the IPO: Share awards as a percentage Share awards as a percentage of issued share capital as at of issued share capital as at 31 December 2009 in a rolling 31 December 2009 granted Type of plan ten year period during the year All Employee Share Plans 10% limit 0% 0% Discretionary Share Plans 5% limit 2.145% 0.77% The Company has not implemented any all-employee share incentive arrangements.
It is the Companys current intention that LTIP awards granted in 2009 will be satisfied by newly issued shares.
Post-employment benefits Policy 2009 and 2010 Lower quartile to median The Executive Directors participate in the Hikma Pharmaceuticals Defined Contribution Retirement Benefit Plan the Benefit Plan in accordance with the Rules of the Benefit Plan relevant to employees of the Group based in Jordan.
Under the Benefit Plan the Group matches employee contributions made to the Benefit Plan.
These are fixed at 5% of applicable salary.
Participants are entitled to 30% of the Groups contributions to the Benefit Plan after three years of employment with the Group, and an additional 10% in each subsequent year.
The participants interest in the Groups contribution fully vests after ten years of employment.
The following table sets out the percentage post-employment contributions compared to the Comparator Group.
Said Darwazah Mazen Darwazah Company 1.35% 1.86% Upper quartile 30% 25% Median 25% 15% Lower quartile 15% 10% In addition, pursuant to applicable law, each of the Executive Directors receives contributions as a percentage of salary which is paid by the Group into Government social security systems.
Benefits in kind Policy 2009 and 2010 Market practice The Company provides the normal benefits in kind for executives of this level in a company of this size, such as company cars, healthcare and life insurance.
Governance and financial results 69 Total compensation Policy 2009 and 2010 Median to upper quartile depending on performance The following table shows the value of each of the main elements of the remuneration package provided to the Executive Directors during the year ended 31 December 2009.

The Committee, however, wholeheartedly supports the alignment of interests created by a minimum level of executive shareholding and should the make-up of the Board change would consider the introduction of a formal shareholding requirement.
Management Incentive Plan MIP During 2009 the Company made the first awards to management under the MIP.
Under the MIP, the Company will make grants of nil cost option awards to executive management across the Group based on the satisfaction of annual performance targets.
The key features of the MIP are as follows: the MIP is open to management level employees across the Group below senior executive level: participation in the LTIP will preclude participation in the MIP: participants will be notified of a maximum monetary entitlement, the maximum award level is anticipated to be 50% of salary p. a. the value of which will be awarded to participants in the form of nil cost options over shares, based on annual performance against individual and Group KPIs: nil cost options will vest two years after the date of award being approximately three years after the commencement of the financial year to which the award relates, subject to the participant remaining in employment with the Group during this period.
Once the options have been awarded, the continued employment requirement is the only condition for vesting.
The MIP awards made in respect of 2009 will be satisfied out of market purchased shares held for the purpose in the Groups Employment Benefit Trust.
The AGM to be held on 13 May 2010 the Company will seek approval from shareholders to satisfy ongoing awards under the MIP from newly issued shares.
The principal terms of the MIP will be set out in a Circular accompanying the Annual Report.
Executive Directors contracts Details of the service contracts of the Executive Directors of the Company in force at the end of the year under review are as follows: Name Company notice period Contract date Unexpired term of contract Potential termination payment Said Darwazah 12 months 1 July 2007 Rolling contract 12 months salary and benefits Mazen Darwazah 12 months 25 May 2006 Rolling contract 12 months salary and benefits The Executive Directors contracts are on a rolling basis, unless terminated by at least 12 months written notice.
This arrangement is in line with best corporate practice for listed companies.
In the event of the termination of an executives contract, salary and benefits will be payable during the notice period there will, however, be no automatic entitlement to bonus payments or share incentive grants during the period of notice other than in accordance with the rules of the relevant incentive plan.
The Remuneration Committee will ensure that there have been no unjustified payments for failure on an Executive Directors termination of employment.
There are no special provisions in the contracts of employment extending notice periods on a change of control, liquidation of the Company or cessation of employment.
70 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2009 Remuneration Committee report continued External appointments The Committee recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to take up non-executive directorships or public sector and not-for-profit appointments, and that these can broaden the experience and knowledge of the director, from which the Company can benefit.
Executive Directors may therefore accept such appointments as long as they do not lead to a conflict of interest, and are allowed to retain any fees paid under such appointments.
During the year under review, Said Darwazah and Mazen Darwazah received fees of US$11,850 and US$3,385 respectively, in respect of such appointments.
Non-Executive Directors Fees Policy 2009 Upper Quartile The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board based upon recommendations from the Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice Chairman and is within the limits set by the Articles of Association.
The nature of the Companys business is international, requiring the Non-Executive Directors to travel to the USA, Middle East and Europe.
The Board is therefore made up of Non-Executive Directors with a wide range of experience both in the UK and internationally.
The use of options for Non-Executive Directors is very prevalent in the US and also to some extent internationally.
However, as a UK listed company complying with UK best practice it is not considered appropriate to grant options to the Companys Non-Executive Directors.
To ensure that the Company remains able to attract the appropriate calibre of candidate and to take account of its inability to grant options, the Board has therefore set its fee policy at the upper quartile.
The individual basic and committee fees, which are paid in Sterling, are as follows: 2009 2010 Upper quartile Total fee Basic fee Chairmanship fee Committee fee Total fee fees in CG Name 000 000 000 000 000 000 Samih Darwazah 157.5 157.5 157.5 293 Michael Ashton 67.5 63 7.5 7.5 78 136 Ali Al-Husry 60 63 63 129 Breffni Byrne 75 63 15 7.5 88.5 139 Ronald Goode 60 63 7.5 70.5 135 Sir David Rowe-Ham 67.5 63 7.5 7.5 78 135 A review of the level of Non-Executive Director fees was conducted during 2009.
The Board commissioned  LLP to conduct a study of non-executive remuneration against the Comparator Group.
This showed that, in relation to the overall Non-Executive Director fee policy set by the Group, Hikmas Non-Executive Director fees remained out of step with those of the Comparator Group.
Following the review it was resolved by the Board that the composition of the Non-Executive Director fees should be updated to reflect not only the work undertaken as a chairman of a board committee, but also as a member of Board committees.
Therefore, a Board committee membership fee will be paid in addition to the basic fee to those Non-Executive Directors who sit on the board committees.
In conjunction with the review the Board also resolved that from 1 January 2010, the basic fees of Non-Executive Directors should be increased to the amounts set out above.
There has been no change in the fees of the Non-Executive Chairman.
The increases continue to move Non-Executive fees back towards the Groups stated policy, though overall Non-Executive fees remain below the level set by Group policy.
The Board continues to believe that it is important to ensure that the fees paid to Non-Executives remain competitive, that they reflect the increasingly important role played by Non-Executives and allow the Nomination Committee to recruit Non-Executive Directors of the appropriate calibre in accordance with the requirements of succession planning.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any bonus plan or share incentive programme operated by the Company and are not entitled to pension contributions or other benefits provided by the Company.
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts, but have letters of appointment with the Company.
Each appointment is terminable on one months notice from either the Company or the Director, but is envisaged to be for an initial period of up to 36 months, subject to the terms of the Companys Articles of Association, the Companies Act and shareholder approval.
