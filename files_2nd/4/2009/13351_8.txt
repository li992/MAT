Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements Directors remuneration report Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors remuneration in the Combined Code.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements are subject to approval.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on the part of the Directors remuneration report subject to audit and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information Remuneration Committee The Company has established a Remuneration Committee the Committee which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code.
The members of the Committee during the year were Tony Hughes and John Jackson, who were both independent non-executive Directors.
The Committee is chaired by Tony Hughes.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest in the Company other than as shareholders.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board.
No Director plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
In determining the other executive Directors remuneration for the year the Committee consulted Alan Jackson non-executive Chairman about its proposals.
Hewitt New Bridge Street appointed independent advisers who provided no other services to the Group during the year provided advice to the Committee, encompassing all elements of the remuneration packages.
Remuneration policy Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain executive Directors of the high calibre needed to progress and develop the Group and to reward them for top quartile sector performance and enhancing value to shareholders.
The performance measurement of the executive Directors and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the Committee.
In addition, the Committee determines the remuneration for the Chairman.
The remuneration of the other non-executive Directors is determined by the Board.
The Companys policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive Directors should be performance related.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for executive Directors: Basic annual salary and benefits for 2009 no increases were applied to any Directors salary and for 2010 a 1.5% increase has been applied: Annual bonus payments which cannot exceed 100% of basic salary for 2010 120% in 2009 for executive Directors: Long-Term Incentive Plan awards: and Pension arrangements.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the Company or Group and there is no requirement for Directors to remit any fees to The Restaurant Group plc.
Andrew Page was appointed as a non-executive director of Arena Leisure plc on 1 December 2008 and received fees as a non-executive director of Arena Leisure plc of 45,000 in 2009 2008: 3,750.
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2009 29 Directors remuneration report continued Basic salary An executive Directors basic salary is determined by the Committee prior to the beginning of each year and when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a whole and by reference to remuneration levels at other companies in the leisure and hospitality sectors.
Following a recommendation from the executive Directors to hold salaries, the Remuneration Committee determined at the December 2008 salary review that no increase to the basic salary of executive Directors would be applied for the 2009 financial year.
At the December 2009 review, it was determined that basic salaries for executive Directors should increase modestly for the 2010 financial year, with such increases capped at 1.5%.
This is below the average salary increase of 2% provided to other employees in the Group.
2008 2009 2010 Basic salary Andrew Page 535,000 535,000 543,000 Stephen Critoph 240,000 240,000 243,500 Trish Corzine 230,000 230,000 233,500 In addition to basic salary, the executive Directors receive pension contributions and certain benefits-in-kind, principally a car or car allowance, and health and life insurance.
Annual bonus payments The annual bonus is based on the achievement of stretching profit before tax targets and personal objectives.
Performance targets are set annually as part of the budgeting process and performance is reviewed against those targets at the end of the financial year.
The maximum performance-related bonus that can be paid in respect of performance in 2010 is 100% reduced from the 120% limit operated for 2009 of basic annual salary and for significant bonuses to be paid, performance must be outstanding.
For any bonus payment made between 75% and 100% of salary there is a reinvestment commitment for the Director into shares in The Restaurant Group plc, and these shares can form part of the matching element described in the Long-Term Incentive Plan detailed below.
This reinvestment requirement will be waived if an executive Director has a shareholding with an average acquisition cost of greater than one times their salary.
Actual bonus payments for 2009 are presented in the emoluments table on page 33.
Long-term incentives The Company operates the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP or Plan, and the 2003 Save As You Earn SAYE Scheme under which awards may be granted to executive Directors.
Long-Term Incentive Plan The 2005 LTIP is the primary long-term incentive scheme of the Company.
Under the terms of the LTIP, individuals may receive an award of conditional free shares Conditional Awards with a face value at grant of up to 100% of salary per annum, vesting at least three years after grant subject to performance conditions and continued employment.
In addition, the Plan has the flexibility to grant conditional awards on a matching basis, pro rata to the number of shares purchased via the annual bonus Matching Awards.
Matching Awards may be granted over shares worth up to 37.5% of basic salary per annum.
The aggregate value of annual awards Conditional and Matching is capped at 137.5% of basic salary although the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to increase this cap to 200% of salary if the Committee decides there are exceptional circumstances in relation to retention and recruitment of employees.
For awards expected to be made shortly after the publication of the preliminary results for 2010, the normal grant limit of 137.5% will apply.
Awards are typically structured with a combination of Total Shareholder Return TSR and Earnings Per Share EPS performance conditions although, as set out in last years Directors remuneration report, only TSR was operated for the 2009 awards given the low visibility of earnings growth as a result of the economic conditions at the time of grant.
30 The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2009 Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements For awards to be made in 2010, two separate performance conditions will again apply: The performance condition attached to 50% of the Conditional Awards will require average annual EPS growth from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2012 of between RPI plus 4% to RPI plus 10% p. a. for between 30% and 100% of this part of the award to vest i. e. between 15% and 50% of the total award.
The performance condition attached to the other 50% of the Conditional Award will be based on TSR performance measured against the constituents of the FTSE Travel & Leisure Index excluding airlines over a single three-year period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2012.
Awards will vest on a straight line basis between minimum and maximum thresholds.
For Matching Awards, there will be a 0.3:1 match for average EPS growth of RPI plus 4% p. a. rising on a straight line basis to the full 1:1 match for average EPS growth of RPI plus 10% p. a.
Performance against the TSR and EPS targets will be independently calculated and reviewed by the Committee.
Shareholding guidelines Following the approval of the LTIP, shareholding guidelines for executive Directors were introduced, linked to the out-turn of the Plan.
At the time Conditional and Matching Awards vest under the Plan or any other executive plan established in the future, there is a requirement to retain no fewer than 50% of the shares, net of taxes, vesting under an LTIP award until a shareholding with a market value calculated by reference to purchase price equal to 100% of base salary is achieved.
SAYE Scheme The Company also operates a SAYE Share Option Scheme, the 2003 SAYE Scheme, for eligible employees under which options may be granted at a discount of up to 20% of market value.
Eligible employees are full time employees and executive Directors who have worked for the Group for at least one year.
Under the terms of the Scheme, the eligible employees are able to purchase shares under a three-year savings contract.
Awards under the SAYE scheme were made in 2004, 2006 and 2008 to eligible employees and Directors.
It is planned to make an offer to all eligible employees under the SAYE scheme during 2010.
Pension arrangements Executive Directors have individual pension arrangements in the form of personal pension plans.
The Company makes a contribution at a rate of up to 20% of basic salary towards funding each executive Directors pension plan.
To the extent that this funding exceeds the relevant current HMRC limit, the surplus may be paid as a salary supplement.
There are no unfunded pension promises or similar arrangements for Directors.
Performance graph As required by the Regulations, the graph below compares the Companys TSR performance with the FTSE 350 Travel and Leisure Share Index for each of the past five years.
The FTSE 350 Travel and Leisure Share Index has been selected for this comparison because it is the index most relevant to gauging the Companys relative performance.
This graph shows the value, by 31 December 2009, of 100 invested in The Restaurant Group plc on 31 December 2004 compared with the value of 100 invested in the FTSE All-Share Index and the FTSE 350 Travel and Leisure Share Index.

However, it may occasionally be necessary to offer longer initial notice periods to new Directors.
All executive Directors have contracts which are subject to one years notice by either party.
In the event of early termination including following a change of control in the Company, the Directors contracts provide for compensation in line with their contractual notice period.
The details of the executive Directors contracts are summarised in the table below: Date of contract Notice period Andrew Page 28 August 2002 1 year Stephen Critoph 7 July 2004 1 year Trish Corzine 31 March 2003 1 year Non-executive Directors The service contracts of the non-executive Directors were each set for an initial three-year period thereafter renewable for periods of three years.
They are required to submit themselves for re-election every three years.
Alan Jackson and John Jackson were re-elected in 2009.
John Jackson has notified the Board of his intention to step down from the Board of Directors at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to be held on 6 May 2010.
The non-executive Directors appointments were made as follows: Date of appointment as non-executive Director Notice period Alan Jackson 9 November 2005 1 year John Jackson 1 October 1996 Nil Tony Hughes 1 January 2008 Nil Alan Jackson was previously Executive Chairman of the Company, and was appointed in March 2001.
From 1 January 2006 he has held the position of non-executive Chairman.
All non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration with the exception of Alan Jackson is determined by the Board based on a review of fees paid to non-executive Directors of similar companies and reflects the time commitment and responsibilities of each role.
The basic fee paid to the non-executive Directors excluding Alan Jackson in the year was 50,000 2008: 50,000 pro rated by tenure of service.
No increases to the fees of non-executive Directors have been made in respect of 2010.

The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2009 33 Directors remuneration report continued Long-term incentives Aggregate emoluments disclosed above do not include any amounts for the long-term incentives granted to or held by the Directors.
The Company operates a number of arrangements which executive Directors and other employees may participate in.
In addition to the Long-Term Incentive Plan and Save As You Earn schemes referred to above, awards of share options have historically also been made to Directors under the 1998 and 2003 Executive Share Option Plans and outstanding awards are detailed below.
Following the Placing of 19,430,000 shares on 14 January 2004, an application to restate the number and price of share options granted under the 1998 and 2003 schemes to Directors and employees was approved by the HMRC.
This restatement was calculated to ensure the effective number and price attributed to the options was as before the Placing with no incremental benefit to the option holders.
The information provided below is stated assuming the restatement occurred on 1 January 2004.

They are free shares awarded to the Directors should the performance criteria be met.
The vesting criteria was dependent on EPS growth of the 2008 results compared with the 2005 results and TSR performance, and this vesting criteria has been met in full.

Note 1 : Alan Jackson was granted an option over 2,400,000 ordinary shares on 5 June 2001 at an exercise price of 45p per share.
This option was divided into three tranches of 800,000 shares, each of which may only be exercised if certain performance criteria are met.
The Companys share price must meet a specified target, which is 75p in the case of the first tranche, 105p in the case of the second tranche and 135p in the case of the third tranche.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying performance of the Group before any tranche of the option can be exercised.
For the second and third tranches, half of each tranche of the option may be exercised after three years and half after four years in each case following the date of the grant.
Each tranche of the option will lapse six years following the date of the grant if the target share price has not by then been met.
If, however, the target share price relating to any tranche of the option is met within this period that tranche will remain exercisable until ten years following the date of grant.
If a change of control of the Company occurs, Alan Jackson is entitled to exercise the option in full.
The Companys share price has met the criteria of the three tranches and the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying performance of the Group.
Alan Jackson has exercised all of those options available to him under the first and second tranches, and has exercised 600,000 options available to him from the third tranche.
Consequently Alan Jackson has 200,000 options remaining available to him at an exercise price of 45p.
