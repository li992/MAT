Remuneration Report The Remuneration Report is one of the most keenly-studied parts of our Annual Report: we take the view that the processes around setting pay and performance are an important part of a Boards work, and shareholders will make judgements about the quality of governance of the Company as a whole when they read the Remuneration Report.
We have therefore made an effort to make this report readable and clear, which is quite a hard task given the very considerable amount of regulation that, entirely appropriately, applies to this section.
First, the Directors confirm that we abide by all the rules.
Specifically, the Company has complied with the Principles and underlying Provisions relating to Directors remuneration of The Combined Code on Corporate Governance and that this Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with the Large & Mediumsized Companies and Groups Accounts and Report Regulations 2008.
Details of each individual Directors remuneration for 2009 are set out on pages 65 and 66.
Information on Directors share and share option interests may be found on pages 68 to 70.
The auditors are required to report on the auditable part of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 as amended by the Regulations.
The information which has been audited can be viewed on pages 65 to 71.
No other parts of this report have been audited.
Responsibilities and role of the Remuneration Committee The Committees principal function is to determine the Companys policy on Board remuneration and to approve the specific remuneration packages for the Executive Directors and the Company Secretary, including their service contracts.
The Committee also has responsibility for making a recommendation to the Board in respect of the remuneration of the Chairman.
The Committees remit therefore includes, but is not restricted to, basic salary, benefits in kind, performance related awards, share options and share awards, long-term incentive schemes, pension rights, and any compensation or termination payments.
The full Terms of Reference of the Committee are available on our website at www.
Membership of the Committee The members of the Committee during the year were as follows: Nigel Northridge Chairman David Hamill Russell King appointed 2 February 2009 Robert MacLeod All of the members of the Committee are Independent Non-executive Directors.
This is important because it means that the pay of the Executive Directors is set by people who are independent of the Executives, and who can come to sensible judgements as to what is in the interest of shareholders and fair to the Executives.
Peter Kennerley is Secretary to the Committee and we consult both the Chairman and the Chief Executive and invite them to attend meetings when appropriate, but no Director is allowed to be present when his own remuneration is discussed.
Our principal external advisers during the year were Hewitt New Bridge Street, who advised on revisions to and administration of the Companys share plans, and Kepler Associates to give advice on pay, benchmarking and other matters related to compensation.
Main activities of the Committee during the year The main focus of the Committees activity comprises managing the various aspects of the remuneration package of Executive Directors at Aggreko.
This package comprises: annual salary: annual bonus: the Companys Long-term Incentive Programme LTIP : pension and life assurance: and other benefits, including healthcare and expatriate benefits for Directors seconded away from their home country.
The Committee met five times during 2009: details of members attendance are set out in the table on page 51.
The main tasks for the Committee were: reviewing and approving the Executive Directors bonuses for 2008: setting targets and rules for Executive Directors bonuses for 2009: reviewing the number of shares granted under existing LTIP awards: reviewing and approving the vesting of the 2006 LTIP awards: reviewing and approving the rules and performance criteria for the 2009 LTIP grant: deciding on the level of pay increase in the annual salary review: and approving minor amendments to the rules of the LTIP to simplify their administration.
60 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Directors Report Remuneration policy The Committee has adopted a number of principles which it applies to the way we set, balance and measure the different elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors.
In developing these policies the Committee is mindful of the views expressed by the various bodies on executive pay.
As a general policy, we aim to ensure that our remuneration policy rewards executives for delivering what we see as being their central responsibility, which is to increase the value of the business to shareholders consistently and over a long period of time.
To achieve this we have structured the reward package with the following principles in mind: We want our Executives, and indeed all our employees, to feel fairly paid, and we do not want them to be easy prey for competitors who are hunting for talent.
However, we dont want to waste money by over-paying.
Accordingly, we aim to position our packages so that the fixed element of pay i. e. salary, pension, and benefits packages are around the median of that paid by UK listed companies of similar size and complexity.
As far as the total reward package is concerned, we believe that shareholders support the concept of paying outstanding rewards for outstanding performance.
We therefore have designed performance-related schemes that offer executives the opportunity to earn large rewards if they produce large increases in shareholder value.
Concomitantly, they should not receive performance rewards if performance is mediocre.
More specifically: We believe that Executive Directors should be able to earn more from their performance-related pay than from their fixed pay to encourage them to deliver superior performance.
Within the performance-related pay element, we believe that Executive Directors should be able to earn more from long-term incentives than short-term incentives.
The value to executives of delivering consistent growth over a three-year period should be greater than they can earn from their annual bonuses.
This means that they are not motivated to deliver short-term gain at the cost of long-term value.
In terms of target-setting, we believe that we should try as far as we can to use measures which are closely aligned to those which deliver value for shareholders and which are independently auditable.
We also believe that the targets should give clear line-of-sight for the Executives i. e. they know what they have to do to earn the money, and as far as possible, what they have to do is under their control : for this reason we prefer absolute, rather than relative measures.
The targets set for annual bonuses and the Long-term Incentive Programme at Group level are Diluted Earnings per Share D-EPS and Return on Capital Employed ROCE : both of these are Key Performance Indicators for the Company as described on pages 27 and 28.
We believe that if the Executives deliver growing D-EPS, at healthy rates of ROCE, the value of the Company to the shareholders is likely to increase.
Finally, we believe that there should be alignment in terms of the structure of performance pay schemes between the Executive Directors and the wider senior management team within Aggreko.
We think it important that the entire senior management team is working towards the same targets and under the same schemes, and if the Executive Directors are doing well, the rest of the management team are doing well.
These are the general principles of our current policy, which we intend to follow for 2010 and, subject to any changes in circumstances or best practices, for future years.
Following these general principles, we set out below a description of how we have applied them to the various elements of remuneration in 2009.
Fixed pay Annual salary Annual Salaries for Executive Directors are generally reviewed each year by the Committee in June.
There were no increases in basic salaries during the course of 2009 for Executive Directors, although Kash Pandyas salary and benefits package was increased as from 1st January 2009 to reect his appointment as Regional Director responsible for Aggreko International and subsequent secondment from the UK to Dubai.
This salary freeze for Executive Directors reected a Company-wide policy of pay restraint in the face of worsening market conditions.
Salaries are determined by a combination of the individuals contribution to the business and the market rate for the position.
We aim to pay the market median for standard performance and pay up to the market upper quartile for upper quartile performance.
On occasions it may be necessary to pay above the market median to attract people of the right calibre to meet the needs of the business.
In setting annual salaries, as with other elements of remuneration, we have discretion to consider all relevant factors, including performance on environmental, social and governance issues.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 61 Remuneration Report continued The appropriate market rate is the rate in the market place from which the individual is most likely to be recruited.
The Company operates in a number of market places throughout the world where remuneration practice and levels differ.
This can result in pay and benefit differentials between the Executive Directors.
In arriving at an appropriate market rate, we commission studies from our advisers, who carry out in-depth research on the practices of Aggrekos peer group in the UK to establish accurate benchmarks.
The same approach is taken for expatriate and overseas salaries where reference is made to the appropriate data for the geographical location.
Pensions Pensions are based on current practice in the markets in which we operate and take into account long-term trends in pension provision.
Further details on pension provision are set out on pages 66 and 67, but, in summary, Angus Cockburn is a member of the Aggreko plc Pension Scheme, which is a defined-benefit scheme.
Messrs Soames, Caplan and Pandya, who joined the Company after the Pension Scheme was closed to new entrants, benefit from a defined-contribution scheme.
George Walker also has a defined-contribution scheme, which operates under US rules.
Benefits All the Executive Directors receive health-care benefits and life assurance cover.
Angus Cockburn receives the benefit of a Company-funded car.
Kash Pandya, who has been seconded from the UK to Dubai, receives an overseas secondment package which covers the cost of housing in Dubai and use of local facilities, a car allowance, and a contribution to school fees.
Performance-related pay Annual Bonus Scheme Generally, the outside world places great weight on the performance of the Company from year to year, and we therefore think it appropriate to have a significant, but not the greatest, part of the performance pay linked to annual performance.
The purpose of the Annual Bonus Scheme is to align Executive Directors with this performance period and to motivate them to meet and beat demanding annual performance targets.
The targets for the Annual Bonus Scheme are related to the Annual Budgets set by the Board.
Generally, bonuses will start to be earned at performance levels a few pp below Budget and then increase until they reach capped levels, which will generally be at 10-15% above Budget.
Executive Directors with regional management responsibilities Messrs Pandya, Caplan and Walker have half of their bonus related to the performance of their region as measured by trading profit and ROCE and half related to D-EPS.
The Chief Executives and Finance Directors bonuses are measured exclusively against D-EPS.
In 2009 the on budget and maximum bonus earnings for the Executive Directors was: % of annual salary On-budget Maximum Rupert Soames 50.0% 125.0% Angus Cockburn 37.5% 100.0% George Walker 60.0% 125.0% Kash Pandya 47.5% 100.0% Bill Caplan 47.5% 100.0% Bonuses are paid following finalisation of the previous years trading results, at which point the targets and quanta of bonuses for the current year are set.
Long-term Incentive Programme The purpose of the Long-term Incentive Programme LTIP is to align the interests of shareholders and management in growing the value of the business over the long term.
It does this by granting shares which vest depending on the extent to which the business meets earnings and return on capital targets over a three-year period: the value of the incentive to an executive is also heavily dependent on the level of share-price appreciation over the period, which also helps to align the interest of executive and shareholder.
A useful extra feature of the LTIP is that it works as an extremely effective retention tool: the more successful the Company is and therefore the more attractive our executives are to other companies, the more difficult it becomes for other companies to lure our people away.
The LTIP was first introduced in 2004, and each year senior executives are invited to join.
It consists of two distinct elements: the Performance Share Plan PSP and the Co-investment Plan CIP.
In 2009 121 individuals about 3% of employees were invited to join one or both of the Plans.
In the last five years 210 people have been invited to join the LTIP, of whom 154 are at the date of this report still employed by the Company.
There have been few voluntary leavers from amongst the population who are members of the LTIP, which is testimony to its power as a retention tool.
62 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Directors Report The CIP and PSP are both measured against the performance over three financial years and they share the performance criteria.
These are the real i. e. ination-adjusted compound annual growth rate over the performance period of Diluted Earnings per Share D-EPS, and Return on Capital Employed ROCE.
This aligns directly both elements of the LTIP with group strategy and measures that the Board believes are Key Performance Indicators.
The PSP is a nil-cost conditional award of shares, some, all, or none of which vest depending on performance against the targets: the number of shares conditionally awarded is related to the salary of the individual concerned and his or her level within the Company.
Since its inception, the largest PSP award has been equivalent to 100% of the recipients salary, although the rules of the scheme permit higher levels.
The CIP is a co-investment plan, whose purpose is to encourage executives to buy and hold shares in the Company.
Executives can subscribe Aggreko shares up to a maximum value of 30% of their salary each year they are invited to join the CIP: if they hold those shares for three years, they will be entitled to receive a minimum award of one share for every two they subscribed, plus a maximum performance-related award of a further three shares for every two they subscribed.
The performance criteria for the LTIP are set annually: in 2009 they were: 75% of the award would be measured against the real i. e. ination-adjusted compound annual growth in D-EPS over the three-year performance measurement period in a range of 3% to 10%.
No performance shares would be awarded against this element if performance were less than 3% and awards would increase straightline to the maximum at 10% growth.
25% of the award would be measured against the average ROCE over the performance period in a range of 23% to 25%.
No performance shares would be awarded against this element if performance were less than 23% and awards would increase straight-line to the maximum at 25% ROCE.
In addition to the above, and to reward truly exceptional performance, the number of shares awarded to participants in the LTIP may be increased by between 1.3 and 2.0 times if the real compound annual growth in D-EPS over the three-year performance measurement period is in a range of 13% to 20%.
In 2009, Rupert Soames, the Chief Executive, subscribed the maximum number of CIP shares, equivalent to 30% of his salary.
He was awarded PSP shares to a value at the date of grant equivalent to 100% of his salary.
The other Executive Directors each received PSP awards equivalent to 70% of their salary: Messrs Pandya, Walker and Cockburn subscribed shares equivalent to 30% of their salary to the CIP, and Bill Caplan subscribed shares equivalent to 25% of his salary.
During the year the Committee approved some minor amendments to facilitate the administration of the LTIP.
These included granting the Committee discretion to value awards under the PSP at the date that invitations are sent out to participants, rather than the grant date, in order to bring it into line with the operation of the CIP, and clarifying the policy for early leavers.
Sharesave Plans The Board believes that Sharesave schemes are valuable in aligning the interests of employees and shareholders, and the Company seeks to make it possible for as many employees as practicable to join the scheme or its various proxies.
The Aggreko Sharesave Plans are normally offered annually to employees and Executive Directors who have at least three months continuous service, and allow a maximum of 250 per month to be saved and converted into Aggreko shares at the end of either two, three, four or five year periods, depending upon local legislation.
During the year the Board approved some minor amendments to the Sharesave Plans, including clarification of the date at which the option price is fixed and allowing for the option price to be fixed in local currencies.
Executive Share Option Schemes Before 2004, senior Executives were invited to participate in an Executive Share Option Scheme at the discretion of the Committee.
Since the LTIP was introduced in 2004, no further grants have been, or will be, made under these Executive Share Option Schemes.
During 2009, the last options granted to an Executive Director met their performance conditions, and with George Walkers exercise of 121,952 options, no Director has any options extant under this scheme.
The allocation of Executive Share Options was based on multiples of remuneration dependent upon the seniority 1 and job size of the individuals appointment, with the maximum multiple of 1 3 times remuneration in any one year being available to Executive Directors.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 63 Remuneration Report continued All executive options that have been granted are subject to performance conditions based on both Total Shareholder Return TSR and growth in EPS.
TSR is calculated by reference to the increase in the Companys share price plus dividends paid.
EPS is Basic Earnings per Share as disclosed in the Group Income Statement.
At the time when the individual wishes to exercise the option which can only normally occur after three years have elapsed since grant, the growth in the Companys TSR is compared to that of the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding investment trusts over a specified period.
If the Companys TSR matches or exceeds that index, and the Companys EPS growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 3 per cent per annum, over a specified period, the option is capable of exercise.
For options granted after 25 April 2001, retesting of performance conditions is limited to six monthly intervals between three and five years after the date of grant.
For options granted before 25 April 2001, testing of the performance conditions is made with reference to EPS growth over three consecutive years prior to the date of exercise and TSR is measured for the period from the date of grant to the date of exercise.
Remuneration of Chairman and Non-executive Directors The Board, within the limits set out in the Articles of Association, determines the remuneration policy and level of fees for the Non-executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee recommends remuneration policy and level of fees for the Chairman to the Board.
Remuneration comprises an annual fee for acting as a Chairman or Non-executive Director of the Company.
Additional fees are paid to Non-executive Directors in respect of service as Chairman of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and as Senior Independent Director.
When setting these fees, reference is made to information provided by a number of remuneration surveys, the extent of the duties performed, and the size of the Company.
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors are not eligible for bonuses, retirement benefits or to participate in any share scheme operated by the Company.
Review of past performance The following chart shows at the value as at 31 December 2009 of 100 invested in the Company on 31 December 2004 compared with the value of 100 invested in the FTSE Mid 250 over the same period.
The other points plotted are the values at the intervening financial year-ends.
The FTSE Mid 250 was selected as this general index is considered more appropriate than sector and peer group comparators given the unique nature of the Companys business.

Benefits in kind are made up of private health care, taxable life insurance benefits, car costs and the allowances paid to Directors on expatriate secondment.
Other pay represents the amount paid to Directors in order to fund pension benefits beyond the HM Revenue and Customs earnings cap.
Following 5 April 2006, Directors have been allowed to receive part of their pension entitlement as taxable pay.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 65 Remuneration Report continued Rupert Soames was the highest paid Director.
His entitlements under the Pension plan and details of his potential receipt of shares under the Executive Share Option Schemes and Long-term Incentive Arrangements are disclosed separately.
Performance targets were confirmed for the 2009 annual bonus in March 2009.
The Chief Executive and the Executive Director responsible for North America had a maximum bonus opportunity of 125% of basic salary and the other Executive Directors a maximum of 100%.
The performance target for the Chief Executive and Finance Director was based solely on growth in D-EPS and the performance targets for Regional Executive Directors was based as to 50% on growth in D-EPS, 40% as to growth in regional trading profit and 10% based on regional ROCE.
The growth in D-EPS for the year was 37%.

We have made no reduction to Mr Cockburns benefits.
The transfer value has been calculated in accordance with the methods and assumptions underlying the calculation of cash equivalents under the Aggreko plc Pension Scheme which are consistent with: i the requirements of Chapter IV of Part IV and Chapter II of Part IVA of the Pension Schemes Act 1993: and ii The Occupational Pension Schemes Transfer Values Amendment Regulations 2008.
The accrued pension is the amount which would be paid at the anticipated retirement date if the Director left service as at 31 December 2009, with no allowance for increases in the period between leaving service and retirement.
Angus Cockburn is also entitled to a pension of 2,162 per annum payable from age 60 from the Aggreko plc Pension Scheme resulting from benefits transferred in from the scheme of a previous employer.
This benefit is not included in the above disclosure.
All Executive Directors who are members of a pension plan are provided with a lump sum death in service benefit of four times salary.
Derek Shepherd was provided with a lump sum death in service benefit of two times salary.
Note 2: For Derek Shepherd, as at date of retirement, 29 April 2009.
The options under the Sharesave Option Schemes have been granted at a discount of 20% on the share price calculated over the three days prior to the date of invitation to participate, mature after three years and are normally exercisable in the six months following the maturity date.
The options under the US Stock Purchase Plan have been granted at a discount of 15% on the closing share price on the date of grant, mature after two years and are normally exercisable in the three months following the maturity date.
The options under the Executive Share Option Scheme are normally only exercisable once three years have elapsed from date of grant and lapse after ten years.
The performance criteria that apply to the Executive Share Option Schemes are described on page 63 and 64.
Awards under the Performance Share and Co-investment Plans are normally made three years after the date of grant and are subject to performance conditions which are described on pages 62 and 63.
The performance criteria for the LTIP granted in April 2006 and exercisable from April 2009 were: 75% of the award would be measured against the real compound annual growth in D-EPS over the three-year performance measurement period in a range of 3% to 8% with maximum vesting at an aggregate D-EPS for the period of 50.71p.
No performance shares would be awarded against this element if performance were less than 3% and awards would increase straight-line to the maximum at 10% growth.
The actual D-EPS over the period was 95.45p, which exceeded the upper limit of the range and accordingly all 75% of the award vested under this criterion.
25% of the award would be measured against the average return on capital employed over the performance period in a range of 18.5% to 20%.
No performance shares would be awarded against this element if performance were less than 18.5% and awards will increase straight-line to the maximum at 20% ROCE.
The actual average ROCE for the period was 25.77%, which exceeded the upper limit of the range and accordingly all 25% of the award vested under this criterion.
Accordingly LTIP awards granted in April 2006 vested in full.
Derek Shepherd retired on 29 April 2009 at the age of 66 after 21 years service with the Company: he had been granted in 2007 a conditional award of 16,284 shares under the CIP and 37,996 shares under the PSP.
The rules of the LTIP provide that on retirement awards under the CIP vest immediately and those under the PSP vest at the normal time i. e. three years after grant.
In both cases the awards are subject to satisfaction of performance conditions, and both would normally be pro-rated for the period of completed service.
However, the Committee has the discretion to waive the pro-ration, which it has decided to do in return for his entering into and complying with non-compete and non-solicitation undertakings which extend well beyond the normal date of vesting of the PSP.
The performance conditions for the CIP were measurable over the first two of the three financial years of the measurement period, and were met in full.
Accordingly, his award over 16,284 shares under the CIP vested on 29 April 2009.
The vesting of the PSP shares will be subject to the measurement of the performance conditions over the three full financial years in April 2011.

Under this policy, on vesting of share grants, Executive Directors, who are not within five years of their normal retirement age, should hold at least 50% of the net proceeds in shares until their aggregate holding is equivalent to at least 100% of their salary.
