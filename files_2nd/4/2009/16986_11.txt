46 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2009 Directors report Remuneration report continued # Directors pension benefits Alan Mitchelson was a member of a defined benefit scheme provided by the Group during the year 2009.
Keith Cochrane and Mark Selway were responsible for their own pension provisions.
Pension entitlement and the corresponding transfer values were as follows during the year: Change in transfer value Increase of accrued Transfer in accrued pension during value of Transfer value Increase pension Accrued the period net accrued of increase Accrued in accrued during the pension as Transfer value of of directors pension as in accrued pension as at pension period net at 1 January accrued pension ordinary Directors at 1 January pension net 26 December during the of inflation 2010 as at 26 contributions ordinary 2010 of inflation 2008 period note 6 note 1 December 2008 note 3 contributions note 2 notes 2 & 6 Notes Alan Mitchelson 4,5 30,543 4,561 4,561 35,104 689,404 89,539 9,528 788,471 92,917 # Audited Notes 1.
The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on normal retirement, prior to any cash commutation, based on pensionable service to the end of the year.
With effect from 1 October 2008, Government legislation requires the trustees having taken actuarial advice to take responsibility for setting the assumptions underlying the calculation of voluntary transfer values to be paid from the plan.
Prior to this date the scheme actuary had this responsibility.
Consequently, the transfer value of the accrued pension at the year end has been calculated in accordance with this revised requirement.
The change in the amount of the transfer value over the year is made up of the following elements: a. transfer value of the increase in accrued pension: b. increase in the transfer value of accrued pension at year start due to ageing: c. impact of any change in the economic or mortality assumptions underlying the transfer value basis as referred to in 2. above: d. less the directors ordinary contributions.
The change in the amount of the transfer value over the year includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Group and directors, such as stockmarket movements: which will be reflected within c. above.
The inflation measure for leavers during 2009 with at least one year to their normal retirement date was 0%, despite actual inflation being negative.
Consequently, the rate of inflation assumed in the above figures is 0%.
The figures allow for the impact of the plan specific earnings cap.
Alan Mitchelson does not have an entitlement to an excepted formerly known as unapproved pension from the Group.
Payment of actual transfer values from the defined benefit scheme of which Alan Mitchelson is a member are not currently reduced below 100% of their full value.
The figures allow for the impact of inflation in accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
