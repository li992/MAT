Directors remuneration report continued Components of executive director remuneration Summarised below are the key elements of the total reward package provided to executive directors and the purpose of each element: Element Maximum value Purpose Base salary N A To recognise market value of role and individuals skill, responsibilities, performance and experience.
Annual bonus 200% of base salary.
Any bonus in excess To reward annual profit and cash ow performance of 100% of salary is deferred into shares.
The deferred element of the bonus aligns annual financial performance and bonuses with sustainable performance over the medium term.
Share options Face value of award of 200% of base salary.
To reward improvements in shareholder value over the longer term and to align management and shareholder interests.
Pension & benets N A To provide a competitive level of benets, providing short term protection and long term savings opportunities.
Base salary The Committees policy is to position base salary for each director at the median level compared to market practice.
32 Base salaries are reviewed annually and are determined by taking into account the performance of the individuals, changes in their responsibilities and information from independent remuneration consultants on the levels of salary for similar jobs having regard to the size of the Company its turnover, market capitalisation and complexity.
The Committee also takes into account internal relativities and the total remuneration of the executives compared to the market.
Base salary is the only element of remuneration which is pensionable.
In addition, benets are provided to executive directors in accordance with market practice.
As a result of the Companys restructuring in 2006, the salaries for the CEO and CFO are currently above the median of market practice and therefore outside the stated policy.
The Committee remains committed to aligning policy with practice over the coming years.
In line with this stated policy and reecting the current economic environment, executive director salaries were frozen for 2009 and will be frozen for 2010.

Incentive arrangements Annual bonus Annual bonuses payable to executive directors in respect of 2009 comprised two elements.
The first element related to preexceptional profit before tax PBT, and the second element related to cash ow performance over the year.
The maximum annual bonus a participant can receive under the combined elements is 200% of salary.
Any bonus earned over 100% of salary will be deferred into shares, with 50% of the deferred amount released after year one and 50% released after year two subject to continued employment.
The PBT element of the bonus is determined on a profit share basis whereby an executive can earn a bonus based on a xed percentage of the Companys PBT.
No bonus in respect of the PBT element is paid below a minimum acceptable riskadjusted level of performance.
For 2009, the minimum level of performance was set at 27m being equivalent to a return on assets equal to at least the weighted average cost of capital return.
The following table shows the percentage profit share for the main board directors for 2009: M Ingle M Robson Percentage profit Share 0.60% 0.40% In respect of the cash ow element of the bonus, executives can earn up to 50% of salary based on achieving pre-determined cash ow targets.
15% of salary will be paid for achieving Threshold target with up to 50% of salary payable for achieving a Maximum target, with payments determined on a straight line basis between these points.
No bonus in respect of the cash ow element will be paid below Threshold.
33 Cash ow targets were assessed again at the end of February 2010 to ensure that cash ow levels had been maintained beyond the December 2009 year end.
Cash ow is dened as the difference between reported Net Debt at the end of the financial year and the beginning of the financial year.
A summary of the operation of the annual bonus plan for 2009 is shown below: Cash ow targets Deferred Shares up to 50% of salary up to 100% salary Annual Bonus profit Share Cash % of PBT up to 100% salary Performance Measures Delivery Mechanism The Groups performance against its financial targets, as it affected the payout of the bonus in respect of the performance year ending December 2009, is shown in the table below: Actual Performance in 2009 Bonus as % of salary Key performance indicator M Ingle M Robson PBT 68.7m 77% 76% Cash inow 63.6m 50% 50% Total bonus earned 127% 126% Directors remuneration report continued Share Option Plan Portfolio Following consultation with our largest shareholders, the Committee decided to grant premium-priced share options in 2009 with a profit underpin instead of using the Co-Investment Plan.
The rationale was: U The Co-Investment Plan is highly leveraged and was designed at the time to support the Companys aggressive depot opening strategy.
When economic conditions started to deteriorate, the Board decided it was prudent to curtail the aggressive depot opening strategy.
Accordingly, the Committee thought it was appropriate to adjust the total package and suspend using the Co-Investment Plan for the time being.
U The Committee wanted to use a simple incentive that rewarded management for improvements in shareholder value though the Committee was mindful to avoid excessive windfall gains by executives given the relatively low share price at the time of award.
The award of share options granted in 2009 was split into two tranches, each with a premium exercise price.
An award of share options with a face value of 100% of salary and an exercise price of 25p: plus an award of share options with a face value of 100% of salary and an exercise price of 50p.
The options are exercisable after three years subject to the Company achieving a cumulative PBT of 90m over the three financial years ending December 2011.
A cumulative measure has been chosen to mitigate any potential volatility in annual performance over the three years particularly in the current environment.
The Remuneration Committee also retains discretion to reduce the number of options that are exercisable at the end of three years if they consider that the performance in any year during the performance period is unsatisfactory.
A summary of the operation of the Share Option Plan Portfolio for 2009 is shown below: 34 50% Share options Cumulative PBT premium price 25p Share Option over 3 years Plan Portfolio of 90m 50% Share options premium price 50p Performance Measures Delivery Mechanism The Remuneration Committee may, in addition to the performance targets described above, at its discretion and where it considers it appropriate reduce the numbers of options that may be exercised to take account of an individuals general performance and the overall performance of the Company over the three year performance period.
Incentives for 2010 It is intended that our executive incentive arrangements will remain broadly consistent for 2010.
The profit Share Plan structure combined with an award of share options is well understood by the management team and provides a strong link to performance, with PBT and cash management continuing to be considered to be the key performance drivers of shareholder value.
However in 2010, the Committee intend to make the following changes: Galiform Plc Annual report & accounts 2009 U Annual bonus The profit share percentage applicable for 2010 has been reduced compared to last year.
The profit share percentages will be between 0.4% to 0.5% for the CEO and 0.30% to 0.35% for the CFO depending on the level of PBT achieved.
No profit share will be paid below a return on assets that is less than the weighted average cost of capital return.
The maximum bonus in respect of cash ow performance has been reduced from 50% of salary to 40% of salary.
U Share options An award of market value share options will be granted in 2010 to the CEO and CFO with a face value equivalent to 200% of salary.
These options will be exercisable after three years subject to the following PBT growth over the three financial years ending December 2012.
PBT growth targets Proportion of the share option award that is exercisable RPI 8% p. a. or above 100% Straight-line vesting between these points RPI p. a.
0% Other existing arrangements The following incentive plans discretionary and all-employee are also at the Committees disposal.
These plans were not operated in 2009.
U Co-Investment Plan CIP 35 Under the CIP, participants are eligible to invest up to a predetermined number of their own shares into the plan for a period of three years.
In return for their commitment, each invested share can be matched with up to five additional shares subject to the achievement of stretching performance targets over the three year vesting period.
No award was made under the CIP in 2009 and there is no intention to use the CIP for executive directors in 2010.
U Performance Share Plan PSP A new PSP was adopted by the Company at the AGM in 2009 on broadly similar terms to our previous plan but with rules i. e. change of control and leavers brought into line with current corporate governance best practice.
No awards have been made to directors under the PSP since 2005 and there is no intention to grant any further shares under this plan in 2010 for executive directors.
Conditional awards of shares equivalent to one times salary have previously been made to executive directors annually at the discretion of the Committee and are released subject to the achievement of company performance targets.
U FreeShare Plan The FreeShare Plan was introduced in 2002.
Executive directors may participate in the Plan on the same terms as all other eligible employees.
The plan is HMRC approved and is not subject to performance conditions other than continued employment.
Under the FreeShare Plan all eligible employees were invited to accept an allocation of up to 200 of the Companys shares in September 2002 and again in May 2003.
The shares are held in a Trust for a holding period being between three and five years after which the award of shares will vest and participants may withdraw their shares.
No further allocations have been made since those dates.
Directors remuneration report continued iii.
Pensions Executive directors can participate in the Galiform Pension Plan The Plan.
The Plan is funded and HMRC approved.
With effect from 1 September 2006 the basis changed to a hybrid dened benefit, occupational pension plan.
Its main features are currently: U The dened benefit pension accrues on a Career Average Revalued Earnings CARE basis at the rate of 1 50th of actual pensionable pay in each year currently capped at 123,600 : post-retirement increases are linked to the increase in the retail prices index with a maximum of 2.5%.
U Members contribute 8% of pensionable pay to the CARE plan.
U In addition to the dened benefit section, the Company will match any voluntary member contribution made to the dened contribution top-up section to a maximum of 8% of pensionable pay.
U Life assurance cover of six times pensionable pay for those members with dependents and two times for those without dependents.
U Pension payable in the event of ill health.
U Spouses pension on death in retirement of 2 3 of deceaseds pension.
U Pensionable pay is limited to the members basic salary.
All plan benets are subject to HMRC limits.
A pension supplement system operates concurrently with the Plan which recognises that pension entitlement in respect 36 of the CARE part of the Plan has included maximum benefit restrictions the Plan Cap which is currently 123,600 being based on the Earnings Cap.
This supplement is 30% of basic salary above the Plan Cap to reect competitive market practice.
If a director chooses to opt out of membership of the Pension Plan, then the supplement payment will be 30% of total basic salary.
The CEO had a fully funded pension position in 2006 and hence has chosen to opt out of membership of the Plan and consequently receives a salary supplement.
Mark Robson continues to participate in the Plan.
Service contracts All executive directors employment contracts have twelve months notice of termination on both sides.
In event of termination by the Company, there will be no compensation for loss of ofce due to misconduct or resignation.
In other circumstances, executive directors may be entitled to receive compensation for loss of ofce which will be paid monthly for a maximum of twelve months.
Such payments will be equivalent to the monthly salary that the executive would have received if still in employment with the Company.
Executive directors will be expected to mitigate their loss within a twelve month period of their departure from the Company.
Galiform Plc Annual report & accounts 2009 v. External appointments It is recognised that executive directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies and that exposure to such duties can broaden their experience and skills, which will benefit the Company.
Galiform allows executive directors and other appropriate senior employees to accept a maximum of one non-executive appointment outside the Company, subject to permission from the Committee, provided this is not with a competing company nor likely to lead to conicts of interest.
No such appointments are currently in place.
Executive directors may retain the fees paid to them in respect of their non-executive duties.
Non-executive directors remuneration Non-executive director appointments are for an initial period of three years.
They are subject to re-appointment every three years, and annually after 9 years.
Non-executive directors do not have contracts of service or notice periods and are not entitled to any form of compensation in the event of early termination for whatever reason.
The remuneration of non-executive directors, other than the Chairman, is considered by the Chairman and the Chief Executive.
The Chairmans remuneration is determined by the Remuneration Committee while the Chairman is absent.
It is intended that a review will be conducted in 2010 to ensure that remuneration for non-executive directors reects the time commitment and responsibilities of their roles.

2 Total bonus outcome for Messrs Ingle and Robson was 127% and 126% of salary respectively.
Any amount earned in excess of 100% of salary will be deferred into shares, half of which will be held in trust for a further year and the remaining 50% will be held in trust for a further two years.
3 Pension supplements are paid every six months in arrears and the next payment is due in March 2010.
The table above includes an accrued amount for the period from 1 October 2009 to 26 December 2009.
Further details of the pension supplement are given on page 36.
4 Employee pension contributions are made on a salary sacrifice basis.
Therefore the basic salary gure noted for Mark Robson is lower to take account of that.

2 Options granted under Sections 2 and 3 of the 2000 Share Option Plan Portfolio are not normally exercisable unless challenging targets are met.
These options have been divided into the following performance conditions: U For the options granted in 2001, 50% of the award vested if EPS growth of 60% was achieved over the performance period, and 100% vested if EPS growth of 120% was achieved over the performance period.
U For the options granted in 2005, 40% of the options became exercisable subject to growth in EPS, calculated on an IIMR basis, being equal to RPI 40% over three years: increasing on a straight line basis up to 100% of the option becoming exercisable where EPS growth equals or exceeds RPI 100% over three years.
Options lapsed on 26 May 2008 to the extent that these targets were not satisfied.
U For the options granted in 2007, 20% of the options will vest if the share price over 30 consecutive dealing days is 185 pence rising on a straight line basis to 100% vesting if the share price over thirty consecutive days reaches 265 pence.
Underpinning this is a requirement to achieve 20% annual compound growth over the performance period.
The options lapsed on 26 December 2009 as the financial underpin was not met.
U For the options granted in 2009, options will vest if the Group achieves a cumulative pre-exceptional PBT of 90m over the three financial years ending 2009, 2010 and 2011.
3 For awards of market value options granted under the Foundation Plan 2006, vesting was dependent upon the achievement of a share price hurdle over thirty consecutive dealing days and subject to an improvement in underlying financial performance of the Company over the financial year commencing 25 December 2005.
35% of the award vested if the share price achieved 115 pence over thirty consecutive dealing days and 100% of the award vested if the share price achieved 160 pence over thirty consecutive dealing days.
The award vested on a straight line basis between these two points.
Vested awards can be exercised for a 12 month period commencing on 31 December 2008.
The awards lapsed on 31 December 2009.
