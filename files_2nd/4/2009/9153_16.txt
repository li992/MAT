Following the wider review of remuneration policy undertaken after Ian Cheshires appointment and as disclosed last year, the Remuneration Committee decided to increase the annual limit to 200% of salary, with the performance measures made correspondingly more demanding, in order to bring long-term incentive provision into line with median practice in other FTSE100 companies and other retailers of a similar size.
The review by the Remuneration Committee concluded that all future PSP awards should be subject to performance targets that are based equally on EPS and TSR.
The combination of TSR and EPS measures was selected as the most appropriate combined performance measure for the PSP.
This combination is robust and simple to understand, provides an effective measure of management performance, aligns executives interests with those of shareholders and is generally favoured by the Companys major shareholders.
The FTSE100 was chosen as the comparator group because there is a general lack of directly quoted home improvement businesses against which to compare the Companys TSR speci cally.
HNBS independently carries out the relevant TSR calculations for the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee may, in its absolute discretion: amend the range of EPS targets set out in the table below to take account of any material change in the retail prices index over the performance period or any change to, or event that affects, the structure or business of the King sher Group or any other material change in circumstances: and vary the performance condition if an event has occurred which causes it to consider that it would be appropriate, provided the varied condition is considered fair and reasonable and not materially less challenging than the original condition would have been but for the event in question.
Any such amendments will be disclosed in the relevant Directors remuneration report.
The TSR and EPS performance targets for all PSP awards are: 50% TSR at the end Percentage of this part of the award 50% EPS at the end Percentage of this part of the award of the Performance Period of performance shares that will vest of the Performance Period of performance shares that will vest Less than median plus 1 percentage point Nil Less than 15.9p Nil Median plus 1 percentage point 15.625% 15.9p 15.625% Between median plus 1 percentage point Straight-line vesting between Between 15.9p and 17.0p Straight-line vesting between and upper quintile plus 1 percentage point 15.625% and 100% 15.625% 50% Upper quintile plus 1 percentage point 100% 17.0p 50% Between 17.0p and 19.6p Straight-line vesting between 50% 100% 19.6p 100% Performance Shares receive a dividend roll-up calculated on the basis of a notional purchase of shares on each relevant ex-dividend date using that days closing mid-market price.
Shares used to satisfy awards under a plan are normally purchased in the market through an employee bene t trust.
Under the PSP, provisional awards of Performance Shares have been granted to selected senior executives following the publication of the annual results.
Awards were made on 21 April 2008.
As part of the terms of his recruitment, awards were made to Ian Cheshire on 1 February 2008 in respect of his 2008 2009 allocations under the plan using the TSR performance target only and therefore no further awards were made to him during the financial year.
Awards were also made to Kevin OByrne as part of his recruitment on 1 October 2008 in respect of his 2008 2009 allocations under the plan.
Kevin OByrnes awards are subject to the TSR 50% and EPS 50% performance targets.
Although the EPS performance condition was over a four-year period in respect of the above awards, the Committee intends to revert to the normal three-year period going forward.
Other long-term incentive plans Apart from the ShareSave Option Scheme, all other option and incentive arrangements have been discontinued, but awards made under these schemes in previous years will vest over time in accordance with the rules governing the various plans.
The details are shown in the section entitled Closed Incentive Plans on page 44.
Pension provision Ian Cheshire is a member of the main fide ned bene t funded arrangement, the King sher Pension Scheme and subject to the scheme cap, which was closed to new employees of the Group on 1 April 2004.
Following his appointment as Group Chief Executive, Ian Cheshire also receives a 30% Company contribution, on his salary above the pension cap, into fide ned contribution arrangements.
Kevin OByrne receives a 20% Company contribution into his fide ned contribution arrangements.
Duncan Tatton-Brown was also a member of the fide ned bene t arrangement, subject to the scheme cap and received a 15% Company contribution to fide ned contribution arrangements and a cash supplement of 5% on his salary above the pension cap.
Details of individual arrangements for the executive directors are set out on page 45.
King sher plc Annual Report 42 Directors remuneration report and Accounts 2008 09 Non-cash bene ts The Company provides a range of additional bene ts, including medical insurance, a subsidised staff canteen, a staff discount card, 30 working days holiday per year and a company car or cash allowance.
Share ownership guidelines The formal share ownership guidelines prohibit executive directors selling shares obtained through the KIS Shares scheme and long-term incentive plans including the PSP except to meet tax obligations until they hold shares costing or worth at least two times base salary for the Group Chief Executive and at least one times base salary for the Group Finance Director.
The Remuneration Committee believes that this will provide a longerterm retention mechanism and means that, over time, executives will have a signi cant personal interest in King sher shares.
The Remuneration Committee believes these arrangements align executives and shareholders interests effectively and encourage a long-term view of performance.
Executive directors remuneration overview The current annual base salaries of the executive directors as at 25 March 2009 are 800,000 for Ian Cheshire and 575,000 for Kevin OByrne.
