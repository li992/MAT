24 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Report on Directors remuneration for the 52 week period ended 25 December 2009 This report sets out the remuneration policy operated by the Group in respect of the Executive Directors, together with disclosures on all Directors remuneration.
The auditors are required to report on the auditable part of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The Board has reviewed the Groups compliance with the 2008 Combined Code the Code on remuneration related matters and has followed the Code in the preparation of the report of the Remuneration Committee.
It is the opinion of the Board that the Group complied with all remuneration related aspects of the Code during the period.
Unaudited information The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing policy on remuneration for Executive Directors and senior management and for determining specific remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors.
Bill Forrester chairs the Remuneration Committee and its other members are the independent NonExecutive Directors James Newman, Ishbel Macpherson and Alan McWalter.
The Code requires that a Group of the size of Dignity plc has a Remuneration Committee comprising a minimum of three nonexecutives.
The Remuneration Committee members have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interests arising from cross directorships and no daytoday involvement in running the business.
The Chairman and the Chief Executive attend the Remuneration Committee by invitation or when required and the Company Secretary, who is also the Corporate Services Director, attended meetings when required as Secretary to the Remuneration Committee.
No Executive Director takes part in discussions relating to their own remuneration and benefits.
The Remuneration Committee is formally constituted with written terms of reference.
A copy of the terms of reference is available for inspection on the Groups investor website www.
The Committee met four times during 2009.
At those meetings basic salaries of Executive Directors and senior managers were reviewed, the targets and quantum of annual performance related bonuses for Directors were also agreed, as were options granted under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The meetings also approved the payment of the 2008 performance related bonus and the vesting of the shares awarded under the LTIP scheme in 2006.
A further meeting was also held in March 2010 to approve the payment of the performance related bonus for 2009, LTIP awards and bonus targets for 2010.
In 2008, the Committee retained the external benefit consultants, Hewitt New Bridge Street, to complete a review of the Executive Directors remuneration.
In discussions with the Committee, and in consultation with Hewitt New Bridge Street, it was decided that a Comparator Group would be defined consisting of all companies in the Consumer Goods and Consumer Services Sector of the FTSE 250 filtered to exclude companies deriving more than 50 per cent of their turnover from overseas or having a market capitalisation in excess of 1.4 billion at that time.
This gave a group of 32 companies with an average market capitalisation of 628 million at November 2008 as the Comparator Group.
At that date Dignity had a market capitalisation of 473 million and an enterprise value including net debt of 710 million.
The bottom half of the FTSE 250 was also used as a reference point for the benchmarking process.
The Committee continue to believe that the use of this Comparator Group is the most appropriate way of reviewing and setting Executive Directors salaries.
Remuneration policy The objective of the remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages to each Executive Director that will: Align rewards with the interests of shareholders: Motivate and encourage superior performance: Allow the Group to retain the talent needed to execute its business strategy: and Enable the Group to be competitive when recruiting appropriately skilled and experienced management.
The Remuneration Committee believes that this policy will retain and develop further the Groups entrepreneurial culture, whilst also focusing executive remuneration on performance which the Committee believes will best serve shareholders interests.
It is therefore the aim of the Remuneration Committee to encourage and reward superior performance by Executive Directors with that performance being based on strong financial performance and returns to shareholders.
This is achieved by weighting the overall remuneration package towards achievement of that performance.
Only 31 per cent of each Executive Directors total potential remuneration package ignoring benefits and pension contributions is accounted for by basic salary, assuming a full annual bonus is achieved and a maximum conditional award under the LTIP is made.
The Remuneration Committee will continue to review all aspects of the policy on an annual basis to ensure that rewards continue to be in line with the Groups objectives and shareholders interests.
25 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Basic salary When determining the basic salary of the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration: The levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills, in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity: The performance of the individual Executive Director: The individual Executive Directors experience and responsibilities: and Payand conditions throughout the Group.
No changes were made to their basic salaries during the period.
It was also requested by the Executive Directors and agreed by the Remuneration Committee that basic salaries for 2010 will remain unchanged.
Salaries effective from 1 January 2010 are: 2009 2010 Name 000 000 Mike McCollum 440 440 Andrew Davies 250 250 Richard Portman 200 200 Steve Whittern 150 150 Total 1,040 1,040 Annual performance related bonus The targets for the year, which are based on the achievement of set earnings per share targets, are reviewed and set annually by the Committee to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and remain challenging.
They are ratified by the full Board.
The targets are designed to enhance shareholder value.
The maximum bonus attainable for 2009 by Executive Directors was 100 per cent of basic salary.
A bonus of 70 per cent isattainable for meeting the first earnings per share target set by the Committee and a further bonus of 30 per cent may be earned by achieving a second and more demanding earnings per share target.
The increase in underlying earnings per share during the period was 6 per cent and the bonus percentage earned by the Executive Directors in the period was 85 per cent.
No other bonuses of any description were paid in the period to Executive Directors.
No changes have been proposed to the Annual Performance Related Bonus for 2010 and there were no departures from this policy in the current period.
This will continue to be based on demanding earnings per share targets with a maximum bonus equal to 100 per cent of base salary.
The scheme is in line with the market median for the bottom half of the FTSE 250 and the lower quartile of the Comparator Group.
Share incentives Shareholders approved the current discretionary share incentive plan, the LTIP, on 5 June 2009.
If existing LTIPs were to be amended or if there was a new LTIP Scheme, approval would be sought from the shareholders.
No changes are presently planned for the existing scheme.
All Executive Directors and other employees are entitled to be considered for the grant of conditional share awards under the LTIP.
Under the rules, the maximum annual award that can be made to an individual is 125 per cent of salary.
All four Executive Directors serving at the start of the year, were granted conditional share awards during 2009 equivalent to the maximum award.
The Committee deemed this award appropriate, as in previous years, mindful of the need to encourage superior performance from the Executive Directors and ensure that a significant proportion of their total remuneration is linked to the performance of the Group.
This award is in addition to those granted in all years from 2004 to 2009.
Richard Portman, prior to his appointment to the Board, received a conditional share award in 2006 equal to 100 per cent of his salary.
Steve Whittern received an award equal to 100 per cent of his salary in 2006 and awards of 4,000 shares in each of the years 2007 and 2008, prior to his appointment to the Board on 29 December 2008.
Total awards made to the Executive Directors under the scheme are shown on page 29.
Eligible Executives are awarded rights, in the form of nil cost conditional share awards, to acquire a maximum number of shares at thebeginning of a three year period, the proportion of which they will be entitled to receive at the end of that period depending on the extent to which the performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the time the allocation is made, are satisfied.
The Remuneration Committee selected comparative Total Shareholder Return TSR as the performance condition for LTIP awards as it ensures that the Group outperforms the FTSE 350 Index over the measurement period indelivering shareholder value, before the Eligible Executives are entitled to receive any of their awards.
The constituent companies of the FTSE 350 Index, at the time the awards are made, were selected as a benchmark as there are no directly 26 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Report on Directors remuneration continued for the 52 week period ended 25 December 2009 comparable quoted companies in the United Kingdom and as Dignity is now a constituent of the FTSE 350 this is still a valid benchmark.
The Remuneration Committee will calculate the TSR in accordance with the rules of the scheme and ratify the calculation prior to the release of any award.
Performance conditions under the LTIP are not subject to retesting.
The percentage of the conditional share awards made up to and including the awards in 2009 are exercisable on vesting as follows: Ranked in the top quintile: 100 per cent of the total award: Ranked at median: 40 per cent of the total award: Ranked below median: zero: and Ranked between median and top quintile: straightline apportionment.
The percentage of the conditional share awards exercisable on vesting from the 2010 awards and onwards is calculated as follows: Ranked in the top quartile: 100 per cent of the total award: Ranked at median: 25 per cent of the total award: Ranked below median: zero: and Ranked between median and top quintile: straightline apportionment.
In addition and irrespective of the TSR performance target, no award will vest unless, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the underlying financial performance of the Group has been satisfactory over the measurement period.
The graph showsthe Groups TSR compared to the FTSE 350.
This gives a broad indication of the likelihood of any conditional award vesting.
5 Year Total Shareholder Return 300% 250% 200% 150% 100% 50% 0% Dignity plc FTSE 350 Index On 24 March 2009 the conditional share awards made in 2006 under the LTIP became capable of vesting.
The TSR of the Group over the measurement period was compared to that of the constituent companies of the FTSE 350 at the time the awards were made.
The performance of the Group was found to be in the top quintile.
On that basis the Remuneration Committee, mindful also of the continued strong performance of the Group, recommended that the entire 2006 share award vest.
Shares were issued to Peter Hindley, Mike McCollum and Andrew Davies on 1 April 2009 and sold in their entirety the following day by the Groups brokers.
On the same day 20,366 shares were issued to Richard Portman who sold 11,000 shares the following day and Steve Whittern was issued with 12,434 shares and sold 6,800 shares on the following day.
Both sales were completed by the Groups brokers.
The total conditional awards held by each Director are shown on page 29 in the section of the Remuneration Committees Report that is subject to audit.
In accordance with the ABI guidelines, the Group can issue a maximum of 10 per cent of its issued share capital in a rolling ten year period to employees under all share plans.
In addition, of this 10 per cent, the Company can only issue 5 per cent to satisfy awards under discretionary or executive plans.
At the period end, conditional awards under the LTIP Scheme to Executive Directors and senior managers amount to 1.14 per cent of the current issued share capital.
If the awards in 2004, 2005 and 2006, that have vested, are included, that percentage is 2.49 per cent.
The total, including SAYE options granted in both the 2004 and 2007 Schemes, is 3.82 per cent.

The policy on termination is that the Group does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations, which do not include any payment from the takeover or liquidation of the Group.

Under the Companys Articles of Association, one third of the Directors are required to submit themselves for reelection every year.
At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting Richard Portman, Bill Forrester and Mike McCollum will submit themselves for reelection.
