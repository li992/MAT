Remuneration Report Remuneration Report Statement from the Chairman of the Board Remuneration Committee - an overview The remuneration report was prepared by the Remuneration Committee and approved by the board.
The board believes that a properly constituted and effective remuneration committee is key to improving the link between directors pay and performance, with the ultimate aim of enhancing our competitiveness.
The primary purpose of the committee is to determine our policy on the remuneration of executive directors and the remuneration package for each executive director.
The committee consists entirely of non-executive directors, and executive directors are not involved in determining their own remuneration packages.
This report describes our remuneration policy and directors remuneration for the 2009 financial year.
Our overall remuneration philosophy remains unchanged from prior years, however, certain aspects with respect to the components of our reward programmes have been reviewed and amended.
During the period, in addition to its regular business, the committee focused specifi cally on: The continued appropriateness of our long standing reward programmes given volatile market conditions The introduction of a non-cash deferred component of our variable remuneration payments see page 194 Industry commentary and developments with respect to remuneration practices, notably: - the Financial Services Authority FSA Reforming remuneration practices in financial services consultation paper of March 2009 - the South African Registrar of Banks circular 2 2008 and their review of incentive schemes operated by South African based banks Talent management and the retention of senior management and executives.
Key points to note for the period under review include: Investec has continued to operate its diversi ed business model which has enabled it to navigate through the present challenging operating environment.
Core capital and liquidity ratios remain sound and the group has reported attributable earnings of 269.2 million 2008: 344.7 million.
The group has increased the upper end of its dividend cover range and its capital adequacy targets.
Further information on our risk management indicators, policies and procedures and the groups performance can be found on page 201.
Total employee costs decreased from 552.2 million to 520.2 million with xed costs increasing by 8.6% to 375.3 million and variable remuneration decreasing by 29.9% to 144.8 million.
34.2 million of the current years variable remuneration has been paid in the form of share awards and deferred representing 23.6% of our variable remuneration expense for the year.
Executive directors have received no salary increases for the 2010 financial year and bonuses have decreased by 51.7%.
Non-executive directors will receive no increases in fee arrangements for the 2010 financial year.
Our rewards programmes continue to be appropriately adjusted for risk and unrealised pro ts.
We further believe that our reward programmes align directors and employees interests with those of our other stakeholders.
Our total shareholder return was negative 7.5% for Investec plc in Pounds Sterling and negative 26.6% for Investec Limited in Rands.
This compares to a negative return of 45.8% for the FTSE 350 General Finance Index.
The group has decreased its dividend return by 12.2% in Pounds Sterling and 2.8% in Rands over the year.
We have also experienced a decline in our share price as a result of the global credit and liquidity crisis.
This decline is not out of line with the fall in share prices of other UK universal and global investment banks.
Since listing on the London Stock Exchange in 2002, Investec plc has outperformed the FTSE 350 General Finance Index see graph on page 198.
Executive directors hold 1.6% and 3.2% of the issued share capital of Investec plc and Investec Limited, respectively.
Nonexecutive directors hold 0.7% and 4.0% of the issued share capital of Investec plc and Investec Limited, respectively see table on page 201.
Investec plc issued 1.6 million ordinary shares and Investec Limited issued 2.3 million ordinary shares to the staff share schemes during the year.
Looking forward The Remuneration Committee will continue to ensure that reward packages remain appropriately competitive, provide an incentive for performance, and take due regard of our culture, values, philosophies, business strategy and risk management and capital framework.
The committee will keep the existing remuneration arrangements, as discussed in this report, under review during the 2010 financial year, particularly taking cognisance of regulatory and market driven remuneration reform proposals.
Where appropriate, we will continue to consult shareholders and shareholder bodies on any signi cant proposed changes in remuneration policy.
The committee unanimously recommends that you vote to approve this report at the 2009 Annual General Meeting.
Signed on behalf of the board George Alford Chairman, Remuneration Committee 15 June 2009 Annual report 2009 189 Remuneration Report Remuneration Report Compliance and governance statement The Remuneration Report complies with the provisions of the 2006 London Combined Code, Schedule 7A of the UK Companies Act 1985, the UK Financial Services Authority Listing Rules, the South African King II Code of Corporate Practice and Conduct and the JSE Limited Listing Rules.
Additional information has also been included to re ect the most common enquiries received and to address some of the issues raised in the various public debates that are currently ongoing with respect to remuneration practices.
Furthermore, the auditors are of the opinion that the auditable part of this report on pages 199 to 205 was properly prepared, in accordance with Schedule 7A of the UK Companies Act 1985.
Composition and role of the committee The members of the Remuneration Committee throughout the year were George Alford Chairman, Geoffrey Howe and Sir Chips Keswick.
The members are all independent non-executive directors and are free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
All the members are also members of the groups Board Risk and Capital Committee and the Audit Committee as discussed on page 176 and 179, thus bringing risk and control mechanisms into their deliberations.
The committees principal responsibilities and objectives are to: Determine, develop and agree with the board, the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of executive directors and executive management comprising individuals discharging managerial responsibilities who are the global heads of our core areas of activity and are members of our global operations forum.
Ensure that quali ed and experienced management and executives will be provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and will be, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their contribution to the success of the group and alignment with the corporate objectives and business strategy.
Review and approve the design of, and determine targets and objectives for any performance related pay schemes for directors and executive management and approve annual payouts under such schemes.
Determine, within the terms of the agreed policy, the total individual remuneration packages of executive directors and executive management including, where appropriate, bonuses, incentive payments and share scheme awards.
Oversee any major changes in our employee bene t structures.
Ensure that the comments, recommendations and rules within the UK and South Africa pertaining to directors remuneration are given due regard, in determining the packages of executive directors.
The committee is authorised by the board to seek any information it requires from any employee in order to perform its duties.
The committees terms of reference are available on our website.
Meetings The committee met six times during the financial year with full attendance other than for four meetings which Sir Chips Keswick was unable to attend, having been excused from attending several board meetings and board committee meetings between 1 April 2008 and 31 March 2009 due to health reasons.
However, his views and advice were obtained where considered necessary by the Chairman.
The Company Secretary of Investec plc acts as Secretary to the committee.
Executive directors do not attend these meetings.
The Chairman of the committee reports on the activities of the committee at each meeting of the full board.
Advisers to the committee Where appropriate, the committee has access to independent executive remuneration consultants.
The selection of the advisers is at the discretion of the committee Chairman and Investec funds any expenses relating to the appointment of external consultants.
During the financial year, the committee continued to use the services of its advisers, Hewitt New Bridge Street which, among other things, speci cally reviewed and provided information on industry consultation papers and developments with respect to remuneration practices and our alignment to them.
In addition, they continued to review and provide information on appropriate benchmark, industry and comparable organisations remuneration practices.
Their recommendations are important in the ongoing review of our remuneration practices.
Furthermore, we have used the services of Linklaters, which have advised this year mainly on a number of issues pertaining to our incentive plans.
Linklaters is one of Investec plcs legal advisers.
Certain specialist divisions within the group, for example Human Resources and the Staff Shares division, provide supporting information and documentation relating to matters that are presented to the committee.
This includes, for example, comparative data and motivations for proposed salary, bonus and share awards.
The variable remuneration pools are determined by our Finance teams taking into account risk adjusted capital requirements and after eliminating unrealised gains.
The employees within these specialist divisions, which provide support to the committee, are not board directors and are not appointed by the committee.
190 Annual report 2009 Remuneration Report Remuneration Report The committee, together with the board, attends a strategic offsite at the beginning of each year at which senior executive employees provide information and presentations on the groups strategic direction, prospects, key focus areas and annual budget.
While executive directors have the right to address any meeting of the committee, they play no role in the determination of their remuneration package.
During the financial year no executive director attended any meeting of the Remuneration Committee.
Furthermore, no employee participates in discussions or decisions of the committee relating to their own remuneration.
Policy on executive directors and employees remuneration Our philosophy and policy remain unchanged from prior years and aim to employ the highest calibre individuals who are characterised by integrity, intellect and innovation and who adhere and subscribe to our culture, values and philosophies.
We strive to inspire entrepreneurship by providing a working environment that stimulates extraordinary performance, so that executive directors and employees may be positive contributors to our clients, their communities and the group.
We reward executive directors and employees for their contribution through payment of an industry competitive annual package, a variable performance reward and ownership in the form of share incentive scheme participation.
Overall rewards are considered as important as our core values of work content greater responsibility, variety of work and high level of challenge and work af liation entrepreneurial feel to the company and unique culture in the attraction, retention and motivation of employees.
We have a strong entrepreneurial, merit and values-based culture, characterised by passion, energy and stamina.
The ability to live and perpetuate our values, culture and philosophies in the pursuit of excellence is considered paramount in determining overall reward levels.
The type of people the organisation attracts, and the culture and environment within which they work, remain crucial in determining our success and long-term progress.
The key principles of our remuneration policy for executive directors and employees, which were consistently applied during the financial year, are as follows: Reward programmes are designed and administered to align directors and employees interests with those of stakeholders, thus ensuring the promotion of effective risk management.
Reward programmes incorporate a pool mechanism that incorporates risk factors as discussed on page 193.
Reward programmes are clear and transparent, in order to retain individual interest in, and identi cation with, our short and long-term success.
Total rewards comprise a xed and variable component.
Total compensation base salary, pension, bene ts and incentives is targeted in normal market conditions to the relevant competitive market see below at upper quartile levels for superior performance.
A signi cant proportion of rewards, including annual and long-term incentive components, are explicitly linked to the performance of the business and the individual business units.
We recognise the performance of the business and the individual.
As indicated above, qualitative and quantitative issues form an integral part of the determination of reward levels.
We do not apply an upper limit on performance bonuses given our risk based Economic Value Added approach discussed further on page 193 and prefer to contain the xed cost component of remuneration at modest levels.
Reward levels are targeted to be commercially competitive, on the following basis: - The most relevant competitive reference points for reward levels are based on the scope of responsibility and individual contributions made.
- Appropriate benchmark, industry and comparable organisations remuneration practices are reviewed regularly.
For executive directors, the FTSE 350 General Finance rms provide the most appropriate benchmark.
For employees, a combination of rms from the JSE Financial 15 and the FTSE 350 General Finance sector offer the most appropriate benchmark.
The committee also reviews on an individual basis data on other international banks with whom we compete.
The committee recognises that we operate an international business and compete with both local and international competitors in each of our markets.
In order to avoid disproportionate packages across areas of the group and between executives, adjustments are made at any extremes to ensure broad internal consistency.
Adjustments may also be made to the competitive positioning of pay components for individuals, in cases where a higher level of investment is needed in order to build or grow either a business unit or our capability in a geography.
Annual report 2009 191 Remuneration Report Remuneration Report Policy on non-executive directors remuneration The board agrees and determines the fees of non-executive directors and the fees are reviewed annually.
The boards policy is that fees should re ect individual responsibilities and membership of board committees.
In view of the current market conditions and the focus on controlling xed remuneration, it was decided that the non-executive directors will receive no increase in their fees in the forthcoming year.
Their fee structure covers the dual roles that the directors perform for the UK listed Investec plc and the South African listed Investec Limited boards.
The fee structure for non-executive directors for the 2009 and 2010 financial years is shown below: Non-executive directors remuneration 2009 fi financial year As approved by the board for the 2010 fi financial year Chairmans total fee 360 000 per year 360 000 per year Basic fee non-executive director fee 53 000 per year 53 000 per year Chairman of the DLC Audit Committee 45 000 per year 45 000 per year Chairman of the DLC Remuneration Committee 32 000 per year 32 000 per year Member of the DLC Audit Committee 13 000 per year 13 000 per year Member of the DLC Remuneration Committee 12 500 per year 12 500 per year Member of Investec Bank UK Limited board 9 000 per year 9 000 per year Member of the Investec Bank Limited board R150 000 per year R150 000 per year Fees are also payable for any additional time committed to the group including attendance at certain other meetings There is no requirement for non-executive directors to hold shares in the company.
The company has left this choice to the discretion of each non-executive director.
Service contracts and terms of employment Our executive directors have inde nite contracts of employment, terminable by either party giving six months written notice to the other.
Each executive director is entitled to receive a basic salary and is also eligible for an annual bonus, the amount of which will be determined at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Furthermore, the executive directors may elect to sacri ce a portion of their annual salary to receive company bene ts such as a travel allowance and medical aid.
The full costs of these bene ts will be deducted from their annual salary.
The contracts of employment do not contain provisions for compensation payable on early termination.
Executive directors are permitted to accept outside appointments on external boards or committees so long as these are not deemed to interfere with the business of the Company.
Any fees earned by executives in this regard are not retained and are given back to the respective companies.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts and letters of appointment con rm the terms and conditions of their service.
The letters of appointment do not contain provisions for compensation payable on early termination.
Unless the non-executive directors resign earlier or are removed from their positions, they will remain appointed as directors until the close of our annual general meeting in 2010 subject to rotational re-election as directors at the 2009 meeting and in terms of the provision of the Articles of Association.
All non-executive directors who have been members of the board for longer than nine years are subject to annual re-election as required in terms of our Articles of Association.
Those directors seeking rotational re-election at the 2009 Annual General Meeting are shown on page 172.
Biographical details of the directors of the board These details can be found on pages 219 to 222.
Dates of appointment to the board The boards of Investec plc and Investec Limited are separate and subject to separate legal obligations for each company.
In terms of the DLC arrangements, they comprise the same persons who are authorised, as boards, to manage Investec as if it were a uni ed economic enterprise.
Details on the dates the directors were appointed to the board can be found on page 172.
Policies on the components of remuneration and employment The reward package for executive directors and employees comprises: Base salary and bene ts Annual bonuses Long-term share incentive plans 192 Annual report 2009 Remuneration Report Remuneration Report The committee reviews the elements of the reward package relative to appropriate benchmarks and other comparable organisations, the contribution by the individual and the business as a whole, the value of individuals in perpetuating our values and culture, and the possible replacement cost of such individuals.
The elements of the reward package, as listed above, are discussed below and the components for each director are detailed in tables accompanying this report.
As a consequence of the global financial markets crisis and the resultant debate and review surrounding remuneration policies and procedures the committee has made a few changes to the components of our reward programmes.
Base salary and bene ts Salaries are reviewed annually and re ect the relative skills and experience of, and contribution made by, the individual.
It is the companys policy to seek to set base salaries including bene ts at median market levels.
Bene ts are targeted at competitive levels and are delivered through exible and tailored packages.
Bene ts include pension schemes: life, disability and personal accident insurance: medical cover: and other bene ts, as dictated by competitive local market practices.
Only salaries are pensionable, the annual bonuses paid are not pensionable.
Our disclosure of executive directors salaries on page 199 has been done on a gross basis i. e. inclusive of pension fund contributions from the company.
Annual bonus Annual bonuses are closely linked to business performance, based on target business unit performance goals determined in the main by realised Economic Value Added EVA pro t performance against pre-determined targets above a risk and capital weighted return.
These targets have been in force, and unchanged, for the past few years and are subject to annual review.
Our business strategy and associated risk appetite, together with effective capital utilisation, form the key cornerstones which underpin the EVA annual bonus allocation model.
This model has been consistently applied for in excess of ten years.
Business units share in the annual bonus pool to the extent that they have generated a realised return on their allocated risk adjusted capital base in excess of their target ROE.
Targeted returns re ect the competitive economics and shareholder expectation for the speci c area of the business, and are set with reference to competitive benchmarks for each product line.
Capital allocated is a function of both regulatory and internal capital requirements, the risk assumed within the business and our overall business strategy.
The group has always held capital in excess of minimum regulatory requirements, and this philosophy is perpetuated in our internal capital allocation process.
A detailed explanation of our capital management and allocation process is provided on pages 150 to 154.
Growth in pro tability over time will result in an increasing incentive pool, as long as it is not achieved at the expense of capital ef ciency.
Target returns must be re ective of the inherent risk assumed in the business.
Thus, an increase in absolute pro tability does not automatically result in an increase in the annual bonus pool.
This approach allows us to embed risk and capital discipline in our business processes.
In essence varying levels of return required for each business unit re ect the state of market maturity, country of operation, risk, capital invested capital intensive businesses or expected expense base fee based businesses.
Individual annual incentive levels are allocated from the EVA pool, based on individual performance, as determined by the committee.
Furthermore, as discussed previously, qualitative issues are integral in the determination of annual bonuses.
In this regard, if business and individual performance goals are achieved or bettered, the variable element of the total reward package is likely to be substantially higher than the relevant target market so as to ensure that overall reward levels are positioned at the upper quartile level for superior performance, in line with our overriding remuneration policy.
Developments over the past year During the financial year the group implemented two changes with respect to annual bonus payments, which are highlighted here and explained in more detail below: The introduction of a deferred bonus plan: and The introduction of non-cash bonuses.
Investec Limited Deferred Bonus Plan 2008 and Investec plc Deferred Bonus Plan 2008 In April 2008, the group introduced a deferred bonus scheme whereby a portion of an employees variable remuneration can be awarded in the form of deferred bonus shares.
The first awards were made as part of the June 2008 bonus payments.
These share awards provided for a two-year deferral but the Bonus Plan allows for deferral of between one to five years.
It is the condition of the plan that the employee is still employed by the group on vesting date in order to bene t under this plan.
Participants have no rights in respect of these shares, including the right to dividends, until the vesting date occurs.
Annual report 2009 193 Remuneration Report Remuneration Report EVA share awards non-cash bonuses During the current year the group further re ned its performance bonus policies by introducing a non-cash element in the form of forfeitable share awards for all employees whose bonuses exceed a pre-determined hurdle rate the amount of which will be reviewed each year and by introducing a more formal deferral requirement, initially over an eleven-month period.
These awards will be made in terms of our existing long term incentive plans.
These changes are in addition to the introduction in 2008 of a deferred bonus plan and further align directors and employees interests with those of stakeholders, and ensure that reward programmes are appropriately risk-adjusted.
Share option and long-term share incentive plans We have a number of share option and long-term share incentive plans that are designed to link the interests of directors and employees with those of shareholders and long-term organisational interests, through performance and risk-based equity grants.
Prior to the implementation of our DLC structure and our listing on the London Stock Exchange in July 2002, we had a number of share option, share purchase and leveraged share schemes in place that were appropriate for a South African listed company.
However, at the time of the London listing it was necessary for us to consider implementing a more internationally recognised share scheme structure and philosophy.
As a result, a number of share option plans were introduced to cater for regulatory, tax and other considerations pertaining to the various jurisdictions in which we operated.
At the same time, however, a decision was taken to maintain the schemes that were in place prior to the London listing until the allocations made in terms of those schemes matured.
While this gives rise to what appears to be a multitude of schemes, the philosophy and practical implications are fairly simple the appropriate level of equity allocation is determined for each employee and then awards are made out of the scheme that is considered most appropriate for that individual given his her location, tax and regulatory environment.
The share option and long-term share incentive plans in operation, and in which the directors are eligible to participate, are summarised in the table below and further details are provided on our website.
Executive directors collectively hold approximately 2.2% of the issued share capital of Investec plc and Investec Limited.
Leveraged equity plans A group of senior and executive managers, including certain Investec plc Investec Limited directors, who have or can have a signi cant impact on the business, were granted participation prior to the implementation of the DLC structure in a leveraged equity plan known as Fintique II, which was established in 1996.
This plan reached its final maturity in July 2008.

2 These conditions require growth in headline earnings per share EPS over the relevant option period to equal or exceed the UK Retail Price Index RPI plus 3% compounded annually over the same period.
In choosing the performance targets for this plan, the committee considered the merits of EPS-based targets against other possibilities, such as comparative performance or comparative growth in return on average shareholders funds ROE against a basket of other companies.
The committee determined that EPS-based targets are most appropriate as they measure our underlying growth.
The committee intends to continue to apply this during the 2010 financial year but keeps the whole matter of the suitability of target-linked share based remuneration under periodic review.
This note does not apply to the Share Matching Plan 2005 which has different performance conditions as approved by shareholders further information is available on our website.
3 This represents the number of awards made to all participants.
For further details, see the Directors Report on page 231.
More details on the directors shareholdings are also provided in tables accompanying this report.
4 Dilution limits: Investec is committed to following the Association of British Insurers ABI guidelines and accordingly, as from the date of the implementation of our DLC structure 29 July 2002, the maximum number of new shares which may be issued by the company under all of the share plans in respect of grants made after July 2002 may not exceed 10% of the issued share capital of the company over a rolling ten-year period.
The committee regularly monitors the utilisation of dilution limits and available headroom to ensure that these guidelines are complied with.
The issued share capital of Investec plc and Investec Limited at 31 March 2009 was 444.9 million shares and 268.3 million shares, respectively.
As announced on the stock exchange news services, 1.6 million Investec plc and 2.3 million Investec Limited shares were issued to the staff share schemes during the year.
5 The market price of an Investec plc share as at 31 March 2009 was 2.92 2008: 3.39, ranging from a low of 1.69 to a high of 4.21 during the financial year.

Annual report 2009 197 Remuneration Report Remuneration Report Performance graph total shareholder return We have implemented a DLC structure, in terms of which we have primary listings in London and Johannesburg.
The listing on the London Stock Exchange LSE took place on 29 July 2002, although we have been listed in South Africa since 1986.
Schedule 7A of the UK Companies Act 1985 requires this report to include a performance graph of Investec plcs total shareholder return TSR performance against that of a broad market index.
We found it dif cult to locate an appropriate group of companies to benchmark ourselves against because of our specialist activities.
A number of companies within the FTSE 350 General Finance Index conduct similar activities to us, although they do not necessarily have the same geographical pro le.
Nevertheless, we believe that this is the most appropriate index against which to measure our performance on the LSE.
The graph below shows the cumulative shareholder return for a holding of our shares in blue in Pounds Sterling on the LSE, compared to the average total shareholder return of other members of the FTSE 350 General Finance Index.
It shows that, at 31 March 2009, a hypothetical 100 invested in Investec plc at the time of its listing on the LSE in July 2002 would have generated a total return of 222 compared with a return of 41 if invested in the FTSE 350 General Finance Index.
Investec plc has therefore outperformed the FTSE 350 General Finance Index over the period.
During the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2009, the return to shareholders of Investec plc measured in Pounds Sterling and Investec Limited measured in Rands was negative 7.5% and negative 26.6%, respectively.
The market price of our shares on the LSE was 2.92 as at 31 March 2009, ranging from a low of 1.69 to a high of 4.21 during the financial year.
Furthermore, the market price of our shares on the JSE Limited was R38.86 as at 31 March 2009, ranging from a low of R27.20 to a high of R63.19 during the financial year.
2 Gross remuneration of S Koseff, B Kantor and A Tapnack has increased on average by approximately 4%.
The gross remuneration of GR Burger is determined in Rands and converted into Pounds Sterling.
In Rand terms GR Burgers gross remuneration increased by 7.7% from R2 795 833 to R3 012 500.
Gross remuneration increases for other employees across the group have generally been in the range of 2% to 8%, and the increases awarded to executive directors are consistent with this.
The executive directors have received no increases in salaries for the 2010 financial year.
3 The executive directors receive other bene ts which may include pension schemes: life, disability and personal accident insurance: and medical cover, on similar terms to other senior executives.
4 In determining annual bonuses, a number of quantitative and qualitative factors metrics were considered which included: - The group recorded a decline in attributable earnings, dividends per share and total shareholder return.
- The group, however, maintained a sound balance sheet with low leverage and healthy capital and liquidity ratios during a challenging operating environment.
- The group reported operating pro ts in all of its core geographies, bene ting from its recurring income base.
- The group maintained its capital strength without recourse to shareholders, new investors or government assistance.
- A focused and intimate involvement of the executive directors in ensuring stringent management of risk, liquidity and capital.
- The group emerged from this period with its capacity to compete, its brand and its entrepreneurial spirit unimpeded.
Further information on the groups performance and risk management metrics have been discussed elsewhere in the Annual Report.
