During the year, the Remuneration Committee received external advice from Deloitte & Touche LLP.
In addition, Directors and employees of the Group, who provided material advice or services to the Committee during the year were Mike Norris CEO, Stephen Benad Company Secretary and Barry Hoffman HR Director.
The Committee considers comparative practice in the European technology sector, FTSE techMARK 100 companies and FTSE 250 companies.
Remuneration policy The Committee reviews and determines, on behalf of the Board, the overall remuneration policy of the Executive Directors, Chairman and with advice from the Chief Executive Officer, the senior executives.
No individual is involved in deciding his own remuneration.
The Executive Directors make recommendations for approval by the Board concerning the fees for Non-Executive Directors that reflect the time, commitment and responsibilities of their roles.
The Companys remuneration policy is designed to reward Executive Directors with remuneration arrangements that are competitive, but not excessive and which further align the interests of the Directors and shareholders.
The policy is designed to ensure that a significant proportion of the total remuneration is dependent upon the Groups financial performance, over the fiscal year as well as over extended periods and that the remuneration policy is aligned to the Groups risk profile.
These objectives are achieved through a combination of base salary and benefits, performance related annual bonuses, a defined contribution pension scheme and share incentive schemes.
Remuneration The main elements of Executive Directors Remuneration for 2009 are shown below, with the 2010 elements detailed on page 35.

34 Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Basic salary and benefits Each Directors salary is reviewed annually, in order to ensure that the basic salary and benefits remain appropriate.
During the review, the Committee considers various factors including performance and relevant market practices on pay, as well as conditions affecting the Group generally.
For 2009, the Board as a whole agreed that no Director would receive a base salary increase during the year.
The Remuneration Committee have, for the third consecutive year, agreed that no Executive Director will receive a base salary increase during 2010 however, amendments have been made to the structure of the bonus scheme, as detailed below.
The Executive Directors receive benefits in line with those offered to employees throughout the Group, including the provision of a car allowance, life insurance, personal accident insurance and the opportunity to participate in the Groups Save as You Earn scheme SAYE, as well as participation in the flexible benefits scheme My Benefits.
Performance-related bonus scheme The Executive Directors participate in an annual performance-related bonus scheme and in 2009, for the role of CEO, this had a maximum threshold of 100 per cent of base salary.
For the role of Finance Director, the maximum threshold was 75 per cent of base salary.
The level of bonus payable is dependent on the achievement of Group financial performance targets and specific personal objectives.
Regarding the award for 2009, up to 75 per cent of the maximum bonus potential was linked to the financial performance of the Group against pre-agreed targets.
The balance 25 per cent of the maximum bonus potential was related to the achievement of specific personal objectives agreed with each Director, for the year, by the Chairman or Chief Executive, as appropriate, and approved by the Committee.
In order for the personal objective element of the bonus to be achieved, the Group budgeted profit target had to have been reached.
For 2009, Mike Norris earned 413,250 2008: 124,688, representing 87 per cent of the maximum and Tony Conophy earned 189,000 2008: 78,750, representing 84 per cent of the maximum.
The Remuneration Committee have reviewed the bonus arrangements for 2010 and have recommended some changes to the bonus structure.
For 2010, 80 per cent of the Executive Directors bonuses will be linked to the financial performance of the Group against pre-agreed targets, with 20 per cent of the bonus being dependent on the achievement of specific personal objectives.
In addition, from 2010, it will be possible to exceed the maximum bonus potential, subject to an overachievement on the PBT element of the bonus targets, up to an absolute maximum bonus potential of 115 per cent of base salary for the role of CEO and 86.25 per cent for the role of Finance Director.
Pension The Executive Directors participate in the Computacenter Pension Scheme, a defined contribution salary sacrifice scheme, under which a maximum annual Company contribution of 5,400 per employee is payable, based on basic salary.
The scheme also allows employees to make additional salary sacrifices, which the Company may contribute to the scheme, on their behalf.
Share incentive schemes Share incentive schemes are considered to be an important part of the executive remuneration policy, designed to support management retention and motivation, whilst aligning senior managements interests with those of shareholders.
The details of the historical grants and associated performance conditions are set out in the table of Directors interests in share options on page 38.
Performance Share Plan annual awards The Performance Share Plan 2005 PSP is the Companys primary long-term incentive scheme for Executive Directors and senior employees.
The Committee approves grants under this scheme, once a year, although further grants may be made in appropriate circumstances.
At the 2009 Annual General Meeting, the maximum value of shares that may be awarded under the plan to an employee in a financial year, was increased from one to two times base salary, which can be exceeded in exceptional circumstances to a maximum of three times base salary.
For 2010, the Committee agreed that awards made to the Executive Directors would be in the range of 0.75 to one times base salary.
Annual awards under this plan are subject to performance conditions, as detailed below: For 2009, the PSP performance target was based on the Groups annual adjusted earning per share EPS growth in relation to the retail price index RPI and measured over a three-year period.
This arrangement applies throughout the Group, except in France, where a two-year measurement period applies, with a further condition that the shares are held for an additional two-year holding period, in order to gain favourable tax treatment.
No shares subject to awards will vest if cumulative annual growth is less than RPI plus 3 per cent.
One quarter of the shares will vest at RPI plus 3 per cent.
Awards will vest in full if the Groups cumulative annual growth is at or above RPI plus 7.5 per cent.
If the Groups EPS growth over the period is between 3 per cent and 7.5 per cent above RPI, awards will vest on a straight line basis between those limits.
There will be no retesting of the performance target.
EPS has been chosen as a performance measure as it is widely used and is considered a transparent yardstick.
EPS is calculated on a pre-exceptional, diluted basis.
The Committee has reviewed the performance criteria to ensure that these remain sufficiently challenging in light of market expectations and in comparison to market practice.
It has been agreed that the performance conditions for the annual grant made in 2010, will remain the same.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 35 Directors remuneration report continued Share incentive schemes continued Performance Share Plan special awards During 2008, the Committee reviewed the level of long-term incentivisation and, after shareholder consultation, approved an additional grant for 2009 only, which was made to six senior executives, including the Executive Directors.
This one-off award is subject to significantly more challenging performance conditions, than the annual grant and was designed not only to incentivise but to provide an aspirational target.
The performance condition attached to this award is based on the Groups profit before tax, for the year ended 31 December 2011.
If in 2011, profit before tax reaches 90 million, 25 per cent of the award will vest and, if the profit before tax is 100 million or more, 100 per cent of the awards will vest.
Awards will vest on a straight line basis between those limits.
Share options The Company also operates the Computacenter Employee Share Option Scheme 2007 the scheme.
As the PSP is the primary long-term incentive scheme, the Committee intends that the scheme be used only in limited circumstances.
No grants were made to employees or Directors, under this scheme, during 2009.
The Executive Directors have historically been awarded share options under the Companys previous share option schemes and details of these grants can be found in the table of Directors interests in share options on page 38.
The maximum number of options that can be awarded under the scheme will remain three times base salary, although this can be exceeded in exceptional circumstances.
Where grants are made to Executive Directors, it is current policy to grant a maximum of 1.25 times base salary.
Should grants be made under the scheme in 2010, any applicable performance conditions will be subject to review by the Committee, taking account of prevailing market conditions, Group plans and objectives.
Dilution limits The Company uses a mixture of both new issue and market purchase shares to satisfy awards under the option, PSP and SAYE schemes.
In line with best practice, the use of new issue or treasury shares to satisfy awards made under all share schemes, is restricted to 10 per cent in any 10-year rolling period, with a further restriction for discretionary schemes of 5 per cent in the same period.
As at the year-end, the potential dilution from awards under all share plans was approximately 5.15 per cent and the potential dilution from awards under the discretionary schemes was approximately 2.18 per cent.
