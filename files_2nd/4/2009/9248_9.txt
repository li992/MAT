Directors remuneration report for the year to 31 December 2009 The Directors remuneration report sets out the Companys policy on the remuneration of executive and non-executive directors together with details of directors remuneration packages and service contracts.
The Remuneration Committee, which met five times during the year, is responsible for recommending to the Board the Companys general policy on remuneration and in particular determining the remuneration packages of the Chairman and the executive directors, and the grant of all options and awards of shares.
The Chairman does not attend discussions on his own remuneration.
The members of the Remuneration Committee are appointed by the Board and the membership is reviewed at least annually.
The Chairman of the Committee is appointed by the Board and cannot be the Chairman of the Board.
The Chief Executive is given notice of all meetings and, at the request of the Chairman of the Committee, attends the meetings.
The Chief Executive may request that he attends and speaks at Committee meetings.
In normal circumstances, the Chief Executive will be consulted on general policy matters and matters concerning the other executive directors and employees.
The written Terms of Reference are available on the Companys website and from the Company on request.
They will also be on display at the Annual General Meeting.
The Remuneration Committee, chaired by Mr A J Reading, comprises the Chairman, Mr N J Keen, and Sir Christopher Hum, Professor Michael Kelly, Mr A M Robb and Dr W R Spivey, all independent non-executive directors.
Mr Keen is a member of the Committee because the Board considers it essential that the Chairman be involved in setting remuneration policy.
Miss A M Downie, the Company Secretary, acts as Secretary to the Committee.
The Board, as a whole, is responsible for setting the remuneration of the non-executive directors.
The Remuneration Committee has during the past year retained Watson Wyatt Limited now known as Towers Watson to provide independent external professional advice in respect of, inter alia, their knowledge of shareholder views on remuneration, trends in market practice, and the validation of certain performance criteria.
Towers Watson also provide pension actuarial services to Laird PLC and to the Trustees of the Laird Pension Scheme.
The Remuneration Committee has also sought the views of the Chief Executive, Mr P J Hill, during the year.
Remuneration Policy The Remuneration Committee has established a policy on the remuneration of executive directors and the Board has established a policy for the non-executive directors.
Executive Directors The current policy for providing remuneration for the executive directors is to have an incentive driven remuneration package which promotes the alignment of interests of executive directors and shareholders.
That policy is based upon the following principles:  the need to link remuneration to achieving strategic objectives and to sustainable long-term corporate success having due regard to environmental, social and governance issues and the overall risk profile of the Group:  the reward opportunity offered to executive directors should be sufficiently competitive to recruit and retain management of the appropriate calibre and experience:  the need to provide a total compensation package which reflects the international complexity of Lairds operations: and  to be mindful of Company performance and overall shareholder returns, and the implications of this for executive remuneration.
The executive directors receive base salary, annual performance awards up to a maximum percentage of base salary, pensions and other benefits, and long term performance awards.
Base salaries, benefits and performance awards of the executive directors are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee.
Base salaries are determined with reference to an appropriate comparator group of companies which is reviewed regularly.
Benefits comprise the provision of a car or car allowance, life, disability and health insurance, participation in the annual performance scheme and membership of a pension scheme.
Neither performance incentive awards nor benefits in kind are pensionable.
Performance linked incentives are a key component of the total remuneration package.
Since 2003, the Remuneration Committee has granted options and awards under the Companys executive share option plans and Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
A summary of these arrangements is set out below.
The Committee believes that a combination of Share Option Plans and the LTIP for senior executives is the most appropriate way of providing the incentive to create substantial improvement in the Companys performance in a way that aligns the interests of executives and shareholders.
Service Agreements Each of the executive directors has a service agreement.
Messrs Hill and Silvers service agreements are dated 8 March 2004.
Mr Rapps service agreement is dated 31 December 2004.
In line with the Companys policy, the executive directors service agreements are not for a fixed term and provide for twelve months written notice of termination from either party.
Mr Rapps service agreement is with Laird Technologies, Inc. and he has a separate letter dated 7 March 2008 from the Company in respect of his appointment as an executive director.
In 2006, the terms of employment for the executive directors in the UK were amended to change the contractual retirement date from age 60 to age 65 to comply with the Employment Equality Age Regulations 2006 which came into force in the UK on 1 October 2006.
The executives may still retire at age 60 with their retirement benefits unchanged from the previous arrangements.
The Companys policy on termination is to comply with the contractual terms and conditions set out in the service agreement.
The Company may, at its election, make a payment in lieu of notice.
The payment would be calculated as the total of the directors base salary plus the value of his benefits, in each case by reference to the period of the unexpired notice of termination.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts.
They are appointed under letters of appointment which provide for a review every three years.
The appointment is subject to termination if the non-executive ceases to be qualified to act as a director of the Company: if he resigns by written notice: or he is not re-elected under the Companys Articles of Association.
Dates of appointment are shown on pages 26 and 27.
Shareholding Guidelines Shareholding guidelines, under which executive directors will be expected to retain, as shares, all of the after-tax profit on the gains made on the vesting of LTIP awards and the exercise of existing or future executive share options, until they have acquired a shareholding equal in value to their base salaries, were introduced in 2003.
At 31 December 2009, Messrs Hill, Silver and Rapp owned shares equivalent to a multiple of 0.62 2008, 0.46, 1.41 2008, 1.06 and 0.28 2008, 0.27 of their base salaries respectively.
During the year, all three directors increased their shareholdings by taking up their rights under the Rights Issue announced on 28 October 2009 see page 30.
40 Laird PLC Non-Executive Directors Lairds policy is to establish and maintain a body of non-executive directors with a breadth of international skills and experience that is relevant to Lairds global businesses.
In this context, it is the Boards policy for the non-executive directors to be paid a level of fee that reflects market conditions and is sufficient to attract individuals with appropriate knowledge and experience.

At their request, the executive directors salaries have not been reviewed subsequently.
The Remuneration Committee also felt that a freeze in base salaries was appropriate in the current economic environment.
Historically, the Remuneration Committee, in reviewing salaries, took account of the individuals and the Companys performance, as well as an analysis prepared by Towers Watson of salaries and compensation of both a comparator group and a wider spread of companies.
Mr Rapps base, performance and pension related compensation is denominated in US dollars and the figures above are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for each year.
Increases in base salary in 2009 for management level employees in Laird PLC and Laird Technologies were generally in the range of 3% to 5%.
Greater increases were awarded to certain individuals as a result of promotions or significant increases in the scale or geographic scope of their responsibilities.
Outside Appointments The Board believes that there can be significant benefits, to both the Company and the individual, from executive directors accepting non-executive directorships of companies outside the Group.
The Board takes into account the likely time commitment for such appointments prior to approving them.
The directors are entitled to retain the fees for such appointments.
During the year, Mr Hill was a non-executive director of Meggitt plc and a non-executive board member of UK Trade & Investment until 31 March 2009.
He was entitled to retain the fees of 45,000 and 2,400 respectively 2008, 45,000 and 4,800 respectively.
Mr Rapp was a non-executive director of Kionix, Inc until 16 November 2009 when it was sold and he was paid 14,349 fees 2008, 16,173.
In addition, Mr Rapp had options in Kionix, Inc which were exercised as part of the sale agreement, he received 57,948 in cash with a further 6,439 held in escrow and payable, pursuant to the sale agreement, in two tranches 18 months and 36 months from date of sale.
Mr Silver was a non-executive director of INVESCO Income Growth Trust plc during the year and he was entitled to retain fees of 21,000 2008, 19,000.
Annual Performance Incentive Awards The awards in 2009 for the executive directors were determined by the Remuneration Committee.
For the UK executive directors, up to a maximum of 100% of base salary could be earned for exceptional performance and for Mr Rapp the maximum was 125%.
The award criteria established for 2009 were based on targets in respect of profit before tax, cash generation, and the achievement of criteria designed to assess and drive performance against a number of key, measurable strategic objectives for the Company, including those relating to environmental, safety and social and corporate responsibility issues.
The specific criteria used are not disclosed for reasons of commercial sensitivity, but include, inter alia, expansion of the customer base, market share gains, turnarounds in the profitability of certain businesses, and aggressive cost reduction targets.
Actual awards as a percentage of base salary in respect of 2009 for Messrs Hill, Rapp and Silver were 10% each.
These took into account the underlying financial performance and the strategic development of both Laird PLC and of its operating division, Laird Technologies.
No awards were made in respect of annual profits targets, with awards at the lower end of the scale being made in respect of certain cash generation metrics and the partial achievement of measurable strategic objectives.
Actual awards in respect of 2008 were 10%, 17% and 10% respectively.
The levels of annual performance awards have thus been scaled back very significantly in 2008 and 2009 from those made in 2004 to 2007 to reflect the difficult trading conditions due to the global economic recession.
Pensions Mr Rapp, who is based in the USA, is a member of an employee managed defined contribution programme to which Laird Technologies, Inc. makes a 50% match of the members contributions up to 6% of gross earnings, subject to a cap.
The amount paid in by Laird Technologies in 2009 was 4,400.
In addition, Mr Rapp receives a taxable cash payment of 30% of base salary in lieu of any additional pension.
Messrs Hill and Silver are members of a UK Group contributory defined benefits scheme.
The main benefits are: on pension retirement at age sixty, a maximum pension of two thirds final salary excluding bonuses and other benefits dependent on service: on death in retirement, a dependants pension of 60% of the members pension: on death in service, a lump sum of four times salary and a dependants pension of 20% of salary or 60% of the members expected pension, if higher.
Pensions in payment for Messrs Hill and Silver will increase by the lesser of the increase in the retail price index or 8.5% per annum compound.
Transfer values provided on leaving service do not include any allowances for discretionary benefits.
Laird PLC 41 Directors remuneration report continued for the year to 31 December 2009 Mr Hills benefits in the defined benefits scheme are subject to an earnings cap.
They are supplemented by an unfunded arrangement to maintain the same level of benefits as if the earnings cap did not apply.
Since 1 July 2008, Mr Hill has received a taxable salary supplement of 40% of base salary in lieu of future accrual of the unfunded arrangement.
Following the introduction of the A Day legislation in April 2006, Mr Silvers pension has ceased to accrue within the defined benefits scheme.
In light of the Companys previous pension commitment to Mr Silver, he now receives a taxable salary supplement of 40% of base salary in lieu of future pension accrual under the pension scheme.
These payments in respect of Messrs Hill and Silver are expected to be cost neutral for the Company and reduce future pension risks for the Company.
Payments in lieu of pension provision are excluded from the calculation of any bonus entitlements and share scheme awards.
They are not included in the calculations below.

Share Plans The share incentive schemes currently operated by the Company for the executive directors are the Long Term Incentive Plan and the Share Option Plans, which the Remuneration Committee believes are the most appropriate way in the current environment of providing the incentive to create substantial improvement in the Companys performance in a way that aligns the interests of executives and shareholders.
A Share Price Improvement Plan SPIP was introduced in 2008.
The executive directors to whom awards were made under the SPIP have waived those awards in March 2010 and therefore no longer have any interests in shares under the SPIP.
The Remuneration Committee, in the light of market conditions, has cancelled the SPIP.
a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP involves the award of shares which only vest after the achievement of demanding performance targets measured over three years.
Executives are eligible for annual awards of shares.
The maximum annual award value under the LTIP is one times base salary.
In setting the level of awards the Remuneration Committee takes into account options granted to executives under the 2003 executive share option plans in the same financial year.
The extent to which awards granted under the LTIP in 2009 vest will be determined by reference to the Companys total shareholder return relative to FTSE 250 companies excluding investment trusts and the following targets will apply: Total Shareholder Return Amount of Award Vesting Performance Level % Upper Quartile Full vesting Median to Upper Quartile Pro rata between 30% and full vesting Below Median Nil These performance conditions will be measured only over a single three year period.
There is no provision for retesting.
In addition, no awards will vest unless the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the Companys underlying financial performance.
The LTIP may use either market purchased shares or new issue shares, provided that any new shares issued will count against the overall dilution limit.
Awards under the plan in 2003 to 2009 inclusive took the form of nil cost options or conditional awards in order to comply with US tax legislation, to be satisfied by shares from the Laird 1990 Employee Benefit Trust the Trust purchased in the market.
Further details on the Trust are on page 45.
The awards made in 2007 lapsed at the end of 2009 as the performance criterion for total shareholder return to 31 December 2009 was not met.
The awards made in 2006 also lapsed, at the end of 2008, as a result of the performance criteria not being met.
The awards made on 12 May 2009 were calculated with reference to a share price of 147.0p as adjusted for the subsequent Rights Issue being the higher of the closing mid-market price on 11 May and 12 May 2009.
They will, apart from Mr Rapps awards, be exercisable between 12 May 2012 and 12 May 2014, to the extent to which the performance criteria are met.
In accordance with US requirements, Mr Rapps award will vest automatically on 12 May 2012 if the performance criteria have been met.
In accordance with the rules of the LTIP, outstanding awards may become exercisable before their normal vesting date in the event of a change of control of the Company.
42 Laird PLC In recent years the policy has been to make awards at one times base salary.
In 2009 the Remuneration Committee carefully considered the level of awards in the light of the Companys business performance and the then current share price level.
The awards made equated to 41.7% of salary for Mr Hill: 41.9% for Mr Silver and 45.3% for Mr Rapp, compared with one times salary in previous years.
The Remuneration Committee considered that these awards, together with awards under the Share Option Schemes described below, should at this level still promote the interests of executives and shareholders in the delivery of above market growth in shareholder value in future years, while at the same time recognising the substantial fall in the Companys share price from 2008 to 2009.
The amount charged to the income statement during the year in respect of the LTIPs granted to the executive directors was 551,000 2008, 756,000.
The fair value for accounting purposes was calculated as 55% of the face value of the awards made in 2009.
The directors interests in the LTIP are as follows: Vested Awards Exercised Lapsed 1.1.
The breakdown of outstanding awards are: Number of nil cost options conditional awards as at 31 December Date of Grant 2009 Exercise period P J Hill 17.3.
14 169,459 Figures are adjusted for the 1 for 2 Rights Issue announced on 28 October 2009.
Mr Rapps conditional awards vest automatically, in order to comply with US tax legislation.
b Share Options The executive directors have outstanding options under the 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme and the 2003 Executive Share Option Plan No.
The 1994 scheme was replaced by new share option schemes approved by shareholders at the 2003 Annual General Meeting.
Since May 2001 the basis for calculation of the maximum grant of options to executive directors and other employees is the equivalent of shares with a market value at the time of grant of up to one times salary in any one year and up to two times salary in special circumstances, such as the recruitment or promotion to a key management position.
1994 Share Option Scheme The 1994 scheme granted options over new shares to be issued at the time of exercise and also over existing shares.
The exercise of options under the 1994 scheme is dependent upon the attainment of performance criteria set by the Remuneration Committee.
The scheme permitted the grant of both approved and unapproved options.
Options were granted at the closing middle market price on the last dealing day prior to grant and are exercisable after three years but not more than ten years from the date of grant.
The performance criteria set by the Remuneration Committee for grants made in 2002, the last year in which options were granted under this Scheme, is that the increase in earnings per share must not be less than the increase in the rate of United Kingdom Retail Price Inflation plus an average of 3% per annum over a three year period.
In 2006 the Committee reviewed the performance conditions and agreed that the earnings per share target had been met and that there had been a significant and sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company.
Laird PLC 43 Directors remuneration report continued for the year to 31 December 2009 The 2003 Executive Share Option Plans There are two plans which were approved by shareholders in 2003.
One plan permits the grant of options approved by Her Majestys Revenue and Customs to be made to individuals who may be eligible for capital gains tax relief on the exercise of options: otherwise both plans are identical in all material respects.
The value of shares under options granted to an executive in any financial year are limited, to one times base salary, unless there are exceptional circumstances e. g. a high level recruitment, in which case the limit is twice base salary.
When granting options, the Remuneration Committee takes into account both the level of awards made to executives under the LTIP and the prevailing share price.
The performance criteria used from 2003 to 2008 inclusive was to measure the increase in earnings per share against the rate of UK retail price inflation plus a specified percentage per annum over a fixed three year period, as shown in the table below.
Applicable Performance Target: Average Annual growth in earnings per share in excess of inflation Tier of Option Grant Options granted 2003 to 2007 Options granted in 2008 Up to 0.5 x salary UK RPI 3% per annum UK RPI 5% per annum 0.5 x salary 1 x salary UK RPI 3% to 5% per annum applied UK RPI 5% to 7.5% per annum applied and above pro rata to the multiple of salary pro rata to the multiple of salary The Committee considered that a consistent and real rate of growth in earnings per share is normally an appropriate performance target as it is a good guide to the underlying financial performance of Laird PLC.
However, due to the uncertain economic circumstances in 2009, the Committee carefully considered the basis for the EPS targets and, after consultation with major Shareholders, set specific EPS performance targets: Level of vesting in 2012 Applicable Performance Target: 2011 Earnings per share EPS Threshold 50% vesting 18.7 pence adjusted for the Rights Issue Full vesting 21.3 pence adjusted for the Rights Issue With a pro-rata vesting on a straight line basis where EPS is between 18.7 pence and 21.3 pence.
The EPS figures have been adjusted, from those set at the time of the grant, for the Rights Issue.
Based on the reported EPS for 2009, of 9.6 pence, to achieve the 2011 threshold requires EPS growth between 2009 and 2011 of 39.6% per annum and, for full vesting, EPS growth of 49.0% per annum, between 2009 and 2011.
The performance conditions under the plan are based on the Companys earnings per share growth adjusted to exclude items which do not reflect the Companys underlying financial performance.
The performance conditions are measured at the end of a three year period.
To the extent that the performance conditions have not been met after three years, the options will lapse.
The rules of the 2003 plan permit the waiver of performance criteria in certain limited circumstances, such as a change of control, death or retirement.
In accordance with the rules of the plan, outstanding options may become exercisable before their normal exercise date in the event of a change of control of the Company.
In order to allow for the grant of options to employees who are not executive directors, there is an overall dilution limit of 10% of the ordinary share capital in issue from time to time for allocations in respect of newly issued shares over a ten year period under these plans and all other share schemes operated by the Company.
In considering whether share options granted in 2006 should vest in 2009, the Remuneration Committee considered not just whether the performance criteria described above had been met, but also the absolute level of growth in underlying earnings per share from continuing operations over the three year period.
This showed that average annual growth in underlying continuing earnings per share over the three year period was approximately 17.9%, which the Remuneration Committee considered did represent a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of Laird.
In recent years the policy has been to make awards at one times base salary.
The awards equated to 83.5% of salary for Mr Hill: 41.9% for Mr Silver and 45.3% for Mr Rapp, compared with awards at one times salary in previous years.
The Remuneration Committee considered that these awards, together with awards under the LTIP described above, should at this level still promote the interests of executives and shareholders in the delivery of above market growth in shareholder value in future years, while at the same time recognising the substantial fall in the Companys share price from 2008 to 2009.
The amount charged to the income statement in respect of the share options granted to the executive directors was 68,000 2008, 89,000.
The fair value for accounting purposes was calculated at 30.7 per cent of the face value of grants made in 2009.
44 Laird PLC The directors interests in options under the 2003 executive share option No.
1 plan in respect of new shares to be issued are shown in the table below: Exercised Granted Lapsed 1.1.
The performance criteria are set out on page 44.

There have been no changes in these interests since the year end.
The middle market share price at 31 December 2009 was 126p.
During the year the share price was in the range 47.71p to 195.24p adjusted for the Rights Issue.
c Share Price Improvement Plan The Laird PLC Share Price Improvement Plan SPIP was designed to be a one-off arrangement to complement the existing LTIP and Executive Share Option Schemes.
The awards made under the SPIP took the form of conditional awards of free shares in the Company, with vesting, subject to an underpinning performance condition, being dependent on the Companys share price increasing to between 10 and 15 between May 2011 and May 2013.
On 9 May 2008, Mr Hill was granted a conditional award of 384,259 shares and Messrs Rapp and Silver were granted conditional awards of 192,129 shares each in the Company in each case adjusted for the Rights Issue announced on 28 October 2009.
The amount charged to the income statement in respect of those awards was 381,000.
The Laird 1990 Employee Benefit Trust the Trust The Trust purchases and holds shares in Laird PLC to meet the requirements of share option awards and grants under the LTIP.
The Trust, which is financed by a loan of 0.2m from the Company, currently holds 119,457 ordinary shares which relate to the LTIP.
Currently there are no outstanding share options, other than those granted under the LTIP, to be satisfied by the Trust.
Whilst shares are held within the Trust, the voting rights in respect of those shares are exercisable by the trustee, in accordance with its fiduciary duties.
