Shuweihat S1 UAE The Committee undertook a review of the comparator group in 2009.
Prior to 2009, the pay policy for the Executive Directors was to be competitive around the median of the FTSE 41-80 group of companies, excluding financial services companies.
The review concluded that significant changes had taken place in the comparator group which had tended to increase the number of companies included in the comparator group with limited activity and executives based in UK.
As a result the Committee agreed to establish a fixed group of 42 comparator companies ranked FTSE 25-90, at October 2009, but excluding those engaged in financial services, mining, oil exploration and property development.
In determining the salaries and benefits of the Executive Directors, the Committee has regard to the treatment of staff and management generally within the Group, to ensure that an appropriate balance is maintained.
Balanced and performance related: The remuneration of the Executive Directors incorporates both fixed and variable elements.
Fixed elements including salary, pension and benefits are provided as part of a competitive employment package.
Variable elements are based upon the achievement of specific and measurable shared and individual performance objectives over both the short and long-term that align the Executives rewards with the creation of value for shareholders.
Shareholder aligned: Remuneration packages include significant opportunities to acquire, and obligations to retain, International Power shares, consistent with our strategy of building a strong share ownership culture.
All Executive Directors, with the exception of the CEO, have a requirement to hold shares equivalent to 100% of their salary.
The requirement for the CEO is 150%.
As at 31 December 2009, all Executive Directors fulfilled this requirement.
The Committee intends to maintain these principles of remuneration for 2010, as the Committee believes they are delivering fair and proportionate rewards to the Executive Directors based on the Groups performance, and it will continue to monitor and consider changes in light of developing market practice.

Awards made conditionally between 2002 and 2005 inclusive incorporated a single performance condition that reflected EPS.
For awards made since 2006, the performance conditions reflect both an EPS target and a relative TSR performance measure.
The link to EPS, at 50% of the potential value to participants, ensures vesting is aligned with a key underlying performance measure as presented in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
The use of TSR, also weighted at 50%, Bellingham Massachusetts provides a market-based measure when assessing performance.
Given that the principal performance measures for the Companys share plans are based on EPS performance and TSR, the Committee reserves the right to also take into account, and adjust appropriately for, the enhancement effects of any purchase and subsequent cancellation of shares, or placing of shares into treasury, by the Company.
Before releasing any award in respect of the TSR element, the Remuneration Committee will also seek to satisfy itself that the Groups TSR performance is a genuine reflection of the true underlying performance of the Group.
For the conditional awards made in 2006 and 2007, the TSR performance condition was measured against companies in the FTSE 51-100.
Following a review in 2007, in respect of the awards made conditionally in 2008 to 2010, the comparator group comprises FTSE 41-80 companies.
Governance 98 International Power Annual Report 2009 Directors remuneration report Benefits on vesting The method of calculating an Executive Directors entitlement to shares upon vesting is as follows: In respect of the TSR element, 25% of the maximum vests for median TSR performance and the maximum vests for upper quartile performance.
In respect of the EPS element, 25% of the maximum vests for performance at the threshold target established by the Remuneration Committee and the maximum vests when the stretch target is achieved.
Straight-line pro-rating will apply for performance between the threshold and maximum data points for both the TSR and EPS elements.

In respect of the TSR element, 25% of the maximum vests for median FTSE 41-80 TSR performance and the maximum vests for upper quartile performance.
EPS performance targets for the 2010 award has been set on a cumulative basis over three years: The threshold EPS performance condition has been set at 72 pence.
The maximum EPS performance condition has been set at 90 pence.
In establishing the EPS performance condition for the 2010 award, the Remuneration Committee carefully considered the implications for EPS of the sale of the Companys Czech business in November 2009.
The Remuneration Committee concluded that the 2010 EPS performance condition was as stretching as the EPS performance conditions which applied to Performance Share Plan awards made in prior years.
Executive Share Option Plans Eligibility for awards International Power operates a range of Approved, Unapproved and Global Executive Share Option Plans for the benefit of senior management and other employees.

The transfer values as at 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2009 have been calculated in accordance with the assumptions used by the Trustees to calculate cash equivalent transfer values in accordance with the legislation which came into force with effect from 1 October 2008.
The calculation of transfer values is undertaken on a market related basis and due to changes in financial market conditions during 2009, transfer values have increased significantly.
In particular, the fall in the yield available on index linked government bonds has increased the transfer values shown at the end of 2009 by around 20% to 40%, depending on the age of each Director.
