Governance 99 Performance review Aviva plc Corporate responsibility Directors remuneration report Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information Highlights The Remuneration Committee the Committee approved the Executive Directors EDs request to freeze their basic salaries for 2009 and to take a 10% reduction on the personal element of their annual bonus.
In 2010, the EDs requested that their basic salaries should not be subject to annual review and the Committee has endorsed this proposal.
The demanding financial and non-financial targets set for the 2009 annual bonus were met in part during the year.
The combination of financial outcomes, along with those targets relating to employees, customers, and personal objectives mean that the Group Chief Executive received a 2009 bonus of 74% of his maximum opportunity 2008: 54%.
The Committee entered the 2010 reward period conscious of the challenging economic background and widespread comment on over generous executive remuneration.
The Committee believes Avivas 2009 business results are strong and that Avivas remuneration practices already closely link pay to performance and also align with current governance guidelines.
The Committee has, however, continued to ensure prudent and proportionate reward outcomes.
Andrea Moneta, Chief Executive Officer, Aviva Europe, Middle East and Africa was appointed as ED of Aviva plc on 29 September 2009.
Information on his remuneration therefore appears in this report for the first time.
On 1 January 2010, Mark Hodges was appointed Chief Executive Officer of the whole of Avivas UK Insurance operations, which brought together the Life and General Insurance businesses.
As a result of this significant expansion of his managerial responsibilities, his basic salary was increased.
On 26 January 2010, Philip Scott retired from the Board.
He continues to be employed by the Group and will retire on 31 July 2010.
Details of his leaving arrangements are disclosed in this report.
Patrick Regan joined Aviva as the new Chief Financial Officer on 22 February 2010.
Details of his joining arrangements and ongoing annual remuneration are disclosed in this report.

In addition to these standing items, the Committee discusses matters relating to the operation of the remuneration policy and emerging market practices.

A further 45 members of senior management similarly accepted a 2009 basic pay freeze.
The 2008 Annual Report and Accounts stated the Committee had decided to review mid year the financial targets used for bonus purposes for EDs and other senior managers.
This was in addition to the mechanical rebasing for exchange rate and capital assumptions that is carried out annually.
Only in exceptional circumstances would the Committee consider amending financial targets, either up or down, and any significant change would be the subject of appropriate consultation.
Having reviewed the targets, it was agreed that they remained valid and therefore the bonuses paid for the 2009 performance year, which are disclosed in this report, are based on unaltered financial and non-financial targets.
The Committee remains conscious of the shareholders loss of value in light of the recession.
This has also impacted the EDs through the significantly lower value of the deferred ABP shares and LTIP grants in 2007, both of which will vest in 2010.
102 Aviva plc Directors remuneration report continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Future actions and changes The Company does not anticipate any significant changes to the structure of EDs compensation packages in 2010, compared with those outlined in this report.
There are, however, three main areas of activity in 2010 which are worth noting: i Increased regulation in executive remuneration and changes in corporate governance 2009 has seen a series of regulatory and governance guidelines issued by a wide ranging group of organisations, from the Financial Services Authority, the Companys primary regulator, to the Financial Stability Board of the G20.
Whilst many of the issued guidelines do not yet formally apply to Aviva, the Company has already reviewed its existing remuneration arrangements against these and Avivas current remuneration structures are broadly in line with the requirements laid down by the majority of the codes of practice and corporate governance expectations.
A good example of this is the high level of deferral on the annual bonus two thirds which would be considered best practice in the new environment.
In addition, the Company has introduced clawback provisions into the Companys share incentive plans.
The Group Risk and Regulatory Committee is also mindful of the recommendations and that its involvement will be required including its input into the setting of financial objectives.
ii Changes to UK taxation The changes in the personal tax regime effective in April 2010 will create a significantly different tax position for a number of senior employees.
The Company has therefore made available the choice to receive deferred annual bonus awards as restricted stock, thus allowing the payment of income tax on grant prior to the changes coming into effect in April 2010.
Any potential cost to the Company is judged to be minimal.
In addition, the 2010 LTIP grant will be underpinned by an approved share option grant.
This will have no additional cost to the Company.
These changes were discussed with Her Majestys Revenue and Customs HMRC before being implemented.
iii Strategic Reward Review The Company is required every five years to seek shareholder approval for the operation of its share-based incentive plans.
The Committee has, in the past, carried out a comprehensive review of senior executive remuneration to coincide with this.
This has allowed the Company to put to shareholders proposals that reflect a thorough review of the Companys remuneration package taking into account changing market and regulatory practice and the requirement to ensure that the package remains competitive.
It was agreed in 2008 that the review would be delayed by 12 months from 2009 to 2010.
This will enable Aviva to reflect on the new regulatory and governance requirements that emerge from the global financial crisis.
Following an in-depth review during 2010, new proposals will be put to shareholders in 2011.
Remuneration policy Alignment with Group Strategy The Committee considers alignment between Group strategy and the remuneration of its senior executives, including EDs, to be critical.
It believes that senior executives should be highly rewarded on a market competitive basis for the delivery of stretching goals but should receive reduced rewards when the business performs poorly.
The pay and employment conditions of employees of the Company and Group were also taken into account when determining directors remuneration for the financial year.
To achieve this alignment Avivas remuneration package is leveraged, with a high percentage of pay at risk against the achievement of stretching goals which is aligned with the Companys risk profile and employee behaviour.
Furthermore two-thirds of any bonus and any LTIP grant are delivered in the form of Aviva shares.
The element of deferred bonus that is matched under the OATTV Plan only vests if very demanding Earnings Per Share EPS targets are met.
The requirements to defer bonus, participation in the LTIP and the OATTV Plan closely tie the long-term value of executive remuneration to the Companys share price performance.
Senior executives thus have high exposure to the same benefits and drawbacks of share price movement as all shareholders.
The belief that senior executives should be shareholders is reinforced through formal guidelines requiring EDs to build up and maintain a significant holding of shares in the Company.
The Groups strategic priorities and targets are set out elsewhere in this report.
Those priorities are reflected closely in the remuneration package: Basic Salary: Internal and external equity in basic salary positioning is an important contributor to a motivational remuneration package.
A range of market data is used to inform decision making taking into account the Companys policy with regard to the FTSE 30 and FTSE 50.
ABP: Bonus structures are effective only if they drive, through the targets, the maintenance of the Company on a sound financial footing and sustained profitable growth.
In addition, the targets must not provide an incentive to promote behaviours which could be detrimental to the Companys long-term interests.
Management must justify the targets it recommends.
The Committee assures itself that the targets provide appropriate incentives, are sufficiently challenging, are aligned to shareholders interests and are within the Groups risk appetite.
The Committee also considers how, given changing economic circumstances, the Groups priorities, and consequently the targets underpinning its bonus structures, need to change.
Given the challenging current environment the Committee has agreed that financial targets for 2010 should focus more on profitable growth and long-term value creation.
Financial targets sit alongside targets on customer advocacy and employee engagement introduced in 2005 that the Committee believes are critical to long-term organisational health.
The personal objectives of Executive Committee members are reviewed by the Committee to ensure they adequately reflect the strategic aims of the Group, good governance and best practice.
Governance 103 Performance review Aviva plc Directors remuneration report continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information OATTV Plan: This plan was introduced to emphasise the Group Chief Executives clear strategic aim for the Group to deliver growth in EPS, with a target of doubling EPS in five years from a baseline at the end of December 2007.
No other element of executive remuneration was focused on EPS growth, and this bonus scheme directly aligns a portion of executive remuneration to this key strategic goal.
LTIP: The LTIP encourages a longer-term management focus on Return on Capital Employed ROCE and relative TSR.
These metrics measure how the Company is performing in both absolute and relative terms.
The Committee considers all these elements, plus pension and other benefits, as a whole.
It looks to ensure that an appropriate balance is maintained between them so that the need for both short-term success and long-term sustainable growth is recognised.
The Committee also ensures that the non-financial business measures and individual objectives reflect adequately the Companys environmental, social and governance responsibilities.
Constituent elements of reward as a percentage of total remuneration Tables 3a and 3b below show how the Groups remuneration policy translates in practice into the Group Chief Executives remuneration package.
The tables outline the contribution each element makes to overall compensation at both Target and Stretch levels of performance.
More than 50% of EDs total remuneration is performance related.
For the remainder of EDs, 43% of total remuneration is paid in cash for on Target performance and 27% for Stretch performance excluding ACAP which EDs participate in to varied degrees, see Table 5.

Table 3b gives the proportions of fixed cash, variable cash and shares.
For the purposes of Table 3b, fixed cash includes basic salary and the discretionary ACAP payment.
Variable cash is the one-third of bonus paid in cash annually.
The share element includes the twothirds of the annual bonus deferred into shares, the OATTV Plan match and the LTIP.
Target performance means a target ABP outcome 75% of basic salary, a 50% vesting of the LTIP 87.5% of basic salary and 1:1 match from the OATTV Plan 50% of basic salary.
Stretch performance means a stretch ABP outcome 150% of basic salary, 100% vesting of the LTIP 175% of basic salary and a 2:1 match from the OATTV Plan 200% of basic salary.
The breakdown does not include any share price growth, the dividends on the ABP deferred shares or other benefits eg cash car allowance, value of Private Medical Insurance PMI and all employee share ownership plans.

Governance 107 Performance review Aviva plc Directors remuneration report continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information ABP target setting The financial targets which underpinned the ABP accounting for 50% of annual bonus in 2009 were derived from Avivas return, growth and capital efficiency capital generation goals.
Three of the financial targets operating profit, volume and new business contribution were stretched as set out in Table 6 due to their importance in achieving these aspirations.
Employee and customer targets each accounting for up to 10% of annual bonus are set taking into account performance to date and aspirations for the future.
The employee targets on leadership and engagement are derived from the Groups employee promise survey in which all business units participate and which over 37,500 staff completed in 2009.
This survey is delivered through an independent third party who is able to provide extensive external benchmark data.
The Companys aspiration is to reach the upper quartile positions compared to the relevant global and national norms on leadership and engagement over time.
In 2009, the number of businesses measuring customer advocacy using a consistent robust methodology doubled, and this was measured by an independent global research agency.
All business units now have customer advocacy targets in place for 2010.
The Companys aspiration is to reach the upper quartile in the relevant local market benchmark.
Internal assurance that the outcomes on employee and customer targets were accurately calculated and reported was provided to the Committee by Group Audit.
Personal objectives based on delivery of key strategic priorities, personal leadership and operating performance of the relevant portion of the business account for up to 30% of annual bonus.

The Committee is sensitive to the current environment in relation to executive pay, and particularly relating to the payment of bonuses in circumstances where financial targets have not been met and share prices have fallen.
However, the combination of financial and non-financial measures is central to the structure of the ABP.
The Committee wants to ensure a balanced focus on both short-term financial performance and on the objective non-financial measures that are leading indicators of future financial success.
This balance is, in the Committees view, reflective of good practice in incentive design and is consistent with the FSAs guidance on creating incentive schemes that have a focus on long-term sustainable performance.
As described above, the Committee took the view that it was important to maintain the integrity of the financial targets for the EDs, and so these were not adjusted during the year.
In the same way, the Committee believes that it is appropriate to pay bonuses based on pre-agreed rigorous targets when these have been met.
To align with the business priorities for 2010, the financial measures at Group level for 2010 are operating profit, volume, new business margin, the Combined Operating Ratio COR of our general insurance businesses and cost savings.
108 Aviva plc Directors remuneration report continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 OATTV Plan The OATTV Plan aligns senior executives with the Group Chief Executives clear strategic aim of doubling EPS by the end of 2012.
The plan matches 100% of the deferred ABP shares for the Group Chief Executive 75% for other EDs.
For the grant made in 2009 the vesting of these matched shares is dependent on the average annual growth in EPS during the three year performance period, thus: Less than 12.5% growth pa Nil 12.5% growth pa 0.1 for 1 41.5% growth pa 2 for 1 Matching is on a straight-line basis for performance between 12.5% and 41.5%.
The maximum match of two shares for each deferred share is paid for delivering a doubling of EPS by the end of 2010.
The threshold matching of 0.1 of a share for each share deferred is equivalent to doubling EPS by 2014.
The Committee reviews the performance conditions of this plan annually.
LTIP Target Setting The LTIP vests subject to the degree of achievement of two equally weighted performance measures, chosen to reflect shareholders long-term interest, in absolute ROCE and relative TSR performance.
ROCE targets ROCE targets are set annually within the context of the Companys three-year business plan and are set on a Market Consistent Embedded Value basis.
Vesting depends upon performance over the three-year period against a target return.
The Companys external auditor provides a formal opinion on the ROCE vesting calculation.
The 2009 LTIP award ROCE targets are set out in Table 7 below: Table 7: 2009 LTIP ROCE Targets ROCE over the three-year performance period Percentage of shares in award that vests based on achievement of ROCE targets Less than 31.5% 0% 31.5% 15% Between 31.5% and 37.5% Pro rata between 15% and 50% on a straight line basis 37.5% and above 50% TSR Targets Relative TSR determines the vesting of the other 50% of any LTIP award.
The comparator group for the assessment of relative TSR performance at the time of the 2009 grant comprised Aegon, Allianz, Axa, Fortis, Friends Provident, Generali, ING, Legal and General, Lloyds Banking Group, Prudential, Royal Bank of Scotland, Royal and Sun Alliance, Standard Life and Zurich.
HBOS had been delisted by the time the 2009 grant was made and so was not included in the comparator group.
Friends Provident was delisted in November 2009.
TSR vesting operates as set out in Table 8 below: Table 8: TSR vesting schedule for the 2009 award TSR position over the three-year performance period Percentage of shares in award that vests based on achievement of TSR targets Below Median 0% Median 15% Between median and upper quintile Pro rata between 15% and 50% on a straight line basis Upper quintile and above 50% Governance 109 Performance review Aviva plc Directors remuneration report continued Corporate responsibility Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information The same targets will apply for the 2010 LTIP awards.
The comparator group will remain unchanged other than the removal of Friends Provident which will be replaced by Resolution Limited.
The Committee has agreed a shortlist of companies that would be considered for inclusion in the comparator group, subject to final review, should any further member of the group be delisted.
Details of subsisting LTIP awards are provided on page 110 and Table 9 below shows the vesting projections non-audited of those awards as at 31 December 2009.
Table 9: Projections of vesting of subsisting LTIP awards LTIP Award 31 December 2009 vesting projection % of award Aviva LTIP 2009 50% Aviva LTIP 2008 50% Aviva LTIP 2007 50% Details of the assumptions used in valuing the LTIP for accounting purposes can be found on page 202 of this report.
The vesting assumption made in respect of the 2010 award for accounting purposes is 50%.
Since the LTIP has performance conditions attached to it, then one potential outcome is that neither performance condition is met and the whole of the LTIP lapses.
Table 10 below has been drawn up to assist in understanding the potential value of the LTIP awards made to EDs in 2010 should the performance conditions be met in part or in whole.

No share price growth is assumed: Expected value, based on the vesting assumption made for accounting purposes, assumes TSR and ROCE elements vest at a combined rate of 50% of the total award.
Share price growth of 5% per annum is assumed over the three-year performance period: Maximum vesting assumes both TSR and ROCE elements vest in full, producing a 100% vesting.
Share price growth of 10% per annum is assumed over the three-year performance period.
Andrea Moneta joined Aviva in July 2008 and does not have an LTIP award vesting in 2010.
At the end of the performance period for the 2006 LTIP grant, which vested in 2009, the Company was ranked eighth out of the 15 companies in the TSR comparator group 15% vesting and ROCE was 36.0% 41.3% vesting.
The total vesting was therefore 56.3%.
The 43.7% of the award which did not vest lapsed.
The LTIP vesting history is set out in Table 11 below.
Prior to the 2005 award, vesting history is based on an earlier LTIP plan, and the last award made under this plan was in 2004.
Table 11: Vesting history of LTIP awards Percentage of award vesting Year of grant Performance period ROCE TSR Total 2002 January 2002 to December 2004 23.3 23.0 46.3 2003 January 2003 to December 2005 30.0 34.9 64.9 2004 January 2004 to December 2006 30.0 34.9 64.9 2005 January 2005 to December 2007 50.0 0.0 50.0 2006 January 2006 to December 2008 41.3 15.0 56.3 Aviva does not award additional shares for the dividends that were paid during the three-year performance period on those shares that vest.
110 Aviva plc Directors remuneration report continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Share Awards Table 12 below sets out the current position of those share-based awards made to EDs under current remuneration arrangements.
The actual price used to calculate the ABP and LTIP awards is based on a three day average price.
The three day average price used to grant the 2008 OATTV Plan awards was 617p and in 2009 was 256p 2.
The performance period for all awards begins at the commencement of the financial year in which the award is granted.
The performance conditions for awards granted and vested during 2009 are explained elsewhere in this report.
The monetary value of awards will be calculated by multiplying the relevant number of shares by the market price at the date of vesting.
The award date for the awards which vested in 2009 was 30 March 2006.
The awards granted to Andrea Moneta were awarded before he was appointed to the board, and were held at the date of his appointment.
The awards that vested in 2009 were released with the net amount being settled in shares and the balance settled in cash and used to pay the resulting tax liability.
These figures relate to shares issued in lieu of dividends accrued during the deferral period.
The aggregate net value of share awards granted to the directors in the period was 5.256 million 2008: 4.319 million.
The net value has been calculated by reference to the market price at the date of grant.

Contracts were last reviewed during 2006 bringing them in line with good market practice.
The aim is to strike a fair balance between the Companys and the employees interests taking into account good market practice.
The key terms are set out in Table 14 below.
Table 14: EDs key terms and conditions of employment Provision Policy Notice period By the director 6 months By the Company 12 months, rolling.
No notice or payment in lieu to be paid where the Company terminates for cause.
Termination payment Pay in lieu of notice up to a maximum of 12 months basic salary.
This may be increased by a discretionary redundancy payment where appropriate but any such further termination payment is capped at 12 months basic salary.
Any amount is subject to phased payment and mitigation requirements.
Remuneration and benefits As described in this Report the operation of the ABP, the OATTV Plan and LTIP is at the Companys discretion and, in the case of the long-term savings plans, at the trustees discretion.
Expenses Reimbursement of expenses reasonably incurred in accordance with their duties.
Holiday entitlement 30 working days plus public holidays.
Sickness In line with senior management terms, ie 100% basic salary for 52 weeks, and 75% thereafter.
Non-compete During employment and for six months after leaving.
Contract dates Director Date current contract commenced Andrew Moss 1 January 2007 Philip Scott 15 November 2006 Mark Hodges 26 June 2008 Andrea Moneta 29 September 2009 Share ownership requirements An internal shareholding requirement was introduced in 2005 that the Group Chief Executive and any EDs should build, over a five-year period, a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 175% of basic salary and 150% of basic salary respectively and no specific value per share was designated for the calculation.
Shares held in compulsory bonus deferrals and performance shares held in unvested LTIPs are not taken into account in applying this test.
As at 31 December 2009, based on that days closing share price of 397.9p, Mr Moss shareholding of 239,848 shares represented 103% of his basic salary of 925,000 his holding of 176,067 shares at 1 January 2009 represented 76% of his basic salary of 925,000 using the 31 December 2009 share price.
As it currently stands, largely due to the volatile market conditions in the current economic climate, Mr Moss will not meet the internal shareholding requirement target of 1.5 x his salary by April 2010, although he is on target to meet the 1.75 x his salary by July 2012.
Mr Scotts shareholding of 512,652 shares represented 340% of his basic salary of 600,000 his holding of 400,973 shares at 1 January 2009 represented 266%.
Mr Hodges shareholding of 139,028 shares represented 106% of his basic salary of 520,000 his holding of 100,086 shares at 1 January 2009 represented 77%.
Mr Monetas shareholding of 394 shares represented 0% of his basic salary of 780,000 694,587 based on average exchange rate for 2009 of 1.12297: 1.00.
TSR rebased to 100 112 Aviva plc Directors remuneration report continued Annual Report and Accounts 2009 External Board appointments Aviva recognises its senior executives can benefit from serving in a personal capacity as a NED of non Aviva Group companies.
It is, at the same time, conscious of the corporate governance recommendations that EDs should take account of the time commitment required by a NED position and ensure any such role does not impact their ability to carry out fully their executive duties.
The Company therefore has a policy of normally allowing senior executives to serve as a NED of one external company, subject to approval by the Board, and to retain any board fees.
The only ED who held an external NED appointment during 2009 was Philip Scott who was appointed to the Board of Diageo plc on 17 October 2007 and, following the announcement of his intended retirement from the Company, to the Board of Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc on 1 November 2009.
As a NED of Diageo plc, Mr Scott received fees totalling 101,250 in 2009.
As a NED of Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc, Mr Scott received fees totalling 25,000 in 2009.
All employee share plans EDs are eligible to participate in a number of HMRC approved all employee share plans on the same basis as other eligible employees.
These plans include a free share element of the Aviva All Employee Share Ownership Plan AESOP.
Under this plan, eligible employees can receive up to a maximum of 3,000 per annum in shares based upon the profits of the Companys UK businesses.
The shares are free of tax subject to a retention period.
In addition, the partnership element of the AESOP, which the Company also operates, allows participants to invest up to 125 per month out of their gross salary in the Companys shares.
There is no matching to this investment by the Company.
The Aviva SAYE allows eligible employees to acquire options over the Companys shares at a discount of up to 20% of their market value at the date of grant.
In order to exercise these options, participants must have saved through a three, five or sevenyear HMRC approved savings contract, subject to a maximum savings limit of 250 per month.
Details of holdings under these plans can be found on page 115.
Dilution Awards granted under the Aviva employee shares plans are met by the funding of an employee trust administered by an external trustee that acquires shares in the market.
The current practice is that new issue shares will generally only be issued where it is not practicable to use the trust and the funding policy is kept under review by the Committee and the Board.
Details of the shares currently held in the employee trust are set out in note 30 to the accounts.
During 2009 loans totalling of 53.6 million were made to RBC Trustees CI Limited to ensure sufficient shares were available to meet its ongoing liabilities.
NEDs The NEDs, including the Chairman, have letters of appointment which set out their duties and responsibilities.
The key terms of the appointments are set out in Table 15 below.

NEDs receive a basic annual fee in respect of their Board duties.
A further fee is paid to NEDs other than the Chairman in respect of membership and, where appropriate, chairmanship of Board committees.
Fees are reviewed annually and are set by the Board to attract individuals with the required range of skills and experience.
In determining the level of fees paid to the NEDs the Board receives recommendations from the EDs, who consider the NEDs duties and responsibilities, together with the time commitment required in preparing for and attending meetings, and the amounts paid by competitors and similar-sized companies.

Accrued pensions shown are the amounts that would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year.
Benefits deriving from Additional Voluntary Contributions AVCs paid by directors are excluded from the amounts above.
The change in transfer value allows for fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and directors, such as changes in stock market conditions.
The transfer values have been calculated in line with the relevant legislation and using actuarial assumptions agreed by the Trustee.
These assumptions were revised during the year resulting in higher transfer values.
Mr Scott opted out of the ASPS on 30 June 2009.
