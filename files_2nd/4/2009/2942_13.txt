Carillion plc 48 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Section 04 Governance 2009 Bonus Plan In 2009, Executive Directors had the opportunity to earn up to 100 per cent of their basic salary through the bonus plan comprising up to 25 per cent for personal objectives and 75 per cent for fi financial objectives.
Awards under the personal element are based on delivery against clear and stretching objectives closely aligned to the strategic aims of the Company.
The fi financial element is determined by outstanding performance against stretching targets based on growth in earnings per share.
The 2009 plan limits the amount of any award that may be taken in cash to 50 per cent of the bonus earned overall.
The balance is deferred into shares of the Company that are held in trust in the participants name and vest after two years.
The number of shares allocated is determined by the price prevailing at the date of bonus award and by using this mechanism, the value individuals receive at the point of vesting is aligned to the value delivered to shareholders over the same period.
The bonuses awarded to the Executive Directors in respect of 2009 are shown in the remuneration table on page 48 half of these benefi ts being paid in cash in 2010 and the balance deferred to March 2012.

Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 51 Governance Remuneration report continued Share options held by Executive Directors The number of options over Carillion plc shares held by Executive Directors of the Company under the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS and Sharesave scheme as at 31 December 2009 are shown below.
The market price of Carillion Shares on this date was 293 pence.
The net asset value received by Don Kenny was therefore 344,676.
Similarly, David Hurcomb exercised an Executive Share Option on 25November 2009 when the market price of Carillion shares was 300 pence.
The net asset value received by David Hurcomb was 17,687.
The ESOS options were granted at an exercise price equal to the market value of the Companys shares on the three business days immediately preceding the date of grant.
Options under the Inland Revenue Approved Executive Share Option Scheme 1999 which carries certain tax advantages for UK employees and the Executive Share Option Scheme 1999 are exercisable normally between three and 10 years after the date of grant, subject to the achievement of the performance condition.
For options granted from 2003 onwards, the following performance condition prevailed: Average compound annual earnings per share growth before exceptional items Percentage of option in excess of RPI over the three-year period following grant that becomes exercisable Less than 4% 0% 4% 30% Above 4% and below 10% 30% to 100% straight-line basis 10% or more 100% Grants of options using this performance condition were made in 2003, 2004 and 2005.
Carillion met the performance target such that 80 per cent, 71 per cent and 100 per cent, respectively of the shares under option are now exercisable.
For options granted before 1 July 2003, the performance target required that the earnings per share of Carillion over a rolling three-year period must increase by a percentage not less than the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index over the same period, expressed as a percentage, plus four percentage points per annum.
All options granted pre-2003 are excercisable.
At 31 December 2009, Executive Share Options were outstanding over 1,408,032 shares 2008: 1,754,361 shares under both schemes at exercise prices ranging from 129.5 pence to 210.7 pence.
The option over 254,532 shares at an option price of 210.7 pence granted to John McDonough in March 2002 was made later in the year than had been specifi ed at the time of his appointment which resulted in an increased option price of 67.3 pence.
Therefore, in order to ensure that he will be in no worse nor better a position as a result of the delay in the grant, a maximum cash adjustment of 67.3 pence per share less tax will be made when and if the option is exercised.
