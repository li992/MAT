Messrs Jones and Ringrose both participate in the Companys SMART Pensions arrangement as detailed on page 53.
To reflect this, the calculations above have a nil reduction for directors contributions in respect of these individuals.
The regular contributions paid by the Company in respect of SMART Pensions for Messrs Jones and Ringrose are shown on page 56.
Mr Vyse retired on 3 April 2009 and, as permitted under the rules of the Scheme, elected to commute part of his pension for a lump sum of 191,190.
The accrued pension shown at 31 December 2009 is the post-commutation pension at the date of retirement and is the benefit on which the transfer value at 31 December 2009 is based.
As a result of the lump sum taken these figures are therefore not comparable to those included in last years report.
The increases in accrued pension shown for Mr Vyse are negative as they have been calculated after deduction of the pension commuted at retirement.
The transfer value of the real increase in the accrued pension shown in the above table is calculated as required by the Listing Rules and shows the increase in value of the benefits up to the date of retirement.
It is therefore inclusive of the commutation payment.
In addition to the above benefits, Mr Vyse has a supplemental temporary pension of 6,136 per annum as at 31 December 2009 2008: 5,790 per annum, which came into payment at retirement.
This supplemental pension is payable until age 65.
The transfer value of this benefit as at 31 December 2009 was 24,000 2008: 24,000.
Mr Jones also participated in the Companys SMART Bonus arrangement available to all employees receiving an annual bonus whereby following the sacrifice of an element of his annual bonus payment the Company made an equal contribution to his Additional Voluntary Contribution AVC account.
In recognition of the saving to the Company of employers National Insurance contributions, the Company made an additional payment of 10 per cent of the annual bonus sacrificed by Mr Jones into his AVC account and saved 2.8 per cent of the employers National Insurance contributions that would otherwise have been payable.
The contribution paid by the Company in respect of SMART Bonus for Mr Jones was 11,000 including the 10 per cent enhancement.
