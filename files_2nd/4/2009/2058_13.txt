Change of control As described on page 54, the Executive Directors service contracts contain change of control provisions.
For the purposes of these provisions, a change of control is deemed to occur if the Company becomes a subsidiary of another company: or if 50% or more of the voting rights of the Company or the right to appoint or remove the majority of the Board of the Company become vested in any individual or body or group of individuals or bodies acting in concert: or if all or substantially all of the business, assets and undertakings of the Company become owned by any person, firm or company other than a subsidiary or associated company.
A change of control is also deemed to occur if the whole of the issued capital of BG Energy Holdings Limited or a substantial part of the undertaking of that Company including its subsidiaries is transferred to another company, unless that transferee company is a subsidiary of the Company, or a company ultimately owned by substantially the same shareholders as are the ultimate owners of the Company.
However, a change of control does not occur if and only if through a process of reconstruction the Company becomes a subsidiary of another company owned by substantially the same shareholders as are the shareholders of the Company.
The Executive Directors service contracts provide that any payments made pursuant to these provisions will be made, less any deductions the employer is required to make.
Any such payments shall be in full and final settlement of any claims the Executive Director may have against the employer or any associated company arising out of the termination of employment, except for any personal injury claim, any claim in respect of accrued pension rights, or statutory employment protection claims.

BG Group Annual Report and Accounts 2009 60 Directors Report: Corporate Governance Remuneration report continued ORDINARY SHARES The Directors interests in ordinary shares of the Company at the end of the financial year were as follows: Interests in ordinary shares a As at As at 1 Jan 2009 b 31 Dec 2009 Sir Robert Wilson 98 000 98 000 Ashley Almanza 540 220 540 638 Frank Chapman 1 118 077 1 721 107 Martin Houston appointed 3 February 2009 467 667 678 119 Peter Backhouse 36 500 36 500 Jrgen Dormann 22 000 52 000 Baroness Hogg 6 585 8 519 Dr John Hood 5 000 Sir David Manning 1 139 1 139 Mark Seligman appointed 3 December 2009 3 000 3 000 Lord Sharman 1 956 1 956 Philippe Varin 5 000 42 500 a Interests including shares acquired pursuant to the BG Group SIP.

On 17 February 2010, Mark Seligman acquired an interest in a further 5 000 ordinary shares in the Company.
On 4 March 2010, Martin Houston acquired a further 6 031 ordinary shares on the exercise of an option granted to him under the BG Group Sharesave Scheme see Options table on page 59.
As of 10 March 2010, the Directors interests in the share capital of the Company represent less than 1% of the issued share capital of the Company.
SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES As stated on page 54, the Executive Directors are required to build up, and then retain, a shareholding with a value equivalent to 200% of their base salary.
The table below sets out, in respect of each Executive Director, how far this requirement had been achieved as at 31 December 2009.
Minimum shareholding Actual Value of requirement as shareholding Base salary shareholdings % of base as % of base Executive Directors 000 a 000 b salary salary Ashley Almanza 670 6 066 200 905 Frank Chapman 1 135 19 311 200 1 701 Martin Houston 525 7 608 200 1 449 a Base salary is annual salary following the 2009 Salary Review and effective from 1 April 2009. b The value of shareholdings is based on the closing price of a BG Group ordinary share on 31 December 2009.
PENSIONS The basis on which retirement benefits are calculated for Ashley Almanza and Frank Chapman has not changed during the year.
They receive an accrual of benefits designed to target a pension of two-thirds of their final 12 months salary on retirement from BG Group at age 60.
Martin Houston has been a member of the GEC since 2000 and was appointed as a Director of the Board with effect from 3 February 2009, and there has been no change to his pension arrangements.
He continues to accrue pension at the rate of 1 60 of his final 12 months salary for each year of pensionable service.
As is the case for all other UK employees who became pension scheme members before 6 April 2006, none of the Directors can be paid an immediate pension before age 60 on a non-actuarially reduced basis unless they have attained age 55 and completed ten years service with the Group including pensionable service transferred from previous employment and the Company expressly agrees to payment on an unreduced basis, or they are over the age of 50 and have been made redundant, or in the event of incapacity.
UK employees who became pension scheme members on or after 6 April 2006 cannot be paid a non-actuarially reduced pension until age 60, other than in the event of incapacity.
Pensions in payment are increased in line with retail price inflation.
An adult dependants pension is payable on death in service, equal to two-thirds of that payable to the pension scheme member based on potential service to age 65.
On death in retirement, an adult dependants pension is payable equal to two-thirds of the members pension prior to exchanging any of it for a cash lump sum.
Ashley Almanza, Frank Chapman and Martin Houston were members of the BG Pension Scheme BGPS and the BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme BGSBS throughout the year.
The BGPS is a funded, registered pension scheme and the BGSBS is an unfunded, unregistered pension scheme.
The allocation of their benefits between the registered and unregistered schemes changed after 6 April 2006, when a new pensions taxation regime came into force.
Their BGPS benefits are limited to the lifetime allowance and the balance of their benefits is provided by the BGSBS.
Frank Chapman and Martin Houston elected enhanced protection under the new regime and therefore both have personal lifetime allowances that are based on the value of their accrued BGPS benefits at 6 April 2006.
A provision has been made in the Companys accounts in respect of the obligations for unfunded post-retirement benefits.

Thereafter a 'salary sacrifice' system operated under which the Company made contributions on behalf of each Director and reduced their salary by a corresponding amount.
c Increase net of price inflation.
No adjustment is made in Martin Houston's case as the date on which he became a Director was less than one year before 31 December 2009. d The transfer values shown at the end of 2008 and 2009 represent the value of each Executive Directors accrued pension based on total service completed to the relevant date.
The accrued pensions are the amounts that would have been paid if the Executive Director had left service at the relevant date.
The transfer values are calculated in accordance with the requirements of the transfer value regulations.
Increases in transfer values since 31 December 2008 have been significantly affected by changes in market conditions over the year and amendments to the actuarial factors used which were reviewed following completion of the 2008 BGPS funding valuation in August 2009. e The figures for Martin Houston have been determined by reference to his appointment date of 3 February 2009, rather than 31 December 2008, which is used for Frank Chapman and Ashley Almanza.
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS None of the Executive Directors currently holds an appointment as a non-executive director of another company.
