This new Plan will effectively replace the Companys existing Option Base Salary Scheme which will shortly expire.

at a rate of 25% of salary from 15%, or 10% below aged 50.
Yours sincerely Annual Bonus The maximum annual bonus opportunity of the Executive Directors will be increased to 200% of salary from 150% of salary which reflects median practice.
There will also be a corresponding increase in target bonus opportunity from 60% Clare Spottiswoode of salary to 80% of salary, which will remain below median.
The Chairman of the Remuneration Committee underlying structure of the annual bonus will remain unchanged 9 March 2010 from last year, in that i 25% of the bonus opportunity will be based on Tullows relative TSR performance against the bespoke Oil & Gas comparator group used for Performance Share Plan awards, ii 25% will be based upon absolute TSR growth targets, iii 50% will be based upon corporate KPIs relating to Health & Safety, Operational & Financial, and Project-specific targets and iv any bonus in excess of 75% of salary will continue to be deferred into shares for three years under the Companys Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
Long-Term Incentives The main other element of the Executive Directors packages long-term incentive provision will remain unchanged and will be provided via regular annual awards of shares worth up to 200% of salary under the Companys Performance Share Plan which will vest three years after grant subject to continued employment and the Companys relative TSR performance against i a bespoke group of international Oil & Gas companies as to 50% and ii the FTSE 100 as to the remaining 50%.
In addition, the Companys share ownership guidelines, which require Executive Directors to build up and hold a shareholding worth at least 200% of salary, will be retained.
The Committee is conscious of the fact that these changes increase the value of the Executive Directors remuneration packages.
However, in this regard, the Committee considers this approach entirely appropriate and that, notwithstanding these increases, the remuneration packages of this highly regarded management team remain below median of comparable benchmarks.

The awards of conditional shares made on 18 March 2009 equated to shares worth 200% of salary for each Executive Director based on the average of the share prices for the five dealing days preceding the date of grant.
The Tullow share price on the date of grant of the awards made on 18 March 2009 was 778p.
Under the PSP 2007 awards, 50% of each award is subject to a condition that compares Tullows TSR to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts.
The other 50% of the award is subject to a condition that compares Tullows TSR to a comparator group of specific oil and gas companies.
For median performance, 30% of the relevant part of the award will vest, with full vesting for upper quartile performance.
Details of the conditions applying to the awards made in 2008 and 2009 are set out on page 94.
The PSP awards made in March 2007 reached the end of their performance period on 31 December 2009.
The Remuneration Committee determined that both parts of the relevant performance condition were met in full, as the Company was ranked in the upper quartile compared to both the relevant comparator groups, and the underlying performance of the Company was determined to be a fair reflection of the Companys TSR.
Accordingly, the Executive Directors will be eligible to receive their awards on 22 March 2010, the third anniversary of grant, subject to continued employment.
On 30 March 2009 and 27 April 2009, being the dates on which awards made in March and April 2006 vested, the market prices of a Tullow share were 771.5p and 783.0p respectively.

The performance condition that is attached to options granted under the 2000 Scheme on the above dates required Tullows TSR to have exceeded that of the median company of the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts over three-years from the date of grant.
This performance condition has been satisfied for all the options above which are therefore fully exercisable.
