These are considered the most relevant indices given the Company is part of the FTSE All Share Index and the underlying businesses of the Company operate in the industrial engineering sector.
The source data for the above chart assumes that the 220 million of cash returned to shareholders in August 2007, following the McKechnie Aerospace and PSM Fasteners disposals, was reinvested to purchase shares in the Company.
This results in an adjustment factor on the price and this factor is used in ongoing calculations of shareholder return for the Company, as ordinarily a return of capital would reduce the share price and an analysis of returns going forward would not reflect value already returned to shareholders.
The benefit of any cash distribution is therefore, in Melroses case, reflected within the shareholder return performance of the Company.
The balance of 81,300 is paid into the individual Directors nominated private pension schemes.
