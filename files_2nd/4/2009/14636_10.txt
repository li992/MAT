The directors remuneration report The Board presents the following report on directors remuneration and the work and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee.
Remuneration committee This Committee has been established for many years and operates under terms of reference agreed by the Board and which can be found on the Group website: www.
From 1st January until 9th February 2009, the Committee comprised Mr. W. H. Whiteley Chairman and Mr. G. Bullock: from 10th February until 30th June, the Committee comprised Mr. W. H. Whiteley Chairman, Mr. G. Bullock and Dr. K. Rajagopal.
From 1st July to 16th July, the Committee comprised Mr. G. Bullock Chairman and Dr. K. Rajagopal and from 17th July to 31st December 2009, the Committee comprised Mr. G. Bullock Chairman, Dr. K. Rajagopal and Mr. C. G. Watson.
Each Committee member is an independent non-executive director.
They bring independence to all aspects of Board remuneration and in the application of professional advice to matters of remuneration.
The Committee is responsible for determining, on behalf of the Board, the Companys remuneration policy, the employment conditions and remuneration packages comprising salary and benefits of individual executive directors and the fees for the Chairman.
The Committee also administers and determines the grant of options under the Groups share option schemes for senior employees and administers and determines the grants of awards under the Performance Share Plan.
The Committee obtains independent professional advice from Towers Perrin now Towers Watson to ensure that the Companys remuneration policy is appropriate and competitive.
Towers Perrin was appointed by the Committee and has not provided other services to the Company during the year.
The Chairman Mr. M. Townsend up to 30th June 2009 and Mr. W. H. Whiteley since that date and Mr. M. E. Vernon, the Chief Executive, attend meetings at the invitation of the Committee to provide information requested by it.
However, the invitees do not participate in any discussions involving their own remuneration.
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
The Committee consulted with Towers Perrin in arriving at the remuneration packages paid to directors during 2009.
The Company has throughout the year complied with the provisions of the Combined Code with regard to directors remuneration.
The Committee has given full consideration to the Combined Code in establishing the remuneration policy and packages for directors.
Policy on executive directors remuneration The Companys policy is to reward directors competitively and on the broad principle that their remuneration should be comparable with remuneration in other similar public companies.
Further, the total remuneration package is designed in a way which is appropriate and necessary to attract, retain and motivate directors of the calibre required to achieve the Companys strategic objectives.
It is anticipated that this policy will continue to govern the Companys approach to executive directors remuneration in subsequent financial years.
In order to align the interests of directors and shareholders, the Committee has structured the total remuneration package to provide a material performance-related element through the annual bonus and the Groups Performance Share Plan.
The structure of the directors remuneration package has been established, subject to appropriate modifications, for many years and has regard to pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group.
The Companys policy on directors remuneration and the structure of their remuneration package are kept under review to ensure the directors overall package remains competitive and shareholders will be informed of any resulting change.
The remuneration package comprises: Basic salary The Committee obtained independent professional advice from Towers Perrin using published information for comparable public companies.
Salaries are reviewed annually as at 1st January taking into account the experience, responsibility and performance of the individual.
Benefits The Company operates company car, life assurance and private health insurance schemes in which the executive directors are eligible to participate.
These benefits are reviewed annually to ensure they remain comparable with benefits provided by other similar public companies and to ensure they are purchased by the Company at a competitive market rate.
Annual bonus The Company operates a non-pensionable annual bonus scheme for executive directors.
The bonus is determined as a percentage of salary.
For 2009, maximum available bonus remained at 100% of salary as in prior years.
The bonus was made up as follows: i a component of up to 65% of salary was determined on a sliding scale by reference to the operating profit of the Group including the Groups associate companies in India and Mexico: and ii a component of up to 35% of salary was determined on a sliding scale by reference to the return on capital employed ROCE.
The application of the above formula resulted in a bonus equal to 37% of salary being payable to all executive directors in respect of the Groups 2009 performance.
The auditors confirmed the calculation was made in line with the rules.
For 2010, the Committee plans to base the bonus for Mr. M. E. Vernon and Mr. D. J. Meredith on the same two measures with the same relative weight as in 2009 and the maximum bonus payable will remain a sum equal to 100% of base salary.
For Mr. N. H. Daws, Mr M. E. Gibbin and Mr. A. J. Scrivin, the maximum profit component of the bonus will be split so that 35% of salary will be paid based on Group operating profit and 30% of salary will be paid based on their respective divisional profit performances, for a total maximum bonus of 65% of salary based on the profit component.
The Committee has offered to executive directors in a UK defined benefit scheme a cash alternative to pension contributions equal to 25% of pensionable salary.
The level of this cash alternative was confirmed by Watson Wyatt LLC now Towers Watson.
The cost of the alternative to the Company would be no greater than the cost of the pension contributions.
The cash alternative has not so far been adopted by any of the executive directors in the scheme.
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009 39 The directors remuneration report continued Options Spirax-Sarco Engineering 1992 UK and global share option schemes Spirax-Sarco Engineering approved and global share option schemes The Company operates share option schemes administered by the Committee which determines the grant of options under the schemes, usually once per year.
These are designed to align the longer term interests of participants with those of shareholders by giving an incentive linked to added shareholder value.
Following the introduction of the performance share plan in 2005, it is intended that, ordinarily, executive directors will be granted awards under that plan rather than be granted options.
Executive directors, senior executives and management hold options granted in previous years and it is currently intended that options will continue to be granted to senior executives and management.
Options granted to each director from 1997 are subject to a performance condition which is described below.
Performance condition for share option schemes In accordance with market practice, options granted are normally specified to be exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant and, for grants from 1997, only if a specified performance condition is satisfied.
In line with the then established market practice, the performance condition for options granted from 1997 up to 2001 requires an increase in earnings per share EPS of more than 6% greater than the increase in the UK retail prices index over a period of three consecutive years between grant and ten years from grant.
For options granted from and including 2002 the performance condition requires an increase in EPS of more than 9% greater than the increase in the UK retail prices index over a period of three consecutive years between grant and ten years from grant.
For grants from and including 2005, the performance condition will, ordinarily, need to be met over the three-year period from the 1st January prior to the date of grant in order for the option to become exercisable.
If the condition is not met at the end of the three-year period, the option will lapse.
The same performance condition applies to each director.
The performance condition chosen was considered appropriate because it ensured increases in the EPS were achieved having taken account of UK inflation.
The auditors are asked to confirm whether the performance condition has been met.
The method of assessment is considered appropriate to confirm compliance with the condition.
The performance condition requires a comparison with a factor external to the Company, namely the growth in the UK retail prices index over the performance period.
Details of total share options outstanding are set out in Note 24 on page 66.
The above performance conditions apply to other relevant options granted to all other participants in the share option schemes.
Spirax-Sarco performance share plan PSP The PSP for executive directors, senior executives and management was adopted at the 2005 annual general meeting.
Following the introduction of this PSP no further option grants have been made to executive directors.
Details of options that were awarded prior to this and which remain outstanding are provided on page 43.
The PSP allows for awards to be made each year with a market value of up to 150% of base salary although in practice the market value of awards has been limited in previous years to 100% of base salary.
The market value of awards made to executive directors in 2009 was limited to 75% of base salary.
Details are set out on pages 43 and 44.
Awards take the form of contingent rights to acquire shares, subject to the satisfaction of performance targets.
To the extent they vest, awards may be satisfied in cash, in shares or an option over shares at the discretion of the Company.
The performance target applied to awards granted in 2006, 2007 and 2008 was based on the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR relative to the TSR of other companies included in the FTSE All-Share Industrial Engineering Index over the three-year periods commencing with effect from 1st January 2006, 1st January 2007 and 1st January 2008.
For awards made in 2009, the Committee decided to amend the comparator group of companies against which the Companys TSR would be measured to encompass a group of the 27 companies within the overall Industrial Goods and Services super sector of FTSE 350.
TSR was chosen as the measure of performance as the Committee felt that this achieved an appropriate alignment of the interests of the directors with those of the Companys shareholders.
For full vesting, the Companys TSR must be at or above the upper quartile, with 25% of the shares subject to an award vesting if the Companys TSR is at the median relative to the comparator group.
Awards vest on a straight line pro-rata basis between median and upper quartile performance.
In respect of the awards made in 2007, the Companys relative TSR performance resulted in 100% of the awards vesting.
Following a review of the operation of the PSP and the market competitiveness of awards, the Committee decided in 2008 to adopt a second performance measure to determine vesting under the PSP.
Although relative TSR was retained as one of the measures to determine the vesting of part of the award, a second, separate element of the award was based upon EPS growth.
The decision to adopt EPS as a specific measure to determine the vesting of part of the future awards was a reflection of the importance the Company gives to continuing growth in earnings.
Specifically, for awards made in 2009, the award was split into two separate parts amounting to 60% and 40% of award respectively.
The vesting of each part of the overall award will be subject to the satisfaction of separate performance targets as follows: i vesting of the first part, amounting to 45% of salary, will be based on the TSR measure as described above: and ii vesting of the second part, amounting to 30% of salary, will be subject to achievement of a target based on aggregate EPS over the whole of the three-year performance period, with growth measured relative to EPS in the year prior to that in which the award is made.
For the awards made in 2009, 25% of this element of the award will vest if the compound annual growth in EPS over the three-year period 2009 to 2011 is equal to 5%: and 100% of the award will vest if the compound annual growth in EPS is equal to or exceeds 11%: there will be pro-rata vesting for actual growth between these two rates.
No award will vest if the Companys TSR is below the median.
TSR calculations are performed by Towers Perrin.
The Committee reviews the measures annually and is maintaining the same measures and the same performance standards for awards made in 2010.
The auditors are asked to confirm whether the EPS performance condition has been met.
40 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual report and accounts 2009 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc employee share ownership plan the plan The executive directors, with the exception of Mr. M. E. Vernon, participate in the plan, as described on page 44.
Participation in the plan is open to all eligible UK employees.
No employees entitlement under the plan is subject to performance conditions, as the aim of the plan is to encourage increased shareholding in the Company by all eligible UK employees.
There are no other long-term incentives or share-based arrangements provided to directors.
Share ownership policy It is the policy of the Board of Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc that executive directors should have a significant shareholding in the Company.
The Board expects that executive directors will accumulate, following appointment to the Board, a shareholding equivalent to at least 100% of basic salary and should retain a shareholding of at least this amount whilst remaining on the Board.
To achieve this level of share ownership the Board expects that executive directors will retain shares acquired under the Companys share-based incentive schemes after sales of such shares as are needed to settle relevant tax and national insurance charges until the required level of shareholding is achieved.
Any shares held in trust for an executive director or in the name of a connected person, e. g. spouse, will be considered as part of an executive directors shareholding.
The Board will exercise discretion in implementing this policy where the personal circumstances of an individual executive director make that appropriate.
The policy does not require any shareholdings by non-executive directors.
Pensions The UK executive directors, other than Mr. M. E. Vernon and Mr. M. E. Gibbin, are members of an HMRC-registered, non-contributory defined benefit pension scheme based on 1 60th of pensionable salary, for each year of pensionable service.
Up to 31st March 2010, the maximum pension is twothirds of pensionable salary.
Mr. N. H. Daws and Mr. D. J. Meredith accrue pro-rata additional service at a rate which gives a further two and a half years 1 of service at age 62 2 although their normal retirement age is 65.
The same provision applied to Mr. A. D. H. Black who retired on 30th April 2009.
This additional service provision does not apply to Mr. M. E. Vernon, Mr. M. E. Gibbin and Mr. A. J. Scrivin who have a normal retirement age of 65.
In April 2010 the terms of the defined benefit pension scheme will change in that the scheme will no longer be non-contributory.
The change allows members to choose to: i continue to build up future benefits as previously in return for sharing some of the cost by way of making member contributions.
Under this option members retain the 1 60th rate of accrual and contribute 3% of their pensionable salary from 1st April 2010 to 31st March 2011 and then 6% of their pensionable salary from 1st April 2011 onwards: or ii build up future benefits at a lower rate of 1 80th accrual without having to make contributions.
The UK scheme also provides lump sum death-in-service benefit of four times pensionable salary and spouses pensions are payable where death occurs in service or in retirement.
Mr. M. E. Vernon, in addition to membership of the Spirax Sarco Inc. defined benefit scheme, has a defined contributions pension scheme as set out on page 45.
In total, pension contributions at the rate of 25% of pensionable pay were payable from 12th June 2007.
A lump sum death-in-service benefit of four times salary is also provided for Mr. M. E. Vernon.
Mr. M. E. Gibbin has a defined contributions pension scheme as set out on page 45.
From 1st January 2009 to 30th April 2009 contributions at the rate of 10% of pensionable pay were payable, increasing to 25% of pensionable pay with effect from 1st May 2009.
A lump sum death-in-service benefit of four times salary is also provided for Mr. M. E. Gibbin.
Non-executive directors The remuneration of non-executive directors is approved by the full Board within the limits set out in the Companys articles of association.
Their remuneration reflects the amount of time spent on the Companys business.
The non-executive directors do not participate in the bonus, share option or share ownership schemes and do not participate in the Performance Share Plan.
Non-executive directors appointments are non-pensionable.
Service contracts The Committee applies a policy on directors contracts reflecting established practice and reviews the content from time-to-time on professional advice.
The executive directors have rolling service contracts with no fixed expiry dates which are subject to 12 months notice.
Date of Contract Notice Period M. E. Vernon 10.12.08 12 months 1 A. D. H. Black 18.10.98 12 months N. H. Daws 28.05.03 12 months M. E. Gibbin 17.04.09 12 months D. J. Meredith 30.12.92 12 months A. J. Scrivin 15.03.05 12 months 1 Mr. A. D. H. Black retired from the Board on 30th April 2009.
No compensation for loss of office was made on his retirement.
The service contract of Mr. M. E. Vernon was amended on 4th March 2009.
Pursuant to the amendment, the Company agreed to pay on behalf of Mr. M. E. Vernon any UK or US tax liabilities which arise on his earnings under his service contract over and above the amount of UK tax liabilities which would have been payable had Mr. M. E. Vernon only been liable to pay UK tax on such earnings.
The Company also agreed to pay the reasonable costs incurred by Mr. M. E. Vernon of obtaining full tax advice in respect of his employment with the Company for the duration of his employment and, save in certain bad leaver circumstances, for a period of two years after termination of employment.
Termination payments reflect the circumstances leading to termination of employment and excessive compensation will not be paid.
Professional advice will be obtained by the Committee to ensure legal obligations and good practice are followed.
Executive directors contracts may be terminated without notice and without payment of compensation on the occurrence of certain events, such as gross misconduct.
If, however, the Company were to terminate an executive directors contract without cause and without due notice, it would pay a sum equal to the value of the salary and benefits to be received during the notice period, but taking into account the directors duty to mitigate his loss.
Any rights to pensions would be dealt with under the rules of the pension scheme applicable to the director and any rights under the Companys share plans would be dealt with in accordance with the rules of each plan.
