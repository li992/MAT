G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 50 Directors remuneration report at 31 December 2009 This report, prepared on behalf of and approved by the board, provides details of the remuneration of each of the directors and sets out the companys remuneration policies for the current financial year and, subject to ongoing review, for subsequent financial years.
The report will be put to the companys Annual General Meeting for approval by the shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee met four times during the period under review.
The members of the committee, all of whom are considered to be independent, are Lord Condon chairman, Mark Elliott, Bo Lerenius and Mark Seligman.
The committee is responsible for setting all aspects of the remuneration of the chairman, the executive directors, the three other members of the group executive committee and the company secretary.
It is also responsible for the operation of the companys share plans.
Its terms of reference are available on the companys website.
1 During the year, the committee received advice from Towers, Perrin, Forster & Crosby, Inc.
Towers Perrin as the committees appointed advisors on executive and senior management remuneration matters.
Towers Perrin has also provided a small amount of management remuneration information to the company during the period under review.
Their terms of appointment are available on the companys website.
In addition Alithos Limited Alithos has been appointed by the committee to verify the calculation of certain elements of payments due under the companys performance share plan.
Alithos has not provided any other services to the company during the period under review.
Nick Buckles, chief executive, provided guidance to the committee on remuneration packages for senior executives within the group.
Further guidance was received from the groups HR director, Irene Cowden.
Neither Mr Buckles nor Mrs Cowden participated in discussions regarding their own remuneration.
Remuneration policy The policy for the remuneration of the executive directors and the executive management team aims to achieve: the ability to attract, retain and motivate high calibre executives: a strong link between executive reward and the groups performance: alignment of the interests of the executives and the shareholders: and provision of incentive arrangements which focus appropriately on both annual and longer term performance.
In terms of market positioning, the overall objective is to achieve remuneration levels which provide a market competitive base salary with the opportunity to earn above market norms through the companys incentive schemes on the delivery of superior performance.
A significant proportion of total remuneration is therefore related to performance, through participation in both short-term and long-term incentive schemes.
On average, the performance-related element of remuneration for executive directors amounts to around 50% of the total package for target performance and around 65% of the total package for stretch performance.
The committee believes that the current balance is appropriate given its desire to ensure a strong link between performance and remuneration whilst, at the same time, avoiding a system which might incentivise inappropriate risk-taking.
The balance between longand short-term incentives, and between basic salary and performance-related bonuses, is therefore kept under close review, but the committee is satisfied that the existing long-term incentive scheme, allied to the claw back processes and minimum shareholding requirements which have been introduced recently, provide suitable controls and incentives which are designed to avoid rewarding excessive risk taking or behaviour aimed at short-term, unsustainable, gains.
Target performance Stretch performance Long-term incentive Base salary Long-term incentive Base salary Annual bonus Annual bonus The committee is also satisfied that the incentive structure for the board does not raise environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
Bonus payments do not form part of salary for pension purposes.
Towers Perrin and Alithos have each given, and not withdrawn, their written consent to the issue of this document with the inclusion of the reference to their respective names in the form and content in which they appear.
Copies of the consent letters are available for inspection at the companys registered office.
G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Overview Business review Governance 51 Financial statements Shareholder information Elements of remuneration a Base salary and benefits The salaries of the executive directors are reviewed with effect from 1 January each year.
Interim salary reviews may be carried out following significant changes in responsibility.
The salaries take account of a benchmarking exercise based on similarly sized companies with a significant part of their business overseas and also reflect responsibility, individual performance, internal relativities and salary and other market information supplied by Towers Perrin.
Benefits include pension arrangements and the provision of a company car or a cash allowance in lieu of a car, health insurance and life assurance.
As in 2009, the executive directors have again requested that their base salaries are frozen in 2010, to take account of both pay and employment conditions across the group as well as the current economic circumstances.
The committee has acceded to this request, but is conscious that this decision is not consistent with the companys stated remuneration policy or the continuing strong performance of the group as a whole.
As a result the committee will continue to monitor the market closely and, when conditions permit, it is the committees intention to more closely align base salaries with its competitive mid-market policy.
Once again, as was the case in 2009, the non-executive directors have also asked that their fee levels are not changed in 2010. b Performance-related bonus scheme For the year under review, the executive directors participated in an annual performance-related bonus scheme, payments under which were dependent on the attainment of defined PBTA profit before tax and amortisation targets of the group, adjusted for the effect of any exceptional items and discontinued operations and using constant exchange rates.
The committee believes that PBTA best reflects the various key drivers of business success within the group.
The maximum bonus entitlement for the executive directors is an amount equal to 125% of base salary 150% in the case of the chief executive.
60% of maximum bonus entitlement was payable on achievement of the budgeted target and the amount of bonus increased on a straight-line basis up to 100% of maximum bonus entitlement for achievement of a stretch profit target.
Any bonus due above 50% of the individuals maximum bonus entitlement would be awarded as deferred shares which would not vest for three years.
For achievement of a threshold level of profits which is at least 95% of the budgeted profit target, a bonus payment of 35% of maximum bonus entitlement was due, with no bonus payable for performance below threshold.
A claw back provision was included in the 2009 annual bonus rules by which any deferred shares awarded and dividends arising therefrom could be clawed back if the 2009 profit figures are restated materially in line with a recommendation by the Audit Committee within two years of the year end.
The committee has approved the retention of the same rules as described above for the 2010 annual bonus scheme but has extended the claw back provisions so that they apply to cash payments as well as to deferred shares.
The group performed extremely well in 2009 in what were very difficult economic conditions in many of its key markets.
PBTA increased by 78.2m 51.7m at 2009 constant exchange rates, exceeding the target of 397.7m, but falling below the maximum full stretch target which was 417.5m: thus, 35% of the maximum stretch target was achieved.
The Remuneration Committee has therefore agreed that the resulting bonus payment will be at 74% of maximum bonus entitlement.
The PBTA target used for the above scheme is the same as the companys budgeted PBTA for the corresponding period assuming constant exchange rates.
The PBTA target allows for adjustments in respect of any material, non-budgeted changes which take place during the year, such as acquisitions, disposals etc.
Thus, for example, should a planned disposal not be completed by the year end, the committee reserves the right to re-insert the operating profit or loss for the business in question in the actual and budgeted PBTA targets.
c Performance Share Plan long-term incentive plan The Performance Share Plan PSP was introduced in July 2004.
Under the plan, the executive directors and certain other senior executives receive conditional allocations of the companys shares which are released to them only on the achievement of demanding performance targets.
The maximum annual award of shares payable under the plan is two and a half times base salary.
The annual award approved by the committee for the year under review is two times base salary for the chief executive, one and a half times base salary for the other executive directors and one times salary for senior executives below board level.
The extent to which allocations of shares under the plan vest is determined, as to two-thirds of the award, by the companys normalised earnings per share growth relative to the RPI over a single three-year period and, as to the remaining third of the award, by the companys ranking by reference to TSR total shareholder return: being share price growth plus dividends paid using a bespoke global group of 16 support services companies as a comparator group, again over a single three-year period.
In relation to awards made in years prior to 2007, the conditions subject to which allocations of shares vest under this plan differ in a number of respects: half of any award is determined by the companys normalised earnings per share growth relative to the RPI over a single three-year period and the other half of the award by the companys ranking by reference to TSR using the FTSE 100 constituent companies as at the date of the award as a comparator group, again over a single three-year period.
There is no provision for retesting.
The following targets will continue to apply to two-thirds of awards granted since 2007, with the three-year EPS earnings per share period ending on 31 December in the third year so for awards made at the beginning of 2009, the period ends on 31 December 2011 : Average annual growth in EPS Proportion of allocation vesting Less than RPI 6% per annum Nil RPI 6% per annum 18% over three years 25% RPI 6%11% per annum Pro rata between 25% and 100% RPI 11% per annum 33% over three years 100% The same targets apply to the first half of awards granted in years prior to 2007.
G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 52 Directors remuneration report continued c Performance Share Plan long-term incentive plan continued The following targets apply to the remaining one-third of each award granted since 2007: Ranking of the company against the bespoke comparator group by reference to TSR Proportion of allocation vesting Below median Nil Median 25% Between median and upper quartile Pro rata between 25% and 100% Upper quartile 100% The same targets apply to the second half of each award granted in years prior to 2007, but the ranking applied is that of the company against the FTSE 100 constituent companies as at the date of the award.
In addition, participants in the PSP will receive a further share award with a value equivalent to the dividends which would have been paid in respect of future PSP awards vesting at the end of the performance period.
In relation to awards made before 2007, there will only be a transfer of shares under the second half if the growth in EPS of the company has exceeded the growth in RPI by 10% over a performance period of three financial years.
Furthermore, there will only be a transfer of shares under the final third or second half in respect of awards made before 2007 if the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the companys TSR performance is reflective of the companys underlying performance.
The Remuneration Committee believes that a combination of earnings per share growth and total shareholder return targets is the most appropriate performance measure for the performance share plan, as it provides a transparent method of assessing the companys performance, both in terms of underlying financial performance and returns to shareholders.
The company calculates whether the EPS performance targets have been achieved by reference to the companys audited accounts which provide an accessible and objective measure of the companys earnings per share, whilst TSR ranking will be determined by Towers Perrin whose findings are verified by Alithos.
Awards will not normally vest where an employee ceases to be employed within the group unless cessation of employment is due to death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or following a change of control of, or sale outside the group of, his or her employing company.
In these situations, vesting will occur in the normal course and the performance targets will need to be satisfied.
Only a proportion of the award, based on the time which has elapsed from the award date to the end of the last complete month in which the employee was employed, will vest in these circumstances in most cases.
The Remuneration Committee does however retain the ability to allow for a greater award to vest if it considers it to be appropriate in exceptional circumstances.
The companys current policy is to use market purchased shares to satisfy performance share plan awards.
The Remuneration Committee believes that continued shareholding by executive directors will strengthen the alignment of their interests with shareholders interests.
Accordingly, whilst executive directors of the company have previously been expected to retain shares to the value of 30% of the after-tax gains made on the vesting of performance share plan awards until they have built up a shareholding equivalent to one times base salary, a formal policy has now been adopted under which, in future, executive directors will be required to retain 50% of after-tax PSP vestings until a total shareholding equal to 100% of base salary 150% for the chief executive is achieved.
Following a review of the operation of the PSP by the Remuneration Committee including detailed analysis of the current EPS and TSR targets, the committee is satisfied that the current EPS and TSR measures and targets remain appropriate for 2010 and that, as in 2009, the committee will remove the impact of currency movements from the calculation of both EPS and TSR.
Fees, service contracts and letters of appointment The chairmans annual fee is 270,000.
The annual fee for the non-executive directors, which is set by the chairman and the executive directors, is 54,100, with a further 44,550 for the role of deputy chairman, 16,700 for the chairmanship of each of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and 10,000 for the role of senior independent director.
No other fees are paid for membership of the board committees.
These fees are subject to periodic review which takes into account comparative fee levels in other groups of a similar size and the anticipated time commitment for the non-executive directors.
The service contracts of those who served as executive directors during the period are dated as follows: Nick Buckles 2 June 2004 Trevor Dighton 2 June 2004 Grahame Gibson 6 December 2006 The contracts of Messrs Buckles, Dighton and Gibson are terminable by the company on 12 months notice.
The contracts are terminable by the executive directors on 12 months notice.
There are no liquidated damages provisions for compensation payable upon early termination, but the company reserves the right to pay salary in lieu of notice.
The directors contracts do not provide for the payment of a guaranteed bonus in the event of termination.
It is the companys policy that it should be able to terminate service contracts of executive directors on no more than 12 months notice and that payments for termination of contract are restricted to the value of salary and other contractual entitlements for the notice period.
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the current arrangements are appropriate and in line with best practice.
The chairman and the other non-executive directors do not have service contracts but letters of appointment.
Mr Seligman and Mr Elliott have each been granted two-year extensions to their initial three-year terms of appointment.
Those extensions began respectively on 1 January and 1 September 2009.
The other non-executive directors were each granted three-year extensions to their initial letters of appointment, such extensions having begun on 19 May 2007.
All continuing directors are required to stand for re-election by the shareholders at least once every three years.
It is the companys policy that executive directors may each hold not more than one external non-executive appointment and may retain any associated fees.
Mr Buckles is a non-executive director of Arriva plc for which he received fees of 45,000 in the year ended 31 December 2009.
Neither of the other executive directors currently holds an external non-executive appointment.
G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Overview Business review Governance 53 Financial statements Shareholder information Performance graph The performance graph below shows the total cumulative shareholder return of the company over the five years to the end of December 2009, based on a hypothetical shareholding worth 100, compared with the return achieved by the FTSE 100 constituent companies over the same period.
The directors believe this to be an appropriate form of broad equity market index against which to base a comparison given the size and geographic coverage of the company and the fact that the company is itself a member of the FTSE 100.
The graph also compares the companys performance over the same period with the bespoke group of companies which is used now for comparative total shareholder return purposes in the companys performance share plan.
Until 2007, the FTSE 100 constituent companies were used for this purpose.
The values attributable to the bespoke comparator group companies have been weighted in accordance with the market capitalisation of the companies calculated at spot exchange rates as at each year end.

Benefits include the cost of providing life insurance which was dealt with previously as part of the cost of pensions.
No new benefits have been provided.
Any bonus due above 50% of the individuals maximum bonus entitlement 150% of base salary for Mr Buckles and 125% for Messrs. Dighton and Gibson will be awarded as deferred G4S shares.
The number of shares which will be awarded will be the amount of bonus in question divided by the average middle market closing price of the companys ordinary shares over the three days immediately following the date of the companys preliminary results announcement: 16 March 2010.
The company paid air fares amounting to US$30,170 for flights between the UK and the USA for Mr Gibsons wife and children.
This sum is taxable in the USA and not included in the figures above.
Mr Gibson receives part of his salary in sterling and part in US$.
The US$ element has been translated into sterling for the purposes of his salary at the exchange rates prevailing in each month in which Mr Gibson was paid.

There have been no changes in the directors holdings since 31 December 2009.
As at 31 December 2009, each of Nick Buckles, Trevor Dighton and Grahame Gibson also had a deemed interest in 5,543,818 ordinary shares held in the G4S Employee Benefit Trust.
Directors pension entitlements For the period under review, both Nick Buckles and Trevor Dighton participated in non-contributory categories of the groups defined benefit pension scheme with a normal retirement age of 60.
Mr Dighton accrued pension at a rate of 1 30ths and Mr Buckles accrued pension at a rate of 1 52ths of their final pensionable salaries.
Their rates of accrual have not changed in the time since they joined the scheme.
An actuarial reduction is applied to pensions payable before normal retirement age.
Pension can continue to accrue at the same rates beyond normal retirement age.
For death before retirement, a capital sum equal to four times pensionable salary is payable, together with a spouses pension of 50% of the members prospective pension at the age of 60 plus a return of any contributions paid prior to the admission to the non-contributory category.
For death in retirement, a spouses pension of 50% of the members pre-commutation pension is payable.
Post-retirement pension increases are payable at the rate of 5% per annum in respect of pension earned up to 31 December 1994 and in line with the increase in the Retail Prices Index subject to a maximum of 5% per annum in respect of pension earned after that date.
With effect from 6 April 2006, Mr Gibson opted for enhanced protection and receives a salary supplement in lieu of pension of 40% of his basic salary.

2 Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the current transfer value basis adopted by the trustees of the G4S Pension Scheme.
3 The value of net increase 4 represents the incremental value to the director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption that service terminated at the year end.
It is based on the increase in accrued pension 2 with the exception of Mr Gibson whose accrual ended on 5 April 2006.
4 The impact of changes in market conditions has been much smaller than in 2008, so the increase in transfer value is mainly due to the increase in the amount of benefit over the year.
5 Inflation was negative over 2009, but an increase of 0% was assumed in the calculations above.
6 Mr Gibson receives a salary supplement in lieu of pension of 40% of his base salary.
Lord Condon Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 15 March 2010 G4S plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Statement of directors responsibilities in respect 56 of the annual report and the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2009 The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and the group and parent company financial statements, in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law they are required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: for the group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU: for the parent company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial statements: and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and the parent company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent companys transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors Report, Directors Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the companys website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors Responsibility Statement Each of the directors, the names of whom are set out on pages 40 and 41 of this annual report confirms that, to the best of his knowledge: the financial statements in this annual report have been prepared in accordance with the applicable accounting standards and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the company and the group taken as a whole: and the directors report, including the Business Review on pages 4 to 39, includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the company and the group taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
This statement of directors responsibilities was approved by a duly authorised committee of the board of directors on 15 March 2010 and signed on its behalf by Trevor Dighton, Chief financial officer.
