Our governance Annual report and accounts 2009 85 Performance graph The graph below shows Balfour Beattys TSR performance compared to the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts TSR over the five financial years ended 31 December 2009.
As in previous reports, the RemCo has elected to compare the TSR on the Companys ordinary shares against the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts principally because this is a broad index of which the Company is a constituent member.
The values indicated in the graph show the share price growth plus reinvested dividends from a 100 hypothetical holding of ordinary shares in Balfour Beatty plc and in the index, at the start of the period and have been calculated using 30 trading day average values.
The detailed information about the Directors remuneration, set out below and on pages 86 to 90 has been audited by the Companys independent auditors, Deloitte LLP.
In practice, the salary paid to Mr McNaughton has been reduced with effect from 1 November 2009 due to the Directors participation in the Companys SMART Pensions salary sacrifice arrangement.
The amount of reduction corresponds to the Director's contributions to the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund, which are now met directly by the Company as part of this arrangement.
Salary sacrifice contributions totalled 1,016 in 2009. ii Ian Tyler, Duncan Magrath, Andrew McNaughton and Anthony Rabin received taxable cash supplements in lieu of pension provision on their salary above the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund specific earnings cap.
iii The performance target for annual bonus was profit before tax, exceptional items and amortisation of intangible assets profit.
The profit for the year ended 31 December 2009 resulted in a bonus of 48.3% of basic salary for each executive Director.
Two-thirds of this bonus is payable in cash and these are the amounts shown in the table above.
The remaining one-third is deferred in the form of ordinary shares in the Company which will be released to the Director on 31 March 2013, providing he is still employed by the Company at that time.
The number of shares comprising the deferred element will be determined based on the share price at the award date of 31 March 2010. iv Hubertus Krossa received a fee of 30,000 included above for his chairmanship of the supervisory board of Balfour Beatty Rail GmbH.

iii Robert Walvis was also interested at 31 December 2009 in 938 ordinary shares in Balfour Beatty held by the Craven Arms Investment Club, of which he is a member.
It is the Companys current intention that awards will be satisfied by shares purchased in the market.
ii For the awards made in April 2007, April 2008 and April 2009, the performance periods are the three years ending 31 December 2009, 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2011 respectively.
50% of each award is subject to an EPS growth target.
The maximum number of shares subject to this performance condition will only vest if EPS growth exceeds the retail prices index RPI by 45% over the performance period for the April 2007 and April 2008 awards and 39% for the April 2009 award.
If EPS growth exceeds RPI by 15% for the April 2007 and April 2008 awards and 9% for the April 2009 award, then 25% of this part of the award will vest.
For growth in EPS between these points, vesting will be on a pro-rata basis.
No shares will vest from this part of the award if EPS growth exceeds RPI by less than 15% or 9% as appropriate.
The other 50% of each award is subject to a total shareholder return TSR target under which the TSR of the Company is compared to that of a comparator group of similar companies listed in the UK at the start of the performance period.
The maximum number of shares subject to this performance condition will only vest if the Companys TSR is at the upper quartile of the comparator group.
If the Companys TSR is equal to that of the median of the comparator group then 25% of this part of the award will vest.
No shares from this part of the award will vest if the Companys TSR is below that of the median of the comparator group.
For TSR performance between median and upper quartile, vesting will be on a pro-rata basis.
There is no provision for re-testing of either of the performance conditions.
iii The average middle market price of ordinary shares in the Company for the three dealing dates before the award dates, which was used for calculating the number of awards granted, was 308.417p for the 2006 award, 491.583p for the 2007 award, 449.17p for the 2008 award, and 354p for the 2009 award.

iv The performance period for the awards made in April 2007 was completed on 31 December 2009.
The growth in EPS for this period with adjustments in relation to the rights issue and the acquisition of Parsons Brinckerhoff for EPS in 2006 and 2009 exceeded RPI by more than 45%, the level required for maximum vesting.
The Companys TSR for this period ranked just below the median of the comparator group.
The combined effect of these performance measures is that 50% of each participants conditional award will vest on 26 March 2010.
This date was brought forward from the original vesting date of 17 April 2010.
Each participant will also receive shares equal in value to the dividends which would have been payable on the shares which vest.
v The performance period for the awards made in June 2006 was completed on 31 December 2008.
The growth in EPS for this period exceeded RPI by more than 45%, the level required for maximum vesting.

90 Annual report and accounts 2009 Remuneration report Directors pensions Executive Directors participate in the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund the Fund.
The Fund provides for a pension at a normal retirement age of 62 for pension purposes and each Director pays an annual contribution equal to 5% of contributory salary except where, in the case of Andrew McNaughton, the Director participates in SMART Pensions, as outlined in note ii to the second table below.
The pension for a Director who can complete 20 or more years pensionable service at normal retirement age is targeted at two-thirds of final pensionable salary, subject to HMRC limits.
With effect from 6 April 2006, HMRC limits were changed with one of the changes being to no longer use the earnings cap when determining the maximum permissible benefits.
However, the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund has retained a Fund specific earnings cap for pension purposes.
The salaries of Duncan Magrath, Andrew McNaughton, Anthony Rabin and Ian Tyler were subject to the Fund specific earnings cap for pension purposes and details of the Companys contributions to additional arrangements for them are shown in the Directors remuneration table on page 85.
The table below sets out the accrued deferred pension which would be paid annually from the Fund at normal retirement age based on each executive Directors service to 31 December 2009 as well as the additional pension benefit secured in respect of service during the year.
