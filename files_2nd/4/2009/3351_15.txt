In respect of the service contract of Mr Deeley, and for Directors appointed in the future, the Committee will look to apply the principles of mitigation following termination.
CCSL has agreed tax equalisation arrangements with each Executive Director under which, if the amount of any remuneration paid by CCSL or any Associated Company to that Director is taxed in a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom, CCSL or the Director will make a balancing payment so that the amount received by the Director after tax in respect of that remuneration is the same as it would have been had he only been subject to United Kingdom tax in respect of it.
Similar tax equalisation arrangements have been put in place for the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors, with the exception of Manfred Wennemer, who is a German resident and was not previously on the board of the former Charter plc.
The Executive Directors entered into letters of appointment in respect of their duties as Directors of the Company which took effect on 22 October 2008.
Each appointment will be subject to termination by either party giving the other party not less than one months notice in writing and will automatically cease if that Executive Director ceases to be an employee of CCSL.

At the same time the salaries received by them from CCSL in respect of their executive duties on behalf of the rest of the Charter Group were reduced by an equivalent amount so that in aggregate they received the same remuneration.
2 With effect from 1 January 2010, the fees payable to all Directors in respect of their duties as Directors of Charter International were increased from 57,750 to 60,250 per annum, with the chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees continuing to be paid an additional 6,000 and 4,000 respectively.

2 The pension entitlement shown in the first row is the aggregate amount which would be paid annually on normal retirement based on service to the end of 2009 under the approved scheme.
3 The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
4 The transfer value of the accrued entitlement represents the value of assets that the pension schemes would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liabilities in respect of the Directors pension benefits.
It does not represent sums payable to the individual Directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
5 The transfer value of the increases in accrued benefits, required by the Listing Rules, discloses the current value of the increase in accrued benefits that the Director has earned in the period, whereas the change in its transfer value, required by the Companies Act, discloses the absolute increase or decrease in its transfer value and includes the change in value of the accrued benefits that results from market volatility affecting the transfer value at the beginning of the period, as well as additional value earned in the year.
