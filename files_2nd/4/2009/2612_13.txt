REPORT ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION AND RELATED MATTERS This report has been prepared on behalf of the Board by the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee has adopted the principles of good governance as set out in the Combined Code and has complied with the applicable Listing Rules and the relevant schedules of the Companies Act 1985.
This report sets out the Groups policy and disclosure in relation to the remuneration and share interests of the directors of Burberry Group plc.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee comprises: David Tyler Chairman Philip Bowman Ian Carter Stephanie George John Peace The Remuneration Committee is responsible for setting the remuneration of the executive directors and the Chairman of the Board and monitors the level and structure of senior management pay.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is a matter for the Board as a whole.
No director is involved in any discussions as to their own remuneration.
During the year under review, the Remuneration Committee met six times.
Details of the number of meetings and attendance at those meetings during the year are set out in the Corporate Governance Report on page 59.
The Remuneration Committee has appointed Kepler Associates Kepler to assist with its considerations.
Kepler provide advice on the ongoing operation of employee and executive share plans together with advice on executive remuneration: they do not provide any other services to the Company.
In addition, assistance has been provided during the year by Towers Perrin.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available on the Groups website www.
Remuneration policy The Remuneration Committee believes the Groups remuneration should be competitive and strongly linked to performance, taking into account the markets in which it operates.
The Groups remuneration policy is based on the following principles.
Remuneration should be closely aligned with shareholders interests through thoughtful selection of performance measures, emphasis on variable pay and delivery of remuneration in shares, part of which are expected to be retained in accordance with the Groups executive shareholding guidelines The overall remuneration framework should provide a balance between short and long term business objectives.
Variable pay for executive directors includes 1 an annual cash bonus based on PBT, and 2 long-term share-based incentives linked primarily to increases in shareholder value and growth in profit.
Furthermore, the Burberry Co-Investment Plan the Co-Investment Plan encourages executive directors and other senior executives to invest their annual cash bonus into shares over a further three-year period Total remuneration should be sufficient to attract, motivate and retain exceptional talent within the global luxury brands sector.
Total remuneration for executive directors and other senior executives is therefore benchmarked against Burberrys main global competitors and UK companies of comparable size.
The Remuneration Committee recognises that for each executive the relative importance of each of these benchmarks may be different.
Benefits are based on competitive market practice for each executive, depending on individual circumstances Changes to remuneration in 2009 10 The current economic environment has emphasised the need to ensure the interests of shareholders and executives remain aligned over the long term.
During the year, the Remuneration Committee has reviewed arrangements to ensure that executive remuneration continues to reward the right behaviours and motivate executives to focus on profitability in a difficult market, set against an exceptionally challenging economic environment.
As a result of this review, the Remuneration Committee has taken the following approach in respect of the executive directors compensation: no awards were granted under the Burberry Senior Executive Restricted Share Plan RSP during 2008 09 no salary increases have been awarded as part of the March 2009 year-end compensation cycle no annual bonuses have been awarded in respect of the financial year to 31 March 2009 and consequently there will be no opportunity to defer bonuses under the Burberry Co-Investment Plan awards with a value of two times basic salary will be granted under the RSP in 2009 10 64 Burberry Group PLC annual report 2008 09 REPORT ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION AND RELATED MATTERS CONTINUED Following consultation with major shareholders, the Remuneration Committee has made a change to the way in which the RSP will operate for awards granted in 2009, within the parameters agreed in 2004 when the plan was approved by shareholders.
The RSP rewards both internal and external performance, and encourages a longer-term perspective through vesting over three, four and five years.
The Remuneration Committee believes that these elements of plan design continue to be effective in the current environment.
The vesting of 50% of the award will continue to be based upon Burberrys three-year Total Shareholder Return TSR relative to its peers and will vest in full only if Burberry achieves least upper quartile TSR relative to its peers.
In order to drive long-term profitability and to ensure that targets remain credible but challenging in todays exceptionally difficult economic environment the remaining 50% will vest in full only if Burberry achieves growth in adjusted profit before tax PBT of 10% per annum.
The proportion of awards which are subject to growth in PBT and were granted prior to 2009 will vest in full only if Burberry achieves growth in PBT of 15% per annum.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the adjustment to the level of profit growth required to achieve full vesting is necessary to reflect the significant changes in the economic environment and will remain as challenging in the current circumstances as those set when the RSP was adopted in 2004.
The Remuneration Committee believes that this change will motivate executives to achieve profit growth in a challenging market as well as to provide competitive levels of total remuneration.
Performance graph The following graph shows the TSR for Burberry Group plc compared to the companies in the FTSE 100 Index assuming 100 was invested on 31 March 2004.
The FTSE 100 Index has been selected as Burberrys capitalisation is close to that of companies at the lower end of the FTSE 100 Index.
Value of 100 invested on 31 March 2004 Burberry FTSE 100 250 200 150 100 50 0 March 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Elements of remuneration Remuneration is structured such that for executive directors and other senior executives, performance-related elements represent the majority of total potential remuneration.
The Group implements its remuneration policy through the provision of the following elements: Base salary The Group aims to provide salaries which are competitive with those of comparable roles at global companies of a similar size and global reach within the luxury goods sector and UK companies of comparable size.
These companies are representative of Burberrys competitors for executive talent.
When making salary determinations, the Remuneration Committee takes into account not only competitive information but also each executives individual performance and overall contribution to the business during the year.
Annual bonus Each year the Remuneration Committee sets bonus targets by reference to internal and external expectations.
Bonuses are currently based on profitability and performance against Group strategic and individual objectives and overall contribution to the business.
The Remuneration Committee believes that linking incentives to profitability helps to reinforce the Groups strategy and long term growth objectives.
Targets are rigorously calibrated by Kepler using benchmarks that include broker earnings estimates for Burberry and its competitors, targets for profitability consistent with median upper quartile shareholder returns, latest projections for the then current year, budget, strategic plan, long-term financial goals, etc.
Actual bonus awards are subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.

Benefits Benefits for executive directors include private medical insurance, life assurance and long-term disability insurance.
Executive directors also receive car and clothing allowances and pension contributions.
Service agreements Attracting the best talent in the global luxury goods sector can require fixed contract terms which result in termination payments in excess of one years remuneration.
Burberry does not offer such terms unless the Remuneration Committee considers it absolutely necessary in the particular circumstances to attract a highly talented individual and even in these circumstances will ensure that, after an initial period, termination payments will not exceed one years remuneration.
Save for the service contract of Angela Ahrendts, there are no service contracts for any executive director which could result in termination payments of more than one years total remuneration.

No further payments will be made in respect of this bonus.

She would also receive her pension contributions and overseas allowances for a further 12 months together with relocation expenses.
If the service agreement is terminated by Burberry after January 2010, the entitlements in respect of salary and bonus would decline to 12 months salary and 75% of her annual maximum bonus opportunity.

If Burberry terminates the agreement without cause but in circumstances where the Remuneration Committee determines that Angela Ahrendts performance or that of the Group does not meet the financial expectations of the Board or shareholders, her entitlements in respect of salary and bonus will be reduced so that she will receive 12 months salary and 37.5% of her maximum bonus opportunity.

To facilitate this, executive directors may, at the invitation of the Remuneration Committee, defer receipt of all or part of their annual bonus and invest it in Burberry shares, with up to a 2:1 match based on individual and Group performance during the year.
The Matching Share awards do not vest for three years and are forfeited if the executive leaves due to resignation within that period.
To further link pay and performance, and to align remuneration with shareholders interests, the vesting of Matching Share awards granted after 31 March 2009 are subject to the achievement of secondary performance conditions linked to growth in profit before tax.
For the year ended 31 March 2008, Angela Ahrendts and Stacey Cartwright chose to defer and invest the whole of their bonus after the deduction of tax into Burberry shares via the Co-Investment Plan.
The Invested Shares are included in the table below and in the table of directors interests appearing on page 71.
The related Matching Share awards under these arrangements are also shown in the table below.
The executive directors did not receive an annual bonus in respect of the year ended 31 March 2009 and will not be granted awards under the Co-Investment Plan in respect of that financial year.
The interests of the executive directors in shares granted under this scheme as at 31 March 2009 were as follows.
The market value of these awards at the date of grant 3 June 2008 was 494.75p per share.
68 Burberry Group PLC annual report 2008 09 REPORT ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION AND RELATED MATTERS CONTINUED The Burberry Group plc Exceptional Performance Share Plan the EPP Following shareholder approval at the 2007 Annual General Meeting, Burberry introduced a one-off long-term incentive plan, delivered in Burberry shares, the purpose of which was to incentivise senior management to achieve stretching goals and to help provide exceptional reward for exceptional performance.
Awards granted under the EPP are based 50% on relative Total Shareholder Return TSR performance and 50% on growth in profits over the three and four-year performance periods to 2010 and 2011.
Awards do not vest unless Burberrys TSR exceeds the median of the comparator group or growth in profit before tax PBT exceeds 50% over the fouryear performance period to 2010 or 75% over the five-year performance period to 2011.
For the performance period to 2010, maximum vesting requires Burberrys TSR to outperform the median of our peers by at least 8% p. a. and would require PBT growth of at least 75%.
For the performance period to 2011, maximum vesting requires Burberrys TSR to outperform the median of its peers by at least 7% p. a. and would require PBT growth of at least 100%.
Of the shares which meet the performance criteria, 50% vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant and the remaining 50% vest on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant.
The TSR group for this award comprised Bulgari, Coach, Compagnie Financire Richemont, Este Lauder, Fossil, Geox, Herms International, Hugo Boss, Inditex, Liz Claiborne, Luxottica Group, LVMH Mot Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Nike, Nordstrom, Polo Ralph Lauren, PPR, Saks, Swatch, Tiffany & Co, and Tods.
The interests of the executive directors in ordinary shares subject to awards under this plan as at 31 March 2009 were as follows: 1 Number of ordinary shares Vesting period As at As at 31 March 31 March 2008 2009 From To Expiry date Angela Ahrendts 850,000 850,000 26 07 2010 26 07 2011 25 07 2012 Stacey Cartwright 350,000 350,000 26 07 2010 26 07 2011 25 07 2012 1 Subject to performance testing The Burberry Senior Executive Restricted Share Plan the RSP Under the RSP, executives may be awarded shares up to a maximum value of two times base salary.
The vesting of awards granted under the RSP is based 50% on Burberrys three-year Total Shareholder Return TSR relative to its peers and 50% on three-year growth in profit before tax PBT.
Awards granted in 2009 will vest in full only if Burberry achieves at least upper quartile TSR relative to its peers and at least 10% per annum PBT growth.
A proportion of an award 12.5% may vest if TSR performance exceeds the median of the peer group or if PBT growth exceeds 3% per annum over three years.
Of the shares which meet the performance criteria, 50% vests after three years.
The remaining 50% vests in two equal tranches on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant.
The Remuneration Committee chose TSR relative to a group of Burberrys peers because it felt that this is an objective measure of the Groups success and aligns with shareholder interests.
Growth in PBT was chosen as it continues to be the primary measure used by management and the Remuneration Committee believes strong growth in pre-tax profit is key to delivering superior shareholder returns.
The TSR group for awards granted in 2007 comprised Bulgari, Coach, Compagnie Financire Richemont, Este Lauder, Fossil, Geox, Herms International, Hugo Boss, Inditex, Liz Claiborne, Luxottica Group, LVMH Mot Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Nike, Nordstrom, Polo Ralph Lauren, PPR, Saks, Swatch, Tiffany & Co, and Tods.

In 2004 and 2005, the peer group included Barneys New York, Neiman-Marcus and Tommy Hilfiger.
When those companies ceased to be listed, Estee Lauder, Fossil, Liz Claiborne and Nordstrom were added to the peer group in 2006.
Executive directors were not granted awards under this plan during the financial year to 31 March 2009.
For awards granted between 2004 and 2007, the PBT element of these awards 50% of the award vests 25% for PBT growth of 5% p. a. and vests in full 100% for PBT growth of at least 15% p. a. over three years, with straight-line vesting between these two points.
