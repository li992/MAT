Matching Share awards are capable of vesting in respect of a maximum of three times the number of Deferred Shares awarded, subject to the achievement of TSR targets over a single two year period.
TSR performance is measured relative to other companies specified by the Remuneration Committee.
For awards granted in 2004 and 2005, TSR was measured partly relative to FTSE 100 companies and partly relative to the following financial services comparator group companies: Aegon, Legal & General Group, Allianz Group, Old Mutual, AXA, Prudential, AVIVA, RAS, Generali and Zurich Financial Services Group.
For 50% of the Matching Share awards, where TSR is measured against the FTSE 100, full vesting will only occur at upper decile performance, vesting will occur in the ratio of shares under Matching Share awards to shares under Deferred Share awards of 2:1 at upper quartile performance and vesting in the ratio 1:1 will occur at median performance.
For the other 50% of the Matching Share awards, where TSR is measured against the financial services comparator group, full vesting will occur if TSR is highest in the comparator group, vesting in the ratio 2:1 will occur at upper quartile performance and vesting in the ratio 1:1 will occur at median performance.
Matching Share awards will not vest at below median performance.
For awards granted in 2005, the targets were measured over the period from 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2007.
The relevant TSR figures were averaged over the three months before the beginning and end of this performance period.
Additionally, no Matching Shares vest unless the Committee is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying performance of the Company over the performance period.
The aggregate value of Share Matching Plan awards exercised during 2009 is 1,359,617.
The market price of ordinary shares on 6 April 2009, the date on which long term incentive scheme interests were granted during the year, was 121.2p.
Deferred Shares are inclusive of voluntary Deferred Shares and compulsory Deferred Shares.
Voluntary Deferred Shares are purchased by Lloyds TSB Offshore Trust Company Limited on behalf of each participant using part of the net annual bonus paid to them and are held in trust for three years.
These Deferred Shares are not at risk of forfeiture and may be withdrawn from the trust at any time, but the related Matching Share awards would lapse if the voluntary Deferred Shares are withdrawn within three years of acquisition.
Compulsory Deferred Share awards are granted as part of the annual bonus.
These Deferred Shares will normally vest in three years from the date of grant subject to continuous employment with the Group.
Matching Shares are capable of vesting in respect of a maximum of 2.5 times the number of Deferred Shares awarded, subject to the achievement of performance conditions over a three year period.
For grants awarded in 2009, 30% of the Matching Shares relating to compulsory Deferred Shares are subject to TSR performance relative to other companies specified by the Remuneration Committee.
For grants awarded in 2006, 2007 and 2008, 50% of the Matching Shares relating to compulsory Deferred Shares are subject to TSR performance relative to other companies specified by the Remuneration Committee.
For awards granted from 2006, TSR will be measured relative to the following comparator group companies: Aegon, Allianz Group, AVIVA, AXA, Baloise, Generali, Legal & General Group, Munich Re, QBE, Swiss Re and Zurich Financial Services.
Full vesting will only occur at upper quintile performance: at median performance 25% of the Matching Shares will vest.
The remaining balance of the Matching Shares relating to compulsory Deferred Shares and all of the Matching Shares relating to voluntary Deferred Shares are subject to a ROE performance condition.
If underlying ROE over three years commencing in the year of grant is below 10% 12% for awards granted in 2008, no part of the award subject to ROE performance will vest.
If underlying ROE over three years is 10% 12% for awards granted in 2008, 25% of the award will vest.
If underlying average annual ROE over three years is 16% or higher 18% for awards granted in 2008, 100% of the awards will vest.
For the purpose of establishing the number of Matching Shares relating to voluntary Deferred Shares that may be awarded, the gross value of that part of the annual bonus payment that a participant elects to voluntarily defer is used.
Performance conditions relating to awards of Performance Shares are the same as those relating to compulsory Deferred Shares for the relevant year as described above.
The above table shows the date by which qualifying conditions for awards made on 6 April 2009 must be fulfilled.
For awards made on 12 June 2006, all performance conditions were met in full and the awards vested in full during the year.
For awards made on 16 April 2007, the date by which qualifying conditions must be fulfilled has been adjusted to 8 March 2010.
For awards made on 9 April 2008, the date by which qualifying conditions must be fulfilled is 9 April 2011.
The market price on the date of grant of awards 12 June 2006 was 125p, the market price on the date of vesting of awards 12 June 2009 was 121.80p.
