The Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Sharesave Scheme and the SIP on the same terms as other employees, although they did not participate in the SIP awards made to employees in 2006 and 2007.
Inmarsat 2005 Bonus Share Plan the BSP The BSP provides the means whereby a bonus award of shares can be made in addition to a participants cash bonus.
Bonus share awards generally vest in three equal tranches on the first, second and third anniversaries of the year following the date of grant.
The BSP also has the facility to enable participants to defer all or a portion of their cash bonus due into additional deferred shares.
To date, the Remuneration Committee has not exercised this and therefore no part of the annual cash bonus payments have been delivered in the form of deferred shares.
The following awards under the BSP have been made to the Executive Directors and certain members of senior management: Share award date and Monetary award date Vesting dates number of shares awarded May and September 2005 March 2006 Fully vested in March 2007, 215,542 shares awarded 2008 and 2009 March, May and September 2007 March 2008 One tranche vested in March 2009: 938,198 shares awarded further vesting in March 2010 and 2011 March 2008 March 2009 Vesting in March 2010, 2011 and 2012 807,630 shares awarded March 2009 March 2010 Vesting in March 2011, 2012 and 2013 Number of shares to be awarded not yet known New award: March 2010 March 2011: subject to achievement Vesting in March 2012, 2013 and 2014 subject of 2010 financial targets to performance conditions having been met Number of shares to be awarded not yet known The levels of bonus share award that can be earned are equivalent to 200% of the maximum annual cash bonus which may be paid and in exceptional circumstances, equivalent to 300% of the maximum annual cash bonus.
For the Chairman and Chief Executive Of cer, the maximum annual cash bonus opportunity is 125% of basic salary and for the Chief Financial Of cer, the maximum annual cash bonus opportunity is 100% of basic salary.
The Remuneration Committee will use these limits carefully and does not intend automatically to make share awards at the higher level.
If a portion of a participants cash bonus is deferred into shares under the BSP, a matching award up to the value of 50% of an individuals maximum bonus opportunity may also be made, which would vest after three years subject to the attainment of performance conditions determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Matching awards have not been made under the BSP to date.
For the bonus share award, the Remuneration Committee sets the annual performance targets in respect of the financial year relating to the award.
To date, these have been the same financial targets as those used for the annual cash bonus comprising four financial measures excluding the individual objectives.
These financial measures have been selected as they are considered to be key to driving annual operational performance.
These performance elements are also being used for the basis of the 2009 BSP award based on the 2009 Financial Results for Inmarsat Global and for Stratos, as appropriate to each individual participant.
Bonus share awards may normally be exercised according to a vesting schedule set by the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee can determine how dividends paid during the vesting period shall be awarded to participants.
For the awards made to date, dividends accrue in the form of ordinary shares which are added to the original award of shares and vest in line with the relevant award.
Share awards under the BSP were made to the Executive Directors and certain members of senior management as noted in the table above and on page 52.
The allocation of shares in respect of all awards from 2007 onwards was made based upon the mid-market closing price of the Companys ordinary shares following the announcement of the Preliminary Results for the relevant financial year.
The annual performance targets have related to revenue, operating expenditure, capital expenditure and EBITDA for Inmarsat Global, and revenue and EBITDA for Stratos for the 2009 BSP award.
It is the Remuneration Committees intention to continue to use revenue, operating expenditure, capital expenditure and EBITDA for the 2010 BSP targets, except based on the Groups performance rather than the performance of the operating businesses.
The BSP to the Executive Directors are detailed on page 52.
Inmarsat plc 47 Annual report and accounts 2009 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued Inmarsat 2005 Performance Share Plan the PSP The PSP provides for the award of shares, which vest based on corporate performance measured over a three-year period.
The PSP is intended for the participation of Executive Directors and certain members of senior management.
The maximum number of shares subject to an award to an individual in any financial year may be equal to 200% of annual basic salary as at the award date other than in exceptional circumstances, such as on recruitment or retention where larger awards of up to 300% of annual basic salary may be made.
It is not the intention of the Remuneration Committee automatically to make share awards up to the maximum levels.
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to increase the size of a participants award that vests to re ect the value of reinvested dividends that are paid during the performance period.
This may be paid as either shares or the cash equivalent.
The intention of the Remuneration Committee is to pay this in shares at the end of the three-year performance period.
