Mr N S Terrington, Mr N Keen, Mr J A Heron and Mr P Pandya were members of the Group defined benefit pension scheme during the year.

The increase in accrued pension during the year and transfer value of the increase excludes any increase for inflation.
The figures for Mr Pandya are negative as he has not accrued benefits within the plan over the year and did not receive a salary increase from 2008 to 2009.
Mr Pandya resigned from the Board of Directors and left the Group in November 2008.
This has led to the negative real increase.
The transfer value has been calculated in accordance with the Occupational Pensions Schemes Transfer Values Regulations 1996 and the Occupational Pensions Schemes Transfer Values Amendment Regulations 2008, in force from 1 October 2008.
Members of the scheme have the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions: neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.

The contributions shown are those paid or payable by the directors under the terms of the plan.
The increases in transfer values as shown in the final column reflect the change in assumptions underlying the transfer value basis as at 30 September 2009 and 30 September 2008.
As well as a change in financial conditions, the 30 September 2009 basis allows for a change in the underlying yields used to derive the discount rate, which have been updated to reflect and better match the duration of the underlying liabilities.
The transfer value at 30 September 2009 has been calculated on the basis of the Occupational Pensions Schemes Transfer Values Amendment Regulations 2008, in force from 1 October 2008.
Under the amended regulations, the trustees are responsible for the assumptions and calculation of transfer values, having taken advice from the scheme actuary.
The transfer values disclosed above do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual director.
Instead they represent a potential liability of the pension scheme.
During the year the Group made contributions in respect of further pension provision of 130,000 2008: 124,000 for Mr N S Terrington, 124,000 2008: 127,000 for Mr N Keen, 65,000 2008: 62,000 for Mr J A Heron and 7,000 2008: 49,000 for Mr P Pandya.
