When making compensation decisions, Barclays balances Barclays announced the closure of its UK final salary pension schemes to the views of these stakeholders with the need to be able to attract, retain future accrual in order to reduce current and future UK pension liability risk and incentivise talent in a competitive market.
and to ensure that our pension arrangements are sustainable and affordable A particular focus during 2009 has been to ensure that our approach to over the long term.
Details of the pension arrangements in place for discretionary pay awards for 2009 is compliant with both the Financial executive Directors are set out on page 178 and for other employees on Services Authority Remuneration Code and the Financial Stability Board page 236.
Implementation Standards, and that aggregate funding decisions balance a number of factors including the need to continue to strengthen capital ratios, to invest in the business, to recommence dividend payments and to protect the business franchise.
We are committed to the principle of pay for performance.
A key element of ensuring the link between pay and performance on an individual basis is the robust performance assessment framework operated across the Group.
Employee behaviours are considered in the context of the Guiding Principles set out above which are incorporated into our Remuneration Policy.
The extent to which employee behaviour accords with these standards is assessed as part of the performance assessment framework, which includes an examination of the employees performance from both a financial and non-financial perspective.
Performance against these areas helps to reinforce the right behaviours and so mitigate operational and reputational risks.
The resulting performance ratings have a direct impact on all individual compensation decisions.
At an aggregate level, in order to ensure that a link is maintained between pay and performance, incentive funding decisions are made by reference to a number of quantitative and qualitative measures and are determined at the discretion of the Committee.
During 2009, the role of Risk and other control functions in remuneration governance was enhanced and the process for setting the remuneration of control functions was formalised.
The exercise of informed discretion plays an important role in the assessment of performance in the context of all our remuneration decisions, rather than using a formulaic approach which could incentivise inappropriate behaviours.
Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group are taken into account by the Committee in determining the remuneration packages for executive Directors.
The general approach is the same across the Group, namely decisions are made on a total compensation basis base salary, bonus and long-term awards against the relevant market.
We seek to provide market competitive retirement and other benefits and eligible employees have the opportunity to participate in share plans.

Summaries of the principal plans are set out below.
Barclays has a number of employee benefit trusts which operate with these plans.
In some cases, the trustees grant awards and purchase shares in the market to satisfy awards as required, in others, new issue or treasury shares may be used to satisfy awards where the appropriate shareholder approval has been obtained.

Table 20: Plans under which awards made in 2009 Executive Directors Plan name eligible?
Description Performance Yes PSP is a performance related share plan under which awards of Barclays PLC shares may be made to selected Share Plan employees including executive Directors, subject to trustee discretion.
PSP The PSP trustee may select any employee of the Group to participate in the plan.
Awards are granted by the PSP trustee, in consultation with the Remuneration Committee and are communicated as provisional allocations to participants.
No right to the shares arises until the PSP trustee releases the shares.
Participants do not pay for a grant or release of an award.
Awards are normally releasable on or after the third anniversary of grant, to the extent that applicable performance conditions are satisfied, subject to trustee discretion.
Any awards released may also include an additional number of shares equivalent to any dividends that would have been paid on the shares between the date of grant and release.
Normally, the maximum expected value of an award made to an employee at the date of grant is the higher of 150% of base salary, or 75% of base salary and target bonus.
Maximum awards reflect the relevant market for each executive Director.
Awards are communicated on grant as an expected value.
This is a single value for the award at grant, which takes into account the sum of the various possible performance and vesting outcomes.
On cessation of employment, eligible leavers as defined normally receive an award pro rated for time and performance subject to trustee discretion.
For other leavers, awards will normally lapse.
On a change of control awards may vest at the PSP trustees discretion and may be pro rated for time and performance to the date of change of control.
PSP is not an HMRC approved plan.
The plan was approved for a ten year period by shareholders in April 2005.
Executive Share Yes ESAS is a deferred share award plan operated in conjunction with various Group bonus plans for selected employees Award Scheme including executive Directors, subject to trustee discretion.
ESAS Awards are granted by the ESAS trustee having first consulted with the Remuneration Committee.
For certain eligible employees a proportion of discretionary annual bonus is delivered in cash and a proportion is as a recommended mandatory provisional allocation of Barclays PLC shares under ESAS.
The mandatory provisional allocation will normally include bonus shares equal to 30% of the value of the deferred bonus amount awarded in shares.
Under mandatory ESAS awards, nil cost options are typically granted three years from award, subject to the discretion of the ESAS trustee.
Participants may then call for the shares plus two thirds of the bonus shares and any associated dividend shares.
If the nil cost option is not exercised by the end of the two year period, the ESAS trustee may release all shares, bonus shares and any dividend shares to the participant.
In addition to mandatory ESAS, participants may also request to waive any bonus or part of a bonus to which they may become entitled and request that a voluntary ESAS award be made to them in the form of a nil cost option.
Voluntary ESAS awards are typically fully exercisable after five years, and include bonus shares equal to 30% of the waived bonus amount.
Dividend shares may be awarded, as per mandatory ESAS awards.
On cessation of employment, a participant may forfeit an award depending on the reason for leaving.
Special provisions apply on a change of control.
ESAS is also used to make certain awards to facilitate the retention and recruitment of new joiners to the Group who have forfeited share awards on leaving previous employment.
Typically bonus shares are not awarded, though dividend shares may be awarded, as per mandatory ESAS awards.
ESAS is not an HMRC approved plan.
Incentive shares No Incentive shares are discretionary share awards that may be made to selected employees excluding executive Directors, subject to trustee discretion.
Shares are normally released after three years, subject to continued employment and the discretion of the trustee.
Dividends received are normally awarded as additional shares and released at the same time.
On cessation of employment eligible leavers as defined normally receive an award pro rated for time in employment, subject to the discretion of the trustee: for other leavers, awards will normally lapse.
On a change of control awards may vest, pro rated for time to the date of change of control, subject to the discretion of the trustee.
Incentive shares is not an HMRC approved plan.

Description Long Term No The LTCP is a forward-looking plan introduced for 2009, under which conditional awards of cash are made to Cash Plan eligible employees excluding executive Directors.
LTCP Awards are released in portions over a period of time two years for 2009 awards, subject to continued employment.
At the time of the final release, for 2009 awards, a service credit 10% of the initial value of the award is added.
Participants must normally be in employment at the time of release in order to receive each portion of the payment.
Participants who leave employment before the release date of any portion of the award will normally forfeit any outstanding amounts.
For categories of eligible leavers an award will vest, pro rated for time in service.
On a change of control awards may vest at the discretion of the Committee.
Sharesave Yes Sharesave was approved for a ten-year period in 2000 and is due to expire at the end of 2010.
Shareholder approval will be sought at the AGM to establish a replacement scheme on substantially the same terms.
Sharesave is a share option plan under which all eligible employees in the UK, Ireland and Spain including executive Directors are invited to participate.
It is HMRC approved in the UK and approved by the Revenue Commissioners in Ireland.
Participants are granted options over Barclays PLC shares which may be at a discount to the market value at the date of award currently 20%.
At the expiry of a fixed term three, five or seven years participants may use savings to acquire the shares by exercising their option within 6 months of the date of vesting.
Participants may save up to 250 per month 500 in Ireland, 135 in Spain for this purpose.
On cessation of employment eligible leavers as defined may exercise their option to acquire shares to the extent of their savings for a period of 6 months.
On a change of control, participants may be able to exercise their options to acquire shares to the extent of their savings for a period of 6 months or a shorter period in certain circumstances.
Sharepurchase Yes Sharepurchase is an HMRC approved share incentive plan under which all employees in the UK including executive Directors are invited to participate.
Participants may purchase up to 1,500 of shares each tax year.
To encourage employee share ownership, Barclays matches the first 600 of shares purchased by participants on a one-for-one basis.
Dividends are also earned in the form of additional shares.
Purchased shares may be withdrawn from the plan at any time.
Matching and dividend shares must be held in trust for three years before release, but may be kept in trust for five years.
On cessation of employment participants must withdraw all shares and depending on the reason for and timing of cessation, the matching shares may be forfeited.
On a change of control, participants are able to instruct the Sharepurchase trustee how to act or vote on their behalf.
The plan was approved by shareholders in April 2000.
Global Yes Global Sharepurchase is an extension of the Sharepurchase plan that is offered to employees in the UK.
Sharepurchase When the Sharepurchase plan was approved by shareholders in April 2000, the approval included the option of extending the plan to other jurisdictions.
Employees in certain jurisdictions are invited under the terms of the Global Sharepurchase plan to purchase shares in Barclays PLC, which attract a matching share award awarded by Barclays up to a cap and associated dividend shares.
Global Sharepurchase operates in substantially the same way as Sharepurchase.
