DIRectoRs RemuneRatIon RePoRt This report has been prepared in accordance with the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Although it is not a requirement of Jersey company law to have the Directors Remuneration Report approved by shareholders, the Board believes that as a Company whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange that it is important in terms of its corporate governance for it to do so.
Accordingly a resolution to approve this Report will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
This report has been divided into separate sections for: 1 Information which is unaudited: and 2 Information on which the Companys auditors have reported as having been properly prepared.
unaudited Information Remuneration Committee The Committee is responsible to the Board for formulating and recommending to the Board remuneration policy and strategy for the Executive Directors.
The Committee also reviews individual remuneration packages of the Executive Directors, including terms and conditions of employment and any changes.
The Committee also reviews the general remuneration framework for the senior management of the Group and approves the operation of any Group share-based incentive schemes, including any Long-term Incentive Plans LTIPs.
The Committees terms of reference are available on the Group website.
The membership of the Remuneration Committee during 2009 was as follows: Period of membership 2009 P Kirby Chairman of Committee 1 Jan 31 Dec S Watson 1 Jan 8 May B ONeill 1 Jan 31 Dec J Davis 27 Apr 31 Dec The Chairman, Derek Mapp, usually attends the meetings by invitation but is not present when matters relating to his own remuneration are discussed.
The number of meetings of the Committee during 2009 and individual attendance by its members are shown on page 41.
None of the members who served on the Committee during the year had any personal financial interest other than as a shareholder of the Company, conflicts of interests arising from crossdirectorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board.
The principal activities carried out by the Committee during 2009 were: determination of Non-Executive Chairmans and Executive Directors remuneration: determination of the Executive Directors bonuses and bonus targets for 2009 and 2010: LTIP awards: determination of performance conditions, vesting of the 2006 grant to Executive Directors and new awards for both Executive Directors and senior management: consideration and approval of the Remuneration Report for the 2008 Annual Report: monitoring of senior management remuneration: approving Rights Issue adjustments for share awards: consideration of the Group Defined Benefit Pension Scheme: and consideration of the effect of the scheme of arrangement the Scheme on employee share plans and approval of successor plans in the Company from those operating within Old Informa.
Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 45 the Year in Review DIRectoRs RemuneRatIon RePoRt continued In determining the Executive Directors remuneration the Committee consulted the Chairman about its proposals: no Executive Director played a part in any decision about his or her own remuneration.
The Committee also engaged independent remuneration consultants Hewitt New Bridge Street Hewitt to provide advice on the structure and operation of Directors remuneration packages and the Companys share incentive arrangements.
Hewitt were appointed by the Committee and do not provide any other material services to the Group.
The Company Secretary, John Burton, also provided assistance to the Committee during the year.
Remuneration Policy The remuneration of the Executive Directors is designed to provide for a competitive compensation package which reflects the Groups performance against financial objectives and personal performance criteria.
It rewards above-average performance and is designed to attract, motivate and retain high-calibre executives.
The performance measurement of the Executive Directors and the determination of their annual remuneration packages are undertaken by the Committee.
There are five elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors as follows: basic annual salary: benefits: annual bonus: share incentives: and retirement and life assurance benefits.
The Companys policy is that a clear majority of the maximum potential remuneration of the Executive Directors should be performance-related.
As described further below, Executive Directors may earn an annual bonus and benefit from participation in a performance-based LTIP.
For 2009, 80% of the maximum bonus payable to the Executive Directors was based on EPS performance and for 2010 is entirely based on EPS performance.
Vesting of LTIP awards granted prior to 2009 have been conditional upon EPS growth and subject to a total shareholder return TSR underpin.
LTIP awards granted after 2008 are subject solely to TSR performance as noted below.
The Remuneration Committee is able to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues when setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
In its judgment the remuneration policies for both Executive Directors and senior management do not raise environmental, social or governance operational risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside of the Company provided that the Chairman determines that it is appropriate.
During 2009 Peter Rigby served as Non-Executive Chairman of Electric Word plc, for which he received and retained fees of 12,000.
Basic Salary The basic salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee prior to the beginning of each year and upon a change of position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers pay practices in the Group as a whole and makes reference to objective research which gives current information on appropriate comparator groups of companies.
A review of the salaries of the Executive Directors was undertaken at the end of 2009 with the assistance of Hewitt.
It included a comparison of benchmark data from two comparator groups of companies, one drawn from the FTSE All Share Media Index, of which the Company is a constituent member, and the other drawn from the FTSE All Share Index which comprised companies of a broadly similar size to Informa in terms of market capitalisation, turnover and overseas operations.
Following its review, the Remuneration Committee concluded that it was appropriate reflecting widespread salary freezes across the Group to maintain the annual basic salaries of the Executive Directors for the 2010 financial year at the same rates that were set in the Spring of 2008: 46 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 P Rigby 700,000 A Walker 425,000 Benefits Each of the Executive Directors receives a benefit allowance of 25,000 per annum together with private medical insurance cover and permanent health insurance cover.
Annual Bonus The Remuneration Committee the Committee continues to consider adjusted diluted EPS to be the most suitable financial measurement to determine performance and align the interests of the Executive Directors with those of the Companys shareholders for the purpose of determination of bonuses as this measurement of performance can be directly influenced by the performance of the Executive Directors and is a key driver in generating returns to shareholders.
The Committee retains a discretion to look at other appropriate benchmarks.
Accordingly, for 2009 it set an award of up to 20% of basic salary for the achievement of personal goals relating to the effective management of the Groups financial position which were set with the aim of protecting and enhancing shareholder value.
In addition, a bonus of up to 80% of basic salary was dependent upon achievement of a sliding scale of challenging diluted adjusted EPS targets which were set at levels to encourage and reward the delivery of excellent levels of performance.
For 2009, the Committee determined that the personal goals had been met in full and accordingly an award of 20% of basic salary is payable to the Executive Directors.
Applying the sliding scale formula, a bonus of 83.6% of basic salary was awarded to each of Mr Rigby and Mr Walker for the 2009 financial year, reflecting a year of resilient financial performance.
For 2010, the Committee has resolved to revert to a structure of the bonus opportunity being solely based on EPS targets.
In addition, for 2010 it has extended the maximum award available from 100% of basic salary in 2009 to 125% of basic salary in 2010.
However, in relation to this additional potential 25% bonus: 1 more stretching targets have been applied for its achievement: and 2 this additional award may only take the form of a conditional award of shares in the Company which will vest only if the Director remains in employment throughout the deferral period, subject to good leaver provisions.
The number of shares awarded will be determined by reference to the market value of the shares at the date concurrent awards under the LTIP are made.
Shares utilised for this purpose will be acquired by market purchase: newly issued shares will not be used.
long-Term incentive Plan From 2006 Executive Directors have been invited to participate in the Companys LTIP, which had been introduced and approved by shareholders in 2005.
The first grant of awards to Executive Directors under the LTIP was made in March 2006 and they were given the alternative of: a maximum award of 100% of basic salary in the Companys shares, provided they are prepared to sacrifice 5% of that years basic salary: or a maximum award of 50% of basic salary in the Companys shares, with no salary sacrifice required.
Mr Rigby, being the only Executive Director at that time who remains in office, opted for the maximum award with a 5% sacrifice in basic salary.
Two further grants of awards were made in April 2007 and April 2008 on the same basis and Mr Rigby again opted for the maximum award with a 5% sacrifice in basic salary as did Mr Walker in April 2008, his first year in office.
Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 47 the Year in Review DIRectoRs RemuneRatIon RePoRt continued The 2006 award made to Mr Rigby vested in full on 1 May 2009: further details can be found on page 53.
The awards made to Mr Rigby in 2007 and to the Executive Directors in 2008 under the LTIP vest subject to continued employment over a three year performance period, including the year of award, and the satisfaction of performance conditions which require both that: the Companys TSR is at least at the median compared to the companies constituting, at grant, the FTSE All Share Media Index: and the Companys average adjusted diluted EPS grows by at least RPI plus 5% per annum for 20% of the award to vest increasing to RPI plus 12% per annum for 100% of the award to vest, thereby encouraging Executive Directors to deliver above market returns to shareholders while also delivering strong financial performance.
The following revised arrangements for the LTIP were approved by shareholders at the AGM on 8 May 2009: 1. the above performance conditions will no longer apply and instead the following TSR performance conditions will be used: one half of the shares under an award will vest based on the Companys TSR performance ranked against the TSR performance of the constituents of the FTSE 350 index excluding investment trusts.
This half of an award shall vest at 20% at median ranking and 100% at upper quintile ranking.
Any ranking below median results in none of the award vesting: and one half of the shares under an award will vest based on the Companys TSR performance ranked against the TSR performance of the constituents of the FTSE All Share Media Index.
This half of an award will vest 20% at median ranking and 100% at upper quintile ranking.
Any ranking below median results in none of the award vesting: 2 the maximum award has been increased to 200% of basic salary: and 3 no salary sacrifice element will apply.
Awards were made to the Executive Directors in 2009 of 150% of basic salary and it is intended that the same size of award be made to the Executive Directors in 2010.
The shares awarded to participants of the LTIP grants are satisfied through the Informa Group Employee Share Trust the EST, currently administered by Nautilus Trust Company Limited in Jersey.
The current intention is to use existing issued shares held in the EST for the vesting of the 2007 LTIP grant to Mr Rigby.
All-Employee Share Plans From January 2006 the Executive Directors, along with all other UK employees, were eligible to participate in the Companys Share Incentive Plan SIP, introduced and approved by shareholders in 2005.
The SIP is an Inland Revenue Approved All-Employee Share Incentive Plan which offers UK employees the opportunity to purchase up to 1,500 of shares in the Company per year out of pre-tax salary.
All members of the SIP were invited to participate in the Rights Issue on 27 May 2009 and documentation was sent to participants on 8 May 2009.
SIP participants who participated in the Rights Issue received shares separate to their holding in the SIP, equal to the value of their rights at the price of 150 pence per share.
The rights of those participants who chose not to take part in the Rights Issue were sold and sale proceeds were distributed amongst the participants.
At a meeting of the Company held on 2 June 2009, a new Share Incentive Plan new SIP was approved by shareholders for its adoption pursuant to the Scheme becoming effective on 30 June 2009.
The terms of the new SIP are the same in all material respects as the pre-existing SIP in Old Informa.
The new SIP was approved by the Inland Revenue on 6 July 2009.
Eligible employees were invited to join the new SIP and can also join on an ongoing basis provided they have completed six months service with the Company.
The Company introduced a US Stock Purchase Plan SPP in 2008 which was approved by shareholders at the AGM in May 2008.
Eligible employees are invited to join the SPP on an ongoing basis once they have completed six months 48 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 service with the Company.
The SPP provides a means by which the Groups US employees may purchase the Companys shares at a 15% discount to the market price.
No tax benefit is available under the SPP.
Eligible US employees can purchase up to $2,940 of shares per year out of post-tax salary.
As US shareholders were not entitled to participate in the Rights Issue, the trustee of the SPP arranged for the automatic sale of the rights of participants in the SPP at the end of the Rights Issue period in the same way as US shareholders, and, accordingly the proceeds of the sale were paid to participants.
Shares in Old Informa held in the SPP at the time of the Scheme becoming effective were exchanged for shares in the Company: accordingly no new SPP was introduced at this date.
Share Options Prior to their merger in May 2004, both Informa and Taylor & Francis operated discretionary share option schemes for the benefit of the Executive Directors.
In the light of changes to the accounting treatment for share options and changing market practice, the Remuneration Committee decided in 2005 no longer to grant options to Executive Directors.
Details of subsisting options granted to the Executive Directors in 2004 and earlier are shown on page 52.
Existing grants were amended for the Rights Issue on 27 May 2009 and rolled over from Old Informa to the Company pursuant to the Scheme becoming effective.
Share Ownership guidelines During early 2006 the Remuneration Committee introduced formal share ownership guidelines requiring the Executive Directors to build up, over a three year period and with pre-existing shareholdings taken into account, a holding in the Companys shares equal to at least one and a half times annual basic salary.
Retirement and life Assurance Benefits The Executive Directors are entitled to receive a contribution of 25% of basic salary toward their retirement arrangements.
The Company also provides life assurance cover providing for the payment of a lump sum in the event of the insureds death in service.
Since Peter Rigby is neither an active member of any Group pension scheme nor is eligible to make further tax efficient pension contributions, instead the Company pays to him a monthly payment in lieu of pension contributions equal to 25% of basic salary after deducting the incremental National Insurance costs to the Company.
Further details of these entitlements are shown on page 53 to 54.
Performance graph The graph below shows the Companys performance, measured by TSR, compared with the performance of the FTSE All Share Media Index, also measured by TSR, in the five-year period ended 31 December 2009.
The FTSE All Share Media Index has been selected for this comparison because the Company is a constituent company of that index.

On 24 June 2009 the Executive Directors entered into new agreements with Informa, the new holding company, in respect of their duties and responsibilities as Directors of that company.
The existing service contracts of the Executive Directors were amended on 24 June 2009 to reflect this additional appointment but otherwise the terms of their original agreements were unaffected.
In the event of early termination, their contracts provide for compensation equal to basic salary, benefits allowance and retirement benefit and in the case of Peter Rigby only, bonus for the notice period.
Pursuant to the terms on which he joined the Group, Adam Walker was awarded a restricted award of 93,269 shares on 7 April 2008.
This award was increased to 117,422 shares following the taking up in full by Mr Walker of his rights in the Rights Issue on 27 May 2009 and will vest in full on 7 April 2010.
Other than in respect of Mr Walkers share award described above, there are no specific terms in relation to the service contracts concerning termination following a change of control or any special rules concerning equity awards following termination: the Executive Directors are subject to the same rules and awards under share schemes following a termination of employment as for all other participants of the relevant schemes.
Each of the Non-Executive Directors has specific terms of appointment, terminable by three months notice.
The dates of the Directors original contracts are shown in the table below, although the contracts have been amended from time to time by letter agreement as required to reflect changes to, for example, salary or fee levels.

However the terms of the contracts remain the same.
The contracts, which include details of remuneration, are available for inspection at the registered office and will be available for inspection at the AGM.

Directors Pension Entitlements The following information is given to comply with the requirements of the Listing Rules of the FSA, which differ in some respects from the equivalent statutory requirements: There were no increases during the year of accrued pension excluding inflation.
Any transfer values disclosed under the Listing Rules requirements do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual Director: instead they represent a potential liability of the pension scheme.
Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2009 53 the Year in Review DIRectoRs RemuneRatIon RePoRt continued Contributions paid by the Group directly to Directors or their nominated retirement investment vehicles in respect of their retirement benefit entitlements were as follows: 2009 2008 000 000 D Gilbertson 30 2 P Rigby 740 151 A Walker 106 81 David Gilbertson left the Group on 20 March 2008.
2 The Committee has resolved not to make a bonus payment to Mr Rigby for 2009.
Instead, the Committee has decided to make a contribution of 585,200 the Contribution Amount to the Informa Group 2010 Employer-Financed Retirement Benefits Scheme EFRBS, where it will be invested to provide retirement and or death benefits to Mr Rigby.
As this contribution will not be immediately and fully deductible for corporation tax purposes, the Committee has decided to make the contribution in two stages in order to have a neutral effect on the Groups cashflow, when compared with the payment of a bonus.
The first payment of 475,276 representing 81.216% of the Contribution Amount was paid to the EFRBS in March 2010 and the balance of the Contribution Amount will be paid to the EFRBS in the year in which Mr Rigby draws down his benefits under the EFRBS.
This remuneration report records both payments being made to Mr Rigby in respect of the 2009 financial year, irrespective of the timing of these payments.
