62 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with Regulation 11 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 the Regulations.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
The auditors are required to report to the Companys members on the auditable parts of the report and to state whether, in their opinion, those parts have been properly prepared in accordance with the Regulations and the Companies Act 2006.
In light of this requirement, and in order to present the information in a form that is as accessible as possible to shareholders, the report has been split into a number of separate sections.
The heading of each section indicates whether it is audited or unaudited.
Overview of the Remuneration Committee and its Policies unaudited Purpose and Structure of the Remuneration Committee The remuneration committee determines and agrees with the Board the overall remuneration policy for the executive directors and the members of the CEC.
The remuneration committee also determines, within the terms of the agreed policy and having consulted with the Chief Executive about their proposals, specific remuneration packages for each of the executive directors, including pension rights and any compensation payments to be paid on termination.
Reference is made to page 55 of the Corporate Governance Statement, where there is a further summary of the role of the remuneration committee.
Cairns remuneration committee operates within terms of reference set by the Board.
These are reviewed periodically to ensure that the remuneration committee remains up to date with best practices appropriate to Cairn, its strategy and the business environment in which it operates.
The terms of reference are available on the Companys website.
The members of the remuneration committee during the year were as follows: t Dr Jim Buckee joined the committee on 15 January 2009 and became chairman on 19 May 2009 : t Mark Tyndall: t Todd Hunt: t Norman Murray joined the committee on 19 May 2009 : t Ed Story resigned from the committee on 15 January 2009 : and t Hamish Grossart resigned as chairman and member of the committee on 19 May 2009.
The Chief Executive is not a member of the remuneration committee but may attend its meetings by invitation and is consulted in respect of certain of its proposals although the Chief Executive is not consulted or involved in any discussions in respect of his own remuneration.
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee As and when the remuneration committee deems appropriate, it takes external advice on remuneration from a number of sources.
During the year it consulted with Hewitt New Bridge Street an independent executive compensation consultancy appointed by the committee on various aspects of the directors remuneration packages.
The Companys legal advisers, Shepherd and Wedderburn LLP and auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, also provided assistance to the committee in respect of the Companys share option schemes and long-term incentive plans.
Advice obtained from Ernst & Young LLP is purely in relation to their independent verification of the Companys achievement against performance conditions applicable to the Companys share option schemes and long-term incentive plans.
Remuneration Policy Overview Cairns policy on executive directors remuneration for the current year and subsequent financial years is that the overall remuneration package should be sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate high-quality individuals capable of achieving the Groups objectives and thereby enhance shareholder value.
The package is generally weighted more towards variable pay and, in relation to the variable pay element, the package is weighted more towards long-term performance.
In designing the remuneration structures of the executive directors, the committee takes into account pay policies within the Group as a whole.
Each executive directors remuneration package currently consists of basic salary, benefits, annual performance related bonuses, a long-term incentive plan, a defined contribution pension if appropriate and life assurance of four times basic annual salary.
The package is designed to support the Groups business strategy and to provide an appropriate incentive to maximise individual and corporate performance, whilst ensuring that overall rewards are market competitive.
Explanation of the Components of Executive Directors Remuneration unaudited Basic Salary and Benefits Basic salary is reviewed annually by the remuneration committee and any changes take effect from 1 January each year.
In deciding appropriate levels, the committee utilises objective benchmarking which gives up-to-date information on remuneration practice within a comparator group of similar companies within the sector.
OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009 63 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Continued For the year 2009 the basic salaries of the executive directors were frozen at 2008 levels, being 552,000 for Sir Bill Gammell, 402,500 for Dr Mike Watts and 345,000 for each of Malcolm Thoms, Phil Tracy, Jann Brown and Simon Thomson.
Following a detailed benchmarking review carried out by Hewitt New Bridge Street consultants in early 2010, the executive directors salaries for the year 2010 have been increased to 600,000 for Sir Bill Gammell, 420,000 for Dr Mike Watts and 360,000 for each of Malcolm Thoms, Phil Tracy, Jann Brown and Simon Thomson.
Benefits available to the executive directors comprise a company car, permanent health insurance, private health insurance and death in service benefit.
Further details of the salary and benefits of each of the executive directors are set out in the remuneration table on page 70.
Annual Cash Bonus Scheme Cairns annual cash bonus scheme applies to all employees and executive directors.
Bonuses under the scheme are based on individual and Company performance measures.
Individual performance is measured through the Companys performance management system.
Company performance measures are based on annually defined key performance indicators KPIs.
The KPIs for 2009 encompassed various portfolio growth and operational performance targets, the substantial majority of which were met.
For employees other than executive directors, only the individual and Company performance measures determine the overall bonus award.
The bonus award to the executive directors is subject to two additional performance measures, being performance against annually defined corporate objectives and reserve replacement performance.
For 2009, this resulted in one-quarter of each executive directors award being determined by individual performance, one quarter by Company performance, one quarter by performance against corporate objectives and one quarter by reserve replacement performance.
The corporate objectives for 2009 are commercially sensitive and are therefore excluded from this report, as are the 2010 corporate objectives.
The choice of these measures, and their respective weightings, reflects the committees belief that any short-term incentive compensation should be tied both to the overall performance of the Company and to those areas of its business that each individual can directly influence.
The maximum level of bonus award for the executive directors and other senior executives for 2009 was up to 100% of salary.
The actual bonuses awarded to the executive directors for performance in 2009 are shown in the remuneration table on page 70.
The bonus cap for all other employees for 2009 was between 25% and 40%.
The maximum bonus potentials for 2010 are currently under review.
The remuneration committee has the discretion to award bonuses in addition to those payable under the annual cash bonus scheme in recognition of particular efforts or achievements by employees, including executive directors.
No bonuses of this kind were awarded to executive directors during 2009.
A similar structure will operate in 2010.
Long-term Incentives Introduction In order to encourage executive directors and other selected senior employees to deliver superior levels of long-term performance for the benefit of shareholders, the Companys policy since 1999 has been to provide these individuals with share incentives under a long-term incentive plan.
The current arrangement is the Cairn Energy PLC Long Term Incentive Plan 2009 2009 LTIP, which was approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 19 May 2009.
During the year, executive directors also held outstanding awards under the following historic share incentive arrangements operated by the Company: t The Cairn Energy PLC Long Term Incentive Plan 2006 2006 LTIP : and t The Cairn Energy PLC Long Term Incentive Plan 2002 2002 LTIP.
At the Companys EGM held on 21 December 2009 shareholder approval was received for the conversion of certain awards previously made under the 2006 LTIP into replacement rights over ordinary shares, such replacement rights to be granted pursuant to The Cairn Energy PLC Replacement Long Term Incentive Plan Replacement LTIP.
Summaries of the 2009 LTIP, 2006 LTIP and 2002 LTIP are provided below, together with additional details relating to the grant of awards under the Replacement LTIP.
2009 LTIP The 2009 LTIP enables executive directors and selected senior employees excluding those employed by the Cairn India Group to be granted conditional awards over ordinary shares, the vesting of which is normally dependent on both continued employment with the Group and the extent to which pre-determined performance conditions are met over a specified period of three years.
The scheme is intended to incentivise the participants to create shareholder value whilst retaining due focus on the underlying financial performance of the Group and to align their interests more closely with those of shareholders.
64 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Continued The value of ordinary shares awarded to a participant under the 2009 LTIP in any financial year is subject to a limit of 300% of his her basic salary although a 400% of salary limit can be applied to an individual by the remuneration committee in exceptional circumstances.
On the vesting of an award under the 2009 LTIP, only 50% of the ordinary shares to which the holder has become entitled are released to him her immediately, with the remaining 50% normally being released after a further period of one year.
No amounts due under the 2009 LTIP are recognised as remuneration until the award has vested and the ordinary shares released.
The first awards under the 2009 LTIP were made on 29 May 2009 to the executive directors and a selection of the Companys senior managers.
Details of the awards granted to the executive directors are set out on page 71.
Pages 73 and 74 contains a summary of the performance conditions that will determine the extent to which the above awards vest at the end of the applicable performance period.
For awards made in future years, the remuneration committee will review, and may amend, the performance conditions used for this arrangement in order to ensure they remain appropriate, challenging and in line with best practice investor guidelines.
2006 LTIP The 2006 LTIP was approved by shareholders at the EGM held on 17 November 2006, conditional on the flotation of Cairn India becoming effective, which occurred on 9 January 2007.
Following the adoption of the 2009 LTIP, no further awards have been or will be granted under the 2006 LTIP.
The date of grant of the last award under the 2006 LTIP was 7 July 2008.
The 2006 LTIP enabled executive directors and selected senior employees to be granted conditional awards over two separate pools of notional units, the first relating to Cairn India Cairn India Units and the second relating to the Capricorn Group Capricorn Units together, Units.
During the year, and as fully explained in the circulars to shareholders dated 22 April 2009 and 3 December 2009, the remuneration committee identified significant issues in relation to one aspect of the 2006 LTIPs operation, namely the mechanism for valuing Capricorn Units.
In light of these issues it was decided that: t no further awards whether over Capricorn Units or Cairn India Units would be granted under the 2006 LTIP: t all future share incentive awards made to the Companys senior management team including its executive directors would be granted under the 2009 LTIP: t participants in the 2006 LTIP who held awards over Capricorn Units Capricorn Awards would be invited to surrender those rights in exchange for the grant of Converted Awards over ordinary shares in the Company pursuant to the Replacement LTIP: and t the number of ordinary shares subject to each Converted Award would be calculated by reference to an implied valuation of the Capricorn Group derived from the farm-in to its Greenland assets by PETRONAS.
All participants in the 2006 LTIP subsequently accepted the conversion invitation described above and were granted Converted Awards on 22 December 2009 pursuant to the Replacement LTIP.
As a result, there are no outstanding Capricorn Awards under the 2006 LTIP.
Each of the executive directors and a number of other senior managers does, however, continue to hold awards over Cairn India Units Cairn India Awards.
These awards are unaffected by the issues described above and continue to subsist on their original terms.
The extent to which a Cairn India Award vests is dependent on continued employment within the Group and the extent to which pre-determined performance conditions relating to Cairn India are met over a specified period.
Following the vesting of a Cairn India Award, the participant will then become entitled to such number of ordinary shares in the Company as have a market value equal to the aggregate price of the vested Units.
For the purposes of the 2006 LTIP, the price of a Cairn India Unit on any day is equal to the price of a Cairn India share, as quoted on the BSE and the NSE of India.
Only 50% of these ordinary shares will be transferred to the participant immediately.
The remaining 50% will normally be held for a further year.
Details of the outstanding Cairn India Awards held by executive directors are set out on page 71.
A summary of the performance conditions that will determine the extent to which these awards vest at the end of the applicable performance period is provided on page 74 and 75.
Replacement LTIP The Replacement LTIP was approved by shareholders at the EGM on 21 December 2009 and, as explained above, has been used to grant Converted Awards over ordinary shares to those participants in the 2006 LTIP who accepted the invitation to surrender their Capricorn Awards.
These Converted Awards were granted on 22 December 2009.
Converted Awards comprise conditional rights to acquire ordinary shares, the vesting of which is normally dependent on both continued employment with the Group and the extent to which pre-determined performance conditions are met over a specified period of three years.
The form of these performance conditions, and the period over which they are measured, is intended to mirror those that applied to the Capricorn Awards that have been replaced.
OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009 65 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Continued On the vesting of a Converted Award, any ordinary shares to which the holder becomes entitled will normally be subject to an extended holding period during which they cannot be sold save to meet tax liabilities arising on vesting.
This period will generally last until 9 January 2013.
Where a participant ceases employment with the Group during this holding period, his her unreleased ordinary shares will normally be forfeit for no consideration.
Exceptions to this general forfeiture principle will be at the remuneration committees discretion but will usually be limited to good leaver circumstances.
In addition, if prior to the end of the holding period, events occur which cause the remuneration committee to consider that the implied value of the Capricorn Group used as part of the conversion process see above was materially overstated as at the date on which the conversion took place, then a proportion of a participants unreleased ordinary shares may be forfeited for no consideration.
In these circumstances, the number of ordinary shares to be forfeited will be decided by the remuneration committee on such fair and equitable basis as it may determine at the relevant time.
Details of the outstanding Converted Awards held by executive directors are set out on page 72.
A summary of the performance conditions that will determine the extent to which these awards vest at the end of the applicable performance period is provided on pages 75 and 76.
No further awards will be granted pursuant to the Replacement LTIP in the future.
2002 LTIP The 2002 LTIP was superseded by the 2006 LTIP, further details of which are set out above.
The date of grant of the last award under the 2002 LTIP was 24 April 2006.
Under the 2002 LTIP, participants have been granted Tier One and Tier Two awards.
A Tier One award is a conditional award over ordinary shares, the vesting of which is normally dependent on both continued employment with the Group and the extent to which pre-determined performance conditions are met over a specified performance period of three years.
A Tier Two award is a share appreciation right over a number of notional Cairn shares.
The maximum potential benefit a participant may receive under a Tier Two award is calculated by comparing the increase in Cairns share price over the performance period with the change in the average share price of a comparator group of companies over the same period.
The increase in Cairns share price if any over the rise or fall in the average share price of the comparator group over the performance period is then multiplied by the number of notional shares that are the subject of the award.
This gives rise to a monetary figure which is then converted into an actual number of Cairn shares using the market value as at the date of vesting.
Where there has been a fall in Cairns Total Shareholder Return TSR over the period, no Tier Two award will vest.
The extent to which a Tier Two award then vests is determined by reference to a further performance condition.
On the vesting of a Tier One or Tier Two award under the 2002 LTIP, only 50% of the ordinary shares to which the holder has become entitled are released to him her immediately, with the remaining 50% normally being released after a further period of one year.
Details of the Tier One and Tier Two awards held by executive directors during the year being the final set of awards granted under this arrangement are set out on page 73.
A summary of the performance conditions that were used to determine the extent to which these awards vested at the end of the applicable performance period is provided on page 76.
Pension Arrangements The Company operates a defined contribution group personal pension plan in the UK.
The scheme is non-contributory and all UK permanent employees are eligible to participate.
The Company contributes 10% of basic annual salary 15% in respect of senior executives on behalf of all qualifying employees.
Dr Mike Watts and Jann Brown are members of the Company plan and, during the year, both received a contribution equal to 15% of their respective annual basic salaries.
Simon Thomson and Malcolm Thoms both have an individual personal pension plan and, during the year, received a contribution from the Company equal to 15% of their respective annual basic salaries.
During the year, Sir Bill Gammell and Phil Tracy both received an amount equivalent to 15% of their respective annual basic salaries in the form of additional salary, as their pension arrangements are fully funded.
Further details of the contributions made by the Company in respect of each executive director are set out in the remuneration table on page 70.
The Company is also the principal employer for a Small Self-Administered Scheme.
Sir Bill Gammell is the sole member of this scheme.
The Company is not contractually obliged to make any contributions into this scheme on behalf of Sir Bill Gammell and did not do so during the year.
66 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Continued Share Option Schemes for Other Employees unaudited Introduction The Company currently operates the following share option schemes for employees below senior executive level.
t 2009 Approved Share Option Plan 2009 Approved Option Plan t 2009 Unapproved Share Option Plan 2009 Unapproved Option Plan t Replacement Share Option Plan Replacement Option Plan t 2003 Approved Share Option Plan 2003 Option Plan t 2002 Unapproved Share Option Plan 2002 Option Plan t 1996 Second Share Option Scheme 1996 Option Scheme Brief summaries of these arrangements are set out below.
It should, however, be noted that none of the Companys executive directors participate in any of the above schemes and it is not intended that options will be granted to them under these arrangements in the future.
2009 Approved Option Plan and 2009 Unapproved Option Plan The 2009 Approved Option Plan and the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan, both of which were approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 19 May 2009, are used to grant market value options to less senior employees of the Group excluding those employed by the Cairn India Group.
The principal difference between these two arrangements is that the approval of HM Revenue & Customs was sought and obtained for the 2009 Approved Option Plan, whereas no such approval was sought in relation to the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan.
Options granted under the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan and 2009 Approved Option Plan are normally exercisable between three and 10 years following their grant but only if and to the extent that specified performance conditions have been satisfied.
The value of ordinary shares over which options may be granted to a participant under the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan and 2009 Approved Option Plan in any financial year is subject to a limit of 200% of his her basic salary although a 300% of salary limit can be applied to an individual by the remuneration committee in exceptional circumstances.
The first options under the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan and 2009 Approved Option Plan were granted on 29 May 2009.
A summary of the performance conditions that will determine the extent to which these options vest at the end of the applicable performance period is provided on page 77.
Replacement Option Plan The Replacement Option Plan, which was approved by shareholders at the EGM on 21 December 2009, was introduced to facilitate the conversion of certain options that had previously been granted by the Company under The Cairn Energy PLC Share Option Plan 2006 2006 Plan.
The 2006 Plan was established by the Company at the same time as the 2006 LTIP described above.
It was designed to enable selected employees to be granted options over Capricorn Units i. e. notional units of value relating to the Capricorn Group.
During the year, and as fully explained in the circulars to shareholders dated 22 April 2009 and 3 December 2009, the remuneration committee identified significant issues in relation to the Capricorn Unit valuation mechanism that was contained within the rules of the 2006 Plan.
In light of these issues it was decided that: t no further options would be granted under the 2006 Plan: t participants in the 2006 Plan who held options over Capricorn Units would be invited to surrender those rights in exchange for the grant of Converted Options over ordinary shares in the Company pursuant to the Replacement Option Plan: and t the detailed provisions of the Converted Options i. e. the number of ordinary shares over which they subsist, the exercise price per ordinary share, the vesting period, etc would effectively seek to put participants in the same position as they would have been in if, on the date they were originally granted their 2006 Plan options over Capricorn Units, they had instead been granted awards on equivalent terms over ordinary shares in the Company.
All participants in the 2006 Plan subsequently accepted the conversion invitation described above and were granted their Converted Options on 22 December 2009 pursuant to the Replacement Option Plan.
As a result, there are no outstanding options over Capricorn Units under the 2006 Plan.
Converted Options granted under the Replacement Option Plan comprise conditional rights to acquire ordinary shares for a specified price, the vesting of which is normally dependent on both continued employment with the Group and the extent to which pre-determined performance conditions are met over a specified period of three years.
The form of these performance conditions, and the period over which they are measured, are intended to mirror those that applied to the options over Capricorn Units that have been replaced.
A summary of the performance conditions that will determine the extent to which Converted Options vest at the end of the applicable performance period is provided on page 77.
No further options will be granted pursuant to the Replacement Option Plan in the future.
OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009 67 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Continued 1996 Option Scheme, 2002 Option Plan and 2003 Option Plan The 1996 Option Scheme, 2002 Option Plan and 2003 Option Plan all of which have subsequently been superseded were formerly used by the Company to grant options to a broad selection of employees in the Group.
Although a number of options granted under these plans currently subsist, no further awards will be granted pursuant to their terms.
A summary of the performance conditions that must be satisfied before awards under these plans can be exercised is provided on page 77.
Cairn India Schemes unaudited As part of the arrangements surrounding its flotation, Cairn India established its own share option schemes pursuant to which options to acquire its shares can be granted.
These arrangements brief details of which are set out in Note 7 of the Notes to the Accounts have been or will be used to grant options to selected employees and executive directors of Cairn India and its various subsidiary undertakings.
Dilution of Share Capital Pursuant to Share Plans unaudited In any 10-year rolling period, the number of ordinary shares which may be issued in connection with the Companys discretionary share plans cannot exceed 5% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital.
In addition, in any ten-year rolling period, the number of ordinary shares which may be issued in connection with all the Companys employee share schemes whether discretionary or otherwise cannot exceed 10% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital.
Proposed All Employee Share Incentive Plan unaudited In order to encourage increased levels of long-term share ownership amongst its employees, the Company intends to establish a UK HM Revenue & Customs approved share incentive plan SIP during 2010.
Once established, the SIP will be used to provide eligible employees, including the executive directors, with some or all of the following benefits: t Partnership shares employees can authorise deductions of up to 1,500 per tax year from pre-tax salary, which are then used to acquire ordinary shares on their behalf.
t Matching shares the Company can award further free shares to all participants who acquire partnership shares on the basis of up to two matching shares for every one partnership share purchased.
t Free shares employees can be given up to 3,000 worth of ordinary shares free in each tax year.
All shares acquired by participants under the SIP will be existing ordinary shares purchased in the market.
As a result, the SIP will not involve the issue of new shares or the transfer of treasury shares.
Non-Executive Directors unaudited The remuneration of each of the non-executive directors other than the Chairman is determined by the executive members of the Board and the Chairman within limits set out in the Articles of Association and having taken independent advice on appropriate levels.
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the committee in his absence, again based on independent advice.
In all cases, the fees are designed to attract experienced individuals and reflect the increased responsibilities of the role of the Chairman and other non-executive directors.
Non-executive directors cannot participate in any of the Companys long-term incentive arrangements and are not entitled to a bonus or pension contributions.
The non-executive directors fees for 2009 were frozen at 2008 levels and are set out in full in the remuneration table on page 70.
The non-executive directors fees for 2010 are 205,000 for Norman Murray, 105,000 for Hamish Grossart and 63,000 for each of the other non-executive directors.
In addition to this, an annual fee of 10,000 is payable to each of Iain McLaren and Dr Jim Buckee for their roles as chairman of the audit and remuneration committee respectively.
Service Contracts Letters of Appointment unaudited The Companys policy is for all executive directors to have contracts of service which can be terminated by either the director concerned or the Company on giving 12 months notice of termination.
In the event of termination by the Company other than as a result of a change of control, the executive directors would be entitled to loss of salary, benefits and pension contributions for the notice periods.
Depending on the circumstances of termination, the executive directors may be entitled, or the remuneration committee may exercise its discretion to allow the executive director, to retain a proportion of their outstanding awards under long-term incentive arrangements but only to the extent that any applicable performance conditions have been met.
The committees policy on early termination is to emphasise the duty of the terminated party to mitigate any loss caused by the early termination to the fullest extent practicable.
On a change of control of the Company resulting in the termination of a directors employment, each of the directors is entitled to compensation of a sum equal to his her annual basic salary as at the date of termination of employment.
Each of the non-executive directors has a letter of appointment in terms of which he is appointed for a fixed three-year period, subject to the Companys Articles of Association, which provide for retirement by rotation at least once every three years.
The letters of appointment set out the time commitment expected by the Company and can be terminated with immediate effect by either the director concerned or the Company.
The Board is satisfied that each of the non-executive directors commits sufficient time to fulfil his her duties as a director of the Company.
None of the non-executive directors has any conflict of interest which has not been disclosed to the Board in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association.
68 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Continued The executive directors service contracts and non-executive directors letters of appointment are available for inspection on request and will be available for inspection before and during the AGM to be held on 20 May 2010.

Given that all these awards lapsed prior to 22 December 2009 see below, these prices and the numbers of shares over which the awards subsisted have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of the 10 for 1 subdivision of the Companys share capital that became effective on that date.
The performance period applicable to the above awards ended on 23 April 2009.
On the basis that the applicable performance conditions a summary of which is provided on page 76 were not met, these awards lapsed in full shortly thereafter.
Overview of Share Incentive Plan Performance Conditions unaudited Introduction The vesting of each award and option granted under the Companys various share incentive plans is conditional on the achievement of performance conditions determined by the remuneration committee at the relevant date of grant.
Set out below is a summary of the conditions applicable to awards and options that were outstanding during the year.
In the case of the Companys long-term incentive plans being the arrangements in which the executive directors participate, the conditions principally relate to the TSR performance of the Company.
These TSR measures were selected by the remuneration committee on the basis that they improve shareholder alignment and are consistent with the Companys objective of delivering long-term value to shareholders.
On the expiry of the performance period applicable to an award or option, the calculations necessary to determine the extent to which the relevant conditions have been satisfied are subject to independent verification by Ernst & Young LLP.
2009 LTIP In the case of all awards granted under the 2009 LTIP during the year, the extent to which an award vests will be determined by comparing the TSR of the Company over a three year performance period with the TSR of a share in each company in the following comparator group: Addax Petroleum, Inc Noble Energy, Inc BG Group PLC Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited PTT Exploration & Production PLC Chesapeake Energy Corporation Premier Oil PLC CNOOC Limited Santos Limited Dana Petroleum PLC SOCO International PLC EOG Resources, Inc Talisman Energy, Inc Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited Tullow Oil PLC Indian Oil Corporation Limited Woodside Petroleum Limited Newfield Exploration Company Denotes companies that have delisted during the applicable performance period.
74 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Continued At the end of the performance period, each company in the comparator group will be listed in order of TSR performance to produce a ranking table.
The vesting of awards will then take place as follows: Ranking of Company Against the Comparator Group Percentage of Ordinary Shares Comprised in Award That Vest Below median 0% Median 20% Upper decile i. e. top 10% 100% Between median and upper decile 20% 100% on a straight line basis In order to make sure that the 2009 LTIP encourages and rewards exceptional performance, the performance conditions attaching to awards also provide that, where the TSR of the Company produces a ranking at or above the upper decile level in the appropriate comparator group, a participant will then be given the opportunity to increase the percentage of his her award that vests through the application of a multiplier that is linked to the TSR actually achieved over the performance period.
The way in which this multiplier will operate is as follows: Multiplier Applied to Determine the Number of TSR of the Company Over the Performance Period Ordinary Shares that Actually Vest 1 50% or less 1.33 100% or more 1 1.33 on a straight line basis Between 50% and 100% However, notwithstanding the performance of the Company against the above targets, no part of any award will vest unless the remuneration committee is satisfied that there has been an overall satisfactory and sustained improvement in the performance of the Company as a whole over the performance period.
2006 LTIP Cairn India Awards In the case of all outstanding Cairn India Awards granted under the 2006 LTIP, the extent to which they vest will be determined by comparing the TSR of a Cairn India share over a three year performance period with the TSR of a share in each company in a comparator group.
The tables below show the comparator groups for each tranche of Cairn India Awards.
OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009 75 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Continued At the end of the performance period, each company in the comparator group will be listed in order of TSR performance to produce a ranking table.

Replacement LTIP The vesting of a Converted Award will be determined by the extent to which specified performance conditions are satisfied over the original three year performance period that applied to the 2006 LTIP Capricorn Award that it has replaced pursuant to the conversion mechanism described on page 64 above.
The terms of these conditions that apply to each Converted Award are the same as those applied to the Capricorn Award that it has replaced.
In particular, the extent to which a Converted Award vests will be determined by comparing the TSR of the Company over the applicable performance period with the TSR of a share in each company in a comparator group see below with vesting taking place as follows: Ranking of the Company Against the Comparator Group Percentage of Ordinary Shares Comprised in Converted Award that Vest Below median 0% Median 20% Upper decile i. e. top 10% 100% Between median and upper decile 20% 100% on a straight line basis For the same reasons as noted above in relation to the 2009 LTIP, where the TSR of the Company produces a ranking at or above the upper decile level in the appropriate comparator group, the percentage of the relevant Converted Award that vests may be increased through the application of the following multiplier that is linked to the TSR actually achieved over the performance period: Multiplier Applied to Determine the Number of TSR of the Company Over the Performance Period Ordinary Shares that Actually Vest 1 75% or less 1.33 150% or more 1 1.33 on a straight line basis Between 75% and 150% For the purposes of the above conditions, the TSR performance of the Company over the performance period will be calculated by aggregating i the growth or fall in the TSR of a Capricorn Unit achieved between the start of the period and the conversion date being the date on which the conversion mechanism described on page 64 above became effective : and ii the growth or fall in the TSR of a Cairn share between the conversion date and the end of the period.
Notwithstanding the performance of the Company against the above targets, no part of any Converted Award will vest unless the remuneration committee is satisfied that there has been an overall satisfactory and sustained improvement in the performance of the Company as a whole over the performance period.
The comparator group applicable to each Converted Award is identical to the group that applied to the Capricorn Award it has replaced.
The table on the following page shows the comparator groups for each tranche of Converted Awards.
2002 LTIP The performance conditions attaching to all Tier One and Tier Two awards granted under the 2002 LTIP which were outstanding during the year, can be summarised as follows: Step One Firstly, the TSR of a Cairn share during the performance period is compared to the average TSR performance of the companies comprising the FTSE 350 Index.
If Cairns TSR performance exceeds the average TSR performance of the Index, then the step one test has been passed.
The step two test is then used to calculate how many if any Cairn shares that are the subject of the award will vest.
Step Two Under step two, the TSR of a Cairn share is compared to the TSR of a share in each company in a comparator group see below with vesting taking place as follows: Tier One Awards Tier Two Awards Ranking of the Company Percentage of Ordinary Ranking of the Company Percentage of Ordinary Against the Comparator Shares Comprised in Tier Against the Comparator Shares Comprised in Tier Group One Award that Vest Group Two Award that Vest Below median 0% Below upper quartile 0% Median 20% Upper quartile 40% Upper quartile or above 100% Number one position 100% Between median and 20% 100% on a Between upper quartile and 40% 100% on a upper quartile straight line basis number one position straight line basis Notwithstanding the performance of the Company against the above targets, no Tier One or Tier Two award vests unless the remuneration committee is satisfied that there has been a satisfactory and sustained improvement in Cairns underlying financial position and performance over the performance period.
OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTS CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2009 77 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Continued 2009 Approved Option Plan and 2009 Unapproved Option Plan All options granted under the above arrangements are subject to a TSR growth target measured over a three year performance period.
Under this target, vesting will occur as follows: Average annual compound growth in TSR of the Percentage of ordinary shares comprised in option that vests Company over the performance period Less than 5% 0% 5% 50% 10% or more 100% More than 5% but less than 10% 50% 100% on a straight-line basis Notwithstanding the above condition, no part of an option granted under the 2009 Approved Option Plan or 2009 Unapproved Option Plan will vest unless the TSR of the Company over the performance period is sufficient to place it at or above the median level in the same comparator group of companies that is used for the purposes of the 2009 LTIP see the table on page 73.
Replacement Option Plan The vesting of a Converted Option will be determined by the extent to which specified performance conditions are satisfied over the original three year performance period that applied to the 2006 Plan Capricorn Unit option that it has replaced pursuant to the exchange mechanism described on page 64 above.
The terms of these conditions that apply to each Converted Option are the same as those applied to the Capricorn Unit option that it has replaced.
In particular, the extent to which a Converted Option vests will be determined by reference to the Companys achievement against a share price growth target measured over the applicable performance period.
Under this target, vesting will occur as follows: Average annual compound growth in the price Percentage of ordinary shares comprised of a Cairn share over the performance period in Converted Option that vests Less than 5% 0% 5% 50% 10% or more 100% More than 5% but less than 10% 50% 100% on a straight line basis Notwithstanding the above condition, no part of a Converted Option will vest unless the TSR of the Company over the performance period is sufficient to place it at or above the median level in the same comparator group of companies that is used for the purposes of the Converted Awards granted under the Replacement LTIP see the first table on page 76.
1996 Option Scheme, 2002 Option Plan and 2003 Option Plan In the case of all outstanding options under the 1996 Scheme, 2002 Option Plan and 2003 Option Plan, the option holder may only exercise his her award if Cairns share price has increased by 5% on a compound basis over the period from the date of grant to the date of exercise: and the percentage increase in Cairns share price over the same period is at least equal to or greater than the percentage movement in the FTSE Oil & Gas Index.
