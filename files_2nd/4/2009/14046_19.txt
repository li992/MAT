The conditions relating to the plans are detailed below.
The comparator group comprises the companies within the FTSE 51 to 130 that are in the proprietary database of the Committees advisors.
This is a group of approximately 30 Deferred Bonus Plan companies of broadly similar size and scope to Serco in terms Following shareholder approval in 2009, the Executive of turnover, growth profile and market capitalisation.
The Directors were invited to participate in the DBP.

The measures are Total Shareholder Return TSR measured against There were no changes to the base salaries of the Executive the companies in the FTSE 51 to 130 excluding investment Directors during the period.
The structure for vesting is the same for both measures.
Annual bonus Bonus is earned only on the basis of achievement of a mix of financial and non-financial objectives which are weighted 80% TSR element: and 20% respectively.
Payment for target performance is at No matching shares will be awarded if the Group does not 75% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 65% of base meet or exceed the median TSR of the comparator group salary for the Finance Director.

These gross value of the deferred bonus vest for upper quartile or measures reflect the growth and margin improvement superior performance at the top end of the range.
The standards of performance set are designed to be stretching.
The non-financial goals set for 2009 assessed performance against a number of strategically EPS element: important areas.
If the annual compound growth in EPS does not meet The maximum annual bonus opportunity is 150% of base threshold then no matching shares will vest salary for the Chief Executive and 130% of base salary for If compound growth in EPS is at threshold then 25% of this the Finance Director.

Prior to 2009 awards were made under the Serco Group plc 2006 Long Term In 2009 both the Chief Executive and the Finance Director Incentive Plan LTIP and the Serco Group plc 2005 Executive elected to defer 50% of their bonus into the DBP.
All grants and awards are made pursuant to the rules of the applicable plans and in accordance with the Model Code and policies in relation to the treatment of leavers have been adopted.
Serco R A 2009 p36-144 Serco sample only 25 03 2010 15:14 Page 72 72 Performance Share Plan Shareholders approved the PSP at the annual general meeting in May 2009.
The PSP awards granted to the Executive Directors are calculated at a face value on grant of 200% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 175% of base salary for the Finance Director.
The shares will normally only vest at the end of a three-year period if the Executive Directors are still in employment with Serco and two performance measures have been met.
The two measures are independent.
The measures are TSR against the companies in the FTSE 51 to 130 excluding investment trusts and EPS growth.
Relative TSR performance determines the vesting of 70% of the shares and EPS growth the remainder.
The shares will vest in full only if Sercos performance is upper quartile or, in the case of EPS growth, superior and at the top end of the range.
Median or threshold performance will trigger the vesting of 25% of the award.
Performance between median threshold and upper quartile superior will be on a straight line basis.
The Committee has discretion to vary the proportion of awards that vest under the Plan to ensure that the outcomes are fair and appropriately reflect the underlying financial performance of the Group.
Dividends will be reinvested and distributed only in respect of shares that vest under both plans at the end of the performance period.
The Remuneration Committee continue to believe that the case for relative TSR and EPS as the performance measures for long-term share-based plans remains strong.
Relative TSR and EPS growth carry equal weight in respect of the matching shares awarded under the DBP.
This is to ensure a balance of internal and external measures and hence sufficient line-of-sight to encourage investment in the plan.
In the case of the PSP, greater weight has been placed on relative TSR to underscore the importance of longer term alignment with shareholders interests.
Sharesave The Group operates Sharesave.
No performance conditions are attached to options granted under the scheme as it is an all-employee scheme.
Options granted to participants are normally set at a discount of 10% to the market value of shares at grant.
None of the Directors participate in Sharesave.
Share ownership policy The share ownership requirement for the Chief Executive is two times base salary and one times base salary for the Finance Director.
Executive Directors are required to retain in shares 50% of the net value of any performance shares or options exercised until they satisfy the shareholding requirement.
At the end of the year, by reference to the share price at that date, Executive Directors share ownership levels were as follows: Ordinary shareholding at Ordinary shareholding at 31 December 2009 530p 31 December 2008 450.50p Number of shares % of salary Number of shares % of salary Chief Executive 735,510 604% 166,440 116% Finance Director 198,075 276% 104,874 124% Pension, life assurance and other benefits Serco operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The Executive Directors participate in the Serco Pension and Life Assurance Scheme SPLAS.
This is a funded, defined benefit scheme, which provides for a target pension of two-thirds of pensionable salary following a full career.
Members contribute to the scheme at rates varying according to the section of the scheme.
From 1 January 2007 Serco also introduced SMART whereby all members were given the option to have their pension contributions paid by salary sacrifice.
Under this arrangement the member makes no normal pension contributions, Serco makes additional contributions to SPLAS equal to those that the member would otherwise have made and the members contractual pay is reduced by the amount of these contributions.
Both Christopher Hyman and Andrew Jenner opted to have their contributions paid by SMART.
Kevin Beestons pension benefits accrued prior to 6 April 2006 exceeded the new Lifetime Allowance, which came into force at that date, and he opted to cease paying contributions and accruing benefits in the pension scheme after 6 April 2006.
Kevin Beeston remains entitled to lump sum and widows pension benefits should he die before retirement and while still employed by or an officer of Serco.
The Chairman and Executive Directors receive a range of other benefits which include a car, private medical insurance, permanent health insurance, life cover, an annual allowance for independent financial advice and voluntary health checks every two years.

The TSR level shown at 31 December each year is the average of the closing daily TSR levels for the 30-day period up to and including that date.
The Companys TSR is compared to that of the FTSE 350 Index, which is a broad equity market index of which it is a constituent.
TSR is defined as the return shareholders would receive if they held a notional number of shares, and received dividends on those shares over a period of time.
It measures the percentage growth in the Companys share price together with the value of any dividends paid, assuming that the dividends are reinvested into the Companys shares.

The Directors receive pension and life assurance benefits consistent with those provided by other leading companies.
The details of the defined benefit schemes operated by the Group are set out in the note on page 117.
In the event of death in service, the Serco Supplementary Death Benefit Scheme provides for a lump sum payment.
The accrued pension benefits of all Directors under the Serco Pension and Life Assurance Scheme, which is a defined benefit scheme, are as follows: Transfer Transfer value of value Gross Increase accrued of accrued Increase increase in accrued benefits benefits in transfer in accrued pension Value of Total at 31 at 31 Directors value during pension during increase in accrued December December contributions the year during the year, net accrual over pension 2009 2008 for the year 4 the year of inflation the year at year end 1 2 3 1 - 2 - 3 5 6 7 8 p. a. p. a. p. a.

The total accrued pension shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement, based on pensionable service to the end of this year, or for Kevin Beeston, to 5 April 2006 when he opted out of the scheme.
The increase in accrued pension during the year is normally shown both as a gross increase and excluding any increase in respect of inflation.
In the measurement year used for 2009 inflation has been negative and so the figures shown assume that none of the pension increase over the year is due to inflation.
Hence the increase in accrued pension over the year, net of inflation, shown in 6, is the same as the gross increase in pension shown in 5. b.
The increase in the accrued pensions of Christopher Hyman and Andrew Jenner allow for both the increase in their pensionable salaries over the year and for the accrual of a further years pensionable service as a result of a further years active membership of the scheme.
c. The pension which Kevin Beeston had accrued up to 5 April 2006 is increased in line with his final pensionable remuneration averaged over the best three years since 5 April 2006.
There is a small increase in his accrued pension over the year to 31 December 2009 due to the method of calculating his pensionable remuneration.
d. Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the current transfer value regulations.
The assumptions to be used for calculating transfer values have been agreed by the Trustees and the methodology for setting these assumptions has remained the same as for last years calculations.
The difference between the transfer values at the beginning and end of the year, shown in 4, includes not only the effect of the increase in accrual and salaries, but also the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and the Directors, such as stock market movements.
The effect of market movements on the transfer value assumptions over the year has resulted in a slight decrease in the transfer value for Kevin Beeston.
e. The value of the net increase in accrual represents the incremental value to the Director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption that his service terminated at the year end, or 5 April 2006 in the case of Kevin Beeston.
It is based on the increase in the accrued pension.
f. The transfer values disclosed do not represent the sum paid or payable to the individual Director.
Instead, they represent a potential liability of the pension scheme.
g. All Directors who are currently active members of the scheme have opted to have their contributions paid by the Company under a salary sacrifice arrangement and hence no contributions were paid by the Directors during the year.
Share dilution Awards granted under the Serco Group plc share plans are met either by the issue of new shares or by shares held in trust when awards vest.
The Committee monitors the number of shares issued under its various share plans and their impact on dilution limits.
The relevant dilution limits established by the Association of British Insurers in respect of all share plans 10% in any rolling ten-year period and discretionary share plans 5% in any rolling ten-year period were, based on the Companys issued share capital at 31 December 2009, 5.72% and 4.43% respectively.
The Group has an employee benefit trust which is administered by an independent trustee and which holds ordinary shares in the Company to meet various obligations under the share plans.
In November 2009 a loan of 2.4m was made to the Employee Benefit Trust to ensure sufficient shares were available to meet its ongoing liabilities.
The Trust held 5,650,253 and 3,436,547 ordinary shares at 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2009 respectively.
