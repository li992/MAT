Business Review Governance Accounts Other Information Bellway p. l. c. 35 Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration Introduction The remuneration of the executive directors is determined by the Board Committee on Executive Directors Remuneration the Committee within a framework set by the Board.
As at the date of this report, the Committees members are three non-executive directors, Mr Toms Chairman, Mr Perry and Mr Johnson.
Mr Perry is to retire at the AGM on 15 January 2010, and he will be replaced on this Committee by Mr John Cuthbert.
None of the Committee members has a personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided.
There are no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
During the year, the Group Company Secretary attended a number of Committee meetings at the invitation of the Committee and provided advice on issues other than those relating to his own remuneration.
The Committee also received independent external advice from Hewitt New Bridge Street.
Hewitt New Bridge Street was appointed by the Committee and does not provide any other services to the Company other than to the Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors Remuneration.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors apart from the Chairman is determined by the Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors Remuneration, which comprises the executive directors.
The Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors Remuneration also receives advice from the Group Company Secretary and Hewitt New Bridge Street.
The Chairmans remuneration is determined by the other non-executive directors.
Context This years report is set in the context of the vote against the advisory resolution to approve the directors remuneration report for 2007 08 at the Annual General Meeting AGM in January 2009.
The opposition of shareholders reflected concerns about the decision of the Committee to base the 2007 08 annual bonus on a broad judgement of the performance of management in a volatile market, rather than to determine the bonus using a range of fixed operating profit targets, based around budget, as had been the case in previous years.
It also reflected concerns that the Committee had failed to consult shareholders adequately in making this change.
The Committee has been very mindful of these concerns, and undertook extensive consultations with institutional shareholders on future bonus arrangements in the spring of this year.
As a result of these consultations it made significant changes to bonus arrangements including: reducing the maximum annual bonus payable from 120% 150% of salary in exceptional circumstances to 100% of salary.
for this year, further reducing maximum bonus potential to one-third of salary, to reflect the fact that the bonus terms were not established until March 2009. restructuring the bonus for this year from a payment based solely on operating profit, to a payment based on fixed targets for operating profit before exceptional items 40% and cash generation excluding any equity raising 40%, with 20% based on personal performance, to be evaluated by the Committee after the year end, thereby providing a more rounded assessment of performance.
The Committee also determined to freeze the salaries and certain benefits of executive directors for the 2009 10 financial year.
Shareholders were consulted before these changes were implemented, and were supportive of the arrangements.
The Committee considers these actions to be a measured and reasonable response to shareholders concerns and hopes that they will be endorsed.
The Company has also addressed the vesting of the award of shares granted in 2006 under the Bellway p. l. c. 2004 Performance Share Plan PSP.
The award was based on relative Total Shareholder Return TSR and the calculation as at 31 July 2009 confirmed that the TSR condition had been met.
Before confirming the award, the Committee also considered the financial underpin which requires the Committee to satisfy itself that the Companys TSR reflects the Companys underlying financial performance.
The underpin, which was approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2004, is defined in narrow and precise terms.
The Committee considers that the terms of the underpin have been met and the awards will vest.
The Committee has engaged with shareholders regarding certain matters in relation to the future operation of the PSP, including the wording of a financial underpin to apply to future awards and will give due consideration to these issues for the financial year commencing 1 August 2010.
Bellway p. l. c. 36 Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration continued Objectives The aim of the Committee is to ensure that the Company has competitive remuneration packages in place in order to recruit, retain and motivate executive directors in the overall interests of shareholders, the Company, its employees and its customers.
The Committee has set, as an objective, a policy of paying remuneration around the median of a peer group of similar UK housebuilding businesses and it is satisfied that the structure of the executives packages broadly achieves this objective.
The Committee has used this comparative approach to benchmarking with caution, recognising the risk of upward only reviews of remuneration.
The structure of the package has been designed to ensure that the performance-related elements of remuneration annual bonus and long-term incentives constitute a significant proportion of an executives potential total remuneration package, but are only receivable if demanding and stretching performance targets are achieved.
The Committee considers that the remuneration level and structure are fully competitive with the market, with a significant element of the package payable in the form of share-based incentives, subject to long-term performance conditions, including relative TSR performance against other UK housebuilders, thereby creating an alignment with the interests of shareholders.
In framing the Companys remuneration policy for executive directors, the Committee has given full consideration to the best practice provisions in the Combined Code and the Association of British Insurers ABI guidance.
Summary of remuneration policy The policy in relation to each component of executive remuneration is described below: Component Policy Performance period How achieved Salary To be market competitive n a Salary levels set by reference to the mid-market level of a peer group of similar UK housebuilding businesses, taking account of individual performance and experience.
In practice, notwithstanding the fact that the current management team is highly experienced and well regarded, packages are generally at or below the median.
Benefits To provide a range and value n a Benefits to be at the mid-market level of a peer group of similar UK which is market competitive housebuilding businesses which include a salary supplement in lieu of pension contributions, car or car allowance, life assurance, medical cover and permanent health insurance.
Annual Bonus To reward achievement of annual 1 year By providing the opportunity to earn a bonus of up to 100% of operational-based performance salary for outstanding operational performance, both financial and targets non-financial.
Long-term incentives To encourage long-term value 3 years By using share-based incentives with performance conditions which performance shares creation, to aid retention, to are aligned with shareholders interests, such as TSR, which are and matching shares encourage shareholding, and to assessed over a three-year period.
promote alignment of interest with shareholders Service contracts and letters of appointment The executive directors have fixed-term service contracts which specify that retirement is at age 60, with a 12-month notice period from the Company and a six-month notice period from the executive.
On termination by the Company, an amount equivalent to one years salary, benefits and the average amount of the last two years annual bonus payments, would be payable.
Within six months of a change of control, if the Company or the executive director serves notice to terminate the contract, the liquidated damages payment would be triggered.
The inclusion of average annual bonus in the calculation of compensation payable for early termination will ensure that there is variability in the potential level of compensation.
In particular, after a period of poor performance, it could be expected that little or no bonus would be payable, reducing potential payout in these circumstances.
The service contracts of all executive directors have been reviewed and amended, including the removal of the right to indexation of basic salaries.
The Committee has also proposed amendments to the terms of future contracts.
These actions will make service contracts consistent with current best practice.
The details of the executive directors service contracts are as follows: First appointed Current contract Executive director as a director commencement date J K Watson 1 August 1995 16 March 2001, amended 7 October 2009 P J Stoker 1 August 1995 19 January 1996, amended with effect from 1 November 2003 and further amended 7 October 2009 A M Leitch 1 August 2002 1 September 2002, amended 7 October 2009 Business Review Governance Accounts Other Information Bellway p. l. c. 37 Annual Report & Accounts 2009 All non-executive directors have letters of appointment with the Company of no more than three years with a three-month notice period by either side.

Mr Cuthbert is to be appointed as a non-executive director with effect from 1 November 2009 and his letter of appointment will run from 1 November 2009 to 31 October 2012.
Salaries and fees Salaries are reviewed on 1 August each year, taking into account the general settlement across the Company.
Any changes are implemented from that date.
For the year under review, the executive directors were awarded a rise of 3% with effect from 1 August 2008.
For the 2009 10 financial year salaries were frozen from 1 August 2009.
Fee levels for non-executive directors reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of the role and are reviewed annually, taking into account the level of fees for similar positions in comparable companies.
They are not entitled to any benefits with the exception of the Chairman or pension.
They do not participate in any bonus or long-term incentive plan and they are not entitled to compensation on termination of their agreements, other than normal notice provisions of three months notice given by either party.
Benefits in kind Benefits in kind provided to the executive directors relate to the provision of motor vehicles and private medical insurance.
Annual bonus scheme For several years the annual bonus scheme had a potential of 120% of basic salary with 150% for exceptional performance.
Following engagement with institutional shareholders, for the year under review the maximum was reduced to 100% of basic salary.
Furthermore, in view of the fact that the performance conditions had not been determined until two-thirds of the 2008 09 financial year had elapsed, the maximum bonus potential was scaled back to one-third of basic salary.
The performance conditions for the 2008 09 bonus were operating profit before exceptional items 40%, debt reduction excluding any equity raising 40% and personal performance 20%.
The latter to be assessed on the basis of how well management is perceived to have negotiated the Company through the present housing downturn during the year.
Full details of the bonus payments and the performance conditions are set out in the notes to the table of directors emoluments.
Annual bonuses are not pensionable.
The 2009 10 bonuses will also be capped at 100% of basic salary.
The performance conditions will be operating profit before exceptional items 80% and personal performance 20%, with personal performance being assessed by reference to succession planning, land bank management, health and safety and customer care.
The greater weighting on operating profit before exceptional items at the expense of debt reduction in last years bonus plan reflects the improved opportunities for growth this year.
The bonus will be payable in cash, with executives having the opportunity to invest up to 25% of their net cash bonus in Bellway shares under the terms of the Bellway p. l. c. 2008 Share Matching Plan.
Long-term incentive schemes The Company operates two long-term incentive plans, designed to focus executive directors on longer term value creation, provide a strong retentive element and provide alignment of interest with shareholders.
The Bellway p. l. c. 2004 Performance Share Plan the PSP was introduced for the Companys executive directors and the Group Company Secretary.
Under the PSP, executives have been granted awards over shares worth 100% of basic salary each year, subject to the achievement of TSR-based performance conditions or, in January 2008, a combination of TSR and Return on Capital Employed ROCE conditions.
The policy for long-term incentives to be granted in the 2009 10 financial year, as was the case in prior years, will be for awards to be granted over shares worth 100% of basic salary.
Awards will vest to executives after three years subject to the achievement of performance conditions based around TSR, which compares the stock market performance share price movement and dividends paid of different companies.
A TSR performance condition will compare Bellways TSR against that of an index created by the average TSR of the other UK housebuilders.
Awards will start to vest at 25% if Bellways TSR matches the performance of the index.
Full vesting will occur if Bellways TSR out-performs the index by an average of 7.5% per annum over three years.
The Committee has carried out significant modelling, the results of which support the premise that 7.5% per annum outperformance is equivalent to average upper quartile TSR performance of the housebuilders over the long term.
Further, regardless of TSR performance, no part of the TSR element of an award will vest unless the Committee considers that the Companys TSR over the performance period reflects underlying financial performance.
The companies comprising the Index for the awards to be granted in the financial year commencing on 1 August 2009 are Barratt Developments PLC, The Berkeley Group plc, Bovis Homes Group PLC, Persimmon plc, Redrow plc and Taylor Wimpey plc.
TSR is recognised as enabling alignment with the interests of institutional shareholders through providing a reward mechanism for delivering superior stock market performance.
Bellway p. l. c. 38 Annual Report & Accounts 2009 Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration continued The Bellway p. l. c. 2008 Share Matching Plan the SMP operates in conjunction with the annual bonus plan.
Under the SMP senior executives may invest up to 25% of their net cash bonus, on a voluntary basis, in Bellway shares, which must be held for a minimum of three years.
Invested shares will not be subject to a risk of forfeiture and executives will enjoy full beneficial ownership including voting rights and dividends.
In return for investing in shares, under the SMP, an award of matching shares is granted.
The level of matching is on a gross basis to the net of tax bonus invested in shares.
Matching shares will vest subject to the executive remaining employed, retention of the invested shares and also subject to a performance condition.
No awards have been made to date.
For any awards which may be made the performance condition will be the same as will apply to the award under the PSP in the same period.
In addition to the two executive plans detailed above, the Bellway p. l. c. 2003 Savings Related Share Option Scheme 2003 SRSOS is available to all employees, including the executive directors.
Shareholding guidelines There is a minimum shareholding requirement for the executive directors, equivalent to 100% of basic salary.
As at 31 July 2009, and at the date of this report, all executive directors hold shares with an equivalent value well in excess of 100% of their basic salary.
Any executive directors appointed in the future will be given an appropriate period of time to acquire the requisite shareholding.
Directors interests The directors interests including family interests and holdings in which the directors are interested only as trustees in the ordinary share capital of the Company are set out below: Fully paid ordinary 12.5p shares Beneficial interests 31 July 2009 1 August 2008 H C Dawe 143,634 143,634 J K Watson 400,527 400,527 P J Stoker 540,000 536,531 A M Leitch 132,473 132,473 D G Perry 5,000 5,000 P M Johnson 4,300 4,300 M R Toms There has been no change in the above interests between 31 July 2009 and the date of this report.
In addition, Mr Dawe had a beneficial interest in 629,164 Bellway p. l. c. 9.5% cumulative redeemable preference shares 2014 of 1 each which are held in his Self Invested Personal Pension Plan SIPP at 31 July 2009 and at the date of this report 1 August 2008 554,164.
Mr Leitch had a beneficial interest in 50,000 Bellway p. l. c. 9.5% cumulative redeemable preference shares 2014 of 1 each, which he held at 31 July 2009 and at the date of this report 1 August 2008 50,000.
Pensions As disclosed in last years report, in July 2008 the executive directors took enhanced transfer values from the final salary section of the Bellway plc 1972 Pension & Life Assurance Scheme, and therefore have no accrued pension entitlements.
Since 1 June 2008 they have received a cash payment in lieu of pension contributions amounting to 30% of basic salary.
The auditors are required to report on the information contained in the following part of this report.
Taxable benefits relate to the provision of motor vehicles and private medical insurance.
The annual bonus is payable in November 2009 for performance during the year ended 31 July 2009.
The performance conditions for the 2008 09 bonus are operating profit before exceptional items 40%, debt reduction excluding any equity raising 40% and personal performance 20%.
The latter has been assessed on the basis of how well management is perceived to have negotiated the Company through the present housing downturn during the year.
In addition, the bonus potential was scaled back by two-thirds as these targets were not set until March 2009.
The actual bonus payments against each of these metrics were determined on the following basis.
: operating profit was 45.6 million, which was at the lower end of the target range.
A bonus of 1.94% of salary was therefore achieved.
debt reduction was 180.9 million and the Company finished the year with debt of 36.8 million.
This was well above the maximum of the target range and a bonus of 13.33% of salary was achieved.
in respect of personal performance the Committee considered that the management team had clearly identified its strategic priorities and had jointly responded effectively to market conditions by reducing the size of the business and exerting strict cost control.
A bonus of 5% of salary was therefore awarded to each executive director.
Executive directors receive a cash payment in lieu of pension contribution amounting to 30% of basic salary.
Directors interests in deferred bonus plan The executive directors have a beneficial interest in certain shares held in the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992 pursuant to the grant of deferred bonus entitlements under the terms of the Bellway p. l. c. 2003 Deferred Bonus Plan a legacy plan.
The number of shares held in the Trust in respect of each director is as follows: Fully paid ordinary 12.5p shares Entitlements Entitlements Entitlements Entitlements held in Trust as awarded vested held in Trust as 1 at 1 August 2008 during the year during the year at 31 July 2009 J K Watson 41,844 23,987 17,857 P J Stoker 30,621 17,675 12,946 A M Leitch 27,204 15,150 12,054 Notes: 1.
Additional shares not included above were awarded on vesting in lieu of dividends accrued on the shares held in the Trust from the date of the award to vesting in respect of each director as follows: Mr Watson 2,874 shares, Mr Stoker 2,117 shares and Mr Leitch 1,815 shares.
There has been no change in the above holdings between 31 July 2009 and the date of this report.

Market value on 24 November 2008, which was the day the shares vested, was 513.00p.
The awards vested at 100% of the full entitlement.
Aggregate gross gains made by these directors on vesting of these awards under the PSP in the year were 507,840.17 2008 620,886.34.
The performance conditions for each award are summarised below: a For awards made on 14 November 2005 and 18 October 2006, vesting is conditional on the achievement of a TSR performance condition requiring Bellways TSR to be at least at the median of a comparator group of other housebuilders at which point 33% of the award vests.
Full vesting requires Bellways TSR to be at the upper quartile.
The Comparator group comprises Barratt Developments PLC, The Berkeley Group plc, Bovis Homes Group PLC, Persimmon plc, Redrow plc and Taylor Wimpey plc plus Countryside Properties PLC, Crest Nicholson plc, McCarthy & Stone plc, Taylor Woodrow plc, Westbury plc and Wilson Bowden plc, all of whom have now delisted.
b For awards made on 16 January 2008, two performance conditions applied to separate parts of the award: i 50% of the award is based on a TSR condition against other housebuilders but, instead of a ranking approach comparing Bellways TSR to that of each other company an Index is created out of the TSR of the other housebuilders in the group.
Bellways TSR is compared to that of the Index.
If Bellways TSR matches that of the Index, 25% of the TSR part of the award vests reduced from the previous vesting profile whereby 33% of the award vested at median.
Full vesting is achieved for 7.5% per annum outperformance of the Index.
The companies comprising the Index for the awards made on 16 January 2008 are Barratt Developments PLC, The Berkeley Group plc, Bovis Homes Group PLC, Persimmon plc, Redrow plc and Taylor Wimpey plc.
ii The remaining 50% of the award is based on a range of ROCE based targets requiring average annual ROCE of 15% per annum at which point, 25% of the ROCE part of the award would vest to 22% per annum for all of this part of the award to vest.
Awards vest on a straight-line basis in between these two points.
c For the award made on 4 November 2008 the TSR part of the award applied as the sole performance condition compared to the same companies as for the award made on 16 January 2008.
The market price of the ordinary shares at 31 July 2009 was 735.00p and the range during the year was 400.50p to 780.00p.
There has been no change in the above potential future beneficial interests between 31 July 2009 and the date of this report.
