In addition to meeting statutory requirements, the Remuneration Committee the Committee takes into account best practice guidelines including guidance produced by the Association of British Insurers ABI and the National Association of Pension Funds NAPF.
The Committees policy on directors remuneration is to: provide competitive remuneration packages necessary to attract, retain and motivate executive directors of an appropriate calibre promote the achievement of the Groups strategic objectives by providing remuneration packages that contain appropriately motivating targets based on performance align senior executives remuneration with the long term interests of shareholders and other stakeholders, including employees.
The report outlines the principles under which the Companys directors are compensated.
The Companies Act 2006 requires the report to be put to a shareholders vote at the AGM on 12 May 2010 where the Chairman of the Committee will be available to answer questions.
The Companies Act 2006 further requires the Companys auditors to report on certain parts of this report, specifically the directors share interests and emoluments, and to provide an opinion as to whether those parts have been properly prepared.
The audited section of this report can be found on pages 60 to 62.
INFORMATION NOT SUBJECT TO AUDIT REMUNERATION COMMITTEE Membership and role During 2009, Francisco Gros was Chairman of the Committee, the other members of the Committee were Sir Graham Hearne and Pat Murray.
All members of the Committee are considered to be independent non-executive directors.
Francisco Gros was on sick leave for part of the year and Sir Graham Hearne assumed the Chairmanship of the Committee during this period.
The Committees primary role is to make recommendations to the Board on the framework of remuneration for the executive directors and Chairman.
The Committee meets formally at least twice per year.
No director is involved in deciding his own remuneration and none of the Committee had during the year any personal interest in matters to be decided or any conflicts of interest, other than as a shareholder of the Company.
Six Committee meetings were held during the year and attendance at all meetings was 100% by all members of the Committee.
Following a review post year end, Pat Murray assumed the Chairmanship of the Committee on 15 January 2010.
In 2009, the Committee retained the services of Deloitte LLPs executive remuneration advisors to provide independent advice on remuneration matters.
Such advice included advice on executive directors compensation.
As Deloitte are also the Companys auditors, the Audit Committee has considered the independence of the auditors in relation to the provision of non-audit services to the Company and has concluded that the independence of the auditors is not compromised.
The Companys Chairman, John Kennedy, and Chief Executive Officer, Gordon Chapman, attended Committee meetings, by invitation, in order to provide advice and context on setting remuneration for the other executive directors and members of senior management.
Alasdair MacDonald, in his capacity as Acting Chief Executive Officer since September 2009, also attended by invitation.
The Committee is a formal Committee of the Board and has powers delegated to it by the Board.
Its remit is set out in its Terms of Reference, which have been adopted by the Board and are available on the Companys website at www.
WELLSTREAM HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT The Committees remit is to make recommendations to the Board on the: Overall framework of executive and senior management remuneration policy and practice, the design and targets for performance related pay schemes and the design of Company share incentive plans prior to approval by the Board and shareholders.
It determines: the specific remuneration of all of the executive directors, members of senior management and the Chairman, including any annual cash bonus, where appropriate, and share incentive payments.
The Committee undertook the following activities during the year: Award of 2008 bonuses Setting 2009 annual bonus targets and assessing progress against targets Setting the level of individual grants and performance conditions for the Performance Share Plan PSP Assessment of remuneration for Luis Araujo and Alasdair MacDonald as newly elected members of the Board and the remuneration of Alasdair MacDonald whilst fulfilling the role of Acting CEO Reviewing a proposal to implement an all employee share incentive plan Considering the Chairmans fees for his re-engagement Recommending the vesting conditions of the PSP awards for managers who left Wellstreams employment.
In April 2009, the Committee wrote to certain major shareholders advising them of the thinking and policy behind a change in remuneration policy to meet investor concerns on the balance of risk and reward and the disclosure of performance targets.
The Committee sought to address: the anticipated reduction in the growth rate of the Group following the very high levels of growth achieved since flotation the impact of an anticipated slow down in development projects in the oil and gas sector as a result of substantially reduced oil and gas prices and the overall economic downturn the general concerns expressed by institutional shareholders that executive compensation levels for quoted companies should reflect current conditions including the reduced level of share prices on public exchanges.
As a result of the review, the Committee decided to freeze base salaries for 2009 for directors and senior management.
The annual cash bonus targets were amended from a single EBITDA measure to three target measures of EBITDA, a cash conversion measure, and an individual performance measure providing 60%, 20% and 20% of the award respectively.
Further details of the targets are given later in this report.
For Performance Share Plan PSP awards the percentage of salary available for award was reduced in the case of the CEO from 125% to under 50% of base salary with reductions applied to other directors and senior management.
The performance criteria were also amended, from a single aggregate earnings per share measure to a combination of an earnings per share growth measure and a cash conversion measure.
The Committee believes that these measures more closely align the directors interests with shareholder value, reflect more general shareholder concerns and take account of market conditions.
This is part of the Companys broader objective of ensuring that an appropriate balance is struck between how profits are apportioned between retentions, remuneration and dividends to shareholders.
For the future, the policies outlined above will continue throughout 2010 and will be regularly reviewed.
The Committee recognised that the lack of disclosure of precise performance measures for awards in 2007 and 2008 raised questions with institutional shareholders.
These targets are fully disclosed later in this report together with further detail of the performance measure for awards made in 2009.
Following the year end, the Committee have again decided to freeze the base salaries of the executive directors and senior management for 2010.
54 55 PERFORMANCE GRAPH Wellstream FTSE 250 index The following graph shows the Companys performance, measured by total shareholder return, compared with an appropriate comparator of the FTSE Mid 250 excluding investment trusts of which the Company was a constituent during the year.
The graph is based on average monthly data to 31 December 2009.
WELLSTREAM IS IN THE FTSE 250 INDEX 250 200 150 100 50 0 WELLSTREAM TSR FTSE 250 EX INVESTMENT TRUSTS TSR, INDEXED REMUNERATION POLICY AND PRACTICE Executive Directors The Committee sets its remuneration levels at a level sufficient to attract, retain and motivate directors and key executives of the calibre needed to achieve the Companys objectives and deliver shareholder value.
The Company looks to reward executives for short term and long term performance both at a Company and individual level utilising three main remuneration tools: in the short term, base salary and benefits and annual cash bonus: and for the long term the PSP.
In addition there are pension contributions to a money purchase scheme.
Benchmarking data is reviewed which includes all sector analyses of the FTSE 250 and other published survey data.
The Committee believe that the remuneration tools represent an appropriate mix of incentives which reflects the Companys needs, establishes an appropriate balance between fixed and variable remuneration, and is based on targets that are appropriately stretching, verifiable and relevant and which take account of risk.
WELLSTREAM HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT JAN09 FEB09 MAR09 APR09 MAY09 JUN09 JUL09 AUG09 SEP09 OCT09 NOV09 DEC09 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT BASE SALARY The Committee determines executive directors base salaries at the beginning of the year, effective 1 January each year.
In 2009, given the prevailing external environment as explained above, remuneration and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group as a whole, the headcount reduction announced in Newcastle during the first quarter of 2009 and change in shift patterns, it was agreed that executive directors would not be awarded any increases in base salary.
Executive Director Base salary at Base salary at 1 January 2009 1 January 2008 Gordon Chapman, Chief Executive Officer 409,000 409,000 Chris Braithwaite, Chief Operating Officer 289,000 289,000 Chris Gill, Finance Director 259,000 259,000 Luis Araujo, Executive Director 252,208 Alasdair MacDonald, Acting CEO 259,000 Luis Araujos salary is denominated in Brazilian Reais and is translated to sterling at the average rate for the year.
Luis Araujo and Alasdair MacDonald were made directors of the Board on 10 March 2009 and 21 September 2009 respectively.
Their salaries above reflect a full 12 month period.
Consistent with the decision not to award any base salary adjustments to executive directors in 2009, neither was awarded an increase in base salary as a result of their appointment to the Board.
ALLOWANCES AND BENEFITS IN KIND In addition to base salary, UK based executive directors receive a car allowance, private medical insurance, pension contributions, life assurance and long term incapacity insurance.
Luis Araujo, based in Brazil, receives a fully expensed car as part of his remuneration package, and other benefits consistent with the Brazil employment market.
ANNUAL CASH BONUS In March each year, the Committee determines the level of cash bonus earned, based upon the achievement of both Group and personal performance objectives which are agreed at the beginning of the previous year.
Such objectives are established with the aim of incentivising the directors to implement the Groups strategy and achieve targets which are directly linked to the performance of the Group.
Stretch bonus targets for 2009 were based on the achievement of EBITDA 60% of the award, a cash conversion metric 20% of the award and a personal performance target 20% of the award.
During 2009 all directors achieved a full award under the cash conversion metric, no award under the EBITDA metric with the balance being made up by achievement of the personal performance metric.
As mentioned below, cash bonus awards actually paid for 2009 ranged from 30% to 68% of salary compared with 80% to 100% of salary in 2008.
The Committee made discretionary awards to three individuals, one to acknowledge the performance during 2009 of Wellstream in Brazil under the direction of Luis Araujo and secondly to Alasdair MacDonald Acting CEO and Chris Gill Finance Director to recognise additional responsibilities in the absence of the CEO who is currently away on sick leave.
56 57 Actual bonus awards paid out are set out below and, together with PSP awards, reflect the Committees assessment of each directors performance in 2009.

The maximum bonus opportunity will replicate that of 2009.
PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN PSP SHARE INCENTIVE The Company has in place a Performance Share Plan in which the Groups executive directors and senior management participate.
Participants receive performance related share awards each year, which vest after three years, subject to the participants continued employment and the extent to which performance conditions have been met.
The market value of the shares at date of grant is normally limited to 100% of the CEOs base salary and 80% for other executive directors, although the Committee has the authority to increase this up to 200% in exceptional circumstances.
2007 award The 2007 award was subject to the aggregate EPS performance targets set by the Remuneration Committee.
Those targets were exceeded and accordingly the awards vest in full.
2009 award In 2009, PSP awards were granted as follows: PSP Grant as Number of Date of Exercise Executive Director a % of salary Shares Award Price Gordon Chapman Chief Executive Officer 46% 35,336 12 May 2009 1p Chris Braithwaite Chief Operating Officer 37% 19,788 12 May 2009 1p Chris Gill Finance Director 37% 17,668 12 May 2009 1p Luis Araujo Executive Director 31% 13,082 12 May 2009 1p Alasdair MacDonald Acting CEO 26% 12,367 12 May 2009 1p The PSP performance criteria are designed to achieve alignment with shareholder return and reward for the delivery of strong executive performance.
In 2009, the Committee approved a new measure for the PSP awards, being 50% for the achievement of an EPS growth measure and 50% for the achievement of a cash conversion measure.
The Committee agreed entry and stretch targets.
The vesting of the 2009 PSP awards has therefore been made subject to the following performance measures, calculated over the three years from 1 January 2009 using 2008 as a base year.
WELLSTREAM HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT EPS GROWTH: 50% OF THE PSP AWARD: Compound EPS Growth over three years % of award vesting 3% pa 30% 10% pa 100% Vesting is linear between these points CASH CONVERSION 50% OF THE PSP AWARD: Average Cash Conversion ratio over three years % of award vesting 85% 30% 100% 100% The performance targets for awards made in 2010 will be set in a similar manner and will be disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report for the year ending 31 December 2010.
As part of its remit, the Committee regularly looks at the performance conditions attached to the scheme.
The Committee reviewed the performance criteria in early 2010 and concluded that they remain appropriate for awards scheduled as part of the PSP annual cycle of awards made in March 2010.

A Share Appreciation Rights scheme operates overseas which mirrors the UK SAYE scheme whereby staff receive cash bonuses determined by the rise in the Companys share price over a three year savings period on an initial discounted fixed price.

The SIP is aimed at providing employees with an additional opportunity to further align their interests with those of shareholders.
The SIP will be submitted for shareholder approval at the AGM on 12 May 2010 and details of the SIP are set out in the Notice of AGM.
58 59 EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS CONTRACTS The executive directors have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of one years notice by either party.

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The non-executive directors fees are set by the Board and are reflected in their three year service agreements which will be reviewed in 2010.
