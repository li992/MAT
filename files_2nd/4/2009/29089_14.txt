| Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2009 38043 pp042-062 File0508 03 201018:15Page44 44 Remuneration report continued Responsibilities of the Committee The Committees role is to review and approve the remuneration strategy and policies for the Group including a responsible approach to the Groups annual compensation review.
The Remuneration Committees terms of reference include responsibility for setting the over-arching principles and remuneration policy on a Group-wide basis, and this approach has been followed by Schroders for a number of years.
It also determines the remuneration of the executive Directors, and monitors the level and structure of remuneration for senior management.
The responsibilities of the Committee are to: Review and approve, on an annual basis, the remuneration strategy for the Group, as recommended by the Chief Executive: Review and approve the remuneration approach for use in the Groups annual compensation review: Fix the remuneration of each of the executive Board members: Review and recommend to the Board the design and operation of the long term incentive plans and share option schemes, including any performance-related pay for executives: Monitor the level and structure of remuneration for senior management: Review and recommend to the Board the remuneration of the Chairman, the Board Secretary and, from 1 January 2010, the Chief Risk Officer: Review and approve, employee remuneration packages which are of a value greater than, or guaranteed for a duration longer than, the levels set by the Board: Approve contractual termination arrangements and exit packages for executive Board members on an individual basis: Approve the appointment and rotation of external compensation advisers to the Committee: Provide an annual report to the Board of the Groups remuneration policy: Conduct an annual review of the Committees performance, periodically reviewing the adequacy of its Terms of Reference and recommending to the Board any changes: and Undertake appropriate discussions as necessary with institutional investors and the FSA on policy or other aspects of remuneration.
A member of the Audit Committee serves on the Remuneration Committee in order that any risks associated with setting remuneration and any circumstances that could materially increase the exposures to risk faced by the Group can be reported back to the Audit Committee.
The Committee reviewed its terms of reference, which are aligned to the Combined Code, having regard to regulatory guidance during the year from the FSA, major investor representative groups and best practice in the market.
The terms of reference confirm that the Committee has oversight of remuneration policy and outcomes in respect of the senior management of the Company.
The full terms of reference of the Committee are available at www.
com or from the Company Secretary.
The annual evaluation of the Committees effectiveness, required under the Combined Code, was undertaken as part of the overall board evaluation process in February 2010.
The specific findings relating to the Remuneration Committee were discussed with the Committee Chairman.
Report on the Committees activities in 2009 During 2009 we undertook a review of our remuneration practices with three objectives: to better align remuneration policy with Group strategy: to take into account emerging regulatory guidance: and to meet institutional guidelines.
The Groups value proposition is based on competitive and sustainable investment performance, translated into a broad product range that meets the investment needs of clients, and efficiently leverages our global distribution capability.
Performance across this value chain is reflected in our annual bonus scheme.
We believe that success in these areas converts into growth in net new business and earnings per share.
We are therefore proposing to introduce a share based Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, for which shareholder approval is required, in order to incentivise key employees in relation to further growth in earnings per share and net new business over four year measurement periods.
The Plan is designed to help us in the process of targeting and linking awards to longer term performance.
The proposed LTIP provides executive Directors with potential remuneration upside but also downside risk through the exchange of part of their deferred bonus for a performance linked LTIP award.
of the cost of the overall LTIP award will be included within our revised compensation KPI, the level of bonus to pre-bonus profit before tax and exceptional items the profit share ratio, as approved by the Board and to be reported to shareholders every year.
This measure replaces the previous compensation to operating revenue ratio.
The change in the ratio increases focus on the control of all costs.
Further information on the proposed LTIP is included in the circular that contains the notice of Annual General Meeting.
During the year the Committee also reviewed our remuneration policies taking account of FSA recommended best practice and the following changes have been effected: 2009 2010 Bonus pool based upon compensation to revenue ratio Bonus pool based on a bonus to pre-bonus profit before tax ratio Bonus deferral for senior officers 50 per cent.
No change Bonus deferral three years minimum with leaver forfeiture No change Deferred bonus in Company shares funds No change No Long Term Incentive Plan Long Term Incentive Plan pending shareholder approval Limited risk review in setting bonus pool Risk review including reports from the Chief Executive and Chief Risk Officer The Committee also considered: 2008 and 2009 annual compensation reviews: The compensation review process: The 2009 bonus pool for discretionary bonus awards: Objectives for the Chief Executive: Feedback from Institutional Investors: Tax treatment of prior year ECP awards and tax treatment of future deferred awards: and Bonus payroll tax.
Remuneration policy and 2009 performance In seeking to attract and retain talented staff, Group policy is to offer relatively modest salaries in comparison to other FTSE 100 companies.
These are infrequently adjusted and were not increased for executive Directors in 2009.
In addition, we offer non-pensionable variable rewards which can be high in years of good performance.
These are delivered in the form of an annual bonus paid out of a pool agreed each year by the Board.
There is a significant degree of three-year deferral into Schroders shares and funds.
It is now further proposed, as referred to above, to extend this concept by introducing long term performance-linked share awards.
Our 2009 results were affected by the financial crisis, with a corresponding impact on the 2009 bonus pool, which was calculated as a percentage of compensation to revenue.
The Board took the view that 2009 was nevertheless a good year for Schroders, since timely measures were taken to cut costs and grow the business at the same time.
The Board therefore decided to limit the reduction in the bonus pool to 8.7 per cent.
on a currency-adjusted basis by raising the compensation to operating revenue ratio from 45 per cent.
Since good performance during the year in generating net new business will favourably impact results in the following year, the Remuneration Committee expects the percentage of compensation to revenue to go down in 2010.
The bonus charge will for the first time in 2010, be defined as a percentage of prebonus profit before tax and exceptional items, instead of a percentage of operating revenue.
The transition is being implemented so that the sum of the bonus pool is neither increased nor decreased directly as a result of the change.
Comparability with previous years will be maintained.
Directors bonuses are not subject to individual caps.
The overall bonus pool is capped each year by the Board, as described above, and Directors bonuses are framed proportionately.
Bonus payments to executive Directors were based on targets set in advance, covering individual and team responsibilities.
These were to a large extent achieved and in many cases exceeded.
The targets covered both personal performance and the principal drivers of the business, notably superior investment performance converted by good marketing and sales into a net increase in assets under management and a positive pre-exceptionals profit before tax performance against budget.
of funds outperformed benchmark or peer group over the twelve months to 31 December 2009.
Net new business was at record levels as detailed in the business review and compared favourably with what we know of competitor performance.
Profit before tax and exceptional items was ahead of budget by 30 per cent.
Other targets included performance of Private Banking, which made tangible progress but still suffered more than the rest of the business from the financial crisis.
Objectives agreed by the Board for the Chief Executive included cost control 57 million was cut on an annualised basis before the adverse effect of 45 million due to currency fluctuations and the retention of talent needed to sustain our performance, in terms of investment | Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2009 38043 pp042-062 File0506 03 201001:05Page46 46 Remuneration report continued performance and net inflows.
The Committee was pleased to note that our retention level was satisfactory.
Management of the Companys own investment portfolio was also considered in assessing performance of the Chief Financial Officer and other executive Directors.
Despite exceptional income statement losses within revenue of 39.1 million, the Committee noted that the basic factors driving the main losses had been taken into account in the 2008 bonus round, and the underlying exceptional profit relating to 2009 was 19.1 million.
Personal performance evaluation of the Chief Executive was conducted by the Chairman, after consultation with non-executive Directors, and the Chairman summarised his conclusions to the Committee.
Evaluation of the other executive Directors was conducted by the Chief Executive, who reported to the Committee.
The Committee received a report from the Chief Risk Officer to confirm that there were no known material outstanding threats to the business.
The Committee received a year end report from the Chief Executive on the underlying business.
The Committee also received an update on bonus levels amongst competitors.
After consideration of these reports, the Committee decided on bonus payments as follows: The Chief Executives bonus declined by 11.1 per cent.
compared to the previous year.
The bonuses of other executive Directors also declined.
Bonuses for executive Directors were subject to 50 per cent.
deferral for three years in Company shares and funds, so that Directors risk forfeiture if they leave prematurely, and share in falls in the Companys share price over at least three years.
See details of the Equity Compensation Plan 2000 set out below.
The Committee approved the Chief Risk Officers bonus directly.
Bonuses for other staff were decided by the Chief Executive taking into account individual performance against objectives, the performance of the area or function of the business in which the individual worked and the levels of reward for comparable roles in the external market.
The Committee had oversight of the amounts paid to senior staff, as well as the mechanisms used to determine their levels and the proportionate amount of deferral required.
It had regular opportunities to discuss these matters with management.
The general policy is to avoid guaranteed bonuses.
None of the executive Directors has such a guarantee.
There are, however, times when guaranteed bonuses form part of the initial package necessary to recruit senior employees.
It remains the Committees practice and intention to grant share options sparingly, principally to assist in recruitment where necessary.
The balance between the fixed and variable elements of the total compensation package for each of the executive Directors was as follows: Variable deferred bonus Variable cash Fixed 33% 40% 40% 41% 44% 30% 36% 37% 37% 40% 16% 22% 37% 24% 23% Michael Alan Philip Kevin Massimo Dobson Brown Mallinckrodt Parry Tosato Fixed includes base salary, other cash payments, benefits-in-kind each as disclosed in the Directors emoluments table and pension entitlements.
| Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2009 38043 pp042-062 File0509 03 201011:17Page47 47 The Group provides its compensation in the following form: Base salary fixed For executive Directors, base salaries are adjusted infrequently.
The salary of the Chief Executive is 400,000 per annum and the salaries of the other executive Directors are set at 300,000.
Base salary is the only element of remuneration that is pensionable.
The level of contribution into the UK pension scheme is subject to a notional earnings cap see notes to the accounts Retirement benefit obligations.
Benefits Executive Directors can participate in the Groups flexible benefits plan on the same basis as other UK employees.
Two executive Directors received a taxable cash allowance in lieu of pension benefits.
Share Incentive Plan The Share Incentive Plan that was introduced in 2006 for all UK-based employees broadens the number of employee shareholders.
of UK employees including Michael Dobson, Alan Brown, Kevin Parry and Massimo Tosato participated in the Plan as at 31 December 2009.
Equity Compensation Key employees receive part of their discretionary bonus in the form of deferred Plan 2000 variable awards under the Equity Compensation Plan ECP on terms designed to align their interests with those of shareholders and to retain their services.
These awards do not give rise to any immediate entitlement but may be exercised in full from the third anniversary of the grant date provided that the participant continues to be employed by the Group.
The following forfeiture provisions apply if a participant resigns before the three years have elapsed: Completed years of service Less than 1 1 and 2 2 and 3 from date of award: Percentage of award forfeited: 100% 66.7% 33.3% In general the first 50,000 of any deferred award is provided in share awards and any balance, subject to a minimum fund award of 10,000, is delivered equally in share awards and fund awards.
The level of fund awards may vary in certain locations where local practice or legal restrictions restrict or preclude the use of fund awards.
ECP awards are not subject to further performance conditions as they are considered as already having been earned by reference to performance.
ECP Share awards Share awards can be granted over either ordinary used wherever possible or non-voting ordinary shares in the Company and are normally structured as rights to acquire shares at nil cost.
At the third anniversary of the date of grant the award is increased by 20 per cent.
If the employee chooses to leave the award within the ECP until the fifth anniversary, the award is increased by a further 11.1 per cent.
Dividends are accrued in respect of share awards after the fifth anniversary ending with the date on which awards are exercised.
No dividends are paid in respect of share awards prior to the fifth anniversary, but awards left in the ECP thereafter are adjusted to reflect dividends paid after the fifth anniversary.
Since these increases are not performance-linked, the Committee has decided not to include those increases, when the present plan is proposed for renewal next year, and instead to adjust awards to reflect dividends paid.
Share awards not previously exercised are deemed to have been exercised on the tenth anniversary of their date of grant.
During 2009 the rules of the ECP were amended to allow participants to elect to accelerate the exercise of any share awards which had not reached the fifth anniversary of the date of grant and to receive on exercise ordinary or non-voting ordinary shares subject to restrictions restricted shares.
| Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2009 38043 pp042-062 File0508 03 201018:16Page48 48 Remuneration report continued ECP Share awards The restrictions on the restricted shares mirror the restrictions on the original share continued awards, including the forfeiture provisions, and therefore shareholder approval was not required.
In February 2010 the rules were further amended to allow new awards to be granted over restricted shares.
ECP Fund awards Fund awards are notional investments in a range of Schroders investment funds and can be granted by the Committee as an alternative to share awards.
These fund awards are re-valued in line with the performance of the relevant fund and are paid out in cash upon exercise.
Fund awards not previously exercised are deemed to have been exercised on the fifth anniversary of their date of grant.
The rules of the ECP were also amended in February 2010 to allow participants to elect to accelerate the exercise of any fund awards which had not reached the third anniversary of the date of grant and to receive on exercise units in funds which are subject to restrictions restricted fund units and to allow new awards to be granted over restricted shares.
The restrictions on the restricted fund units mirror the restrictions on the original fund awards, including the forfeiture provisions.
Equity Incentive Plan The Equity Incentive Plan provides awards over shares, restricted for five years.
2008 variable If a participant resigns before the five years have elapsed forfeiture provisions will apply.
Its purpose is to increase the shareholdings of key employees below senior management, for whom the LTIP will apply.
The following forfeiture provisions apply if a participant resigns before the five years have elapsed: Completed years of service Less than 3 3 and 4 4 and 5 from date of award: Percentage of award forfeited: 100% 66.7% 33.3% Share Option Plan 2000 Under the Share Option Plan 2000, the Company grants market value share variable options over non-voting ordinary shares.
Options usually become exercisable if the option holder remains with the Group for at least three years.
For executive Directors, in line with market practice, options usually become exercisable if the performance target has been met at the third anniversary, being the Companys earnings per share growth which must be at least four per cent.
per annum above the increase in the Retail Price Index over a three-year period.
There is no retesting if the performance target is not met after three years.
Share options granted to other employees have no performance conditions.
Proposed Long-Term We are proposing to introduce a share based LTIP in order to incentivise key Incentive Plan variable employees in relation to further growth in earnings per share and net new business over four year periods.
This proposed plan requires shareholder approval which will be sought at our Annual General Meeting in May.
The Plan takes into account the views of our major shareholders.
The Plan is designed to help us in the process of targeting and linking executive rewards to longer term performance.
The Plan has stretching performance criteria.
The overall cost of remuneration will only increase once the Plan reaches the 50 per cent.
Executive Directors will have downside risk as their bonuses will be reduced by 25 per cent.

Rights to shares include the after tax value of share awards granted subject to the rules of the Equity Compensation Plan.
For each executive Director other than Kevin Parry who became an executive Director on 1 January 2009 as at 31 December 2009, based upon the share prices at close of business on that date, this target had been achieved.
Service contracts The Committees general policy is that each executive Director should have a rolling contract of employment with mutual notice periods of six months.
When recruiting executive Directors, the Committees policy is that contracts should not contain any provision for compensation upon early termination and that the parties should rely on employment rights conferred by law.
In the event that compensation for early termination is payable, the Committees policy is to seek to keep such compensation to an appropriate level.

In lieu of this, he receives a taxable cash payment of 34,467 per annum, included in the emoluments table above.
No contributions were paid by the Company during the year.
2 No contributions for Bruno Schroder have been made by the Company into the Scheme since 17 January 1993.
He began to draw his pension from the Scheme on 17 April 2007.
The values shown in this table in respect of his pension benefits are notional.
The accrued pension represents the annual pension which each Director would be entitled to receive from normal retirement age after leaving service.
The accrued pension would be increased each year until it became payable in accordance with statutory requirements.
The change in accrued pension represents the difference between the accrued pension at 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2009.
This is broken down into inflationary increases, where the inflationary increase for 2009 is shown as nil because the annual Retail Price Index figure for the measurement period, September to September, was negative, and increases arising as a result of service for the year, postponement of retirement or any change in salary.
The transfer value represents the current capital sum which is expected to be required, using longevity and financial assumptions, to provide the pension and ancillary benefits at the relevant date.
Transfer values have been calculated using assumptions set by the Scheme Trustee, having taken advice from the Scheme Actuary, in accordance with the Occupational Pension Schemes Transfer Values Amendment Regulations 2008.
The significant increase in the transfer values in 2009 are primarily due to the reduction in gilt yields over the year.
The accrued pension or transfer value shown above does not include any allowance for additional voluntary contributions made by a Director.
Defined contribution The following table gives details of the pension contributions paid or payable by the Company into defined contribution arrangements for the year to 31 December 2009.
