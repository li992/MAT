Executive remuneration explained General remuneration policy The remuneration policy for the Companys Executive Directors and other Group senior executives is shaped by the need to align the interests with the interests of MITIEs shareholders.
The policy has particular regard to the Companys and the Groups long-standing culture of encouraging equity ownership in order to achieve this alignment.
The Committee, and the Board, continue to believe that the principle of equity incentivisation has been a key driving force in the past success of the Group and that consequently, in order to maintain and develop further MITIEs performance culture, the remuneration packages of Executive Directors and other Group executives should continue to contain significant performance-related equity-based elements.
Ongoing assessment The Committee is advised by its external remuneration consultants, Kepler Associates: in addition, the Group Human Resources Director provides guidance to the Committee members.
Kepler Associates provide no other services to the Company.
The Committee tests the remuneration structure regularly to ensure that it remains aligned with business needs and is appropriately positioned relative to the market.
Benchmarking is conducted against sector and size comparators, in respect of base salary, total cash and total remuneration, provided by our external remuneration consultants.
The Committee also takes account of a range of other factors when determining appropriate salary levels including market conditions and the responsibilities and skills of the individual Directors.
The Committee believes that the executive team should be motivated by the success of the Company and as such upper quartile performance should be rewarded with an upper quartile package.
At the time of signing this report the Committee is reviewing the structure of the Executive Director remuneration package to ensure it remains appropriate for 2009.
The Committee will confirm the agreed structure following consultation with the Companys major shareholders, and disclose any changes in the 2009 10 Remuneration report.
qxd:Layout 1 28 5 09 12:19 Page 52 MITIE Group PLC 52 Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Remuneration report Remuneration package The overall package for Executive Directors consists of a fixed element salary and certain benefits and a variable element annual performance-related bonus and long-term equity-based incentives.
The balance between these fixed and variable elements is set out in this Remuneration Report.
Base salary Reviewed annually, as described above.
Benets The benefits package for the Executive Directors consists of private healthcare and the provision of a company car allowance.
Annual bonus Variable remuneration is designed to drive further MITIEs performance.
The annual bonus scheme is structured to align a significant element of the remuneration of Executive Directors with short-term Company performance.
Bonuses to Executive Directors are awarded at a maximum of 100% of base salary, dependent on the achievement of Group budgeted performance levels or performance against the budget of the respective areas of the business within the individual Directors direct control.
Targets were achieved in the year ended 31 March 2009, resulting in the payment of maximum bonuses at a rate of 100% of salary.
The Committee is currently reviewing the structure of the 2009 annual bonus and will finalise the plan following consultation with the Companys major shareholders.
Share based incentives The LTIP and the Executive Director Share-ownership Policy are designed to engender long-term decision making and sustainable growth: LTIP Historically, Executive Directors and senior executives were incentivised through a mix of options granted under the ESOS and through shareholdings in the Company acquired through equity participation in subsidiary companies of the Group that were structured in accordance with the MITIE Model.
In 2007 this policy was replaced by the sole use of awards granted under the LTIP.
Certain Executive Directors still retain options granted under the ESOS and details of this scheme can be found on page 55.
There is no re-testing of performance conditions for any incentive programme.
The LTIP was established in 2007 and is the principal equity-based incentive scheme for Executive Directors.
Awards may be granted, under a joint-ownership structure or through direct grants, in the form of nil-cost options, conditional shares or forfeitable shares.
The Committee may also decide to grant cash-based awards of an equivalent value to share-based awards or to satisfy share-based awards in cash, although it does not currently intend to do so.
An award may not be granted after 26 July 2017.
No payment other than in respect of any individual recipients electing to pay income tax and national insurance, where appropriate is required for the grant of an award.
In 2008, with the approval of shareholders, the upper limit on the market value as at grant of awards that an individual Executive Director may receive in any financial year was raised from 100% to 200% of annual base salary in that financial year.
The Committee only intends to use this upper limit in respect of awards to Ruby McGregor-Smith the Chief Executive and Suzanne Baxter the Group Finance Director and the previous upper limit of 100% of annual base salary will continue to be applied to other Executive Directors.
In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment or retention, the rules currently allow for this limit to be increased to 250% of any employees annual base salary.
As part of its review of the change in the upper grant limit, the Committee considered the introduction of a second performance target for awards of over 100% of an Executive Directors base salary.
The Committee decided against this believing it would dilute the clarity and simplicity of the scheme, and that a single target is more in keeping with the other successful equity-based incentive schemes that operate within the Group.
Awards are not transferable, except on death, and are not pensionable.
The scheme rules, in line with standard industry practice, contain provision for pro-rata vesting in the event of retirement, redundancy, disability, and or death.
In the event of a change-ofcontrol, awards will be pro-rated both for time and performance, subject to the discretion of the Committee.
The Committee continues to believe that EPS is the most appropriate long-term performance measure for MITIE.
It brings the advantages of simplicity and visibility of the value of the award which the Committee believes enhances the LTIPs effectiveness as an incentive tool.
Awards will normally vest after three years provided that certain performance criteria have been met.
All awards are subject to performance conditions that require adjusted EPS, less inflation measured by the retail prices index RPI, to exceed certain performance thresholds over a three-year period.
Where EPS growth is less than inflation plus the lower performance threshold per annum none of the awards will vest.
Awards vest in full for EPS growth equal to inflation plus the upper performance threshold.
Vesting is on a straight-line basis for performance between these levels.
For LTIP awards made in 2008, the lower and upper performance thresholds were RPI 5% p. a. and RPI 14% p. a. respectively.
The Committee is currently reviewing the EPS targets that will apply to 2009 LTIP awards to ensure that these remain stretching and achievable in the current economic climate.

Share ownership policy A share-ownership policy for Executive Directors was introduced in 2007 at the same time as the LTIP.
Under this policy, all Executive Directors are required, over time, to build and maintain a shareholding in the Company worth 100% of base salary.
During 2008, this requirement was increased to 150% in respect of any Executive Director who is granted an LTIP award of more than 100% of their base salary.
The Committee recognises that the principal mechanism for building up this holding will be on the exercise of LTIP awards and accordingly, until such time as the shareholding requirement is met, Executive Directors will be expected to retain no fewer than 50% of shares net of taxes that vest under the LTIP.
For the coming year, we do not propose to amend the share ownership policy.

The remuneration level for the role was last reviewed in 2007, following receipt of advice from external R remuneration consultants in relation to market comparators, and was maintained at the level paid to the previous Chairman on the appointment of Roger Matthews on 31 July 2008.
S The fees for the Non-Executive Directors are set by the Chairman and the Executive Directors and they are reviewed annually.
The fee level is designed both to recognise the contribution and responsibilities of the role and to attract individuals with the experience and skills required to contribute to the future development of the Board and the Group.
The Non-Executive Directors are paid a basic fee with an additional fee for chairmanship of committees, together with expenses incurred in carrying out their duties on behalf of the Company.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Companys share schemes or the annual bonus scheme, nor do they receive pensions or ancillary benets.
Fee levels for the reporting year were maintained at 2007 levels.
Further details of fees paid to Non-Executive Directors are provided in the audited section of this report.

The interests of Directors in each of these schemes is set out in Tables 4 and 5.
No options have been issued to any Directors under the MITIE Group PLC SAYE Scheme.
There has not been any variation in the terms and conditions governing any of the grants listed below since the relevant grant date.
No price is payable upon award in respect of ESOS or LTIP awards other than income tax and National Insurance in respect of certain LTIP awards.
Applicable exercise prices for options awarded are set out in Table 4.
The performance conditions relating to the awards to Directors detailed below are the same as for any other member of the schemes who received awards at the same time.
The share options detailed in Table 4 were granted under the ESOS and the performance conditions that applied at the date of grant require a percentage growth in the Companys earnings per share equal to or in excess of 10% per annum compound over the period from the date of grant of the option to the date on which the option first becomes exercisable.
Since the grant to Ruby McGregor-Smith and Suzanne Baxter detailed in Table 4, there have been no grants to Directors under the ESOS both the unapproved part and the HM Revenue & Customs approved part, and it is the Companys policy that equity-based incentives for Directors in the current reporting period will be based solely upon LTIP awards.
The LTIP awards made in 2007 and 2008 detailed in Table 5 are subject to the performance conditions that require adjusted EPS, less ination measured by the retail prices index RPI, to exceed certain performance thresholds over a 3-year period.
Where EPS growth is less than ination plus 5% per annum, none of the awards will vest.
Awards vest in full for EPS growth equal to ination plus 14% per annum.
Vesting will be on a straight line basis for performance between these levels.

The full beneficial interest will only transfer to the Director if the performance criteria applicable to the award are met.
Share dilution The Company has stated its intent to manage dilution rates within the ABI guidelines of 10% of issued Ordinary share capital in respect of both all-employee schemes and discretionary schemes the ESOS, LTIP and SAYE and 5% in respect of discretionary schemes the ESOS and the LTIP.
In calculating compliance with these guidelines the Company allocates available headroom on a ten-year atline basis, making adjustments for projected lapse rates and projected increases in issued share capital.
Options granted under the LTIP are satisfied through the market-purchase of shares held by MITIE Group PLC EBT 2007 and the MITIE Group PLC EBT 2008.
The potential dilution of the Companys issued share capital is set out in Table 6 in respect of all outstanding options granted under the Companys equity-based incentive schemes and which are to be satisfied through the allotment of new shares.
Table 6: Share dilution Current total dilution All share plan maximum 10% 7.7% Discretionary share plans maximum 5% 4.0% Total shareholder return performance Table 7 shows the total shareholder return performance of MITIE shares compared with the FTSE 250 and FTSE 350 Support Services indices over a 5-year period to 31 March 2009.
The Committee is of the opinion that these comparators provide a clear picture of the performance of MITIE relative to a range of companies of comparable size as well as a specic group of companies within the same sector.
Total shareholder return is calculated according to the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and assumes that all dividends are reinvested.
The market price of the Companys shares as at 31 March 2009 was 187.00p.
The highest and lowest prices during the year were 245.00p and 158.25p respectively.

Directors interests in shares Tables 8 and 9 detail the beneficial interests of the Directors who were in ofce on 31 March 2009 in the share capital of the Company and in the share capital of certain of the Companys subsidiary companies respectively.
The interests of Directors in these subsidiary companies were acquired under the MITIE Model, further details of which are given in the Directors and governance report on page 47.
No such interests have been acquired by Directors since 2004 and it is the Companys policy that Directors will not be entitled to participate in any MITIE Model investments in the current reporting period.
