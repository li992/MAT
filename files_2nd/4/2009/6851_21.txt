Directors remuneration report Composition of the remuneration committee The remuneration committee is appointed by the board.
At the start of the year the committee comprised Howard Phillips as chairman, Norman Murray and Jane Scriven.
With the retirement of Howard Phillips from the board on 2 September 2008, Norman Murray took over as chairman and Ian Durant was appointed as the third member.
All of the committee members during the year were regarded by the board as independent non-executive directors.
Terms of reference and reporting The committee determines, and annually reviews, all elements of executive directors remuneration.
It approves all contracts of executive directors, and any compensation arrangements arising from their termination.
It also approves all grants of share options and LTIP allocations to directors and executives and reviews best practice in executive remuneration.
The committee is made aware of the salary levels of certain senior employees.
Advisers to the remuneration committee The committee has taken external advice on general remuneration levels and comparator information from Hewitt New Bridge Street, who do not provide any other services to the company.
Advice is also obtained, where appropriate, from the companys legal advisers, Linklaters.
The committee also received internal advice from Rooney Anand, chief executive, in determining appropriate remuneration and incentive packages for the other executive directors.
Remuneration policy The company operates in a highly competitive market and must attract, motivate and retain high quality directors.
The committee considers current market practice and makes comparisons with turnover, market capitalisation and operational details against a selection of other companies.
The committee has regard to pay and conditions elsewhere within the group.
No director makes a decision relating to his own remuneration.
Individual directors leave the meeting when their own remuneration is being discussed.
A significant proportion of each executive directors potential remuneration is performance related, thus aligning the directors interests with those of shareholders and encouraging performance at the highest levels.
Components of directors remuneration The remuneration package of each executive director consists of the following elements: Annual pay Annual pay reects the responsibilities, market value and sustained performance level of executive directors.
Pay is reviewed annually or when a change in responsibility occurs.
Benets in kind The range of taxable benets available to executive directors is listed on page 79.
Bonus Bonus payments are determined by the remuneration committee and awarded where justied by performance.
For the financial year 2008 09 and for future financial years, the executive directors have been and will be eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus, the maximum amount being 100% of annual pay, for the achievement of stretch targets.
The targets are a combination of personal and financial performance objectives agreed in advance by the committee, with the financial targets relating to operating profit and profit before tax and exceptional items and specic business unit related targets.
There has been a long-standing practice of the targets being set before the start of the year and then being subject to a mid-year review, where appropriate, to take account of the effect of changes to the size of the estate following acquisitions and divestments since the start of the year, internal transfers and changes in market conditions with adjustments made up or down to ensure that they remain appropriately challenging.
At this half-year review, the committee took the view that there had been such a sharp and unforeseen change to the external economic situation which had created such unprecedented trading conditions in the pub and hospitality trade that the performance targets set for the majority of executive directors had been mis-calibrated and could conceivably encourage undue risk taking in suggesting to executives that such targets remained appropriate.
Accordingly, it was decided that the targets should be adjusted to reect the current state of the market so as to encourage the executives to deliver improved performance against stretching second half targets for the financial year.
In addition to setting revised targets, the available quantum was scaled back below 100% of salary for the remaining period.
In cases where targets were adjusted, it was decided that one-third of any net bonus payment paid should be in shares and deferred.
This will stretch the time-horizon of the bonus over the deferral period to help ensure that the value of any bonus earned based on financial performance in the second half of the year would be impacted by future performance affecting the value of the shares encouraging a longer-term perspective.
This would also reduce the risk prole of the bonus plan and act as a lock-in mechanism, as the deferred shares will be forfeited in the event that the relevant director leaves the group, other than as a good leaver, before the end of December 2010.
The bonus payable to Justin Adams will not be subject to deferral as his original business unit targets were considered sufciently achievable and yet still challenging in the current climate and were therefore left unchanged.
GREENE KING PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 09 Pension Tim Bridge is now a pensioner member of the groups dened benefit pension scheme.
His pension is equivalent to 1 45th of his final pensionable earnings for each year of service, with a pro rata payment for a part year, subject to HMRC limits.
His final pensionable earnings were those received immediately prior to him ceasing to be chief executive.
The pension arrangements for Rooney Anand, Justin Adams, Ian Bull, David Elliott and Jonathan Lawson are on a dened contribution basis.
They all have self-invested personal pension schemes to which the company makes a contribution.
The contribution rates are 25% for Rooney Anand, as chief executive, and David Elliott, on an age-related basis, and 20% for the remainder of the executive directors.
No element of remuneration other than annual pay is treated as pensionable and the retirement age for the schemes is 60.
Justin Adams, David Elliott and Jonathan Lawson participate in a group death-in-service insurance scheme.
Death benets in excess of the HMRC maximum, where applicable, were provided through additional insurance.
Since A-Day, life assurance provision for Rooney Anand and Ian Bull has been through an HMRC approved excepted life policy.
The cost of this insurance is disclosed as a non-cash benefit in the emoluments table below.
Long-term incentives In previous years executive directors and other senior employees have been awarded long-term incentives in the form of share options and restricted or conditional awards of shares under the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP awards.
The annual award levels for executive directors have been 1x salary for each type of award.
Both awards have been subject to an EPS-based performance condition.
Two changes are proposed to the companys long-term incentive award strategy for 2009 10.
The first change relates to the type of award, where it is proposed to grant only LTIP awards, rather than a mix of options and LTIP awards.
The grant of LTIP awards alone will create a simple and cohesive reward structure, help provide greater line of sight between performance and reward than share options which can be highly volatile and provide a stronger alignment with the interests of shareholders.
The move to granting LTIP awards alone is not intended to increase the value of the long-term incentive awards overall.
To calculate the value of the increase to the LTIP awards by the value of the option foregone, an option valuation methodology has been used.
On this basis, the value of a share option is approximately one-third of the value of an LTIP award and it is therefore proposed to increase the grant level for LTIP awards to 133% of base salary.
As set out in the AGM notice, shareholder approval is being sought to increase the individual limit in the rules of the LTIP from 100% of salary, to facilitate this policy.
If shareholder approval is given, it is intended that no further share options will be granted under the executive share option scheme in the immediate future.
However, the committee wishes to retain the exibility to use the scheme again in exceptional circumstances if the business strategy supports its future use.
The companys major shareholders will be consulted if any proposed future use of share options would result in an increase in total remuneration.
The second change relates to the performance conditions to be applied to the LTIP awards.
Rather than one EPS-based performance target, there will be two performance conditions applying to distinct parts of the award, one being an adjusted EPS-based condition and the other based on adjusted free cash ow.
The use of two separate financial performance conditions will provide a more rounded assessment of financial performance.
For awards in 2009 and for the foreseeable future the company intends to use both conditions measured over a three year period.
To emphasise the importance of cash management as a medium-term business priority there will be a 60:40 weighting in favour of the cash measure.
The adjusted earnings per share part of the performance condition will be based on a sliding scale range of pence per share targets for the 2011 12 year end, with between 0% and 100% of that part of the award vesting depending on the extent to which the targets are met.
Earnings per share has been retained as it is the key measure of company profitability and the range to be set will, in the view of the remuneration committee, be appropriately challenging bearing in mind the current business climate.
For the three-year adjusted free cash ow measure it is proposed that the following denition will be adopted: net cash ow from operating activities less capital expenditure.
Net cash ow from operating activities will include the impact of changes in working capital, and interest and tax payments, but will be adjusted to exclude exceptional items at the discretion of the remuneration committee in consultation with the audit committee.
The deduction from the free cash ow measure will be for capital expenditure on properties that were within the estate at the beginning of the performance measurement period, where that capital expenditure has not been funded from property disposal proceeds.
Free cash ow has been chosen as a performance condition because converting EBITDA to positive cash ows to support debt repayment, continued investment in the business and the ongoing payment of dividends is a key measure for both management and shareholders.
A range will be set for the three year aggregate adjusted cash ow, with between 0% and 100% of that part of the award vesting, depending on the extent to which the targets are met.
Measuring on an aggregate three-year basis rather than the more common approach of focusing on the end year only of the three ensures that there will be a focus on delivering cash across all three years.
In each case the precise details of the target range will be determined over this summer in the light of the rights issue and announced if shareholder approval is granted to the changes to the LTIP rules referred to above.
The remuneration committee will continue to review the propriety of performance measures each time future awards are granted.
To the extent that any substantial changes are proposed, the company will consult with its major shareholders in advance.
