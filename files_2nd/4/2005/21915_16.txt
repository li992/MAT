Foreign currency risk The Group invests in overseas securities and holds short-term foreign currency cash balances both of which gives rise to currency risks.
It is not the Groups usual policy to hedge this risk.
However, in the run-up to the referenda on the proposed new European Constitution forward Euro positions were taken to minimise the risk of a detrimental effect on the value of Euro denominated investments and the gain on this has been taken to capital.
Contingencies, guarantees and financial commitments At 30 September 2005 the Group had no contingent liability in respect of any investments carrying an obligation for future subscription or underwriting commitments 2004: nil.
