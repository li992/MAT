The total emoluments reported for 2005 exclude retirement contributions made by the company to the pension schemes as detailed on page 56 which in 2004 were paid as a salary supplement included within total emoluments.
Retirement contributions were paid on behalf of Mr Mackay and Mr Wyman to the extent allowed by the earnings cap, in the amounts of 57,528 2004: 5,436 and 64,260 2004: 58,440 respectively, and contributions in excess of the earnings cap were 162,972 2004: 50,400 and 70,740 2004: 3,930 respectively.

Mr Mackay receives an annual fee of 60,000 which he is permitted to retain, relating to his appointment as a non-executive director of Reckitt Benckiser plc.
A proportion of this fee is applied to the purchase of Reckitt Benckiser plc ordinary shares.
From the date of his appointment on 25 February 2005 and up until 31 March 2005, he will have received a pro-rata amount of the annual fee.
The items included within benets are given on page 56.
Share incentive plans The interests of the executive directors in shares of the company provided in the form of options and awards since listing on 8 March 1999 are shown in the tables below, which have been audited.
During the year to 31 March 2005 the highest and lowest market prices for the companys shares were 895.0p and 580.0p respectively and the market price on 31 March 2005 was 828.5p.
The tables below contain the aggregate expected values of each option grant or performance share award.
The expected values of grants and awards made prior to November 2002 are the values previously disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Reports up to 2003 and were calculated by Mercer.
The expected values for the grants and awards made in 2003 and 2004 have been calculated by Mercer using: A binomial valuation model for the options that uses daily share price data and takes account of the option grant date, exercise price and risk-free rate of return, with assumptions as to dividend yield, future volatility and forfeiture: and A Monte Carlo simulation model for the performance share awards using the same inputs and assumptions as for the binomial model, but which projects, many thousands of times, the share price of the company along with the share prices of the comparator group stocks to determine correlations between the companies.
This produces a distribution of share prices and TSR rankings thus allowing complex market based hurdles to be modelled.
The methods of calculation of fair values have not been audited by .
