DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Remuneration Committee The remuneration policy is determined by the Board and is described below.
The Remuneration Committee of the Board is composed of the nonexecutive directors Mr W W Rhodes, Mr M T Davies, Mr N G Hannah and Mr J H Holt the Committee.
Mr Davies took over from Mr Rhodes as Chairman of the Committee on 1 July 2005.
Sir Nigel Rudd attended only the January 2005 meeting as a member of the Committee.
The Committee recommends to the Board the specific remuneration packages for executive directors.
All of its recommendations made to the Board during the year were accepted.
The Committee meets as often as necessary to discharge its duties, which during 2005 was three times.
Details of members attendance are set out in the Corporate Governance report on page 17.
Advisers During 2005 the Committee appointed New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, who are independent remuneration consultants, to provide specialist advice.
They provided no other type of services to Pendragon.
Sir Nigel Rudd and Mr T G Finn provided internal advice to the Committee but not in respect of their own pay.
The secretary to the Committee is Hilary Sykes.
Remuneration policy and policy review During 2005 the Committee carried out a full review of its policy on executive directors remuneration.
This was driven partly by investor feedback at the time of the 2005 Annual General Meeting, but primarily by the need to ensure the retention and continued motivation of Pendragons highly successful executive team.
The results of this review are summarised below and will be submitted to the shareholders for approval at the 2006 AGM: annual bonus will not count for future pension accrual: executive directors will be offered the opportunity to take a cost equivalent salary supplement instead of continued participation in the Pendragon Pension Plan: annual bonus for 2006 will be assessed solely on group financial and operational targets: and a new Long Term Incentive Plan is being proposed to shareholders and would replace executive share options for executive directors.
The companys policy on non-executive directors remuneration is reviewed annually by the Board.
Remuneration for non-executive directors is confined to basic salary without a performance related element.
Non-executive directors may elect to receive all or part of their remuneration in the form of benefits in kind, typically the provision of a motor vehicle for their use.
The Board does not foresee any variation to the policy for the non-executive directors in the forthcoming year.
Total remuneration The companys policy in respect of executive directors remuneration recognises the need to attract and retain directors with levels of remuneration that are arrived at responsibly and reflect their individual contribution and value to the company.
The remuneration policy places great emphasis on ensuring that the executive directors incentive arrangements have the potential to provide a greater reward than base salary.
Combined with an approach that requires all incentive arrangements to be linked directly to business specific measures, this ensures that rewards will be based on the continued creation of shareholder value.
Further, in order to promote retention and sustained corporate performance, an equal emphasis will normally be placed on short-term and long-term rewards.
Importance of share ownership The company recognises the importance and value of having executive directors who are significant shareholders in the company.
To promote this goal for the next generation of executive directors, during 2005, the company has adopted share ownership guidelines.
These guidelines encourage executive directors to hold shares worth 100% of salary 200% of salary for the chief executive within three years of being appointed to the Board.
26 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED The following table shows the directors' interest in shares not subject to audit : 31 December 2005 31 December 2004 Shares Shares Sir Nigel Rudd 1,830,000 1,800,000 T G Finn 2,903,127 2,903,127 M S Casha 823,837 823,837 W W Rhodes 656,672 656,672 D R Forsyth 301,302 301,302 H C Sykes 213,327 187,500 N G Hannah 198,173 198,173 J H Holt 25,000 25,000 M T Davies 20,000 10,000 There were no changes to the directors interests shown above between 31 December 2005 and the date of this report.
Base salary Base salaries are reviewed annually and are set by reference to the individuals skill, experience and contribution and the scale of managerial responsibility.
The 2006 salaries were provisionally set on this basis and then New Bridge Street Consultants were then asked to review them against the market.
The benchmarking results showed that the proposed salaries were around or below the median of appropriate benchmarks.
The Committee was reassured by this result and is satisfied that the variable pay opportunity outweighs the salary positioning.
Benefits Life assurance, private health cover, professional subscriptions, contribution to home telephone costs and the provision of two cars, one of which is fully expensed, are provided to the executive directors.
Pensions The executive directors currently participate in the Pendragon Pension Plan which is a company sponsored non-contributory defined benefit arrangement.
The companys approach to pensionable earnings attracted criticism from investors last year as a result of the inclusion of annual bonus in the definition of pensionable salary.
The Committee, mindful of this criticism and of impending changes to pension scheme tax legislation, will provide executive directors with the following choice: remain in the defined benefit arrangements, with annual bonuses being excluded from the definition of pensionable salary for future pension accrual: or leave the current defined benefit pension arrangements and take a cash allowance in lieu of future pension benefits.
In calculating the level of the salary supplement the Committee has been mindful to ensure that the net effect would be broadly cost neutral for the company, with the cash allowance based on the expected cost of funding the current defined benefit pension promise.
This has translated to a cash allowance of circa 26% of salary for executive directors who opt for this choice.
The salary supplement will not be consolidated into base salary for the purposes of future annual bonus payments and long term incentive awards.
Annual bonus As part of the remuneration review, the Committee concluded that, for 2006, all of the executive directors annual bonus potential will be based on corporate financial and operational measures.
The maximum bonus that will be payable in any one year remains at 100% of the directors salary.
Bonus awards at the highest available percentage of salary are made only upon achievement of outstanding performance.
As explained above, in 2006 and future years, bonuses will not be pensionable.
Annual bonuses for 2005 were awarded in accordance with criteria set earlier in the year.
27 Equity incentives The Committee has proposed to shareholders that a new Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP be adopted by the Company.
A detailed description of the LTIP is given in the circular to shareholders accompanying the Notice of Annual General Meeting, but in summary the key features are: under the LTIP, the executive may be granted performance share awards worth up to 100% of base salary per annum: the vesting of performance share awards will occur on the third anniversary of the grant date, provided that the executive is still employed by the company and the same performance conditions as described below have been satisfied: each year, commencing with bonuses paid in 2006, an executive director may choose to re-invest his annual bonus in purchasing Pendragon shares of an amount up to 100% of salary, which will then be matched with an award over shares with the same pre-tax value as the monies used to buy the shares: matching share awards will vest on the third anniversary of their grant date a provided the executive is still employed by Pendragon: b to the extent that a performance condition has been satisfied: and c to the extent that the associated shares purchased by the executive have been retained for the three years: the performance condition or conditions will be tailored to the long-term performance of the company.
All awards will be subject to performance conditions that reflect the companys performance over a single fixed three year period the performance period, beginning on the first day of the financial year in which awards are granted.
For grants in 2006, the performance conditions will be based on the companys normalised earnings per share EPS growth in excess of the retail price index RPI, over the performance period and the vesting schedule will be: 2008 EPS Vesting percentage less than RPI 12% 0% RPI 12% 30% RPI 30% or more 100% between RPI 12% and RPI 30% straight-line vesting between 30% and 100% In addition, these EPS growth targets will be underpinned by a requirement that the companys total shareholder return TSR outperforms the FTSE 350 total return index over the performance period.
TSR calculations will be averaged over a three monthly period immediately prior to both the beginning and the end of the performance period.
although the Committee would have preferred to use bespoke performance measures, practically this is not possible at this time due to the potential acquisitions under consideration.
The Committee has therefore adopted EPS for the 2006 award as the main performance condition because it is an internal performance measure which can be calibrated at this time.
The Committee concluded that these were stretching objectives, both in the context of the challenges facing the company and of performance in the wider market: and the company has also chosen EPS as the performance measure because:- the company has relatively few direct competitors and therefore choosing a total shareholder return peer group would be problematic EPS is the most common internal performance measure used in the market by companies of a similar size to Pendragon the EPS performance condition is considered to be very stretching.
Share options Executive directors have historically participated in the Pendragon 1999 Approved Executive Share Option Scheme, which is an HM Revenue and Customs approved scheme, and the Pendragon 1999 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme the Executive Schemes, each of which was approved at the companys 1999 Annual General Meeting.
Options become exercisable between three and ten years after grant subject to fulfilment of the performance conditions set out in the notes to the table on page 29 of this Report.
No variation has been made during the financial year in the terms and conditions of the share options or the Executive Schemes.
The last award to executive directors under the Executive Schemes was made in 2003.
28 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Changes from previous year If supported by shareholders the LTIP will replace the grant of executive share options to the executive directors.
The executive directors will continue to be eligible to participate in the company's all-employee sharesave scheme.
Discretionary share options granted under the Executive Schemes the exercise of which is conditional on the companys adjusted earnings per share over the three consecutive financial years, beginning with the financial year in which the option is granted, exceeding by at least 3 per cent per annum compound the increase in the Retail Prices Index over the same period.
When determining the extent to which the EPS performance targets have been met under the Executive Schemes, the Committee will seek guidance from external advisors on the effect of the move to International Financial Reporting Standards and will endeavour to ensure consistency of measurement over the relevant performance period.

The aggregate gain made by the directors on share options exercised during 2005 was 7,080.
Share price information and performance not subject to audit There are no other share option or long term incentive schemes for which the directors are eligible.
The middle market price of Pendragon PLC ordinary sales at 30 December 2005 was 512 pence and the range during the year was 264 pence to 525 pence.
29 Directors service contracts All four of the executive directors have service contracts that commenced on 20 December 1999 and do not have an expiry date but can be terminated on giving one year's notice.
No changes to the terms of the executive directors service have been made during the year.
The appointment to the Board of any further executive directors would be expected to be on similar terms.
Each of the executive directors contracts includes protection for the director in the event of a termination arising from a change of control.
Compensation of one year's salary and benefits, together with the value of the maximum annual bonus is payable if the director or the acquirer serves notice of termination within six months of a change of control.
Bearing in mind the consolidation being witnessed in the motor retailing sector at present, the company continues to believe that these provisions are appropriate.
These provisions will be reviewed annually and it is not necessarily the case that any executive director appointed to the Board in the future would be afforded this protection.
Copies of the individual contracts of appointment are available for inspection by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Non-executive directors Each non-executive director has a fixed two year contract, renewable upon expiry at the company's discretion.
When making a decision on reappointment, the Board reviews the non-executive director's attendance and performance at meetings and the composition and skills of the Board as a whole.
Individual details of contracts are: Name Commencement Expiry Sir Nigel Rudd 01.01.06 31.12.07 W W Rhodes 01.01.06 31.12.07 N G Hannah 01.01.05 31.12.06 J H Holt 01.01.06 31.12.07 M T Davies 18.10.04 31.12.06 Consistent with the policy for executive directors, the contracts include a provision that the non-executive director will be entitled to a year's total fees and benefits if the contract is terminated by either party following a change of control.

Total shareholder return not subject to audit The graph below shows the growth in total shareholder return on the companys shares in comparison to the FTSE 350 Index excluding investment companies.
For the purposes of the graph, total shareholder return has been calculated as the percentage change during the relevant period in the market price of the shares, assuming that any dividends paid are reinvested.
The relevant period is the five years ending 31 December 2005.

The other points plotted are the values at intervening financial year-ends.
The FTSE 350 Index was chosen because the company is a member of this index.
excluding investment trusts Whilst reporting on remuneration issues, I am pleased to advise that below Board level, on average, approximately 25% of the companys payroll costs related to team incentives, reflecting the performance culture that exists throughout the company.
In addition, as at 31 December 2005, 22% of the companys team members were participants in one or more of its share based incentive plans.
