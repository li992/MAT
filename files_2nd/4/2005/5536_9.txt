Directors Remuneration Report INFORMATION NOT SUBJECT TO AUDIT: Remuneration Committee and advisers The Companys Remuneration Committee the Committee is composed entirely of independent non-executive directors and is chaired by Mr A J Stewart, its other members being Mr D A Harding and Mrs S E Murray.
During the year Mr M F Garner resigned from the Committee, prior to retiring from the Board.
No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest in the matters being decided.
Mr H V Reid and Mr G E Tuppen attend meetings at the invitation of the Committee if necessary except when their own remuneration is being discussed.
The Committees key objectives are to: Determine and recommend to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, an overall remuneration package for executive directors.
Monitor the level and structure of remuneration for senior management.
The Committee has been constituted and operated throughout the year in accordance with the provisions of Schedule A and B of the Combined Code.
This report also complies with Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 which incorporates the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
During the year the Committee and the Company has continued to use the services of Ernst & Young LLP E&Y and they have provided specific advice on remuneration matters relating to share schemes and the Enterprise Inns Incentive Plans.
E&Y are the Groups auditors and also provide advisory services in respect of non-audit matters and taxation.
In addition the Remuneration Committee has sought advice relating to directors remuneration and the Enterprise Inns Incentive Plan 2005 from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP who provide no other services to the Company save in respect of advice in connection with the operation of the Companys incentive schemes.
The Committee, amongst other matters, determines the level of awards made under the Companys incentive plans, considers feedback from shareholders and undertakes an annual review of its effectiveness.
Remuneration Policy Executive Directors The Remuneration Committees policy is designed to ensure that the level and structure of remuneration arrangements allows the Company to attract, retain and motivate the exceptional individuals required to continue to enhance shareholder value.
Base salaries will be set accordingly, with a significant proportion of executives remuneration performance-related so that appropriate levels of reward are available for outstanding performance.
In addition, the Committee is, at all times, mindful of remuneration practices in other relevant companies.
To achieve this, the remuneration package comprises: Fixed Elements: comprising basic salary, benefits and pensions: and Performance Related Elements: comprising short-term performance related cash and deferred share bonuses and long-term performance arrangements satisfied by the award of shares.
The Committee believes that these arrangements provide rewards which reflect an appropriate balance between individual and Group performance and aligns the rewards to executive directors with the long-term interest of shareholders.
These awards are satisfied by the use of existing shares held by an Employee Benefit Trust.
Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2005 27 Directors Remuneration Report A significant proportion of the executive directors remuneration is linked to performance.
For all future awards of long-term incentives the Committee believes that it is appropriate for a mixture of average compound annual adjusted Earnings per Share EPS growth and Total Shareholder Return TSR targets to apply to awards for the following reasons: The adjusted EPS growth targets will encourage the executive team to deliver substantial annual adjusted EPS growth over the three year performance period.
The TSR targets will require the Company to deliver returns to shareholders in excess of its FTSE 100 peers.
The Committee will seek independent advice to determine the extent to which the adjusted EPS growth and TSR targets are met.
The details of individual components of the remuneration package and service contracts are as follows: Basic salary and benefits Basic salary is a fixed cash sum payable monthly.
The basic salary and benefits are reviewed annually.
Benefits principally comprise car allowances or the use of a motor car, fuel and private medical insurances.
Pensions The pension contributions are amounts paid to the directors individual defined contribution schemes.
Current Enterprise Inns Incentive Plans the Plans For the year in review the Company had the following relevant Plans: At the Annual General Meeting held on 21 January 1997 an ordinary resolution was passed adopting the Enterprise Inns Incentive Plan the 1997 Plan, which provides for participants to earn nonpensionable cash bonuses and short-term and long-term incentives.
At the Annual General Meeting held on 24 January 2002 an ordinary resolution was passed adopting the Enterprise Inns Incentive Plan 2002 the 2002 Plan.
The 2002 Plan also provides for participants to earn non-pensionable cash bonuses and short-term and long-term share incentives.
At the Annual General Meeting held on 20 January 2005 ordinary resolutions were passed adopting the Enterprise Inns 2005 Annual Bonus Plan and the Enterprise Inns 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan the 2005 Plans.
The 2005 Plans have replaced the 1997 Plan and the 2002 Plan and no further awards will be made except under the 2005 Plan.
Further details of the Plans are set out below: Short-term share incentives under the 2002 Plan Under the terms of the 2002 Plan the short-term incentive depends upon achievement of annual growth in adjusted EPS measured against RPI.
There is a one year performance period for awards.
No short-term award is made unless adjusted EPS growth exceeds RPI by at least 2.5% over the performance period.
To achieve the maximum award of 20% of salary, adjusted EPS growth must exceed RPI by 15%.
Awards between the minimum and maximum limits are calculated on a straight-line basis pro rata to the growth in adjusted EPS between the minimum and maximum targets.
Short-term incentives may not ordinarily be exercised for 36 months after the end of the performance criteria period.
Performance related and short-term share incentives under the 2005 Plan Under the terms of the 2005 Plan executive directors are eligible to participate in an annual cash bonus scheme as determined by the Committee.
The maximum award level under the Bonus Plan for the Chief Executive is 100% of salary.
For the other executive directors the maximum award level is 75% of salary.
In addition awards under the Bonus Plan are subject to demanding Company performance targets such that no less than 75% of an executives bonus will be subject to a sliding scale of challenging annual adjusted EPS growth targets, with no more than 25% subject to challenging personal targets.
60% of any bonus earned will be paid in cash, with the remaining 40% deferred into shares a Deferred Share Award which may not ordinarily be exercised for 36 months after the end of the performance criteria period.
Awards between the minimum and maximum limits are calculated on a straight-line basis pro rata to the growth in adjusted EPS growth between the minimum and maximum targets.
The cash bonus awards for the year are shown in the remuneration table on page 32.
28 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2005 Directors Remuneration Report Long-term share incentives under the 1997 Plan Under the 1997 Plan, the long-term incentive awards ordinary shares to participants upon achievement of compound growth in adjusted EPS measured against RPI over 3 years.
To qualify for any award, adjusted EPS growth must exceed RPI over a three year period by 5% compound 15.8% simple, and to qualify for the maximum award of 50% of salary averaged over a three year period, adjusted EPS growth must exceed RPI over a three year period by 15% compound 52.1% simple.
Long-term incentives may not ordinarily be exercised until 24 months after the end of the performance criteria period.
Long-term share incentives under the 2002 Plan Under the 2002 Plan, the long-term incentive awards ordinary shares to participants upon achievement of compound growth in adjusted EPS measured against RPI over 3 years.
To qualify for any award adjusted EPS growth must exceed RPI over a three year period by 5% compound 15.8% simple, and to qualify for the maximum award of 100% of salary averaged over a three year period, adjusted EPS growth must exceed RPI over a three year period by 20% compound 72.8% simple.
Long-term share incentives under the 2005 Plans Under the 2005 Plan, the long-term incentive has two elements: an award of Performance Shares worth up to 150% of salary each year : and an award of Matching Shares linked to the co-investment of up to 25% of salary in Investment shares, which are then matched on a 2:1 basis.
Shares that can count as Investment Shares are: shares subject to the Deferred Share Award under the 2005 Bonus Plan shares acquired by participants using their cash bonus or other funds, up to the 25% of salary maximum.
Awards vest subject to the satisfaction of a sliding scale of average compound annual adjusted EPS growth targets and the Companys TSR performance against the FTSE 100.
More specifically, awards only vest in full if the Companys average compound annual adjusted EPS growth over a three year performance period following grant is at least 15% and the Companys TSR ranking against the FTSE 100 is in the upper quintile.
Awards vest in three equal tranches on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant.
The Performance and Matching Share Awards are subject to the same performance conditions.
For awards made in 2004 05 one half of an award will be subject to a performance condition based on an average compound annual adjusted EPS growth.
The EPS based condition will measure the Companys average compound annual adjusted EPS growth by comparing the Companys adjusted EPS for the year prior to the date of grant the base year with the adjusted EPS for the third financial year following the base year, such that awards will vest as follows: Level of match under the relevant portion of Matching Award Average compound annual Percentage of relevant portion of Matching Award Shares: adjusted EPS growth Performance Award that vests Investment Shares Less than 7% 0% 0:1 7% 20% 0.4:1 15% 100% 2:1 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2005 29 Directors Remuneration Report Straight-line vesting will occur if average compound annual adjusted EPS growth is between 7% and 15%.
The remaining half of the award will be subject to a TSR condition which compares the Companys TSR performance over the three year period commencing on the date of grant with the TSR of the FTSE 100 as at the date of grant as follows: Level of match under the relevant portion of Matching Award Companys TSR Percentage of relevant portion of Matching Award Shares: ranking v the FTSE 100 Performance Award that vests Investment Shares Below median 0% 0:1 Median 20% 0.4:1 Upper quintile 100% 2:1 Straight-line vesting will occur if the Companys TSR ranking is between median and upper quintile.
TSR will be calculated by averaging the Net Return Index of each company over the six month period prior to grant and vesting, unless the Committee determines that a shorter or longer period is a more appropriate way of ensuring that the condition constitutes a fair measure of the Companys TSR performance over the period.
In addition, irrespective of the Companys TSR performance, no part of this portion of the award will vest unless the Companys adjusted EPS grows by at least 10% over the performance period, unless the Committee believes that it is inappropriate to apply this underpin.
For the avoidance of doubt, if both the threshold TSR hurdle of median performance against the FTSE 100 and the threshold adjusted EPS growth hurdle of 7% average compound annual adjusted growth are met, at least 20% of the total award will vest.
Remuneration Policy Non-executive directors Fees: The fees for non-executive directors are determined by the Board within the limits in the Articles of Association.
The non-executive directors are not involved in any discussions or decision about their own remuneration.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors takes the form solely of fees, which are set by the Board having taken advice on appropriate levels.
Service contracts: The Companys policy is for all executive directors to have a service contract of no fixed term under which they are entitled to receive twelve months notice of termination.
There are no special provisions in the executive directors contracts for compensation in the event of loss of office.
The Committee would consider the circumstances of any individual case of early termination and would determine compensation payments accordingly.
A fair but robust principle of mitigation would be applied to the payment of compensation in the context of professional advice received as to contractual entitlement.
