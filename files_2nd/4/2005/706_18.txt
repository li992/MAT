54 Alliance UniChem Plc Board report on remuneration The remuneration committee the committee determines the remuneration of the Chairman and the executive Directors and makes recommendations to the Board for any changes to the terms and conditions of employment of executive Directors.
The committee consists of three independent non-executive Directors: Kenneth Clarke committee Chairman, Neil Cross, and Adrian Loader.
Patrick Ponsolle resigned from the committee in July 2005, having up until that date been a member of three Board committees.
Paolo Scaroni, Ian Meakins and Stefano Pessina attend meetings by invitation in advisory capacities, but are not present when their own remuneration is discussed.
Remuneration policy The aim of the Groups remuneration policy is to attract, retain and motivate the highest calibre of executive Directors and senior executives, aligning the rewards of those individuals with the interests of shareholders by linking a substantial part of their remuneration package to the performance of the Group and the creation of long-term shareholder value.
In implementing the remuneration policy, the committee has considered the principles of the Code with regard to Directors remuneration.
In accordance with the remuneration policy, the remuneration of executive Directors is made up of a combination of basic salary, non-cash benefits, annual performance bonus, long-term incentive plan benefits, and pension benefits, all of which are detailed below.
The executive Directors remuneration is reviewed at the end of each calendar year.
No Director is permitted to vote in respect of their own remuneration.
Service contracts Ian Meakins, George Fairweather, and Steve Duncan are employed under service contracts that can be terminated by either party with notice of 12 months.
Stefano Pessina and Ornella Barra have service contracts that can be terminated by the Group with notice of 12 months or by each of them with notice of six months.
There are provisions in the service contracts for payment of current basic salary in lieu of the required notice period to terminate a service contract.
Were the situation to arise, the Company intends to apply the principle of mitigation to any payment on termination of a Directors service contract, and is contractually entitled to apply this principle in the case of Ian Meakins.
Per Utnegaard resigned from the Board on 17 March 2005.
His emoluments for the year as a Director and employee and his payment for loss of office are set out in the emoluments section of this report.
The principle of mitigation was not applicable as his departure was not as a result of unsatisfactory performance.
The dates of the executive Directors current service contracts are: Director Contract date I. K. Meakins 16 September 2004 S. Pessina 10 December 2002 G. R. Fairweather 28 March 2002 O. Barra 10 December 2002 S. W. J. Duncan 29 December 1995 The Company recognises that its executive Directors may be invited to become non-executive Directors of other listed companies and that such duties can broaden experience and knowledge which benefit the Company.
Executive Directors are therefore allowed to accept one external non-executive appointment with the Companys prior approval, as long as this is not in any way connected with the Companys business and would not lead to any conflict of interest.
Fees received by the Director may be retained.
Stefano Pessina is a non-executive Director of Galenica, an associate company.
He waived his entitlement to fees as part of the agreement with Galenica on reciprocal board representation.
George Fairweather is a non-executive Director of Mitchells & Butlers and retained fees paid of 49,500 in 2005 for that appointment.
Ian Meakins was a non-executive Director of mmO2 until March 2005, for which he retained fees paid of 12,500 in 2005 for that appointment.
Jeff Harris, who retired from the Board in April 2005, is a member of the supervisory board of Andreae-Noris Zahn, an associate company.
Salaries The setting of basic salary reflects the committees assessment of the market rate for relevant positions, taking into account the levels of responsibility, the individual Directors experience and their contribution to the Group.
For determining basic salary in 2005 and 2006, the committee appointed and received advice from  PwC.
PwC provide remuneration and other consultancy services directly to the Company.
The amount paid to each Director in 2005 is detailed in the emoluments section on page 56.
55 Alliance UniChem Plc Following a report from PwC in December 2005, the remuneration committee reviewed salaries payable to the executive Directors based on market related base salary data from a comparator group of companies consisting of 20 companies from the 25 smallest FTSE 100 companies by market capitalisation excluding financial companies and 20 companies from the 25 largest FTSE 250 companies by market capitalisation excluding financial companies the Comparator Group.
Salary increases, which are effective from 1 January 2006, were based on this data after taking account of the performance of each Director.
Executive Directors basic salaries at 1 January 2006 are as follows: Director I. K. Meakins 670,000 S. Pessina 510,000 G. R. Fairweather 390,000 O. Barra 330,000 S. W. J. Duncan 330,000 Benefits Benefits available to executive Directors relate to the provision of company cars or a car allowance, private medical insurance, and, for Stefano Pessina and Ornella Barra, the cost of travel to and from work, accommodation and subsistence while working for the Group in the UK.
The provision of these benefits reflects market practice and do not relate to performance.
The value of these benefits for each Director in 2005, including expenses chargeable to UK income tax, are detailed in the emoluments section on page 56.
Where a Director is entitled to a benefit but chooses not to take that benefit, a cash supplement is paid in lieu of that benefit.
Salary supplements Salary supplements include cash payments and long-term financial provision.
Annual performance bonuses The annual performance bonus scheme rewards executive Directors for the performance of the Group and of the individual businesses for which they are responsible for achieving their budgeted performance, after the cost of bonuses.
Payments also take into account personal performance.
To bring the level of bonus into line with market practice, the committee, following consultation with the Companys major shareholders, raised the maximum bonus an executive Director could receive from a maximum of 50% of basic salary to a maximum of 100% of basic salary from the beginning of 2005.
The committee is satisfied that the new level is commensurate with that in companies of a similar size and complexity.
80% of the bonus was based on adjusted profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders which is after tax and excludes exceptional items and IAS 39 timing differences and 20% was based on personal performance.
A potential target bonus of 40% of base salary was payable for the achievement of the 2005 budget which the committee considered as challenging but achievable.
For those executive Directors with specific business responsibilities Steve Duncan and Ornella Barra half of their financial performance target was based on the results of the Group as a whole and half on the combined performance of the businesses for which they have responsibility.
Bonuses started to accrue on the achievement of 96% of the budget and the maximum profit related bonus of 80% would have been payable for achieving 104% of budget.
Personal performance was based on a 360 appraisal process.
Following Per Utnegaards departure from the Company in April 2005, Ian Meakins assumed direct responsibility for the wholesale businesses in the UK and France, therefore half of his financial performance was based on Group performance and half on the combined performance of the businesses for which he had direct responsibility.
The amounts actually earned by each Director are detailed in the emoluments section on page 56.
Non-executive Directors All non-executive Directors were entitled to a basic fee of 45,000 in 2005.
The Board reviewed fees payable to non-executive Directors in January 2005, based on advice from PwC, which compared the level of fees paid by the Comparator Group.
No changes were made to the fees payable to Jeff Harris and Kenneth Clarke.
The basic fees payable to the other non-executive Directors were increased by 10,000 per annum with effect from 1 January 2005.
Jeff Harris, who retired from the Board and as non-executive Chairman on 22 April 2005, earned a fee of 83,333 up until the date of his retirement.
Based on market data provided by PwC and Spencer Stuart, the remuneration committee approved Paolo Scaronis fee of 175,000 per annum for acting as Chairman of the Company.
Kenneth Clarke Deputy Chairman and senior independent non-executive Director earned a total fee of 125,000 per annum, which included 5,000 per annum for chairing the remuneration committee.
Neil Cross received a total fee of 65,000, which included a fee of 10,000 per annum for chairing and serving on the Board of Alliance UniChem Pension Trustee Limited and 10,000 per annum for chairing and serving on the audit committee.
Other members of the audit committee were paid an additional fee of 5,000 per annum.
Non-executive Directors derive no other benefits from their office and are not eligible to participate in the Groups pension arrangements.
Jeff Harris receives a pension in respect of his service whilst acting as an executive of the Company.
It is Company policy not to grant share options to non-executive Directors or to require part of their fees to be paid in the form of shares.
Jeff Harris was eligible to receive share options in connection with the 2002 LTIP allocation made under the long-term incentive plan when he was an executive Director.
He was entitled to 25% of the award which he exercised during the year, details of which are set out on page 59.
56 Alliance UniChem Plc Board report on remuneration Non-executive Directors are appointed for fixed terms, normally of three years.
Non-executive Directors who have served beyond six years are subject to a more rigorous review when they come up for re-election.
This review takes account of the need for progressive refreshing of the Board.

57 Alliance UniChem Plc Long-term incentive plan The long-term incentive plan is a discretionary arrangement under which allocations are made to executive Directors with the aim of rewarding them for creating shareholder value.
Each allocation takes the form of a non-binding statement of intent to make an award of a stated maximum amount following the end of a specified performance period.
The allocation is determined as a percentage of basic salary in the year that the performance period starts.
The Directors allocations outstanding at 28 February 2006 are: 2003 allocation 2004 allocation 2005 allocation maximum amount maximum amount maximum amount Director I. K. Meakins 400,000 625,000 S. Pessina 233,333 300,000 485,000 G. R. Fairweather 220,000 233,333 375,000 O. Barra 180,000 193,333 310,000 S. W. J. Duncan 156,667 186,666 315,000 The performance periods for the allocations are: 2003 allocation 2004 allocation 2005 allocation Period start 1 January 2003 1 January 2004 1 January 2005 Period end 31 December 2005 31 December 2006 31 December 2007 The amount of the award is dependent on the achievement of certain performance measures during the performance period that the committee believe are the most appropriate measure of the underlying performance of the Group.
Total shareholder return measures the total return to shareholders in terms of share price growth and dividends reinvested in the shares of the Company over the performance period.
Inbucon Group provides the committee with a total shareholder return monitoring report and advises on performance under the long-term incentive plan based on earnings per share performance.
Earnings per share are defined as diluted earnings per share before amortisation of intangible assets and exceptional items for the period when the Group reported under UK GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share which excludes exceptional items and IAS 39 timing differences for the periods when the Group reported under IFRS, in both cases for full accounting years Earnings Per Share.
RPI-x is the index of retail prices for all items excluding mortgage payments as published by the UK Government RPI.
The performance against RPI-x is calculated on a per annum compound basis.
The total shareholder return measure for all outstanding allocations is compared with the performance of companies in the FTSE 100.
For the 2003 and 2004 allocations, the TSR and EPS targets are: Performance measure Achievement % awarded Total shareholder return below median at median 50% 12.5% for every 1% above median 1.5% up to upper quartile 75% 50.0% Earnings per share below RPI-x 5% at RPI-x 5% 5.0% for every 0.1% above RPI-x 5% 4.5% up to RPI-x 6% 50.0% To bring the level of awards into line with market practice, the committee, following consultation with the Companys major shareholders, raised the allocation from 66.66% to 100% of basic salary for 2005 onwards.
In anticipation of the proposed merger of the Company with Boots, the remuneration committee has delayed the 2006 allocations under the long term incentive plan to the executive Directors in order to facilitate the alignment of the long-term remuneration arrangements of the executive Directors of the combined business following the merger.
58 Alliance UniChem Plc Board report on remuneration For the 2005 allocation, the TSR and EPS targets are: Performance measure Achievement % awarded Total shareholder return below median at median 50% 12.5% for every 1% above median 1.5% up to upper quartile 75% 50.0% Earnings per share below RPI-x 5% at RPI-x 5% 5.0% for every 0.1% above RPI-x 5% 2.25% up to RPI-x 7% 50.0% The award takes the form of a right to acquire ordinary shares in the Company for a nominal sum within a period of ten years from the date of the award.
The number of shares will be determined by the market price of the Companys shares at the date of the award.
The committee has the discretion to withhold or reduce awards to any extent it considers appropriate, having regard to the Groups underlying financial performance and irrespective of the level of attainment of the performance targets.
During 2005, awards were made on allocations for the performance period 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2004.
During the performance period, the Company was in the 66th percentile of the comparator group on total shareholder return, which was the FTSE 250 for the 2002 allocation, and the increase in earnings per share was in excess of RPI-x 4%.
On this basis, awards equivalent to 86.8% of the allocations were made and converted into share options at 753.5 pence and 823.5 pence per share, with the exception of Jeff Harris who was only entitled to 25% of the allocation, reflecting his period as an executive Director.
2 Resigned from the Board in July 2004 and left the Company on 31 December 2004.
In accordance with an agreement between the Company and G. I. Cooper, Mr Cooper exercised an option over 27,577 ordinary shares at an option price of 1 in total in the Company which had been awarded to him in 2004 on allocations for the performance period 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2003.
The option was normally exercisable from 31 December 2004 to 31 December 2005.
The market price of the Companys shares on the date of exercise was 820 pence.
The awards are further detailed in the table of share options and long-term incentive awards.
Following the end of the performance period for the 2003 allocation detailed above, the committee has recommended to the trustees of the 1992 Employee Trust that awards equivalent to 90.1% of the allocation are made.
Their basis for doing this is that during the performance period, the Company was in the 68.4th percentile of the comparator group on shareholder return and the increase in earnings per share was in excess of RPI-x 6%.
Performance % Total shareholder return for the Company and total shareholder return for FTSE 250 125 and FTSE 100 companies, being the 100 comparator groups used for the long-term incentive plan, over the five years ended 75 31 December 2005 were: 50 25 0 -25 -50 Dec 00 Jun 01 Dec 01 Jun 02 Dec 02 Jun 03 Dec 03 Jun 04 Dec 04 Jun 05 Dec 05 Alliance UniChem Plc Source: Bloomberg FTSE 100 FTSE 250 59 Alliance UniChem Plc The increase in published earnings per share over the five years ending 31 December 2005 compared to RPI-x 3% and RPI-x 5% over the same period is: The EPS figures from 2000 to 2004 % growth were calculated under UK GAAP.

The Directors may participate in the savings related share option scheme but do not participate in the discretionary scheme.
Details of outstanding options under these schemes are shown in note 34 to the financial statements.
Options granted under the discretionary 1997 Share Option Scheme since May 2003 have no retesting of performance measures and have a fixed performance period being a defined three year period made up of three consecutive accounting periods.
This period commences on 1 January of the year of the award.
The performance target is that the Earnings Per Share growth of the Company must be greater than the increase of RPI-x 4% compound over the performance period.
For options granted prior to May 2003 there is retesting of the performance measures where the Earnings Per Share growth of the Company must be greater than the increase of RPI-x 4% compound at any time during the exercise period.
The performance conditions for options granted up to and including 2002 have been satisfied.

3 Resigned as a Director in July 2004.
Jeff Harris receives an unreduced pension from age 55, based on arrangements entered into with the Company in 1992.
The agreed pension arising was calculated on the basis of the annual rate of basic salary at the time of retirement plus the annual average of car fuel benefit and bonus over the preceding three years.
20,773 per annum of this pension is unfunded and is paid directly by the Company.
Ian Meakins has no pension benefit.
He receives a cash payment for long-term financial provision at the rate of 240,000 per annum.

62 Alliance UniChem Plc Board report on remuneration George Fairweather and Steve Duncan are members of the defined benefit section of the Companys pension scheme.
The benefits of the pension scheme, subject to statutory limits including the earnings cap, are as follows: normal retirement age of 60: contributions by the Director at the rate of 5% of basic salary: a lump sum of 4 x basic salary and a spouses pension of 50% of prospective members pension are payable on death in service: the statutory minimum pension and accumulated contributions are payable on death after leaving service but before retirement: all pensions in payment increase in line with the Scheme Rules: and no allowance is made for any discretionary increases within transfer values.
In addition, George Fairweather and Geoff Cooper are members of the Alliance UniChem 1993 Pension Scheme, which is a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme.
This is a money purchase arrangement which aims to provide limited targeted benefits on basic salary in excess of the earnings cap.
An actuarial review has identified a funding deficit relating to service up until 31 December 2005 of approximately 108,000 for George Fairweather and 454,000 for Geoff Cooper which will be paid by April 2006.
The Company has undertaken a review of pension arrangements in light of the provisions of the Finance Act 2004.
As a result, the 1993 Scheme will be closed in 2006, with suitable adjustments being made to the Companys pension scheme to reflect contractual promises.
These changes will maximise the use of the defined benefit section of the Companys pension scheme rather than using unapproved arrangements.
The changes do not represent an increase in the value or cost of the contractual promise, but allow the benefits to be provided more efficiently.
Ornella Barra is a member of the unapproved International Pension Scheme, which is a defined contribution arrangement.
Based on actuarial advice, the contributions include an amount of previous underfunding of the contractual promise.
From 2006, contributions will reflect the cost of future service, as determined by the actuary.
Audit The following sections of the above report form part of the financial statements on which the auditors have expressed their opinion on page 63: Emoluments, Long-term incentive plan, Share option schemes, Ian Meakins share incentive plan, Directors shareholdings and Pensions.
