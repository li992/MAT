the Company has established a new US headquarters office in Wayne, Pennsylvania where the majority of our senior executives are based.
In addition, the Company has recently completed the acquisition of TKT, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
The Company operates in a competitive multinational environment.
In 2005, approximately 90% of the Companys revenues were generated and 80% of its employees were based outside the UK.
Indeed most of the Companys revenues are generated in the US and the majority of its employees and most of its senior executives are based in the US.
The importance of our US business to the continuing growth of your Company, coupled with the fact that most of our senior executives are based in the US, presents the Committee with particular challenges.
Key elements of our remuneration package, including long-term incentive arrangements, have been in place for five years or more and, over this time, the Company has grown and changed significantly.
As a result of both the growth and development of the Company and the competitive operating environment, the Committee reviewed senior executive remuneration during 2005 and conducted a competitive benchmarking study.
On the basis of, and consistent with, data from the study, the Committee modified the remuneration policy and proposed a number of changes to remuneration including the introduction of a new share plan to replace Shires existing plans and amendments to the annual incentive plan.
The Committee conducted a consultation process with major shareholders regarding the proposed programs and made changes to its proposals consistent with shareholder feedback.
These are described within this report.
The Remuneration Committee is committed to a continuing dialogue with shareholders and we take account of your views.
We hope that this report provides helpful context and explanation about the policies and practical considerations that influence our decisions.

The option was granted on March 4, 2002 over 209,211 shares with an exercise price of 5.065 per share.
The payment, which was subject to tax and non-pensionable, was intended to put Mr Stahel in the same position as if he had exercised the option and subsequently sold the shares on the day on which he notified the Company of his desire to exercise the option.
Following the implementation of the Scheme of Arrangement, on November 25, 2005, all existing options to acquire ordinary shares in Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Old Options were swapped for new equivalent options to acquire ordinary shares in Shire plc New Options.
Any performance conditions attached to the Old Options continue to apply to the New Options.
42 Annual report and accounts for the year ended December 31, 2005 Shire plc 6420 Annual Report 2005. qxd 28 4 06 17:44 Page 43 Directors remuneration report Notes i Options granted under this scheme are subject to performance criteria and cannot be exercised in full, unless Shires ordinary share price increases at a compound rate of at least 20.5% per annum over a minimum three-year measurement period.
If Shires share price increases at a compound rate of 14.5% per annum over a minimum three-year measurement period, 60% of the options may be exercised.
If these conditions are not met after the initial three years, they are thereafter tested quarterly by reference to share price growth over the extended period.
If the share price does not meet these conditions at any time, none of the options granted become exercisable.
On February 28, 2000, the Remuneration Committee of the Board exercised its powers to amend the terms of the Executive Share Option Scheme so as to include a cliff vesting provision.
It is intended that no further options will be granted under the Executive Scheme.
ii Options granted under the Sharesave Scheme are granted with an exercise price equal to 80% of the mid-market price on the day before invitations are issued to employees.
Employees may enter into three or five-year savings contracts.
iii Options granted under the 2000 Executive Scheme are exercisable subject to certain performance criteria.
In respect of any option granted prior to August 2002, if Shires ordinary share price increases at a compound rate of at least 20.5% per annum over a minimum three-year measurement period, the option becomes exercisable in full.
If it increases by at least 14.5% per annum over the same three-year period, 60% of the options granted become exercisable.
If these conditions are not met after the initial three-year measurement period, they will thereafter be tested quarterly by reference to compound annual share price growth over an extended period.
The performance criteria were reviewed in 2002 to ensure the criteria reflected the market in which Shire operates.
Given Shires development, it was considered appropriate that an EPS-based measure should be adopted in place of share price growth targets.
The performance criteria are based on real growth in the diluted earnings per share reported in the Companys Form 10-K under US GAAP, adjusted to ensure a consistent basis of measurement, as approved by the Remuneration Committee, including the add back of significant one-time items option EPS.
Therefore, the performance criteria were amended so that an option would become exercisable in full if Shires option EPS growth over a three-year period from the date of award exceeds the UK Retail Prices Index RPI for the following tranches of grants: Options with a grant value of up to 100% of salary RPI plus 9% Directors, RPI plus 15% Between 101% and 200% of salary RPI plus 15% Between 201% and 300% of salary RPI plus 21% Over 301% of salary RPI plus 27% The new EPS performance criteria apply to options granted under the 2000 Executive Scheme from August 2002.
After consultation with certain of its institutional shareholders, the Company has decided that for options granted under the scheme from 2004 onwards, the retest of the performance condition if Shires option EPS growth has fallen short of the minimum annual average percentage increase over the three-year period from grant, has been changed.
The performance condition will be retested once only, at five years after the grant.
Hence the level of option EPS growth in the next two years needs to be consequentially higher to meet the test.
Six weeks prior to the expiration date, any options that have not become exercisable at an earlier date, automatically vest without reference to the performance criteria.
It is intended that no further options will be granted under the 2000 Executive Scheme.
iv Following the acquisition of BioChem Pharma Inc. on May 11, 2001, the BioChem Stock Option Plan was amended such that options over BioChem Pharma Inc. s common stock became options over ordinary shares of Shire.
All BioChem Pharma Inc. options, which were not already exercisable, vested and became exercisable as a result of the acquisition.
It is intended that no further options will be granted under the BioChem Stock Option Plan.
v Under the Stock Purchase Plan, options are granted with an exercise price equal to 85% of the fair market value of a share on the enrolment date the first day of the offering period or the exercise date the last day of the offering period, whichever is the lower.
The offering period is for 27 months.
The market price of the ordinary shares at December 31, 2005 was 7.44 and the range during the year was 5.39 to 7.53.
