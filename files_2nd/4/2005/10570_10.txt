Morgan Sindall Report and Accounts 2005 Directors remuneration report Introduction This report is prepared in accordance with schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 the Act.
This report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and the Combined Code on Corporate Governance published in July 2003 the Code.
As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the annual general meeting of the Company to be held on 25 April 2006.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on certain parts of the directors remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Act.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information.
Unaudited information Remuneration committee The members of the remuneration committee the committee during 2005 were Gill Barr chair, Bernard Asher and Jon Walden, all of whom are independent non-executive directors.
The committee is responsible for determining and agreeing with the Board the broad policy for the remuneration of the executive directors, including the executive chairman.
It sets the salaries and remuneration packages for the executive directors and monitors the structure and level of remuneration for other senior executives.
The terms of reference of the committee are available on the Companys website and on request from the company secretary.
During the year, the committee was assisted by New Bridge Street Consultants LLP NBSC on a number of aspects of the remuneration packages for the executive directors, including awards made under the Morgan Sindall Executive Remuneration Plan 2005.
The committee also consulted the chief executive, the finance director and the chairman, but not in relation to their own remuneration.
NBSC did not provide any other services to the Company or the Group.
Policy on executive directors remuneration The committee seeks to develop remuneration packages which satisfy the following principles: to attract, retain and motivate the best possible person for each position: to be perceived as simple and fair and, therefore, valued by participants: to ensure that the fixed element of remuneration salary, pension and other benefits is set no higher than market rates and that a significant proportion of the total remuneration package is determined by the Companys performance: to recognise the importance of rewarding over performance but not under performance in both the short and long-term: to reward directors fairly for their contributions whilst remaining within the range of benefits offered by similar companies in the sector: and to align the interests of executives with those of the shareholders.
A fundamental review of the Companys remuneration structure was carried out by NBSC in 2004 at the request of the committee.
This resulted in a revised remuneration structure for 2005 with a more balanced mix of long-term and short-term rewards to ensure that executives focus on sustained performance rather than just short-term performance.
The long-term rewards focus on Group performance with demanding criteria over a three year period, whilst short-term rewards are more closely linked to targets for the financial year and, in the case of senior executives, targets in the specific areas of responsibility of each individual.
The committee has decided to retain the same remuneration structure for 2006.
Base salary The base salary of individual executive directors is determined by the committee prior to the beginning of each year and, if appropriate, if an individuals position or responsibilities change.
The base salaries of the executive directors for 2005 were set by the committee following a benchmarking exercise carried out on its behalf by NBSC for each individual executive director against a comparator group of twenty five companies of a similar size and profile.
Other benefits in kind The executive directors receive certain other benefits, principally a car allowance and benefits in kind, namely private medical insurance and life assurance.
Annual bonus At the end of each financial year, the committee establishes the targets to be met for the executive directors to earn a cash bonus in respect of the following year.
For the 2005 financial year, the performance criteria were Group profit based targets set taking into account the previous years likely outturn profit and growth expectations.
The maximum bonus payable in cash represented 75% of base salary 100% of salary for John Bishop who did not receive a long-term incentive award in 2005 and required profit before tax for 2005 to exceed the Group budget by more than 10% and this profit target was achieved.
28 Directors remuneration report In recognition of the record results achieved and the outstanding performance of the Group in 2005, the committee has decided to award an additional one-off bonus to Paul Smith this year to reflect his key contribution towards the Groups success.
In order to align his interests with shareholders, this bonus will take the form of a deferred share award of 20,000 shares to be granted following the announcement of the Companys preliminary results.
The shares will be held in trust for two years and he may be required to forfeit them if he ceases to be employed by the Company during that period.
For the 2006 financial year, executive directors will have the potential to earn a cash bonus worth up to 75% of base salary with performance measures and targets based on similar principles to those in respect of 2005.
For other senior executives, performance criteria focus primarily on the performance of the divisions over which they have a direct management influence.
Long-term incentives Morgan Sindall Executive Remuneration Plan 2005 the 2005 Plan Following the review carried out by NBSC in 2004, the committee concluded that the Company should have the ability to offer senior executives performance shares and or share options as a long-term incentive under the 2005 Plan which was approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting of the Company on 12 April 2005.
The committee considers that the flexibility to grant both types of award provides a suitable balance of performance related incentives, with options rewarding share price growth, with performance shares encouraging executive retention and with both types of incentive rewarding sustained growth in earnings.
A summary of the 2005 Plan is set out below: Award levels In normal circumstances, the maximum annual award, which is subject to the achievement of testing performance targets, will be performance shares worth 75% of base salary 100% of salary in exceptional circumstances.
For the grant of awards made in 2005, executives were given the choice at the time of grant of receiving their awards either in the form of performance shares or by electing to receive share options to replace some or all of their performance shares at a rate of 4 share options for every 1 performance share.
It is anticipated that future awards will give executives a similar choice, with the awards to be granted in 2006 being offered on the same ratio.
Performance conditions The committee believes that long-term incentives should be structured so as to incentivise growth in the Companys earnings by use of an earnings per share EPS performance condition.
In the committees opinion, an EPS performance condition will provide a clear linkage between performance and reward for senior executives and will also only reward executives for significant improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group which should be reflected over time in enhanced shareholder value.
The vesting of share options and performance shares awarded will be determined by the Groups EPS performance against the Retail Prices Index RPI, over a single three year period with no opportunity to re-test performance.
The committee will ensure that EPS is calculated on a consistent basis during the transition to and under IFRS.
The committee has determined that the vesting schedule for performance shares and share options should be as follows for the awards to be made in 2006, based on the three year performance period to 31 December 2008: Average annual EPS performance in excess of RPI Performance shares Share options Vesting percentage Less than 4% pa Less than 5% pa 0% 4% pa 5% pa 25% 10% pa 10% pa 100% Between 4% and 10% pa Between 5% and 10% pa Pro rata on a straight-line basis Pension arrangements The Company makes contributions equivalent to 10% of base salary, in the case of David Mulligan, to the Morgan Sindall Retirement Benefit Plan and, in the case of the other executive directors, to their individual personal pension plans.
29 Morgan Sindall Report and Accounts 2005 Directors remuneration report Performance graph The graph below shows a comparison of the total shareholder return for the Companys shares over the last five financial years against the total shareholder return for the companies comprised in the FTSE 350 index excluding investment trusts.
This is considered by the committee to be the most suitable comparable broad index against which the Companys performance should be measured for this purpose.
400 Cumulative total shareholder return for the five years to 31 December 2005 350 based on original notional value of 100 300 250 Morgan Sindall plc 200 FTSE 350 excluding investment trusts 150 100 50 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Service contracts It is the Companys policy that executive directors service contracts should be terminable on one years notice.
In circumstances of termination by notice except in cases of removal for misconduct, compensation will be determined by the committee having regard to the particular circumstances of the case.
The committees guidelines will be to determine an equitable compensation package while avoiding rewarding poor performance and having regard to the departing directors obligations to mitigate his loss.
In ordinary circumstances, base salary and employer pension contributions for the full period of notice of one year would be paid together with accrued bonus entitlements and shares or share options granted under long-term incentive schemes where the relevant performance criteria had been satisfied.
Other employee benefits would also be maintained for the notice period subject to the rules of the appropriate Group scheme.
The dates of the executive directors contracts are: John Morgan 28 October 1994 Paul Smith 18 February 2003 David Mulligan 1 March 2004 Paul Whitmore 21 March 2000 At the discretion of the Board, executive directors are allowed to act as non-executive directors of other companies and retain any fees relating to that post.
Currently John Morgan acts as a non-executive director of Genetix plc and receives a fee of 20,000 per annum.
Non-executive directors The dates of the terms of engagement of the non-executive directors are: Bernard Asher 4 February 1998 Gill Barr 11 August 2004 Jack Lovell 2 August 2001 Jon Walden 5 April 2001 All non-executive directors have specific terms of engagement being an initial period of three years which thereafter may be extended by mutual consent.
Their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set by the articles of association of the Company and is based on surveys together with external advice as appropriate.
At the annual general meeting in 2005, a resolution was passed to increase the limit on directors fees, which enabled the Company to increase the fees payable to the non-executive directors to market competitive levels after several years at the same rate.
Fees for 2006 will comprise a basic fee of 35,000 and, to reflect their additional responsibilities and time commitment, an additional fee of 5,000 and 3,000 will be paid to the chairs of the audit and remuneration committees respectively.
Non-executive directors cannot participate in any Company share based incentive plan and do not receive any other benefits.

32 Directors remuneration report Legacy plans Long-term incentive plan LTIP Set out below are details of outstanding awards made to executive directors under the Companys LTIP.
No awards have been granted under the LTIP since 2003 and there is no intention to grant further awards.
The outstanding awards are conditional upon the Groups total shareholder return performance over a three year period compared with a selected peer group.
Once shares have been allocated to the executive after the three year performance period, the executive is entitled to receive dividends in respect of those shares and to exercise voting rights but may not transfer or otherwise deal in those shares until a further two years have elapsed and he may be required to forfeit the shares if he ceases to be employed by the Company during that period.
After two years they will vest in his name.

Preliminary figures for the year to 31 December 2005 indicate that upon expiry of the three year period from date of grant, 100% of the shares will be allocated to the participants.
2 No awards, which had been allocated in prior years, vested during 2005.
3 When John Bishop ceased to be a full time employee at the end of May 2005, 36,401 shares had been conditionally awarded to him in respect of the 2003 LTIP award.
He also had a total of 18,692 shares allocated to him from the 2001 and 2002 LTIP awards and 6,876 nil cost options awarded under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan see below that had not yet vested at that date.
As referred to above, 19,598 of his outstanding shares under the 2003 LTIP award have been voluntarily waived included in the Lapsed Mar 2005 column in the table above.
To reflect John Bishops critical role in the growth and development of the Company over the past twelve years, the committee currently intends to exercise its discretion and allow a proportion of the outstanding awards to vest when he ceases to be a part time employee in 2006.
Deferred share bonus plan The following nil-cost options over shares were granted to the executive directors on 10 March 2005.
These represented 25% of the annual bonus earned in respect of the year ended 31 December 2004.
No long-term incentive awards were made to the executive directors in respect of that financial year.
The nil-cost options will be exercisable for five years from 10 March 2008, being three years after the date of grant.
The market value of a share on the date of grant was 712.5p.
Nil cost share options No.
John Morgan 8,046 Paul Smith 10,241 David Mulligan 4,114 Paul Whitmore 6,876 John Bishop 6,876 33 Morgan Sindall Report and Accounts 2005 Directors remuneration report Share options Details of options granted under the 1995 share option scheme 1995 scheme for directors who served during the year are: Date from Date Exercise which Expiry Director Scheme Granted granted price exercisable date Paul Smith 1995 unapproved 100,000 10 Mar 2003 2.07 10 Mar 2008 9 Mar 2010 The market price of a share on 31 December 2005 was 929.5p and the range during the year was 539p to 935p.
Options were granted to Paul Smith under the 1995 scheme as part of his initial employment package in 2003 and in lieu of participation in the LTIP.
No other executive director has any options outstanding under the 1995 scheme.
Details of options granted under the 1995 scheme to other employees in the Group are shown in note 22 to the accounts on page 63.
No further options may be granted under the 1995 scheme.
The original performance condition for options granted under the 1995 scheme required the growth in the Companys EPS over a period of five consecutive financial years to be sufficient to rank it within the upper quartile compared to the EPS growth of a comparator group of FTSE 100 companies.
However, the introduction of IFRS from 2005 has created a significant problem in measuring this performance condition because the accounts used for calculating the base EPS figures are derived on a UK GAAP basis and the end EPS figures will be derived on an IFRS basis.
It is not considered practicable by the committee to make the necessary adjustments to try to measure the base and end figures on a consistent accounting basis for all FTSE 100 companies.
Accordingly, the committee following consultation with leading shareholders and in accordance with the rules of the 1995 scheme has amended the performance condition to use a comparative total shareholder return TSR measure rather than a comparative EPS measure.
As a result, outstanding options under the 1995 scheme are now only exercisable if the Companys TSR is ranked at or above the upper quartile compared to a comparator group of FTSE 100 companies over a period of five consecutive financial years.
