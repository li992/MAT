81 Remuneration report The Remuneration Committee is governed by formal terms of reference and is comprised entirely of independent non-executive directors.
The Committee meets as required during the year, but not less than twice a year.
All members of the Committee have no personal financial interest, other than as a shareholder, in the matters to be decided by the Committee, no potential conicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the Companys businesses.
The Committee is responsible for reviewing the remuneration policy for the Chairman, executive directors and senior executives of the Company.
The Committee also has responsibility for the Companys performance related pay schemes and share incentive plans, and the levels of awards made under them as they apply to the senior executives.
Details of the full terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Company website at www.
During 2005 the Remuneration Committee comprised the following members: Sir George Russell Chairman of the Committee Sir Robert Phillis from 7 February 2005 James Crosby until 1 May 2005 John McGrath until 1 May 2005 Sir Brian Pitman Baroness Usha Prashar from 7 February 2005 until 1 May 2005 The Chief Executive is generally invited to attend meetings of the Committee to advise on policy for executive remuneration except when matters relating to his own remuneration are discussed.
Similarly, the Chairman of ITV plc may also attend.
Internal and external advisers to the Committee may also be invited to attend all or part of meetings where appropriate.
No individual is involved in decisions relating to their own remuneration.
The Committee has appointed Deloitte and Touche LLP Deloitte as external independent advisers.
In addition, Deloitte provided the Group with tax and corporate finance advice under separate engagement terms.
Advice on legal matters is provided by Lovells.
The Committees internal advisers are the Group Human Resources Director and the Company Secretary, supported by their colleagues in the Human Resources and Secretariat functions.
Remuneration policy These pages set out how the Remuneration Committee operated the various elements of remuneration in 2005 and intends to operate them going forward, subject to the approval by shareholders of the Remuneration report at the forthcoming AGM.
General policy The Board is committed to building the most appropriate remuneration policy for ITV.
In doing this the Committee has designed a remuneration policy which is intended to address ITVs operational requirements while taking into account prevailing best practice.
The remuneration policy is based on the following key principles: To provide competitive total remuneration opportunities which will attract, retain and reward the best executive talent necessary to drive ITVs successful future in the highly competitive media market.
This must respond to the pressures that ITV faces from both other commercial and publicly owned broadcasters and producers.
The majority of total long term remuneration for all senior executives should be variable atrisk and tied to the achievement of specic stretching performance conditions and objectives which align executive remuneration with shareholders interests.
The schemes encourage executives to adopt the attitude of owners and true entrepreneurs and build up meaningful and substantial shareholdings in ITV.
Performance should be measured over clearly specified, varying periods i. e. short, medium and long term.
The Committee does not believe that retesting is appropriate in such a framework, and no ITV arrangements contain this feature.
Individuals should be rewarded for success, and steps should be taken, within contractual obligations, to minimise rewards for failure.
The Board is unanimously of the view that service contracts for executive directors should be no longer than twelve months.
The Committee should take its decisions being fully aware of the wider context in ITV as a whole, and as part of this process, the Group Human Resources Director, as the Committees main internal adviser, provides an update on wider remuneration, employee relations and human resource issues in ITV as a regular agenda item.
Updates on the external remuneration environment are provided by Deloitte.
A remuneration policy needs to evolve over time to adapt to commercial demands, changing market practice and shareholder expectations.
Investors will be consulted about any key issues that arise and be provided with the opportunity to endorse the Companys remuneration policies on a regular basis through the vote on the Remuneration report.
Components of reward The reward package for senior members of staff consists of a combination of incentive schemes intended to provide motivation and reward for short, medium and long term performance and to retain the necessary talent over the longer term.
Each component is intended to full a different function within the remuneration framework.
Salary and approach to competitive positioning Market positioning of salary and other elements of reward is approached on an individual by individual basis.
The aim is to identify the most appropriate competitive positioning for each role and for the individuals best capable of lling it.
Once the appropriate competitive positioning has been determined, the emphasis is on providing a high ratio of variable pay opportunities to xed elements of reward.
Variable pay opportunities are wholly performance driven, and performance as a whole is tightly managed within ITVs performance management framework.
The application of this policy is monitored to ensure that all assessments of competitive positioning keep pace with changes in the relevant remuneration environment.
Typically, changes in remuneration opportunity will track the market for the given role and individual.
Following the changes in the executive team announced in September 2005, a job sizing and market positioning review was undertaken in respect of individuals in the senior team whose role or responsibilities had changed.
No material change was found to have taken place which would affect the positioning of the executive director roles, and consequently during 2005 and going into 2006 their salaries will have been increased in line with the cost of living rises provided to all staff.
82 ITV plc 2005 annual report Remuneration report Short term and deferral incentives Annual incentives are provided for the most senior executives and other key management talent through the ITV Deferred Share Award Plan DSA.
50% of any pre-tax bonus entitlement will automatically be deferred into shares under the DSA, vesting after 12 and 24 months.
Participants may elect to take the balance of the bonus in cash.
Any of this 50% not taken in cash will be deferred into shares.
Awards made under the DSA, as well as any cash bonus payments, will be based on the achievement of a combination of corporate, and specic business and individual targets.
For 2006 the corporate element includes demanding targets based on profit, revenues and share of commercial impacts.
For the executive directors, the targets will be weighted towards corporate performance.
The total annual bonus opportunity including awards made under the DSA for executive directors will not normally exceed 150% of a participants annual salary.
Long term incentive plans During the year the Committee has kept the Companys long term incentive plans under regular review to ensure they remain appropriate and are fullling their objectives.
No changes have been made to the operation of the schemes other than to spread opportunities under the Commitment Scheme further details provided below.
In 2006 the Committee intends to continue to monitor and review the performance criteria for the plans to ensure these continue to represent the best way to drive the creation of value in line with shareholders interests.
Annual long term opportunities The Performance Share Plan PSP, was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2004.
It is the main long term incentive and, as such, the awards replace grants that would otherwise have been made under the ITV plc Unapproved and Approved Executive Share Option Schemes Option Schemes.
There have been no option grants made under the Option Schemes and following the adoption of the PSP the Committee does not intend to operate the Option Schemes for individuals receiving PSP awards.
However, options subsist from earlier grants under the Granada and Carlton schemes.
The performance conditions applying to PSP awards are described below.
In the event of a change of control, performance is measured over the foreshortened performance period and any resulting amounts vesting are pro-rated to reect the proportion that this period represents of the full performance period.
Early vesting may be permitted if the individual leaves in certain compassionate circumstances.
The maximum award that can be made under the PSP is 150% of salary in respect of any year.
Vesting of the awards is currently dependent on TSR performance of the Company, against the customised FTSE 100 comparator group described below.
There is no vesting for performance below median.
35% of the award vests at median and 100% at upper quartile.
Awards have a three-year performance period.
There is an exercise window of 12 months from the date of vesting, after which period they expire.
Long term scheme requiring capital commitment The ITV plc Commitment Scheme the Scheme requires invitees to commit and retain a significant amount of capital in the form of ITV shares in essence, the invited participants are encouraged to adopt the attitudes of owners and commit their own funds.
Under the Scheme, participants must commit and retain shares of up to a maximum value of 300% of salary at the date of commitment.
A matching award will be granted, composed of an award of free shares and or a market value option to acquire an equal number of shares.
The maximum matching award can be over no more than three times the number of committed shares for each component part of the matching award.
Vesting of the matching award is currently dependent on TSR performance of the Company, against the customised FTSE 100 comparator group described below.
25% of the award vests at median and 100% at upper quartile.
Matching awards will vest subject to achievement of the performance condition no earlier than the third anniversary of the date of grant.
The performance period will be set by the Committee when the award is made.
Up to 50% of the initial awards will vest at the third anniversary of the date of grant and the remainder at the fourth.
Any portion of the award that has not vested at the end of the relevant performance period will lapse i. e. either year three or year four in respect of the initial awards.
There is no provision for retesting in this or any other ITV arrangement.
In the event of a change of control, awards may vest based on the extent to which the performance condition has been met in the period since the awards were made, unless it is determined that exceptional financial circumstances have occurred.
As a condition of accepting the invitation to participate, each participant has formally acknowledged the independent directors absolute discretion in this matter.
In 2004 the Committee decided to operate the Scheme according to the following additional parameters: a participant who chooses to participate above an investment of 100% of salary maximum investment is 300% may not receive a PSP award in the year in which they participate in the Scheme: executive directors may participate up to a maximum investment of 100% of salary per annum but with eligibility for a PSP award in that year : and the level of performance related payout in the event of a change of control is capped to a multiple of the original financial amount a participant invests twice investment if a change of control occurs in the first year, three times if it occurs during the second year and four times if change of control occurs in the third or fourth year.
From 2005 onwards, the Committee has resolved to further limit awards under the Scheme by reducing invitations to all participants to a maximum investment of 100% of salary per annum, except in exceptional circumstances.
83 Performance conditions Targets for awards made under the DSA, as well as any cash bonus payments, are explained above.
All long term incentive awards, i. e. those made under the PSP or under the Commitment Scheme will currently vest subject to ITVs relative TSR performance against a comparator group, which the Committee considers to be the most appropriate measure of the creation and maintenance of shareholder value.
The effectiveness of relative TSR as a measure of performance for the TSR based ITV plans is dependent on the selection of an appropriate comparator group.
The Committee has given careful consideration to the way in which such a group should be derived and has identied the following criteria: the performance of the companies should be driven by similar macro-economic factors as ITV and, particularly given the widespread participation in plans dependent on TSR within ITV, any comparator group must be meaningful, for both investors and participants: the group should be of a sufficient size to accommodate fide-listings and mergers that may occur within the comparator group and to ensure that the vesting schedule does not result in large increases in vesting for small changes in rank: and it should be easy to identify the appropriate comparators at any point in time on an objective basis.
Given these criteria, and after considering a number of alternatives, the Committee decided that the initial comparator group for ITVs TSR based plans should be a customised FTSE 100 group, excluding those sectors which do not provide a benchmark of performance that would be relevant to ITV.
The remaining companies in the comparator group consist of the FTSE 100 constituents at each individual grant award date of the following sectors: Media and Entertainment, Telecom Services, Support Services, General Retailers, Transport, Beverages and Leisure and Hotels.
On this basis, in respect of the PSP and Commitment Scheme awards made in 2004 and 2005 the comparator companies were: Allied Domecq Compass Intercontinental Hotels Rexam BAA Daily Mail Kingsher SAB Miller Boots Diageo Marks & Spencer Scottish & Newcastle British Sky Broadcasting DSG International O Vodafone 2 British Airways Emap Next Whitbread BT Enterprise Inns Party Gaming William Hill Bunzl Exel Pearson WPP Cable and Wireless GUS Reed Elsevier Yell Capita Hays Rentokil Initial Carnival Hilton Reuters Included in comparator group for 2004 Commitment Scheme, 2004 PSP and 2005 Commitment Scheme awards only.
Included in comparator group for 2004 PSP, 2005 Commitment Scheme and 2005 PSP awards only.
Included in comparator group for 2005 PSP awards only.
Both the PSP and the Commitment Scheme provide for a reduction of the vesting result produced from the TSR calculation if the Committee, together with the other independent directors, consider that exceptional circumstances have prevailed, including failure to achieve real earnings per share growth over the performance period.
The Committee may consider the appropriate comparator group for future awards and whether any secondary performance criteria may be applied, and would consult with investors should such changes be contemplated.
All TSR measurement for the purposes of calculating vesting is performed by a third party in 2005 this was Deloitte.
The results are circulated to the members of the Committee for their conrmation.
The performance condition applicable to awards made under the Granada Media Commitment Scheme is TSR relative to Granadas international media comparator group companies as set out on page 87 in relation to share option schemes.
25% of awards vest at median: full vesting occurs at upper decile.
Up to 50% of these awards are capable of vesting after two years, with the remainder subject to performance over a four year period.
84 ITV plc 2005 annual report Remuneration report Performance graph The graphs below show the TSR performance of ITV against the FTSE 100 index.
The FTSE 100 has been selected for comparison as it represents a broad equity market index of which ITV was a member during the full financial year.
ITV plc ITV plc Financial Listing Year End 250 FTSE 100 ITV 200 150 100 50 Source: Datastream 0 Oct-02 Jan-03 Apr-03 Jul-03 Oct-03 Jan-04 Apr-04 Jul-04 Oct-04 Jan-05 Apr-05 Jul-05 Oct-05 Jan-06 This graph shows TSR performance from 16 October 2002 the date of the announcement of the merger as this is considered to be the most appropriate basis on which to assess ITVs performance.
Prior to the listing of ITV the graph tracks the performance of a synthetic stock which shows the combined TSR performance of Granada and Carlton, weighted on the basis of their respective market capitalisation at 16 October 2002.
ITV plc ITV plc Financial Listing Year End 250 FTSE 100 Granada Carlton ITV 200 150 100 50 Source: Datastream 0 Jan-01 Jan-02 Jan-03 Jan-04 Jan-05 Jan-06 This additional graph is provided to mirror as closely as possible the normal basis for TSR performance graphs.
The graph therefore shows TSR performance over a five-year period to present, with the performance of Granada and Carlton shown separately prior to the listing of ITV.
The TSR holdings have been rebased to 100 at the date of listing to reect the requirement to show performance from this date onwards.
In both graphs one-month averaging has been applied throughout, with the exception of the month following the merger.
To ensure that the portion of the graph from the date of listing reects solely the performance of ITV plc, the data for ITV in this period has been averaged from 2 February 2004 to each date, with the effect that the averaging period lengthens until it reaches one month.
Financing of share based awards The Board seeks to finance all share based awards in ways which minimise the cost of such awards to the Company and its shareholders, including the impact of dilution.
Most awards are satisfied through the use of ITV shares acquired in the open market by employee benefit trusts.
Details of the shares held by the trusts are set out in note 29 to the accounts on page 67.
For awards made under long term incentive plans shareholders have granted exibility to finance awards using either newly issued shares or shares held in treasury.
This exibility provides the Board with the ability to make best use of corporate tax relief made available by HMRC in respect of share based arrangements and to manage effectively the spreading of the cost of awards across the employing companies whose employees receive awards.
TSR rebased to 100 at 16 10 02 TSR rebased to 100 at date of listing one month rolling average one month rolling average 85 Service contracts The executive directors of ITV plc have service contracts which provide for 12 months notice on either side.
As an alternative to serving notice, ITV may terminate the service agreement by paying the executive a sum the Prescribed Sum representing the aggregate of salary and the value of all other benets, excluding pension benets, for the 12 month period.
Alternatively the Company may elect to provide such benets in kind for 12 months.
Where the Prescribed Sum is payable, the Company will procure that the executive is put in the same position in respect of the pension scheme and other pension benets as if he had remained in pensionable service for an additional 12 months from the date of termination.
The payment of the Prescribed Sum will normally be made in monthly instalments.
Where the Prescribed Sum is payable the executive is also entitled to: a an award under the DSA over shares equal to between a minimum of 75% and a maximum of 100% of salary dependent upon a share price performance related ratchet, up to one half of which may be taken as a cash payment: and b where the executive has been nominated for an award in accordance with the terms of the DSA in respect of the financial year in which the Prescribed Sum is payable, the value of the award shall be determined in accordance with the same share price performance related ratchet.
Henry Staunton will step down from the Board of ITV plc on 31 March 2006.
Up until that time his remuneration and other benets will continue at the current rate.
Upon his departure he will receive, under the terms of his contract of employment, the following: one years basic salary including payment in lieu of accrued holiday 595,400 and benets in kind 37,800 and an award under the Deferred Share Award Plan with a value at that time of between 75% and 100% of basic salary the percentage to be calculated by reference to the share price performance of ITV plc compared to the FTSE 100 index between 4 December 2003 and 31 March 2006 in accordance with the formula in his contract of employment, 50% of which will be paid in cash and 50% in the form of a nil cost option over ITV plc shares.
The Company will publish details of the number of shares subject to such option in due course on its web site at www.
For the period of 2006 during which he is in post, he has a maximum bonus opportunity of 50% of salary, subject to performance.
The Company will also make contributions towards his pension arrangements for the period from April to October 2006 in an aggregate amount of 260,760.
All of the above reect the terms of Henry Stauntons service agreement which was signed in December 2003 at which time the notice period was reduced from 24 months to 12 months.
The requirements for performance testing of Henry Stauntons pre-existing awards of shares and options under the ITV plc Performance Share Plan and Commitment Scheme, and under the legacy Granada schemes, remain in place.
As at 28 February 2006 performance testing of his awards under the ITV plc Performance Share Plan and Commitment Scheme would have resulted in none of those awards vesting.
The non-executive directors have contracts of service with the Company.
Sir Peter Burt receives an annual fee of 200,000 and Sir George Russell receives an annual fee of 115,000 from 30 June 2005.
The other non-executive directors receive an annual fee of 45,000 from 31 March 2005 plus an additional sum of 5,000 for membership of the Audit Committee and 5,000 for membership of the Remuneration Committee.
John McGrath receives an additional sum of 15,000 from 30 June 2005 as Chairman of the Audit Committee.
Retirement and other benets The Board has conducted a full review of the pension commitments of ITV and executive directors arrangements formed part of this review.
No changes to executive directors arrangements are currently contemplated.
No additional remuneration will be paid to executive directors as a result of the introduction of the tax simplication regime for pensions being introduced on 6 April 2006.
Impact of International Accounting Standards Where the Committee is overseeing arrangements which involve financial metrics which require year on year comparisons and the base and end gures are derived on different bases, because of the transition to International Financial Reporting Standards, the Remuneration Committee will seek the view of the Audit Committee on the most appropriate interpretation.

No further options will be granted under Executive Option Schemes to these individuals following the introduction of the PSP.
The performance condition applicable to awards made under the ITV and Granada Media Commitment Schemes are as set out in the remuneration policy above.
Merger adjustment Following the merger of Granada with Carlton, ordinary shares in Granada were converted on a one-for-one basis into ordinary shares in ITV plc.
All rights under the various Granada and Granada Media share schemes, other than those granted after 1 January 2003, became exercisable as a result of the merger up to 1 August 2004.
Any Granada ordinary shares acquired on exercise were converted immediately on exercise into ordinary shares of ITV plc and all outstanding Granada and Granada Media options unexercised at 1 August 2004 were exchanged into options over ITV plc ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis.
Granada ESOS, SAYE and Granada Media Commitment Schemes: As part of the merger Granada shareholders on the register of members on 28 January 2004 received Granada Redeemable Shares.
In order to maintain the value of the options, a ratio adjustment of 1.04 was agreed with the Companys auditors and the Inland Revenue using the share price of Granada on the day before the Granada shares became ex-bonus issue and the share price on the first dealing day after the shares became ex-bonus issue.
For every one Granada ordinary share under option each optionholder became entitled to options over 1.04 Granada and Granada Media ordinary shares.
To ensure that the aggregate amount payable on the exercise of options under the Granada and Granada Media schemes remained the same, the exercise price per share was also adjusted by dividing the original exercise price by 1.04.
On exercise, optionholders receive shares in ITV plc in exchange for the Granada shares under option.
Granada Deferred Share Award Plan: Participants received the redeemable shares on the shares under award held by the Granada Employees benefit Trust.
The numbers in the tables above are in ITV plc shares and have been adjusted as explained above.
89 Share price information The market price of the ITV plc ordinary shares at 31 December 2005 was 112.5 pence and the range during the year was 101 pence to 130 pence.
The market price of the ITV plc convertible shares at 31 December 2005 was 0.75 pence and the range during the year was 0.75 pence to 63 pence.
The ITV plc convertible shares did not attain their conversion terms and in January 2006 were cancelled from the ofcial list of the UK Listing Authority and converted into deferred shares of no economic value.
Directors pension entitlements Two directors are members of the Companys dened benefit pension scheme.
The following directors had accrued entitlements under the schemes as follows: Accrued Increase in Accrued pension accrued pension 1January pension 31 December 2005 in the year 2005 Name of director 000 000 000 Charles Allen 439 49 488 Henry Staunton 327 29 356 The following table sets out the transfer value of the directors accrued benets under the scheme calculated in a manner consistent with Retirement benefit Schemes Transfer Values GN 11 published by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries.
The pension benets of Charles Allen and Henry Staunton are provided on a dened benefit basis.
The accrued pension shown is that which would be paid annually based on service to the end of the year.
The increase in the accrued pension during the year reects an increase in the pension entitlement as a result of one years additional accrual and increases in pensionable earnings.
