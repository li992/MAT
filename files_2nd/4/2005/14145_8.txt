Remuneration Policy The principal objectives of the Remuneration Committee, which is chaired by Mr R Pointon and comprises the Non-executive Directors, are to attract, retain and motivate high quality senior management with a competitive package of incentives and awards linked to performance and the interests of shareholders.
The Committee seeks to ensure that the Executive Directors are fairly rewarded taking into account all elements of their remuneration package in the light of the Groups performance.
The Committee has appointed Deloitte & Touche to provide independent market information and advice relating to executive remuneration and benefits.
This remuneration report will be put to shareholders for their approval as a separate ordinary resolution at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
As described below, a significant proportion of potential total remuneration is performance related and is built around annual and longer term incentives.
For Directors achieving medium performance, performance related pay would represent approximately 35% of total remuneration.
If performance were such that the maximum award available under each incentive scheme was paid, performance related pay would represent approximately 60% of total remuneration.
Basic Salary The basic salary element is determined after evaluating the Executive Directors duties and responsibilities and is based on the complexity, know-how, decision-making involved and their overall impact on the business.
Account is taken of relevant external data that provides information to assist in the deliberations.
Basic salary is generally reviewed on an annual basis or following a significant change in responsibilities.
Annual Cash Bonuses Annual cash bonuses are payable at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee as a percentage of basic salary dependent on corporate performance compared to target.
For the year to 31 March 2005, the Executives potential cash bonus ranged from 20% for achieving target performance to a maximum bonus of 50% for achieving target performance plus 20%.
In addition, bonuses have been paid for the exceptional work involved with the sale of the UK landfill and power operations and exceeding the disposal proceeds target.
Cash bonuses are not pensionable.
Long Term Incentive Plan Under the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP senior employees may be granted an award annually, the vesting of which is subject to the attainment of two pre-determined performance conditions measured over a three-year period.
Awards are in the form of a number of shares, the maximum value in any financial year cannot be more than 100% of basic salary as at the date of grant and calculated on the Companys share price at that time.
The first performance condition is based on Total Shareholder Return TSR, where the Companys TSR achieved during the three year performance period is measured against the TSR achieved by those companies that constituted the FTSE Support Services Sector immediately before the date of grant of an award.
An award will only vest in full if the Companys TSR results in it being ranked in the upper quartile of the companies in the comparator group where the company with the highest TSR is ranked first.
If the TSR of the Company results in a median position in the comparator group then 25% of the award will vest.
Vesting above the median position is on a sliding scale, with 3% of the award vesting for each percentile increase in the Companys rank above the median position up to the maximum award.
If the Companys TSR for the performance period results in a position below the median then the award will lapse.
The second performance condition is based on Earnings Per Share EPS and for an award to vest, the average growth in the Companys EPS, before taking into account goodwill amortisation and exceptional or extraordinary items, for the three year performance period, must exceed growth in the Retail Price Index over the same period by at least nine percentage points.
No amendment may be made to the performance conditions which would be to the material advantage of participants without the prior approval of shareholders in general meeting.
annual report 2005 The Shanks Group plc Employee Share Trust has been established for the purpose of granting awards under the LTIP and to hold shares in the Company either purchased in the market or new shares subscribed for, with funds provided by the Company or its subsidiaries.
As at 31 March 2005 the Employee Share Trust did not hold any of the Companys shares.

This Index has been selected as it is a broad equity index of which Shanks Group plc is a constituent company.
Share Option Schemes The Committee believes that share ownership by employees encourages the matching of long-term interests between employees and shareholders.
All UK employees including Executive Directors, subject to certain service conditions, may participate in a HM Revenue & Customs approved Savings Related Share Option Scheme SRSOS.
Senior executives are also able to participate in an Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
With effect from 26 July 2001 unapproved executive share options may be granted annually up to a market value of one and a third times basic salary in the preceding period of 12 months.
The ESOS expires in August 2005 and after that date it is intended to grant awards under the LTIP to senior executives rather than set up a replacement ESOS.
Under the terms of the SRSOS for employees, options may be granted during the ten year period to August 2005 to acquire up to 10% of the issued equity share capital of the Company, including options granted under the ESOS and LTIP.
Options are granted at the higher of the nominal value and an amount determined by the Remuneration Committee being not less than 80% of the market value.
At 31 March 2005 options outstanding amounted to 1,952,309 ordinary shares see note 22 in the financial statements.
Under the terms of the ESOS, options may be granted during the ten year period to August 2005 to acquire up to 5% of the issued equity share capital of the Company.
The exercise of options granted under the 1995 ESOS, which is the only current scheme, is subject to a performance condition, achievement of which is a pre-requisite for exercise of options.
The condition is tested once only after a period of three years and if it is not achieved the relevant options will lapse.
Options granted after 26 July 2001 will only be exercisable if the Groups EPS, before taking into account goodwill amortisation and exceptional or extraordinary items for the three year measurement period, must exceed growth in the Retail Price Index over the same period by at least nine percentage points.
The Remuneration Committee applied a different performance condition for options granted under the 1995 ESOS prior to 26 July 2001.
These options may not be exercised unless the growth in the Groups EPS over the period of any three consecutive years after the date of grant equals or exceeds the increase in the Retail Price Index over the same period by at least six percentage points.
Options are granted at the higher of the nominal value or the market value.
At 31 March 2005 options outstanding amounted to 4,736,000 ordinary shares see note 22 to the financial statements.
continued Performance Conditions The performance conditions for the LTIP and ESOS schemes described above were chosen following recommendations from external remuneration advisers and remain consistent with market practice.
Directors Service Contracts and Notice Periods Mr M Averill and Mr D Downes have rolling service contracts dated 29 September 1994, which required one years notice from the Director and two years notice from the Company.
The Remuneration Committee has agreed that the policy with regard to notice period for Executive Directors is one year.
Accordingly in July 2004, it was agreed that the notice period be reduced to six months from the Director and one year from the Company.
No compensation payments have been made for this reduction.
Mr F Welham has an existing contract which requires one years notice from the Group and six months from the Director.
Termination payments are limited to the Directors revised contractual remuneration including basic salary, any bonus earned and benefits for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
Any entitlement to LTIP awards or exercise of share options upon termination is governed by the rules of the relevant scheme.
Pensionable service will also accrue for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
In the event of early termination, the Remuneration Committee will consider carefully what compensation should be paid taking into account the circumstances of the particular case.
The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts.
External Appointments The Remuneration Committee acknowledges that executive directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other quoted companies which have no business relationship with the Group and that these duties can broaden their experience and knowledge to the benefit of the Company.
Executive Directors are limited to hold one such position and the policy is that fees may be retained by the Director, which reflects the personal risk assumed in such appointments.
Mr M Averill and Mr D Downes have each been appointed to one such non-executive position.
The fees received from these appointments were 28,750 and US$19,500 respectively.
Directors Emoluments The following table shows a breakdown of the emoluments of the individual Directors, excluding pension contributions to the defined benefit scheme and potential gains on exercise of share options, for the year to 31 March 2005.
Performance Other Total Basic salary related bonuses emoluments emoluments 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 2004 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 I M Clubb 100 100 100 100 M C E Averill 338 330 249 25 25 612 355 R C Biffa 28 28 28 28 P Delaunois 28 28 28 28 D J Downes 266 260 193 70 39 529 299 R B Pointon 28 28 28 28 1,325 838 Non-executive Director i Other emoluments include such items as a company car or car allowance, medical insurance, payments relating to FURBS and life assurance.
ii The Non-executive Directors do not participate in the annual bonus plan and do not receive any pension contributions from the Group.
iii Mr R Biffa is also a shareholder and director of Radstrong Limited.
The fees in respect of Mr Biffas services as a Director of the Group were paid to this company.
annual report 2005 Directors Pension Benefits Mr M Averill, Mr D Downes and Mr F Welham are members of the Shanks Group Pension Scheme, which is a funded, defined benefit scheme approved by HM Revenue & Customs.
Under the terms of this scheme the Executive Directors have: at retirement, and subject to length of service, a pension of up to two thirds of basic salary subject to HM Revenue & Customs limits: an employee contribution of 7% of basic salary: a lump sum death in service benefit of four times basic salary: and a spouses pension on death.
The Directors pension benefits are set out in the table and notes below: Transfer value of increase Increase Transfer value Transfer value decrease in Increase decrease at 31.03.05 at 31.03.04 Increase accrued pension decrease in accrued of pension of pension decrease in during the year in accrued pension Accrued benefits benefits transfer value net of inflation Age at pension during the year pension at accrued at accrued at less Directors less Directors 31.03.05 during the year net of inflation 31.03.05 31.03.05 31.03.04 contributions contributions ii iii iv iv iv v 000 pa 000 pa 000 000 000 000 000 M C E Averill 53 15 11 178 3,022 2,599 400 158 D J Downes i 59 31 32 35 630 1,120 497 580 i Mr Downes is subject to the HM Revenue & Customs cap on approved pension benefits and is provided with comparable unapproved benefits for basic salary in excess of the cap via a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme FURBS.
In September 2004, Mr Downes unapproved benefits were transferred from a defined benefit FURBS to a defined contribution FURBS.
The market value of the investments transferred was 656,000.
Due to this change in status, the defined contribution FURBS benefits have been excluded from the closing figures in the table above resulting in the negative figures shown.
A contribution of 86,000 was also paid by the Company to the defined contribution FURBS in December 2004.
The market value of the defined contribution FURBS investments as at 31 March 2005 was 802,000. ii The increase decrease in accrued pension during the year represents the difference between the total accrued pension at the end of the year and the equivalent amount at the beginning of the year.
iii The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service at the end of the year.
iv The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The calculation is based on the assumption that pensions will be paid from the earliest retirement age possible without the application of actuarial reduction factors at age of 57 for Mr M Averill and 60 for Mr D Downes.
v The increase decrease in transfer value has been calculated after taking into account market conditions and the Directors ages at 31 March 2005 and 31 March 2004. vi Employee contributions were increased from 5% of basic salary to 7% from 1 May 2004.
This has been reflected in the calculations.
