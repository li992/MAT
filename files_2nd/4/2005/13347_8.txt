25 Directors remuneration report Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7a of the Companies Act 1985.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Companys members on the auditable part of the Directors remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with Schedule 7a of the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information Remuneration Committee The Company has established a Remuneration Committee the Committee which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code.
The members of the committee during the year were John E. Jackson, Andrew Thomas, and Robert Ivell, who were all independent non-executive Directors.
The Committee is chaired by Andrew Thomas.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest in the Company other than as shareholders.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board.
No Director plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
In determining the other executive Directors remuneration for the year the Committee consulted Alan M. Jackson Chairman about its proposals.
Following his move from Executive Chairman to non-executive Chairman from 1 January 2006, the Committee is responsible for setting Alan M. Jacksons fee level.
Remuneration policy Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors of the high calibre needed to progress and develop the Group and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders.
The performance measurement of the executive Directors and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the Committee.
The remuneration of the non-executive Directors is determined by the Board.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for executive Directors: Basic annual salary including Directors fees and benefits: Annual bonus payments which cannot exceed 75% 2005: 75% of basic salary for executive Directors: Long-Term Incentive Plan awards: and Pension arrangements.
The Companys policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive Directors should be performance related.
As described below, executive Directors may earn annual incentive payments of up to 75% of their basic salary together with the benefits of the participation in the Long-Term Incentive Plan.
During 2005, the Company undertook a review of its remuneration and incentive arrangements for executive Directors and other senior management, with the advice of New Bridge Street Consultants LLP appointed independent advisers who provided no other services to the Group during the year, encompassing all elements of the remuneration packages.
Specific consideration was given to performance related pay, particularly share-based long-term incentive provision.
The main conclusion of this review was that a new Long-Term Incentive Plan the LTIP should be introduced to replace the 2003 Executive Mirror Option Scheme as the primary long-term incentive scheme.
As part of their mandate, New Bridge Consultants LLP discussed the proposed LTIP with the Companys substantial shareholders.
Further information on the LTIP follows on page 26 and 27.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the Company or Group.
During 2005, the Chairman held five other directorships, as set out on page 17.
His aggregate remuneration in respect of these totalled 210,000 in 2005.
Since the year end, Mr Jackson has become a director of Playtech plc.
In respect of his chairmanship of Living Ventures Limited, Mr Jackson received a fee of 35,000 for 2005 included in the amount of 210,000.
As a result of a previously agreed incentive arrangement, Mr Jackson received a one-off bonus from Bowmark Limited of 222,000 following Bowmark Limiteds disposal of its 30% stake in Living Ventures Limited to The Restaurant Group plc.
There is no requirement for Directors to remit fees earned from appointments outside of the Company or Group to the Company or Group.
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2005 26 Directors remuneration report continued Basic salary An executive Directors basic salary is determined by the Committee prior to the beginning of each year and when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a whole and by reference to remuneration levels at other companies in the leisure and hospitality sectors.
Basic salaries were reviewed in December 2004 with increases taking effect from 1 January 2005.
They were again reviewed in December 2005 with increases from 1 January 2006.
Executive Directors contracts of service which include details of remuneration will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
In addition to basic salary, the executive Directors receive pension contributions and certain benefits-in-kind, principally a car or car allowance, and health and life insurance.
Annual bonus payments The Committee establishes the objectives that must be met for each financial year if a cash bonus is to be paid.
The Committee believes that any incentive compensation awarded should be tied to the interests of the Companys shareholders and that the principal measure of those interests is Group profitability together with total shareholder return relative to the FTSE Leisure and Hospitality Sector.
Performance targets are set annually as part of the budgeting process and performance is reviewed against those targets at the end of the financial year.
The maximum performance related bonus that can be paid is 75% of basic annual salary.
Incentive payments for the year ended 1 January 2006 varied between 112,500 and 303,750 for the executive Directors.
This reflects the profit performance of the Group.
The Groups strategic objectives, control system and indicators are also aligned to total shareholder return.
Long term incentives The Company operates the 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, and the 2003 SAYE Scheme under which awards may be granted to Directors.
No further awards may be granted under the 1998 Executive Share Option Scheme or 2003 Executive Mirror Option Scheme following the introduction of the LTIP in 2005.
Long-Term Incentive Plan The 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP scheme, approved by shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 9 November 2005, is the primary long-term incentive scheme of the Company going forward.
Under the terms of this scheme, individuals may receive an award of conditional free shares Conditional Awards with a face value at grant of up to 100% 200% in exceptional circumstances of salary per annum, vesting at least three years after grant subject to performance conditions and continual appointment.
Discussions were held with major shareholders prior to the LTIP scheme being implemented.
In addition, the Plan has the flexibility to grant conditional awards on a matching basis, pro rata to the number of shares purchased via annual bonus Matching Awards.
Matching Awards may be granted over shares worth up to 37.5% of base salary per annum.
The aggregate value of annual awards Conditional and Matching is capped at 137.5% of base salary.
The Committee consider that EPS and TSR are the most appropriate measures of performance, with EPS targets rewarding significant and sustained earnings growth and TSR providing a balance to the financial performance and retaining a share price discipline in the remuneration package.
For the initial Conditional Awards to executive Directors, two separate performance conditions apply to a proportion of the award: The performance condition attached to 50% of the Conditional Awards requires average annual EPS growth from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2008 of between RPI plus 4% to RPI plus 10% p. a. for between 30% and 100% of this part of the award to vest i. e. between 15% and 50% of the total award.
The performance condition attached to the other 50% of the Conditional Awards is based on Total Shareholder Return TSR performance measured against the constituents of the FTSE SmallCap over a single three-year period from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2008 for between 30% for median performance increasing on a straight line basis to 100% for upper quartile performance of this award to vest i. e. between 15% for median and 50% for upper quartile performance of the total award.
Awards will vest on a straight line basis between minimum and maximum thresholds.
For Matching Awards, there will be a 0.3:1 match for average EPS growth of RPI 4% p. a. rising on a straight line basis to the full 1:1 match for average EPS growth of RPI 10% p. a..
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2005 27 Performance against the TSR targets will be independently calculated and reviewed by the Committee.
Under the terms of the plan as approved by shareholders, a one-off Conditional Award together with an option to participate in the Matching Award was made to Alan M. Jackson in his capacity of Executive Chairman.
Prior to Mr Jackson relinquishing executive responsibilities, a one-off Conditional Award worth 50% of salary for 2005 was made together with an invitation to invest up to 37.5% of his salary into Matching Awards, to be matched on a one for one basis.
Conditional Awards and Matching Awards are subject to the same performance criteria as noted above.
No further awards will be made under the Plan to Alan M. Jackson.
Following the approval of the LTIP, shareholding guidelines for executive Directors have been introduced, linked to the out-turn of the Plan.
At the time Conditional and Matching Awards vest under the Plan or any other executive plan established in the future, there is a requirement to retain no fewer than 50% of the shares net of taxes until a shareholding with a market value equal to 100% of base salary is achieved.
SAYE Scheme The Company also operates a SAYE Share Option Scheme, the 2003 SAYE Scheme, for eligible employees under which options may be granted at a discount of up to 20% of market value.
Eligible employees are full time employees and executive Directors who have worked for the Group for at least one year.
Under the terms of the Scheme the eligible employees are able to purchase shares under a three year savings contract.
The exercise price of the options granted is equal to the market value at the time the option is granted.
Pension arrangements Executive Directors have individual pension arrangements in the form of personal pension plans.
The Company makes a contribution at a rate of up to 20% of basic salary towards funding each executive Directors pension plan.
To the extent that this funding exceeds the relevant current Inland Revenue limit, the surplus may be paid as a salary supplement.
There are no unfunded pension promises or similar arrangement for Directors.
Performance graph As required by the Regulations, the graph below compares the Companys total shareholder return performance with the FTSE Leisure and Hospitality share index for each of the past five years.
The FTSE Leisure and Hospitality Share index has been selected for this comparison because it is the index most relevant to gauging the Companys relative performance.

However, it may be necessary occasionally to offer longer notice periods to new Directors.
All executive Directors have contracts which are subject to one years notice by either party.
In the event of early termination, the Directors contracts provide for compensation in line with their contractual notice period.
The details of the executive Directors contracts are summarised in the table below: Date of contract Notice period Andrew Page 28 August 2002 1 year Stephen M. A. Critoph 7 July 2004 1 year Kevin J. Bacon 17 March 2003 1 year Patricia A. Corzine 31 March 2003 1 year Non-executive Directors The service contracts of the non-executive Directors were each set for an initial three year period thereafter renewable for periods of three years.
They are required to submit themselves for re-election every three years and the Board believes this to be appropriate in the Companys circumstances.
Andrew Thomas was re-elected in 2003, and Robert Ivell was elected in 2005.
Andrew Thomas is standing for re-election at the forthcoming 2006 Annual General Meeting, and, in accordance with best practice, John E. Jackson is also standing for re-election as he has served on the Board for more than nine years.
Under their terms of appointment the non-executive Directors have no notice period.
Their appointments were made as follows: Date of appointment as non-executive Director Alan M. Jackson 9 November 2005 John E. Jackson 1 October 1996 Andrew Thomas 1 May 2001 Robert Ivell 1 March 2004 Alan M. Jackson was previously Executive Chairman of the Company, and was appointed in March 2001.
From 1 January 2006 he has held the position of non-executive Chairman.
The information contained in the audited information is based on the financial year to 1 January 2006, and hence remuneration is disclosed for Mr Jacksons tenure as an executive Director.
At an Extraordinary General Meeting held on 9 November 2005, a sum of 240,000 for Mr Jacksons fee for 2006 was approved by shareholders.
The fee level was set recognising the higher than usual time commitment approximately two days a week, to take account of Mr Jacksons role in reviewing each new site opening.
All non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board based on a review of fees paid to non-executive Directors of similar companies and reflects the time commitment and responsibilities of each role.
The basic fee paid to each non-executive Director in the year was 40,000.

The Company operates a number of share option schemes which executive Directors may participate in.
Following the Placing of 19,430,000 shares on 14 January 2004, an application to restate the number and price of share options granted under the 1998 and 2003 schemes to Directors and employees was approved by the Inland Revenue.
This restatement was calculated to ensure the effective number and price attributed to the options was as before the Placing with no incremental benefit to the option holders.
The information provided below is stated assuming the restatement occurred on 1 January 2004.

Under that scheme, the exercise of options was dependent upon the following performance criteria: The year on year growth of earnings per share must exceed the average year on year growth in the Retail Price Index by more than 4% per annum or more than 3% per annum for any year if inflation, as measured by the change in the Retail Price Index, is in excess of 8% for that year, for a period of three consecutive financial years each ending during the life of the option.
Following the approval of the 2003 Mirror Scheme, the executive Directors were ineligible to acquire new options under the 1998 Scheme.
As at 1 January 2006, there are no outstanding share options eligible for exercise by the executive Directors under the 1998 Scheme.
Under the 2003 Mirror Scheme the performance criterion that must be met requires the Companys earnings per share to grow at an annual rate of the Retail Price Index plus 2.5% over the three year period prior to exercise of the option.
No further awards may be made under the 2003 Scheme following the adoption of the LTIP.
LTIP 1 these are Conditional Shares awarded under the LTIP scheme.
They are free shares awarded to the Directors should the performance criteria be met.
The vesting criteria is dependent on earnings per share growth of the 2008 results compared with the 2005 results.
LTIP 2 these are Matching Shares awarded under the LTIP scheme.
They are free shares and are conditional on the Directors acquiring a certain number of shares by 7 May 2006 for the respective Director to be entitled to the Matching Shares available under the scheme, and the performance criteria be met.
Note 1 : Alan M. Jackson was granted an option over 2,400,000 ordinary shares on 5 June 2001 at an exercise price of 45p per share.
This option is divided into three tranches of 800,000 shares, each of which may only be exercised if certain performance criteria are met.
The Companys share price must meet a specified target, which is 75p in the case of the first tranche, 105p in the case of the second tranche and 135p in the case of the third tranche.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying performance of the Group before any tranche of the option can be exercised.
For the second and third tranches, half of each tranche of the option may be exercised after three years and half after four years in each case following the date of the grant.
Each tranche of the option will lapse six years following the date of the grant if the target share price has not by then been met.
If, however, the target share price relating to any tranche of the option is met within this period that tranche will remain exercisable until ten years following the date of grant.
If a change of control of the Company occurs, Mr. Jackson is entitled to exercise the option in full.
During the year the Companys share price met the criteria of the three tranches and the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying performance of the Group.
Alan M. Jackson has exercised all of those options available to him under the first and second tranches.
During 2005 certain Directors exercised share options that had vested.
