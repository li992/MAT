As a result, they also received a pension-related salary supplement of 10% of the difference between the pensions earnings cap and their base salary.
2 The pensions for Roger Holmes, Maurice Helfgott and Laurel Powers-Freeling are based on their deferred pension on respective leaving dates of 31 May 2004, 30 November 2004 and 31 December 2004.
MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC 25 a Pension benets continued The accrued entitlement represents the deferred pension at age 60 to which the director would have been entitled had they left the Company on 3 April 2004 and 2 April 2005 respectively.
The additional pension relates to the increase in the deferred pension during the year gross and net of ination under the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, and the Listing Rules respectively.
The transfer value of the deferred pension calculated as at 2 April 2005 is calculated by the actuary of the relevant Company Pension Scheme in accordance with actuarial guidance note GN11.
The equivalent transfer value calculated as at 3 April 2004 is on the assumption that the director had left service at that date.
Ination has been assumed to be equivalent to the actual rate of price ination which was 3.1% for the year to 30 September 2004.
The measurement date accords with the Listing Rules.
The transfer values are the lump sums which could have been paid to another pension scheme for the benefit of the director.
It is not possible for a transfer value to be paid directly to the director personally.
Luc Vandevelde, Vittorio Radice and Mark McKeon left the Company on 31 May 2004, 11 June 2004 and 30 November 2004 respectively.
None of them participated in the Company Pension Scheme.
Stuart Rose and Charles Wilson do not participate in the Company Pension Scheme.
