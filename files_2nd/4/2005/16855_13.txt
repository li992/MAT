# Retired 28 July 2004 Non executive directors remuneration The remuneration for non-executive directors is set by the full board on the recommendation of the executive directors.
Remuneration comprises an annual fee plus an additional fee for the chairman of each of the audit and remuneration committees and for the senior independent non-executive director.
Non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in any of the companys bonus or share option schemes.
Remuneration policy The companys policy continues to provide for each of its executive directors a remuneration package which is adequate to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the appropriate calibre, whilst at the same time not paying more than is necessary for this purpose.
Executive directors remuneration The following comprised the principal elements of executive directors remuneration for the period under review: base salary benefits, including pension, company car and fuel, healthcare and private telephone costs annual short term performance related bonus long term incentive plan LTIP share options 32 VT Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Remuneration report continued Year ended 31 March 2005 During the year a comprehensive review of executive directors Remuneration has been undertaken by the Remuneration committee with the assistance of the Monks Partnership on the instructions of the Remuneration committee.
In addition, the Monks Partnership have provided advice on remuneration for employees.
The short term bonus has been awarded annually by the Remuneration committee and relates to the achievement of certain profit and cash targets set by that committee.
The maximum bonus payable has been 50% of base salary.
With effect from 1 April 2005, subject to shareholder approval, the executive directors will participate in a Deferred Annual Bonus Scheme DABS.
This scheme will replace the existing annual short-term performance related bonus.
The maximum payment achievable under these new arrangements will be 75% of base salary.
Providing that the annual targets for profit and cash are met, and the strategic objectives for all executive directors are achieved, 40% of any bonus payment will be deferred for a period of three years and placed, as shares, in a trust.
Individual executive directors may also elect to defer a further 35% of bonus under the same arrangement.
At the end of the three year period, matching shares will be awarded dependent upon earnings per share targets having been consistently achieved over the whole period.
The maximum matching will be 3:1.
Under the LTIP, each year shares may be awarded to executive directors and to other selected senior executives equal in value up to 50% of base salary.
The shares are held in trust and released after three years pro rata to achievement of the performance target, which is at least the median of the comparator group.
The performance criterion is the Total Shareholder Return TSR of the comparator group which currently comprises the members of the FTSE 250 but excluding Investment Trusts but for future years the Remuneration committee has the discretion at the point of allocation additionally to relate the TSR to the Defence sector or the Support Services sector.
Relative movements in TSR are shown in the graph below.
Shares vest fully if the companys performance equals or exceeds the upper quartile of the comparator group but there is no vesting if performance is below the median.
Each time executive directors are awarded shares under the LTIP they are entitled to invest up to 5% of base salary to purchase additional shares in the company provided that the cash cost does not exceed the amount they received in their most recent DABS award.
These additional shares are held in the trust for at least three years and they are then matched on a 1:1 basis with further shares.
Share option plans The company operates two share option plans a UK Inland Revenue approved plan and an unapproved plan under which executive directors and other executives are eligible to participate at the discretion of the Remuneration committee.
Options are granted at market value, determined immediately before the grant.
Annual awards do not normally exceed one times base salary.
Options under the companys schemes can normally be exercised only on the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Remuneration committee and linked to the underlying performance of the company.
The performance condition currently applying is real growth in earnings per share excluding goodwill amortisation and exceptional items of at least 3% per annum over three consecutive years.
There will be no retesting.
Performance graph As the company is a constituent of the FTSE 250, the FTSE 250 index provides an appropriate indication of market movements against which to benchmark the companys performance.
