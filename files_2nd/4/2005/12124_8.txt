Photo-Me International plc 31 Annual Report 2005 Remuneration report The Remuneration Committee In line with the requirements of the Combined Code, the Committee operates within agreed terms of reference and has responsibility for determining the remuneration of the executive directors and the Groups other senior executives.
With the exception of the constitution of the Remuneration Committee which, as explained below, includes two non-executive directors who are considered by the Combined Code not to be independent, the Board confirms that the Company has complied throughout the relevant year with the provisions of the Combined Code relating to directors remuneration.
The Committee consists entirely of non-executive directors and held one meeting during the year.
The directors who served on the Committee throughout the year were as follows: Vernon Sankey Committee Chairman Sir Patrick McNair-Wilson David Scotland Francis Wahl The Board acknowledges that Sir Patrick McNair-Wilson due to a past business relationship with the Group and Francis Wahl due to length of service as a non-executive director will not be deemed independent.
However, they have, and will continue to, apply entirely independent judgement in connection with executive remuneration issues.
The Committee is advised by New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, who have been appointed by the Committee and who advise it on various matters relating to senior executive remuneration.
New Bridge Street Consultants have provided no other services to the Company.
The Committee also received advice from Serge Crasnianski in relation to the remuneration of certain senior executives but not in relation to his own remuneration.
Remuneration policy for executive directors The Committees remuneration policy for the executive directors is to have regard to the directors experience and the nature and complexity of their work in order to provide a competitive remuneration package that attracts, retains and motivates high calibre executives from whom first class performance is expected.
The remuneration policy is also intended to be consistent with the Companys business objectives and shareholder interests.
In order to align the interests of shareholders and executive directors, a significant proportion of the remuneration of executive directors is performance-related through an annual bonus plan and the grant of share options.
The remuneration packages of the executive directors comprise the following main elements: Basic salary Annual bonus Share options Pensions Other benefits Basic salary The basic salaries of the executive directors are reviewed annually by the Committee.
In conducting this review, the Committee takes account of the terms of existing service contracts and the performance of the individual executive director concerned.
The Committee also has regard to the pay of staff and management generally within the Group and takes into consideration the levels of basic salary paid by other relevant companies of similar size and standing, and market levels generally.
Annual bonus In 2003 an annual bonus scheme was introduced, whereby executive directors may receive an award of up to 50% of basic salary, subject to the extent to which annual performance targets are met.
Such targets take account of current business plans and are based largely on pre-tax profit and other objective financial tests.
A threshold performance level is set, below which no bonus is payable.
With effect from May 2004 the Committee increased the maximum award level to 75% of basic salary: any bonus in excess of 50% only being paid in return for outstanding performance.
The first bonuses under the scheme were paid in the year to 30 April 2005.
Share options In recent past years until February 2004, the Company issued share options under the rules of the Approved and Unapproved Senior Staff Share Option Schemes which were introduced in 1997.
These schemes were the sole share-based long-term incentive arrangement for senior executives.
Existing options granted under the Schemes can only be exercised subject to the achievement of a performance criterion.
At the Annual General Meeting of 4 November 2004 the 1997 Approved and Unapproved Senior Staff Share Option Schemes were replaced with a new Photo-Me Executive Share Option Scheme the Scheme, which will operate as the sole long-term incentive arrangement for the Companys executive directors and senior employees and which is more reflective of current best and market practice.
The main features of the new Scheme are that options may be granted over shares worth up to 150% of a participants salary, each year.
The vesting of options is subject to an EPS-based performance condition relating to the extent to which the Companys EPS for the third financial year end, following the date of grant, reaches a sliding scale of challenging EPS targets.
Remuneration report Remuneration report 32 Photo-Me International plc Annual Report 2005 Remuneration policy for executive directors continued Share options continued These absolute EPS targets are used as the Committee believes that the Companys senior executive team should focus on delivering substantial EPS growth over subsequent three year periods.
The extent to which these targets are met will be determined by the Committee, with the assistance of external consultants to ensure independent verification.
The Committee will take advice as to the best approach to adopt to take account of new International Financial Reporting Standards, in relation to any EPS-based targets that are set.
As yet, no options have been issued under the new scheme.
Pensions Executive directors with salaries paid by the Company in the UK are entitled to join the Companys Group Stakeholder Pension Plan, to which the Company contributes 5% of their basic UK salaries.
Serge Crasnianski, Franois Giuntini and Jean-Luc Peurois are members of the Plan.
Company contributions at the rate of 5% of their basic UK salaries were: 2005 2004 Serge Crasnianski 4,870 4,791 Franois Giuntini 960 939 Jean-Luc Peurois 3,357 3,285 9,187 9,015 Other benefits Executive directors are provided with employment related benefits which can include a company car, private medical insurance and life assurance.
Service agreements The following executive directors have service contracts which are terminable by the Company on giving 12 months notice.
None are appointed for a specified period.
The dates of these service contracts are as follows: Serge Crasnianski 23 October 2000 Franois Giuntini 23 October 2000 Jean-Luc Peurois 23 October 2000 The overseas service contracts of Franois Giuntini and Jean-Luc Peurois provide for notice periods of 12 and 9 months respectively and for the payment of a liquidated amount equal to 6 and 9 months of their overseas basic salary, respectively.
The provisions in Messrs Giuntinis and Peurois service contracts are consistent with local practice in France, where these executives carry out a significant proportion of their duties.
Therefore, the Committee does not consider it appropriate to alter these existing contractual entitlements.
Riccardo Costi has no service contract with the Company, but has a contract dated 16 June 1999 with the Groups subsidiary company, Nippon Auto-Photo KK.
This contract is not for a specified period, is terminable by the company without notice but provides for payment of a liquidated amount equal to 18 months of basic salary.
Such a provision is consistent with local practice in Japan for a senior executive with his length of service of over 30 years.
Therefore, the Committee does not consider it appropriate to alter this existing contractual entitlement.
The Committees policy is that no future executive directors service contract shall be of a fixed term nor shall be terminable on giving more than 12 months notice and that such contract shall contain no provisions for the payment of liquidated damages on termination, which the Committee considers appropriately reflects market and best practice.
Within the restrictions imposed by the relevant service contracts, the Committee will apply the principle of mitigation when determining any payment of compensation on an executive directors termination.
Dan David, who served as non-executive Chairman until 1 February 2005, had service contracts with the Company dated 23 October 2000 which were subject to 6 months notice from either party.
In accordance with his contracts Dan David was paid at the contracted rate until 4 May 2005, in order to ensure a smooth handover to the new Chairman.
On 1 February 2005 Dan David was appointed Life President of the Company and remains a non-executive director, with no service contract, on similar terms as other non-executive directors.
The only difference to other non-executive directors is that Dan David is to be paid an additional 1,000 per annum and will continue to benefit from private health insurance, in recognition of his position as Life President.
None of the non-executive directors are appointed for a specified term and none have service contracts, although they are subject to re-election by shareholders at least every 3 years as are the executive directors.
None of the non-executive directors will be entitled to compensation upon termination of their involvement with the Company.
Non-executive directors fees The fees of the non-executive directors are determined by the executive directors, taking into account the level of fees paid by companies of a similar size and standing.
Non-executive directors are not entitled to participate in any Group pension scheme nor will they be granted any awards under the Companys option schemes or annual bonus plan.
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Board as a whole excluding the Chairman and not by the Remuneration Committee.
The Board believes that this procedure is appropriate for the Company.
