Directors remuneration report Dear shareholder I wanted to take this opportunity to reiterate our senior executive remuneration policy and to update you on some detailed changes that we are making to the application of that policy.
Our remuneration policy We wish to attract and retain the best global talent to deliver Diageos strategy within a framework of good corporate governance.
Our remuneration policy remains unchanged from 2004, when it was reviewed and approved by shareholders, as we believe that it continues to support those objectives.
Our remuneration policy is as follows: Our senior executive remuneration arrangements are intended to attract and retain the best global talent.
We believe that pay should vary significantly with performance over both the short and long term.
Our base salaries are set at the median of the relevant market for each role.
Annual bonuses are paid in cash after the end of each financial year and are determined by performance in the year against pre-set stretching business targets.
Our long term incentives comprise a combination of share option grants and share awards in each year, and vary with three year EPS and TSR performance respectively.
Our senior executives are required to hold shares in Diageo to participate fully in our share option and share award plans.
Three changes have been made to the way in which the TSR plan is being operated.
The TSR plan is a long term incentive plan under which senior executives can be made awards of shares in Diageo, depending on how Diageos Total Shareholder Return TSR performs relative to a peer group of companies, over a three year period.
The level of share award that will vest if we perform at the median, or in the middle, of this peer group has been reduced from 50% of the initial award to 35% of the initial award.
This change was communicated at last years AGM and had effect for initial awards made after October 2004.
The remuneration committee planned to align the timing of making awards under the TSR plan with the start of the financial year from 2005 onwards.
To effect this transition, a one-off half size award was granted with a performance cycle effective from 1 January 2005, with initial awards that did not exceed 125% of base salary.
Making this half size award meant that executives have not received initial awards that were any greater than they otherwise would have received, on a pro rata basis.
Following the strategic realignment of the groups businesses, Diageo is now a global premium drinks business headquartered in the United Kingdom.
During the year, the remuneration committee reviewed the TSR peer group for future awards to ensure that each peer company remains a relevant comparator.
We are also making a number of detailed changes to the application of our policy, which are summarised below: TSR plan peer group We have had to make some changes to the peer group of companies against which we measure our TSR performance to reflect recent consolidations.
Due to the combination of former peer group companies Procter & Gamble and Gillette, we have replaced Gillette with the first reserve company for the outstanding performance cycles.
For the 2003 and 2004 plans, Gillette has been replaced by Pernod Ricard.
For the 2005 plan Gillette has been replaced by Scottish & Newcastle and the remuneration committee approved Groupe Danone and LOral as reserve companies.
More recently, the combination of Pernod Ricard and Allied Domecq has resulted in the replacement of Allied Domecq with Inbev for the 2003 and 2004 plans, and Groupe Danone for the 2005 plan.
The section of the remuneration report that covers the TSR plan provides details of the revised peer groups and the remaining reserve company.
Executive service contracts We are revising our service contracts for senior executives.
As before, they will require 12 monthsnotice to be given on termination.
If a termination payment becomes due under the new contracts, the remuneration committee may exercise their discretion to require part of the termination payment to be paid in instalments and to be subject to mitigation.
IFRS and the measurement of EPS growth for incentive plans We have considered the implications of the transition to the new accounting framework on the need to assess three-year EPS performance in a consistent and robust way.
It will not be practical to restate either historic or future EPS on a common accounting policy basis.
We intend to review the material differences between the two approaches on an item by item basis and remove significant one-off variances to produce normalised earnings.
As with most businesses the performance of Diageo depends on the quality and commitment of its people.
We believe that our remuneration policy helps to attract and retain the best global talent.
Lord Hollick of Notting Hill Senior non-executive director and chairman of the remuneration committee Diageo Annual Report 2005 64 Directors remuneration report What this report covers This report to shareholders for the year ended 30 June 2005 covers: the policy under which executive and non-executive directors are remunerated: and tables of information showing details of the remuneration and share interests of all the directors.
The report was approved by the remuneration committee, which is a duly appointed and authorised committee of the board of directors, on 30 August 2005 and was signed on its behalf by Lord Hollick who is senior non-executive director and chairman of the remuneration committee.
As required by The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations, this report will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the annual general meeting.
The board has followed and complied with section 1 of the new Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued in July 2003 and the Regulations in preparing this report and in designing performance-related remuneration for senior executives.
KPMG Audit Plc have audited the report to the extent required by the Regulations, being the sections headed Directors remuneration for the year ended 30 June 2005, Long term incentive plans and Executive directors pension benefits.

The chairman and the chief executive may, by invitation, attend remuneration committee meetings, except when their own remuneration is discussed.
Further information on meetings held and director attendance is disclosed in the corporate governance report.
The remuneration committees terms of reference are available at www.
com and on request from the company secretary.
Advice During the year ended 30 June 2005, Diageos human resources director and director of performance and reward were invited by the remuneration committee to provide their views and advice.
The remuneration committee also appointed the following independent and expert consultants: Deloitte & Touche LLP who provided external market data on levels of senior executive remuneration.
They also provide HR systems, accountancy and tax services to Diageo, including services to support the process for assessing risk management and control systems and processes.
Hewitt Associates who provided external market data on levels of senior executive remuneration in the United States.
During the year they also acted as advisers to the UK pension scheme, provided other pension and reward services and services in respect of financial reporting.
Kepler Associates who reviewed and confirmed the total shareholder return of Diageo and the peer group companies for the 2002 TSR plan cycle the performance cycle which ended on 31 December 2004, provided analysis of appropriate TSR plan peer group reserve companies for performance cycles from 2005 and provided a monthly performance update of all outstanding performance cycles.
They provided no other services to Diageo during the year.
Additional remuneration survey data published by Monks Partnership, Towers Perrin and Watson Wyatt was presented to the committee during the year.
Remuneration philosophy Diageos remuneration philosophy for senior executives is based on a belief in: Performance-related compensation: it influences and supports performance and the creation of a high performing organisation.
Rewarding sustainable performance: it is at the heart of Diageos corporate strategy and is vital to meeting investors goals.
Measuring performance over three years: it aligns with the time cycle over which management decisions are reflected in the creation of value in this business.
Providing a balanced mix of remuneration: base salary, benefits, pension, short term cash incentives and longer term equity incentives.
Providing a competitive total remuneration opportunity: it helps Diageo compete for the best talent among companies with global operations and global consumers.
The board of directors continues to set stretching performance targets for the business and its leaders in the context of the prevailing economic climate.
To achieve these stretch targets requires exceptional business management and strategic execution to deliver performance.
This approach to target setting reflects the aspirational performance environment which Diageo wishes to create.
In Diageo, annual incentive plans aim to reward good performance with commensurate levels of remuneration.
Long term incentive plans aim to reward long term sustained performance.
Under both sets of plans, if stretch targets are achieved, high levels of reward may be earned.
All incentives are capped to ensure that inappropriate business risk taking is neither encouraged nor rewarded.

The anticipated normal mix between fixed and variable remuneration is that for 100 of remuneration earned, 32 will be fixed remuneration and 68 will be performance related remuneration.
In some years, the performance related remuneration may be higher or lower depending on the performance of the business.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 66 Directors remuneration report Share ownership Senior executives are required to hold shares in Diageo to participate fully in the share option and share award plans.
This policy extends to the top 100 senior leaders and reflects Diageos belief that its most senior leaders should also be shareholders.
Individuals have three years to build up their shareholding from their own resources.
The executive directors each held company shares equivalent to at least 225% of their basic salary on 1 January 2005 and met the requirement.
The senior executives are eligible to participate in the broad-based share and option plans Diageo operates for its employees.
These are the tax approved share incentive plan and savings-related share option scheme in the United Kingdom.
Service contracts At the time of signing the remuneration report the executive directors have service contracts, which provide for six months notice by the director or 12 months notice by the company and contain non-compete obligations.
In the event of early termination by the company without cause, the agreements provide for predetermined compensation to be paid, equivalent to 12 months basic salary for the notice period and an equal amount in respect of all benefits.
PS Walshs service contract with the company is dated 7 October 1999.
NC Roses service contract with the company is dated 1 October 2000.
We are revising our service contracts for senior executives.
As before, they will require 12 months notice to be given on termination.
External appointments With the specific approval of the board in each case, executive directors may accept external appointments as non-executive directors of other companies and retain any related fees paid to them.
During the year ended 30 June 2005, PS Walsh served as a non-executive director of Centrica plc and of FedEx Corporation and retained the fees paid to him for the services.
The total amounts of such fees paid to him in the year ended 30 June 2005 were 46,250 and $74,875 respectively.
In line with the FedEx Corporation policy for outside directors, PS Walsh is eligible to be granted share options.
During the year ended 30 June 2005, he was granted 6,000 options at an option price of $84.98.
He also exercised 4,000 options that were granted at an option price of $35.94.
Of these, 3,000 were sold at $99.60 per share, and 1,000 were retained.
The fair market value on the date of exercise was $98.93.
NC Rose served as a non-executive director of Scottish Power plc during the year ended 30 June 2005 and retained the fees paid to him for this service.
The fees paid to him in the year ended 30 June 2005 amounted to 57,000.
Chairmans terms, conditions and fees The chairman had a letter of appointment for an initial five year term from 1 July 2000.
As previously disclosed, this has been extended by the board to 30 June 2007.
It is terminable on six months notice by either party or, if terminated by the company, by payment of six months fees in lieu of notice.
Diageos policy on chairmans fees is as follows: the fees should be sufficient to attract, motivate and retain world-class talent: fee practice should be consistent with recognised best-practice standards for the position of chairman: the chairman shall not participate in any of the companys incentive plans: and part of the chairmans fee shall be paid in Diageo shares.
The fees of the chairman are normally reviewed every two years and any changes would normally take effect from 1 January.
Fees are reviewed in the light of market practice in large UK companies and anticipated workload, tasks and liabilities.
In accordance with the companys stated policy, a review of the chairmans fees was undertaken in the year.
In light of market practice, it was determined that the chairmans annual fee should be increased by 50,000 to 500,000.
As recommended by the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, these changes were approved by the remuneration committee with effect from 1 January 2005.
The whole of the increase is paid in Diageo shares, which have to be retained until the chairman retires from the company or ceases to be a director for any other reason.
Non-executive director terms, conditions and fees The non-executive directors have letters of appointment.
A summary of their terms and conditions of appointment is available at www.
Diageos policy on non-executive director fees is as follows: the fees should be sufficient to attract, motivate and retain world-class non-executive talent within the limits set by the shareholders from time to time: fee practice should be consistent with recognised best-practice standards for non-executive directors: and non-executive directors should not participate in any of the companys incentive plans.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 67 Directors remuneration report Directors remuneration report continued The fees of non-executive directors are normally reviewed every two years and any changes would normally take effect from 1 January.
Following the most recent review the base fee for the non-executive directors was increased by 10,000 to 60,000, the other elements remain unchanged.
The current annual fees, effective from 1 January 2005, are: From 1 Jan 2005 Base fee 60,000 Senior non-executive director 20,000 Chairman of audit committee 20,000 Chairman of remuneration committee 10,000 In addition, an allowance of 3,000 is payable each time an overseas based non-executive director is required to travel to attend board and committee meetings to reflect the additional time commitment involved.

b As at 30 June 2005 the salary payable to the chief executive was 930,000 p. a. and to the chief financial officer was 525,000 p. a.
In the financial years ended 30 June 2004 and 30 June 2005, the percentage increases in basic salary of the chief executive were 4% and 10% respectively, with an average increase in the two years of 7%.
In the financial years ended 30 June 2004 and 30 June 2005, the percentage increases in the basic salary of the chief financial officer were 4% and 8% respectively, with an average increase in the two years of 6%.
These average increases are comparable with those made in companies in the pay benchmarking group for these roles.
c The business results for the year ended 30 June 2005 are described in the operating and financial review and the level of the executive directors annual bonus payments are commensurate with this level of performance delivery.
d Other benefits include company car and driver, fuel, product allowance, financial counselling, accompaniment by spouse on business travel when appropriate, medical insurance and life insurance premiums.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 68 Directors remuneration report Long term incentive plans payment and gains for the year ended 30 June 2005 In addition to the above emoluments, in the year the executive directors received payments and made gains under long term incentive plans as follows: 2005 2004 Executive 2002 share option a TSR Plan exercises SEPSOS Total Total 000 000 000 000 000 Executive directors NC Rose 636 878 13 1,527 536 PS Walsh 1,109 287 172 1,568 1,456 Total 1,745 1,165 185 3,095 1,992 a The Senior Executive Phantom Share Option Scheme SEPSOS operated within GrandMet as a share price related bonus scheme, and the last grants under it were made in 1996.
Amounts paid in respect of SEPSOS arose from the exercise of phantom options in prior years and, in the case of PS Walsh, from exercises during the year.
All remaining phantom options under SEPSOS have now been exercised and a final payment will be made to PS Walsh in November 2005.
Long term incentive plans LTIPs Annual awards of LTIPs are granted under both the total shareholder return plan TSR plan and the senior executive share option plan SESOP.
The level of award is considered each year in the light of performance.
The remuneration committee regularly reviews the performance measures and the vesting schedule used in each plan.
This is to ensure that the LTIPs continue to support the business objectives and are in line with current best practice.
During the year, the remuneration committee determined that the level of award under the TSR plan that would vest for TSR performance at the median, position 9 out of 18 relative to the peer group for a TSR plan cycle, should be reduced from 50% to 35% for awards granted under the TSR plan after October 2004.
TSR plan Under this plan, participants are granted a conditional right to receive shares.
All conditional rights awarded vest after a three year period the performance cycle subject to achievement of two performance tests.
The primary performance test is a comparison of Diageos three year total shareholder return the percentage growth in Diageos share price assuming all dividends and capital distributions are reinvested with the TSR of a peer group of 17 other companies.
TSR calculations for all cycles commencing on or after January 2002 are converted to a common currency US dollars.
The second performance test requires that the remuneration committee not recommend the release of awards if it considers that there has not been an underlying improvement in Diageos three year financial performance, typically measured by improvements in earnings per share.
For the performance cycles 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2005 and 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2006, the peer group consists of Diageo and Altria, Anheuser-Busch, Campbell Soup, Carlsberg, Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, Heineken, Heinz, Inbev, Kelloggs, McDonalds, Nestl, PepsiCo, Pernod Ricard, Procter & Gamble, Unilever and Yum!
There are no reserve companies remaining for the 2003 or 2004 plans.
For awards made before January 2005 the performance cycles began on 1 January each year.
For awards made after July 2005 the performance cycle will begin on 1 July each year.
To effect this transition, a one-off half size award was made with a performance cycle that began on 1 January 2005, with initial awards that did not exceed 125% of base salary.
The following table shows the percentage of the award that will normally be released at the end of the performance cycle: 2005-2007 and subsequent performance cycles Ranking in peer group 1-2 3456789 10-18 % of award released 150 142 114 94 83 72 61 35 nil For the 2003-2005 and 2004-2006 performance cycles the level of vesting will remain 50%, not 35% of the initial award.
For performance cycles from 1 January 2005, the peer group currently consists of Diageo and Anheuser-Busch, Brown-Forman, Cadbury Schweppes, Carlsberg, Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, Groupe Danone, Heineken, Heinz, Inbev, Nestl, PepsiCo, Pernod Ricard, Procter & Gamble, SAB Miller, Scottish & Newcastle and Unilever.
The reserve company remaining for the 2005 plan, currently 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2007, is LOral.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 69 Directors remuneration report Directors remuneration report continued Directors interests in TSR plan awards The following table shows the directors interests in the TSR plan.
Details of executive share options are shown separately see below.
For the performance cycle 1 January 2005 31 December 2007 award made in February 2005 only 35% of this number of shares would be released for achieving position nine in the peer group and no shares would be released for achieving a position of 10 or below.
b This number reflects the maximum possible award of 150% of the number of shares initially awarded, that would be released for achieving position one or two in the peer group.
c The closing market price on 18 February 2005, the award date, was 752 pence.
d The three year performance cycle for the 2002 TSR award ended on 31 December 2004.
The number of shares to be released based on the relative TSR performance was 94.4% of the initial award based on a TSR ranking at position five in the peer group at the end of the performance cycle.
Kepler Associates independently confirmed the TSR ranking Diageos EPS growth over the performance cycle exceeded the growth in the UK RPI over the same period.
The remuneration committee determined this represented an underlying improvement in financial performance that permitted the release of the awards.
e The market price on 18 February 2005, the release date.
The market price when the award was made on 22 February 2002 was 811 pence.
f The directors interests are deemed to be the maximum award.
At 15 August 2005, they were the same as at 30 June 2005. g For performance cycles ending on 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2006 the remuneration committee will normally approve the release of awards in the February following the end of the performance cycle.
With effect from 2005, for performance cycles ending on 30 June each year the remuneration committee will normally approve the release of awards in the August following the end of the performance cycle.
Senior executive share option plan SESOP Options granted under SESOP cannot normally be exercised unless a performance condition is satisfied.
The current performance condition is based on the increase in Diageos basic earnings per share before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items EPS over a three year period.
If the increase in EPS is at least 15 percentage points greater than the increase in the RPI over the same period, then all the options can be exercised.
If the EPS increase is at least 12 percentage points greater than that of the RPI but less than 15 percentage points, half of the options can be exercised.
For options granted from October 2004 no retest is permitted.
For options granted prior to October 2004, if all or half of the options fail the initial performance condition, the three year assessment period will be rolled forward by a year and a retest carried out at that time.
However, the performance condition can only be rolled forward a maximum of three times.
The following table shows, for the directors who held office during the year, the number of options held under all executive share option schemes and savings-related schemes.
The mid-market price for ordinary shares at 30 June 2005 was 823 pence 30 June 2004 744 pence: 15 August 2005 778 pence.
The highest mid-market price during the year was 824 pence and the lowest mid-market price was 658 pence.
Exercisable options are those that have vested and can be exercised in the option period:not exercisable are those options where the minimum holding period has not been completed or the performance conditions have not yet been met.
The option period starts from the earliest month in which the options may be exercised and ends with the month in which the options lapse.
Growth in Diageos EPS before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items EPS, and after adjustments to ensure that EPS was measured on a consistent basis over the performance period of the three years ended 30 June 2005 exceeded the performance condition RPI plus 15 percentage points and these options will become exercisable in full in October 2005. b Options granted under the savings-related share option scheme.
Long term incentive plans and change of control In the event of a change of control, outstanding TSR Plan awards would be released and outstanding share options would become exercisable, based on the extent to which the relevant performance conditions had been met since the initial award or grant respectively, time apportioned to reflect the shortened performance period that had elapsed, and at the remuneration committees discretion.
Pension provision Scheme details NC Rose and PS Walsh are members of the Diageo pension scheme.
They accrue pension rights at the rate of onethirtieth of basic salary per annum, subject only to current Inland Revenue limits.
Bonus payments and other benefits are not included in pensionable pay.
No actuarial reduction is applied to pensions payable from the age of 57, subject to company consent.
Their pensions are guaranteed to increase in line with inflation up to a level of 5% per annum, and such increases will not be lower than 3% per annum and that their pensions at normal pension age of 62 will not be less than two-thirds of basic salary in the 12 months prior to retirement.
On death in service, a lump sum of four times pensionable salary is paid, along with a spouses pension of two-thirds of the members prospective pension.
When an executive director dies after retirement, a spouses pension of two-thirds of the members pension would be paid.
The executive directors are not currently required to make pension contributions.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 71 Directors remuneration report Directors remuneration report continued For executives who entered service after 31 May 1989, the benefits which can be provided from the Diageo pension scheme are restricted by the operation of the current Inland Revenue earnings cap.
Such executives, including any directors, receive total pension benefits calculated as if the earnings cap did not apply, without compensation for any adverse personal taxation consequences which may arise.
All benefits earned during the year in respect of earnings above the cap will be provided by the company on an unfunded basis.
No compensation will be paid for the introduction of the new UK income tax regime from April 2006.
Executive directors will begin paying pension contributions on a phased basis with effect from April 2006.
The contributions will rise to 6% per annum over three years in three equal instalments.
Executive directors pension benefits Details of the accrued pension to which each director is entitled had they left service on 30 June 2005 and the transfer value of those accrued pensions are shown in the following table.
The accrued pensions shown represent the annual pension to which each executive director would be entitled at normal retirement age of 62.
The transfer value is broadly the cost to Diageo if it had to provide the equivalent pension benefit.
The transfer values shown in the following table have been calculated in accordance with the Guidance Note published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries GN11.

b The increases in the transfer values in the year were attributable to an additional years service approximately 30% of the increases and the salary increase in the year approximately 30% of the increases and the remainder is attributable to technical changes in the way in which the transfer values were calculated approximately 40% of the increases.
c The executive directors made no contributions in the year.
Share and other interests The beneficial interests of the directors in office at 30 June 2005 in the ordinary shares of the company are shown in the table below.
NC Rose and PS Walsh are among the potential beneficiaries of these trusts and are deemed to have an interest in all these shares and shares subject to call options.
b At 30 June 2004, WS Shanahan had an interest in 850 9.42% cumulative guaranteed preferred securities, series A issued by Grand Metropolitan Delaware, LP.
During the year these securities were redeemed at the option of the company.
Diageo Annual Report 2005 72 Directors remuneration report Performance graph The graph below shows the total shareholder return for Diageo and the FTSE 100 Index since 30 June 2000.
The FTSE 100 Index reflects the 100 largest UK quoted companies by market capitalisation and has been chosen because it is a widely recognised performance benchmark for large UK companies.
The graph shows that Diageo outperformed the FTSE 100 Index over this five year period.
