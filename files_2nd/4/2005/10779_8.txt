N Brown Group plc 25 Report and Accounts 2005 Remuneration report Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with The Directors Report Regulations 2002 the regulations.
This report also meets the relevant requirements of the listing rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the board have applied the principles of good governance relating to directors remuneration.
This report will be put to an advisory vote of the companys shareholders at the annual general meeting on 21 July 2005.
The auditors are required to report on the audited section of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the regulations.
The report is therefore divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information: Remuneration committee During the financial year, the remuneration committee of the board the committee comprised Ivan Fallon chairman, Lord Stone of Blackheath and John McGuire, all of whom are non executive and independent.
John McGuire was appointed to the committee on 23 March 2004.
The committee members have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The committee has formal written terms of reference which are available for shareholders to inspect at the registered office of the company.
The committee met three times during the year in question.
The committee was advised during the year by Deloitte & Touche LLP, the companys auditors, who have also provided audit, tax and due diligence services to the group, Addleshaw Goddard Solicitors who provided legal advice in relation to the share incentive arrangements and who have also provided general legal advice to the group and by Halliwell Consulting who provided advice in relation to the share incentive arrangements and the chief executives remuneration package.
Deloitte & Touche LLP and Addleshaw Goddard are general advisers to the company and were not specifically appointed by the committee.
Halliwell Consulting have not provided advice to the group on any other matter and were specifically appointed by the committee.
In determining executive directors remuneration for the year, the committee consulted Alan White, the chief executive.
No director played a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
The board have reviewed the groups compliance with the Combined Code 2003 the code on remuneration related matters.
It is the opinion of the board that the group complied with the remuneration related aspects of the code during the year, however, the following exception should be noted: the annual bonus plan provides for company expensed matching shares at the end of two years rather than three under the code and the provision of these matching shares is not subject to additional performance conditions see page 26.
Remuneration policy for executive directors and senior executives The committees policy is to set the main elements of the remuneration package to attract, motivate and retain executive directors and senior executives by offering them competitive remuneration packages, which are prudently designed and linked to individual and corporate performance.
The normal remuneration package for executive directors comprises basic salary, an annual performancerelated bonus including a deferred element with a matching share award, a long-term incentive programme, a pension and other benefits in kind including a company car allowance and medical insurance.
The remuneration committee regularly reviews the structure of the executive package, including the balance between fixed and variable pay to ensure that the remuneration remains competitive and challenging.
The policy will continue to apply for the current financial year.
For subsequent years, the committee will review the policy on an annual basis and recommend changes as and when appropriate.
A review of the bonus structure and the use of long-term share based incentives was undertaken in 2004.
The charts below demonstrate the balance between fixed and variable performance based pay for each executive director: Analysis of Performance vs Non Performance element of Remuneration Package Fixed Pay Variable Performance Related Pay 35% 35% 65% 65% Alan White Dean Moore N Brown Group plc 26 Report and Accounts 2005 Remuneration report Basic salary When determining the salary of the executive directors the committee has taken into consideration the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity, in particular those existing in the home shopping and retail market sectors: the performance of the individual executive director: the individual executive directors experience and responsibilities: and the pay and conditions throughout the group.
Salaries and conditions are reviewed on an annual basis.
Annual performance-related bonus Each executive director and senior executive participates in one of a number of annual performance-related bonus schemes.
Each scheme is designed to stretch the performance of the executive and is linked to the growth in annual profit and the achievement of other business targets.
These targets are reviewed and agreed by the committee at the beginning of each financial year to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and position of the company and that they continue to remain challenging.
Payments under the annual bonus schemes consist of an immediate cash element, a deferred element in shares net of tax and a 1:1 matching share element based on the pre-tax value of the bonus used to acquire the deferred shares.
Matching shares are released two years from their date of award provided the executive retains his deferred shares and remains in employment.
The levels of bonus earned for this year are set out in the following table: Name Alan White Dean Moore Maximum Bonus Potential Including Maximum Value of Deferred & Matching Shares %age Salary 110% 110% 2004 05 Bonus & Deferred Shares Paid 135,400 72,175 2004 05 Matching Share Award 41,824 21,493 Total 2004 05 Bonus & Matching Share Award as a %age of Salary 49% 45% The performance targets used for 2004 05 were based on a combination of profit and cost-savings initiatives.
The performance targets for 2005 06 have recently been reviewed and set by the committee and will be based on a combination of profit, cost-saving initiatives and the achievement of personal objectives.
The provision of the matching shares is not subject to the satisfaction of any additional performance requirements.
It is the opinion of the committee that the difficulty in satisfying the underlying performance requirements to earn the annual bonus is commensurate with the potential value of the maximum immediate and deferred bonus payable.
Bonus payments to directors are excluded from calculations of pensionable salary.
Share incentives It is the policy of the committee that executive directors and senior executives generally receive an annual award under either the longterm incentive plan or one of the companys executive share option schemes.
Before allowing any individual to participate in both the long-term incentive plan and one of the executive share option schemes, the committee will carefully assess the expected value of the combined total award, particularly if it exceeds the maximum value possible under either scheme individually.
In addition, it is the committees policy only to grant combined grants where there are some or all of the following circumstances: to minimise the P&L cost to the company and dilutive cost for shareholders for a given share commitment to an executive: where different performance conditions apply to awards and options: or on initial recruitment of a senior executive.
In respect of share awards but not share options the performance condition of earnings per share EPS growth for share awards was replaced in June 2004 with a performance condition based upon Total Shareholder Return TSR.
The decision to move to TSR was taken for the following reasons: market research provided by Halliwell Consulting, retained for the purpose, indicated that TSR is a more appropriate and common measure for long-term incentive arrangements within FTSE 250 companies, a TSR performance condition is more closely aligned with shareholder interests than EPS Growth, a TSR performance condition more closely evaluates company performance against a basket of comparator companies in the same sector, a TSR performance condition is more easily understood and measurable by eligible executives and is considered to be a suitably challenging measure in the current retail sector trading environment.
N Brown Group plc 27 Report and Accounts 2005 Remuneration report The committee determines whether the TSR performance conditions for share awards and options are satisfied using by ranking the company over a 3 year performance period against a matrix of comparator companies comprising Blacks Leisure, Brown & Jackson, Dixons Group, Findel, French Connection, GUS, Homestyle, JJB Sports, Kera Electrical, Laura Ashley, Matalan, Marks & Spencer, Merchant Retail, MFI Furniture Group, Moss Bros Group, Mothercare, Next, Peacocks and Woolworths.
For example, a ranking in the lower quartile will mean that no award will vest, a 10% to 50% award will vest in the third quartile depending on rank, a 60% to 95% award will vest in the second quartile depending on rank and a 100% award will vest in the upper quartile regardless of rank.
The measurement period is 3 years from date of grant.
The committee determines which companies are to be added or removed from the comparator group.
For 2005 06 awards the remuneration committee has determined that if TSR is below the median ranking company there will be no entitlement to any of the award.
For median performance the entitlement will be 50% of the maximum award.
For performance above the median the entitlement will rise with the maximum award being earned for performance which places the company in the upper quartile of the comparator group.
For option awards the performance requirements of growth in EPS remains see below.
Long-term incentive share plan Executive directors and certain senior executives are eligible to participate in the groups long-term incentive share plan.
The plan provides appropriate incentives to reward sustained success through the achievement of challenging business targets, thereby better aligning the interests of shareholders and executives.

Eligible employees, including executive directors and senior executives, may be granted options over the companys shares at a discount of up to 20% to the prevailing market price at the time of grant of the option, which subject to certain conditions can be exercised after either three or five years.
Approximately 30% of eligible group employees currently participate in the scheme.
An all-employee share ownership plan now known as a share incentive plan was established and approved by shareholders in July 2000.
No invitations or awards have yet been made under this plan.
Pension The group operates a number of pension schemes for the benefit of all eligible employees.
Alan White is a member of the N Brown Group Pension Fund the fund, which is an Inland Revenue approved defined benefit scheme.
Currently this scheme provides for him a normal retirement age of 60, a pension accrual rate based on 1 40th of pensionable salary to give a maximum pension of 2 3 pensionable salary at normal retirement date, including retained benefits and a lump sum death benefit of four times pensionable salary.
No part of a director's pensionable salary includes remuneration other than basic pay.
All members of the fund currently pay contributions at the rate of 6% of pensionable salary.
The members contribution is increasing to 7% from July 2005 and to 8% in July 2006.
The group bears the cost of providing the lump sum death benefit and the balance of contributions necessary to finance fund benefits.
The fund is now closed to new entrants.
Eligible employees who would otherwise have been entitled to join the fund are now able to join a new defined contribution pension scheme.

The company contributes 6% of Dean Moores annual salary into the defined contribution scheme.
Benefits in kind Executive directors receive the following additional benefits: a car and fuel allowance: and medical insurance.
Directors contracts It is the companys policy that executive directors should have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of 1 years notice.
The policy, on termination, is that the company does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations.
In addition, executive directors are expected to mitigate their loss or, within existing contractual constraints, accept phased payments.
In addition, the committee ensures that there are no unjustified payments for failure.
None of the executive directors contracts provides for liquidated damages.
There are no special provisions contained in any of the executive directors contracts that provide for longer periods of notice on a change of control of the company.
Further, there are no special provisions providing for additional compensation on an executive directors cessation of employment with the company.
