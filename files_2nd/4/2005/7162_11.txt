Hays plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 32 REMUNERATION REPORT This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and will be submitted to shareholders for their approval at the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held on 3 November 2005.
In preparing this report, the Board has followed the provisions of Schedule A to the July 2003 FRC Combined Code.
COMPOSITION AND TERMS OF REFERENCE OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The Board has delegated to the Remuneration Committee, under agreed terms of reference, responsibility for the remuneration policy and for determining specific packages for individual executive Directors including the Chairman.
The terms of reference for the Committee are available on the Companys website and from the Company Secretary at the Registered Office.
The Remuneration Committee was chaired by Mrs L M S Knox throughout the year.
All the members of the Remuneration Committee are independent non-executive Directors.
Mr B G Wallace was a committee member throughout the year and Mr C S Taylor served up until his retirement on 23 November 2004.
Messrs C W Eccleshare and P H Stoneham were appointed to the Committee on 24 November 2004.
The Committee receives assistance from the Chairman, Chief Executive and Company Secretary who attend meetings by invitation.
The Remuneration Committee has appointed Kepler Associates as independent remuneration advisers.
Kepler Associates advise the Committee on levels of Directors remuneration and the design of suitable incentive arrangements for both the executive Directors and the Groups senior management.
Kepler Associates do not provide other services to the Group.
REMUNERATION POLICY FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The Committee determines the remuneration policy for current and future years which is reviewed on an annual basis.
The remuneration policy is designed to attract, develop, retain and motivate the senior executives of the Group.
The Remuneration Committee has agreed that the remuneration strategy for the Company is to set base salaries at market median and to provide a normal annual bonus opportunity of up to 60% of base salary, based on performance against profit targets and individual measures.
Long term incentives comprise the Long Term Co-Investment Plan.
The existing share options and performance share schemes are now closed, and no further awards under the schemes will be made.
Approximately 50% of the fair value of total remuneration is performance-related based on current salaries and other emoluments, target annual bonuses and expected values for long term incentives.
The executive Directors packages consist of the following: Base salary Base salaries are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee taking into account the performance of the individual, changes in their responsibilities, information from independent remuneration consultants on levels of salary for similar jobs and the Groups performance against financial objectives.
Other benefits Other benefits provided for Directors are car benefit, medical expenses insurance and permanent health cover.
Annual bonus Annual bonus arrangements have been put in place for each executive Director based on profit targets and individual measures relevant to their responsibilities.
For 2004 05 the arrangements can result in normal bonus payments of up to 60% of base salary.
For 2005 06, the bonus opportunity has been increased to 80% of base salary, on terms that any amount of bonus exceeding 60% of base salary must be invested on an after-tax basis in shares which the Director will be required to commit under the Long Term Co-Investment plan.
Bonus payments are not pensionable.
At the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, further cash bonuses may be paid in exceptional circumstances.
The Remuneration Committee approved the payment to the Chairman of a one-off bonus for exceptional services during the 2004 05 financial year in connection with the successful demerger of DX Services, which was the concluding transaction in the restructuring of the Group.
Long Term Co-Investment Plan The Long Term Co-Investment Plan the Plan, approved at the Annual General Meeting in 2003, is the primary long term incentive arrangement for the Company.
Its principal objectives are to encourage executive Directors and key employees to make committed investments in the Companys shares and to reward superior performance with superior earnings potential.
The key features of the Plan are: Participants have an annual opportunity to commit shares in the Company Committed Shares to the scheme, and will become entitled to receive matching shares if the Company outperforms its peers.
The number of matching shares available will depend on the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR performance relative to a peer group of 14 recruitment companies based in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.
This performance measure has been selected because the Remuneration Committee considers that a direct TSR comparison against competitors is the most appropriate means of assessing performance and aligning participants interests with those of shareholders.
The maximum matching opportunity is five matching shares pre-tax for every Committed Share.
Matching at this level will only occur in the event of the Company ranking first in the peer group.
No matching shares will vest for sub-median performance.
Matching shares are forfeited if a participant resigns or withdraws their Committed Shares within three years of the start of the performance period.
Matching shares vest three years after participants have been invited to participate, subject to achievement of the performance measure, retention of the shares throughout the relevant period and the individual participants continued employment with the Group.
Hays plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 33 The Remuneration Committee proposes to make some amendments to the Plan for which shareholder approval will be sought at the Annual General Meeting.
These are described below and in the notes to the resolutions.
The amendments will be effective for invitations made for the 2005 06 financial year.
a To the extent that matching shares vest, participants will be entitled to receive an additional number of shares that represents the value of the dividends that would have been paid on those matching shares during the performance period.
The number of additional shares will be determined by reference to the share price on each relevant dividend payment date.
Participants will not be required to invest the dividends paid on their committed shares: b Currently executive Directors can invest as committed shares an amount up to 20% of annual remuneration.
In conjunction with the compulsory investment of executive Directors additional bonus as described above, shareholder approval is being sought to increase this limit to an amount equal to 30% of annual remuneration.
For Executive Committee members the current 20% limit will increase to 25% of annual remuneration: and c In order to encourage wider participation in the Plan amongst managers who are neither executive Directors nor Executive Committee members, such managers will be permitted to treat restricted shares as committed shares under the Plan.
Restricted shares, which involve a conditional award of free shares, are designed to encourage retention and have been introduced following a review of remuneration arrangements for managers below Executive Committee level.
They are satisfied by a transfer of existing shares from an employee trust.
Share options The Company continues to operate the Hays UK Sharesave Scheme which is open to all eligible staff in the United Kingdom and the Hays International Sharesave Scheme which is open to staff in certain other countries where the Group has operations.
Pensions Pension contributions are made into the Hays Pension Scheme, which is an approved defined benefit scheme providing benefits up to HM Revenues & Customs HMRC limits.
Only basic salary is pensionable.
For those Directors subject to the HMRC earnings cap on pensionable salary, top-up benefits are provided through either: The Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme, which is an unapproved, unfunded retirement benefit scheme: or The Hays Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme, and or salary supplements.
The Hays Pension Scheme also permits the provision of additional benefits including money purchase pension benefits.
In appropriate circumstances, the Remuneration Committee may approve contributions to the scheme to fund such benefits.
For 2004 05, such a contribution was approved in respect of Mr D R Waxman, as described below.
SERVICE CONTRACTS The Companys policy on service contracts is that Directors contracts should be terminable on not more than one years notice.
In the event of early termination of a Directors service contract, the Company would be required to pay compensation reflecting the salary and benefits to which the Director would have become entitled under the contract during the notice period.
Alternatively, the Company may, at its discretion, pay a predetermined termination sum in lieu of notice.
In the event of early termination, the Remuneration Committee will give careful consideration to what compensation should be paid taking into account the circumstances and the responsibility of the individual to mitigate.
The contract details of currently serving Directors are: Current contract start date Unexpired term Notice period R A Lawson 1 July 2001 Indefinite One year D R Waxman 3 March 1998 Indefinite One year J W Martin 4 March 2003 Indefinite One year NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The payment policy for non-executive Directors is to pay the market rate to secure persons of a suitable calibre for a Group of this size.
The remuneration of the non-executive Directors is determined by the Board.
The responsibility of the role and international nature of the Group is fully considered when setting the fee level.
An additional fee is paid to non-executive Directors who chair Board Committees.
The non-executive Directors fees are non-pensionable.
The non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any incentive plan.
The non-executive Directors do not have service contracts with the Company, however, they have letters of appointment which appoint them to the Board for an initial three year period.
They are subject to retirement and re-appointment by shareholders after that initial period and appointments can be terminated immediately by the Company.
These are available from the Company for review.
The Company permits its executive Directors to hold one non-executive directorship.
Fees paid for these appointments are retained by the Company.
At present no executive Directors hold any external directorships.

The graph shows the Total Shareholder Return generated by both the movement in share value and the reinvestment over the same period of dividend income.
The Remuneration Committee considers that the FTSE 350 is the appropriate index because the company has been a member of this index throughout the period.
In March 2003, the Company announced its plans to transform Hays plc into a Specialist Recruitment business.

The Remuneration Committee would otherwise have been minded to pay him a discretionary bonus of 288,000 for the year, and paid an equivalent amount as a money purchase pension contribution in respect of him see below.
These payments include cash allowances for pension top-up benefit paid directly to the Director.
The remuneration of the highest paid Director, Mr J W Martin, was 679,000.
The highest paid Director in the previous year was Mr C S Matthews, who received 1,025,000.
Mr G J Williams, who retired as a Director on 30 April 2003, received emoluments of 19,000 from his work as trustee of the Hays Pension Scheme.
Mr N A McLachlan, who resigned as a Director due to ill health on 8 September 2003, continues to be paid in line with the sickness provision contained in his contract.
His total emoluments for the period to 30 June 2005 were 318,000.
The non-cash element of the emoluments are disclosed as benefits in kind in the table and comprise car benefits and health insurance.
Hays plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 35 Directors pension entitlement The following Directors were members of defined benefit schemes provided by the Company during the year.
Pension entitlements and corresponding transfer values changed during the year as follows: Annual Annual Value of Value of pension Gross pension Increase Value of net accrued accrued entitlement increase entitlement in accrued increase pension at Total change in pension at at 30 June in accrued at 30 June pension net in accrual 30 June transfer value 30 June 2004 pension 2005 of inflation over period 2004 during period 2005 In 1 2 3 4 D R Waxman 73,889 43,444 117,333 41,153 714,232 1,123,257 913,371 2,036,628 J W Martin 15,948 4,569 20,517 4,075 30,240 94,990 57,265 152,255 Notes: 1 Pension accruals shown are the amounts which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year.
2 The value of net increase represents the incremental value to the Director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption that service terminated at the year end.
It is based on the accrued pension increase after deducting any contribution made by the Director.
3 The change in the transfer value includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and Directors, such as stock market movements.
It is calculated after deducting Directors contributions.
Voluntary contributions paid by Directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
4 Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with version 9.1 of guidance note GN11 issued by the actuarial profession.
Following Mr D R Waxmans waiver of any entitlement to a discretionary bonus for the year ended 30 June 2005, the Remuneration Committee approved the payment of 288,000 to the Hays Pension Scheme to provide money purchase pension benefits in respect of him.
Demerger of DX Services As described in the Companys circular to shareholders dated 27 September 2004, the Remuneration Committee implemented compensatory arrangements for participants in the Companys share plans to take account of the depreciatory effect of the demerger on their rights.
Based on the approach described in the circular, the compensation arrangements were implemented by reference to a 12.48% reduction in value of the Companys shares corresponding to the value of DX Services shares received by shareholders.
Under these arrangements, which applied to participants in each plan as at the date of the demerger, directors were treated in the same manner as other participants.
Each arrangement has broadly the same economic effect, and is summarised below: a.
Long Term Co-Investment Plan participants holding 2003 awards were offered the opportunity to increase the number of their committed shares by 12.48%, thereby increasing their potential entitlement to matching shares by the same percentage: b. Hays plc1989 Executive Share Option Scheme 1989 ESOS, Hays UK Sharesave and Hays plc 1996 Company Share Option Plan 1996 CSOP HMRC approved plans participants will generally become entitled to free shares equal in number to up to 12.48% of the shares under a participants option, when the underlying option is exercised: c. Hays plc 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 ESOS and Hays International Sharesave unapproved plans participants generally had the number of shares under option increased by 12.48% and the exercise price reduced by 11.1%.
The sum that is payable on exercise remains constant: and d. Performance Share Scheme participants will be entitled to receive additional shares equal to 12.48% of the number that vests if and when the award becomes exercisable.
Long Term Co-Investment Plan In December 2003 the first invitation to participate in the plan was issued to 180 employees who committed a total of 1,801,716 shares.
A subsequent invitation was issued to 261 participants in December 2004, who as at 21 June 2005 had committed 1,036,312 shares to the plan.
The commitment period remains open until 30 September 2005.
The mid-market price on 21 June 2005 the grant date for the 2004 invitation was 125.75p.
The maximum matching permitted under the plan rules is five matching shares pre-tax for every committed share.
Maximum matching will only arise should the Companys TSR exceed that of all of the peer group of 14 recruitment businesses based in the United Kingdom and overseas over the measurement period.
The executive Directors have committed the following numbers of shares to the plan representing, in each case, the maximum that they were invited to commit and as a consequence they could become entitled to the maximum number of matching shares shown below without payment and prior to income tax on those shares : 2004 Invitation 2004 Invitation 2003 Invitation 2003 Invitation Commitment Matching award Commitment Matching award D R Waxman 118,000 590,000 87,836 439,180 J R Martin 100,000 500,000 75,441 377,205 This figure includes additional shares committed under the arrangements implemented following the demerger of DX Services.
Hays plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 36 REMUNERATION REPORT continued Options The Company operates three executive share option plans, although grants have ceased to be made under all of these plans: the Hays plc 1989 Executive Share Option Scheme which is an HMRC approved scheme, the Hays plc 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme which is unapproved for HMRC purposes and the Hays plc 1996 Company Share Option Plan which is an HMRC approved scheme.
Options cannot be exercised under the 1995 ESOS and 1996 CSOP unless performance criteria are met.
The performance criteria require growth in Earnings Per Share EPS to have exceeded the growth rate in the Retail Price Index by 2% per annum in a three year period prior to exercise.
The performance measures were selected so as to align participants and shareholders interests.
The EPS criteria were selected as EPS is a widely recognised, transparent measure of underlying performance.
There were no performance criteria linked to the 1989 Executive Share Option Scheme, as it was not market practice for such schemes to impose performance criteria at the time the grants were made.
Aggregate emoluments disclosed above do not include any amounts for the value of options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company granted to or held by the Director.
During the year the shares traded in the range 116p to 141p.
The number of options has been adjusted under the arrangements implemented following the demerger of DX Services described on page 35.
Upon exercise, participants will be entitled to free shares equal to 12.48% of the stated number of shares under option under the arrangements implemented following the demerger of DX Services.
Mr D R Waxman exercised 16,840 options under the 1989 ESOS on 4 October 2004 at a market price of 122.23p and 9,802 options on 5 January at a market price of 122.5p.
Hays plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 37 Performance Share Scheme The Company operates a Performance Share Scheme which was available to certain Directors, and a limited number of senior executives, who did not hold shares at the time of the management buy-out in 1987 or at the time of the Companys flotation in 1989.
The key attributes of the scheme are that participants have to make a significant financial investment at the outset and that in normal circumstances participants can only realise any gain after five years.
The last awards made under this scheme were in 2000.
The maximum number of shares receivable by executive Directors at 30 June 2005 or at date of resignation under the Performance Share Scheme is as follows: Date of Number of Advance Period of Director grant shares payment by director exercise D R Waxman 27 September 2000 86,791 27,250 2005-2010 Under the terms of the Performance Share Scheme the number of shares receivable by executive Directors is dependent upon the total increase in earnings per share over the five year period following the payment made by the participant.
As such it is not possible to determine the interests of individual Directors prior to the completion of the Scheme.
However, in light of the Companys financial performance in recent years and the reduced level of stock markets generally, it may be considered that the proportion of the shares that will become exercisable is not significant in the context of the Directors overall remuneration package.
On 21 April 2002, Mr D R Waxman became entitled to 223,718 shares arising from a grant made on 21 April 1997.
This grant remains exercisable until 21 April 2007.
The number of options has been adjusted under the arrangements implemented following the demerger of DX Services.
No awards were made during the year and no awards were exercised by Directors.
