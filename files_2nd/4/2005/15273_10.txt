Directors Remuneration Report The following report complies with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and satisfies the requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and the Combined Code on Corporate Governance which was published in July 2003 by the Financial Reporting Council.
Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee comprises Mr P S Wood Chairman, Mr P J Welch and Mr C J Williams, who served on the Committee throughout 2005 apart from Mr Williams who was appointed to the Committee on 13 December 2005.
Mr G Montezemolo served on the Committee until his retirement from the Board on 26 May 2005.
Mr R H Hunting served on the Committee from 6 September to 13 December 2005.
The Committee is responsible for determining the companys policy on executive remuneration and the specific remuneration for each of the executive directors and the Chairman including pension rights.
The Committee is also responsible for reviewing the remuneration of senior executives throughout the group.
The Committee was assisted in its deliberations on executive directors remuneration by Monks Partnership Monks and the Chief Executive.
With the approval of the Remuneration Committee, Monks was retained by the company and during the year provided general executive remuneration advice for salary review purposes and specific remuneration advice in connection with the recruitment of senior executives.
The Board as a whole determines the remuneration of the non-executive directors, including members of the Remuneration Committee, but the non-executive directors do not participate in the decision on their own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee met three times during 2005 and each meeting was fully attended by the Committees members.
Remuneration Policy Non-executive directors remuneration It is the Boards policy to review fees paid to non-executive directors on a regular basis.
The last review of non-executive director remuneration was carried out in 2003.
Each non-executive director other than the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman receives a fee of 26,000 per annum.
Fees of 100,000 per annum and 33,000 per annum are paid to the Chairman and Deputy Chairman respectively.
Non-executive directors are not eligible to receive awards under any of the companys share schemes or other employee benefit schemes nor does the company make any contribution to their pension arrangements.
Dr M J Peagram held share options relating to his service with Holliday Chemical Holdings PLC which he exercised during the course of 2005.
No options have been granted to non-executive directors in their capacity as non-executive directors of the company.
Executive directors remuneration The companys policy for 2005 was and continues to be for 2006 and subsequent years to structure executive pay in such a way that key executives may be recruited, motivated and retained through being offered remuneration packages that are competitive.
For that purpose, the Committee uses data provided by external independent surveys relevant to the industry or sector in which each Yule Catto subsidiary operates.
Whilst not adopting set formulae the Committee is also sensitive to the pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the group when considering annual salary increases and total remuneration.
The major element of the remuneration package of senior executives is a competitive basic salary which is reviewed with effect from 1 January each year.
For executive directors this review is conducted with the assistance of an annual independent survey of salaries at UK industrial and service companies with a similar profile to the company in terms of overseas operations, turnover and market capitalisation.
The survey presents market guidelines for basic pay and increases in basic salaries for executive directors in the UK during the previous twelve months.
The Committee then uses this information to recommend basic salaries for the executive directors in line with the Boards policy of awarding for good performance a basic salary of approximately the market median for companies of a similar size and complexity.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee has overseen the introduction of incentives, which are designed to reward the achievement of predetermined targets by the individuals concerned.
These incentives, which were designed in accordance with the provisions of Schedule A to the Code, currently comprise annual cash bonuses and membership of one of two shareholder approved longer term incentive plans the Share Plans.
Yule Catto & Co plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Directors Remuneration Report 25 Directors Remuneration Report continued Annual cash bonuses The annual cash bonus payment for the executive directors is an amount equal to the percentage of basic pay calculated by reference to the annual growth in the companys basic earnings per share for underlying performance after deducting the annual rise in the rate of headline inflation RPI multiplied by a factor of 2.5 subject to a limit of 50% of basic pay.
For divisional chief executives, managing directors of subsidiary companies and senior head office employees the annual cash bonus payments are based on appropriate combinations of profit, cash flow and safety and environmental targets and personal business objectives.
In 2005 the bonuses were subject to limits of 40%, 35% and 30% of basic pay respectively.
The structures of the bonuses and awards under it are reviewed periodically and are determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Share plans The Share Plans comprise the Performance Share Plan the Performance Plan and the Longer Term Deferred Bonus Plan the Deferred Plan.
The Performance Plan was introduced in 2002 following shareholder approval at that years Annual General Meeting and covers the executive directors, divisional chief executives and senior head office employees.
An award consists of a right to acquire shares which can be exercised for a nominal price, subject to the company satisfying performance conditions.
The value of shares awarded under the Performance Plan in any financial year to any individual currently may not exceed 100 per cent of their annual basic salary.
For awards made from 2002 to 2005 performance conditions related to growth in earnings per share over a three year period.
Following review by the Remuneration Committee it is proposed that, subject to shareholder approval, the existing earnings per share based performance conditions are replaced by performance conditions related to growth in total shareholder return.
Accordingly the notice for the 2006 Annual General Meeting contains a resolution seeking shareholder approval for the introduction of the new performance conditions.
The terms of the new conditions and the reason for their introduction will be set out in the circular to be dated 19 April 2006 to be issued by the company to shareholders.
An award which vests in accordance with the current and proposed performance conditions will only be exercisable and allocated shares may only be transferred as to one half after the third anniversary of the date the award is made and as the remaining half after the fourth anniversary of the date the award is made.
The Deferred Plan covers managing directors of subsidiary companies and an award takes the form of a right to acquire shares in the company which can be exercised for a nominal price after three years.
The value of shares subject to an award is determined by reference to sustained growth in the profit before tax set at a minimum of 5% per annum of the company or subsidiary for which the participant works by reference to a base year determined at the date of grant.
The value of shares subject to an award may not exceed 20% of any participants basic salary in any year.
No further awards can be made under this plan after 2006 and following review by the Remuneration Committee it is proposed that, subject to shareholder approval, a replacement plan be introduced this year.
Accordingly the notice for the 2006 Annual General Meeting also seeks shareholder approval for such a new plan, a summary of the principal terms of which will be set out in the circular referred to above.
During 2005 386,747 shares and 10,558 shares were awarded under the Performance Plan and the Deferred Plan respectively.
As a result of the obligation on the company to prepare its consolidated accounts in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS from 1 January 2005 adjusted earnings per share figures for 2005 and 2006 cannot be produced on a consistent basis for the purposes of comparison with adjusted earnings per share figures for 2002 and 2003 as required under the terms of awards made under the Performance Share Plan in 2003 and 2004 respectively.
The Remuneration Committee has concluded that the companys financial performance in 2005 compared with that for 2002 was such that it did not give rise to any possibility that the awards made in 2003 would have vested if consistent earnings per share information for 2005 had been available.
The Remuneration Committee will review likely financial performance in 2006 towards the end of that year and decide then how to address the unavailability of a consistent adjusted earnings per share figure to compare with that for 2003 for the purposes of the awards made in 2004.
For the awards made under the Performance Share Plan in 2005 the Remuneration Committee decided that as the results of the group for the year ended 31 December 2004 have been converted onto an audited IFRS basis that basic earnings per share for underlying performance should replace adjusted earnings per share for the purposes of comparing performance in 2004 with that for 2007.
Executive directors are entitled to participate in grants of options made under the companys Savings-Related Share Option Scheme as and when these are made.
