Remuneration policy for executive Directors The Annual Incentive has a Threshold level of performance The Committee has established employment and remuneration below which no award is paid, a Target level at which executive practices for the Companys executive Directors aimed at fostering Directors are entitled to a payment equal to 50% of their base sound ethical behaviour within a culture focused upon high salary and a Maximum performance level at which a maximum performance.

Overall, the objective of the against this criterion, with Mr Millards award pro-rated for the policy is to align Directors interests with those of shareholders period up to his ceasing to be a Director and Mr Butterworths progenerally in maximising shareholder value.
In accordance with this rated from his date of joining.

The Committee takes into consideration guidelines issued by and the remainder based upon the performance of the Ceramics its leading shareholders and bodies such as the Institutional division.
This latter divisional element was based on divisional Shareholders Committee, the Association of British Insurers and operating profit adjusted for performance against key operating the National Association of Pension Funds.
During the course of the cash flow targets.
For 2005, the Group as a whole and the year the Committee monitored and discussed the operation of the Ceramics division exceeded the Target level of performance and current share incentive schemes and whether these remained this level of achievement of Annual Incentive targets is reflected in appropriate to the Companys current circumstances.

new group includes companies more closely aligned to Cooksons Cookson Group plc { 37 } Annual Report 2005 Directors Remuneration Report continued Long-term incentive continued The LTIP has two elements.
Firstly, executive Directors are eligible to receive a conditional annual award of shares worth up to 100% of base salary Performance Shares.
Secondly, executive Directors can elect to invest all or part of their Annual Incentive in ordinary shares of the Company Bonus Investment Shares in return for which they receive a conditional award of ordinary shares worth up to 2.25 times the pre-tax equivalent of the Annual Incentive so invested Matching Shares.
Performance Shares and Matching Shares vest after three years, with the proportion of shares vesting being based on the Companys TSR performance over that three-year period relative to that of the constituent companies of its comparator group.
For awards made during the year, the comparator group used for the Company was the FTSE 250 excluding Investment Trusts.
This performance measure was chosen to enhance the link between the interests of Directors and shareholders.
The same comparator group will be used for awards made in 2006.
Vesting of the Performance Shares and Matching Shares will be as follows: TSR ranking relative to FTSE 250 Matching Shares Vesting Ratio excluding Investment Trusts Performance Shares Vesting Percentage Matching Shares: Bonus Investment Shares Below Median 0% 0 Median 25% 0.5:1 Upper Quintile top 20% 100% 2.25:1 Between Median and Upper Quintile Pro rata between 25% and 100% Pro rata between 0.5:1 and 2.25:1 Matching Share awards will only vest if the Bonus Investment Shares originally purchased have been retained.
No Performance Shares or Matching Shares will vest for below median performance.
To determine whether the performance conditions have been met, the TSR of each of the comparator companies will be measured.
Measurement will take place over a performance period commencing on the first day of Cooksons financial year in which the award is granted.
Thus, for grants made in 2005, the performance period commenced on 1 January 2005 and will end three years later, i. e. 31 December 2007.
TSR will be measured as the percentage increase in a return index net of tax between the beginning and end of the performance period.
The return index at the beginning of the performance period is the average return index on each weekday in the three-month period prior to the start of the performance period, and the same three-month averaging method will be used to ascertain the return index at the end of the performance period.
The companies will then be ranked, in descending order, according to their TSR.
If Cookson is ranked at or above median against the comparator group then some proportion of the awards will be eligible to vest.
The Committee will obtain independent external advice to assess whether the Company has met the performance conditions at the end of the performance period.
This consultant will be asked to confirm that the companies which make up the index and the measurement of the Companys performance are both in accordance with the rules of the LTIP.
Prior to the vesting of any award, the Committee has also stipulated that, as an additional hurdle, it will need to be satisfied that vesting has been justified by the underlying financial performance of the Company over the performance period.
Allocations were made under the LTIP to the executive Directors in April 2005, with the exception of Mr Butterworth who received an award based on his pro-rated 2005 salary upon joining the Company.
Mr Salmon purchased Bonus Investment Shares under the Matching Share element of the LTIP in 2005.
In addition to the Board, senior Divisional and Corporate executives are also awarded Performance Shares under the LTIP and the more senior of them are given the opportunity to participate in the Matching Shares element.
Performance graph The graph below compares Cooksons Total Shareholder Return over the last five years with the return on the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding Investment Trusts.
This index has been chosen as the comparator index to reflect the size, international scope and diversity of the Groups businesses and is the comparator group against which Cooksons performance is measured for the LTIP.

Shareholding guidelines The Remuneration Committee encourages executive Directors to build and hold a shareholding in the Company equivalent in value to at least one times salary.
To this end, executive Directors will normally only be able to sell a maximum of up to 50% measured as the value after tax of any Performance Shares or Matching Shares vesting under the LTIP, until this criterion has been met.
International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS Whilst the majority of the performance measures attached to the outstanding awards under Cooksons incentive schemes were not affected by the move to IFRS, the earnings per share EPS performance conditions applicable to the Companys executive share option schemes were affected.
These conditions have continued to be calculated in accordance with UK GAAP.
Directors service contracts It has been the Companys general practice for many years to employ executive Directors on local terms while giving due consideration to global market practices.
The Board has determined that any new executive Director would be appointed with a notice period not exceeding one year, although in certain circumstances the Board would consider a longer initial term.
Both of the current executive Directors have contractual notice periods from the Company of 12 months.
Neither of the executive Directors contracts contains any change of control provisions, and they both contain a duty to mitigate should the Director find an alternative paid occupation in any period during which the Company must otherwise pay compensation on early termination.
A summary of the main conditions of the contracts of the current executive Directors is as follows: Executive Directors Date and jurisdiction Unexpired Notice period Basis of compensation on of contract term for employer early termination by the Company M G Butterworth 25 05 05 UK 12 months 12 months One times salary, pension allowance and benefits payable half in a lump sum and the balance in six separate monthly instalments commencing six months after leaving, mitigated by any salary earned from new paid occupation.
N R Salmon 14 06 04 UK 12 months 12 months One times salary, pension allowance and benefits payable half in a lump sum and the balance in six separate monthly instalments commencing six months after leaving, mitigated by any salary earned from new paid occupation.
Former executive Directors Messrs Millard and Cozzani served as Directors during the year ended 31 December 2005.
On 15 March 2005, the Company announced that Mr Millard had informed the Board of his intention to step down from the Board and leave the Company during the course of 2005.
He left the Board and the Company on 31 July 2005.
Mr Millard had a UK contract dated 19 February 2004.
It could be terminated by the Company giving 12 months notice.
No compensation for loss of office was paid to or is receivable by Mr Millard and his entitlements under the MTIP, LTIP and executive share option schemes all lapsed when he left the Company.
On 26 July 2005, the Company announced that Mr Cozzani, executive Director and Chief Executive of the Ceramics Division, would step down from the Board upon reaching retirement age, on his 65th birthday.
Mr Cozzani therefore retired from the Board on 6 October 2005.
He had two employment contracts one Illinois, USA and one Belgian, dated 23 February 2004 and 5 May 1997 respectively, both of which terminated on 31 December 2005.
The Illinois contract contained no notice provision after 6 October 2005 and the Belgian contract was terminated by due process under Belgian law to terminate it in the year of his 65th birthday.
No compensation for loss of office was paid to or is receivable by Mr Cozzani.
As a retiree Mr Cozzani was classed as a good leaver under the Companys executive incentive arrangements.
Further details of Mr Cozzanis MTIP, LTIP and executive share option entitlements can be found in the MTIP allocations, LTIP allocations and Share options tables on pages 42 to 44.

All Directors are subject to retirement, and election or re-election, in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association.
The Board sets the remuneration of the non-executive Directors after considering the role and responsibilities of each Director and the practice of other companies.
The non-executive Directors do not participate in these Board discussions on their own remuneration.
The Group Chairmans remuneration is set by the Remuneration Committee.
External appointments Executive Directors are permitted to hold positions as non-executive directors of other companies provided that these do not lead to conflicts of interest.
The Board sanctions each such request on a case by case basis.
Fees received are retained by the executive Director concerned.
Mr Salmon was appointed a non-executive director of United Utilities plc in April 2005.
In 2005, he received fees for the role of 34,500.
In 2005, Mr Millard served as a non-executive director and chairman of the Audit Committee on the Board of Exel plc for which he was entitled to receive fees of 50,000 p. a.
No Directors have any material interest in a contract of significance other than service agreements with the Company or any subsidiary company during the year.
Pension arrangements The pension arrangements for the executive Directors are as follows: Current Directors Messrs Butterworth and Salmon are not entitled to participate in any of the Groups pension arrangements.
In accordance with their contracts they receive pension allowances of 25% of their respective base salaries to enable them to make their own pension provision.
An amount up to the Inland Revenue limit for contributions is paid into an Inland Revenue approved pension plan nominated by the Director, with the excess currently being paid as a salary supplement.
Mr Butterworths pro-rated salary supplement in 2005 amounted to 33,854, whilst Mr Salmons salary supplement in 2005 amounted to 115,875.
Former Directors Mr Cozzanis pension was provided for through defined contribution arrangements with external providers.
On retirement, he became entitled to the accumulated value of his defined contribution fund.
The Companys contributions in 2005 were 208,363.
Mr Millards defined benefit pension was built up through a combination of the Companys UK tax-approved pension plan and an unfunded unapproved pension plan agreed in 1996 when he joined the Company.
Between 1 January and 31 July 2005 the date he left service, his total accrued contractual pensions entitlement under both these plans increased by 40,564 p. a. net of inflation.
This increase would have had a transfer value of 593,155 net of member contributions measured as at 31 December 2005 had Mr Millard elected to defer all his accrued benefits.
Following his retirement as a Director of Cookson on 31 July 2005, however, Mr Millard exercised his contractual right to take a transfer value in respect of his unapproved pension entitlement of 139,459 p. a. from normal retirement age of 62, retaining only his deferred pension entitlement in the Companys tax-approved pension plan.
The transfer value was 1,999,400 before tax 1,199,640 after tax.
Mr Millards deferred entitlement in the tax-approved pension plan, payable from normal retirement age of 62, amounted to 33,147 p. a. as at 31 December 2005.
The transfer value of this remaining accrued benefit as at 31 December 2005 was 511,362.
The transfer value as at 31 December 2004 of his accrued entitlement at that date was 1,800,193.
The reduction in his transfer value over 2005, allowing for member contributions paid during 2005, was 1,312,135.
The majority of the reduction in transfer value was attributable to the transfer of Mr Millards unapproved pension benefits during 2005.
The above information is audited by the Companys Auditor.
Cookson Group plc { 40 } Annual Report 2005 Directors remuneration The following table details the remuneration payable to each Director in respect of the year ended 31 December 2005, together with comparative totals in respect of the year ended 31 December 2004.

The 2004 market prices shown for shares on the date before the awards have been multiplied by 10 to reflect the impact of the share consolidation on the Companys share price.
The allocations were calculated based upon the closing mid-market price of Cookson shares on the day before the awards were made.
2005 allocations were made to Messrs Cozzani, Millard and Salmon on 4 April 2005 and to Mr Butterworth on 2 August 2005.
Cooksons mid-market closing price on these dates was 392.5p as adjusted for the share consolidation and 341.75p respectively.
The performance criteria which apply to the vesting of these share allocations are summarised on page 38.
Following his retirement, Mr Cozzani retains the allocations of Performance Shares made to him in 2004 and 2005 under the LTIP.
The allocations held by Mr Millard lapsed on the date he left the Company, 31 July 2005.
Cookson Group plc { 42 } Annual Report 2005 MTIP allocations Under the MTIP, executives were eligible to receive a bonus paid partly in cash and partly in ordinary shares the beneficial receipt of which is deferred for two years from the date of the award restricted shares based upon the achievement of target financial performance, measured over a three-year period.
The MTIP operated on a rolling three-year basis and the final remaining cycle culminated on 31 December 2005.

No bonus entitlement arose relating to Group profit targets.
Payment was made one-third in cash and two-thirds in restricted shares.
Mr Millards restricted share allocation lapsed following his departure from the Company on 31 July 2005.
The restricted shares allocated to Mr Cozzani were released to him at the end of the restricted period on 31 December 2005.
The closing mid-market price of Cooksons shares was 425p on this date: the value of shares transferred to Mr Cozzani was therefore 64,315.
The MTIP award for 2003-2005 was based on the achievement of Group profit targets.
The Group exceeded its target level of profit, so payments were made accordingly.
Under the rules of the Plan, as Mr Cozzani has retired from the Company, the payment will be made to him wholly in cash rather than one-third in cash and two-thirds in restricted shares, inclusive of the vacation pay required to be paid on such remuneration under Belgian law.
All the interests shown in the above table and detailed in these notes have been adjusted for the consolidation of the Companys ordinary shares which took effect from the close of business on 26 May 2005, when every 10 ordinary 1p shares held by shareholders were exchanged for 1 new 10p ordinary share.
Messrs Butterworth and Salmon have no entitlement to any awards under the MTIP as they joined the Company following the discontinuance of any new MTIP cycles.
Share options Share options in respect of the ordinary shares of the Company remain outstanding under the Companys executive share option schemes.
The last executive share option grant was made in 2003.
Under these schemes, share options were granted at the market price prevailing at the time of grant.
Options normally only become exercisable if the growth in Headline earnings per share has been at least equal to the increase in the UK Retail Price Index plus 3% per annum 2% per annum for options granted in 1995 and 1996 for a consecutive three year period.
When options were granted in November 2002 and September 2003 the performance criteria were made more demanding for executive Directors and, in order for options to vest, two additional criteria were added.
These were subsequently adjusted for the share consolidation which took place on 26 May 2005.
The amended criteria were as follows: i the average mid-market closing price for a period of 30 consecutive dealing days effectively six weeks must exceed 500p during the three-year period commencing from the date of the grant: and ii for the 2002 grant, the Groups cumulative earnings per share before amortisation of intangibles and exceptional items for the financial years 2003-2005 must exceed 96p: or for the 2003 grant, the Groups cumulative earnings per share before amortisation of intangibles and exceptional items for the financial years 2004-2006 must exceed 100p.
