A participant who is granted a deferred share award under APRA must normally continue to remain an employee of the Group for two years from the date of the award in order to retain the full number of shares, although shares will be released early in certain circumstances including retirement or redundancy.
The value of any deferred share awards is derived from the annual bonus criteria and is therefore dependent on personal and business financial performance: the release of deferred share awards is not dependent on the achievement of any further performance conditions.
The deferred share element operated for 2005 will result in share awards as described on page 43.
The committee intends to maintain the deferred share element in respect of 2006.
This arrangement provides a strong link between performance and remuneration, promotes a culture of share ownership amongst the Groups senior management and encourages decisions in the long-term interest of shareholders.

Non-executive directors The Chairman and the non-executive directors have letters of appointment rather than service contracts.
No compensation is payable to the Chairman or to any non-executive director if the appointment is terminated early.
Non-executive directorsfees The Board takes account of independent market surveys in determining the fees payable to the Chairman and the non-executive directors.
The committee makes recommendations to the Board on the remuneration of the Chairman.
The fees paid to the Chairman and non-executive directors are shown in the emoluments table on page 43.
Up to April 2005, each non-executive director received an annual fee of 30,000.
In addition, fees of 6,000 per annum were paid to members of the audit, remuneration and nominations committees, with the chairmen of the audit and remuneration committees receiving a further 6,000 per annum.
In February 2005 the Board reviewed the fees payable to non-executive directors as reported in the 2004 Annual report.
It concluded that there was a strong case for increasing the non-executive directorsfees to more competitive levels in order to reect the increased responsibilities and time commitments which changes in corporate governance were imposing on all non-executive directors.
The Board therefore agreed that with effect from May 2005 a non-executive director would receive an annual fee of 50,000 covering his or her membership of the Board and of Board committees.
The audit committee chairman and the remuneration committee chairman would receive additional fees of 15,000 and 12,000 per annum respectively.
The senior independent director would receive an additional fee of 5,000 per annum for carrying out this role.
The Chairman and the non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Groups share schemes, incentive arrangements or pension schemes.
A facility is in place which enables non-executive directors to use some or all of their fees, after the appropriate statutory deductions, to make market purchases of shares in the Company on a monthly basis.

Pensions James Guyette participates in pension plans sponsored by Rolls-Royce North America Inc. All other executive directors who are under their normal retirement ages are members of the Groups UK pension schemes.
These schemes are funded and approved dened benefit pension schemes providing, at retirement, a pension of up to two thirds of final remuneration.
New HM Revenue and Customs HMRC pensions regulations are effective from April 2006.
There is no intention to compensate directors or other senior executives for any additional tax they may be required to pay as a result of these regulations.
The committee has determined that where further pension accrual would exceed the new HMRC annual and or lifetime allowances applicable from April 6, 2006, executives may choose to opt out of pension accrual and receive a cash allowance in lieu of pension provision.
Alternatively, as permitted under the new pension regime, the committee will have the discretion to enable the drawing of pension benets to commence while the executive is still in employment with the Group.
In such circumstances the pension schemes provide for appropriate early retirement factors to reduce the pension payable.
qxd 15 3 06 07:58 Page 49 49 Information subject to audit Pensions continued 8 Details of the pension benets, which accrued over the year in the Groups approved UK dened benefit pension schemes, are given below.
The pension position of Dr Mike Howse, who passed his normal retirement age in 2004 and who is excluded from the table below, is described in note 5 below.

2 The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement, based on service to the end of the year.
3 The transfer values stated represent liabilities of the Rolls-Royce sponsored pension schemes and not sums paid to the individuals.
The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11 GN11.
GN11 covers individual transfer calculations and the above gures have been calculated using assumptions certied by the Actuaries as being consistent with GN11.
Transfer values calculated on this basis will vary up or down from one year to the next due to changes in financial conditions, principally long-term interest rates from which the Actuary derives the assumptions used to place a capital value on the pension entitlement.
Whilst uctuating up or down in individual years, transfer values generally trend upwards over time as individuals complete more service and become older.
A large part of the increase in transfer values over 2005 is attributable to falls in the market interest rates on which the transfer value calculations are based.
4 The gure in brackets is the transfer value of the increase in pension retirement lump sum during the year ended December 31, 2005 excluding the effect of ination, and net of the members own contributions.
5 Dr Mike Howse ceased to accrue pension benets after reaching his normal retirement age on July 1, 2004.
He began receiving his pension benets from this date, although he remained an executive director until he retired from the Board on June 30, 2005.
No pension benets were therefore earned by Dr Mike Howse over the six month period in 2005 while he remained a director.
6 The Group operates the Rolls-Royce Supplementary Retirement Scheme SRS.
The purpose of the SRS is to fund pension provision above the pensionable earnings cap which was imposed on approved pension schemes under the 1989 Finance Act.
Membership of the SRS is restricted to executive directors and to a limited number of senior executives.
The members of the SRS include Andrew Shilston.
He joined the Group after the introduction of the earnings cap and his terms and conditions on joining the Group included a commitment to provide pension and life cover based on total salary, in line with other directors and senior executives.
Employer contributions to the SRS during 2005 have been added to the increase in transfer value over 2005 for the approved dened benefit plans, and are therefore included in the gures shown in the right hand column of the first table.
In addition, the employer has paid 51,000 to Andrew Shilston directly in order to meet the income tax liability that he will incur on these employer contributions to the unapproved plan.
The additional pension earned and the corresponding transfer value relate only to the period for which he was a director ie to the period July 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005.
For Colin Smith, the comparator transfer value gure at the start of the year is the value as at June 30, 2005, immediately before his date of appointment as a director.
8 Members of the schemes have the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions.
Neither the contributions nor the resulting benets are included in the above table.
9 Benets are translated at US$1.82 1.
10 The lump sum entitlement shown is that which would be paid on immediate retirement based on service to the end of the year.
11 The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice.
12 James Guyette is a member of two dened benefit plans in the USA, one qualied and one non-qualied.
He accrues a retirement lump sum benefit in both of these plans which, as cash balance arrangements, operate on the same basis as dened contribution except a guaranteed minimum rate of interest of four per cent is applied to investments.
The aggregate value of the retirement lump sums accrued in these two plans, and the transfer values of these benets, are shown in the second table.
In addition, James Guyette is a member of two 401 k dened benefit savings plans in the USA, one qualied and one non-qualied, to which both he and his employer, Rolls-Royce North America Inc. contribute.
The aggregate employer contribution invested in the cash balance and 401 k plans each year is calculated with reference to taxable basic and annual incentive compensation to reect market practice in the USA.
However, this is capped at no more than 26 per cent of basic salary.
James Guyette is also a member of an unfunded non-qualied deferred compensation plan in the USA, to which his employer makes notional contributions calculated with reference to his basic salary.
Employer contributions to the 401 k and deferred compensation plans during 2005 have been added to the increase in transfer value over 2005 for the dened benefit plans, and are therefore included in the gures shown in the right hand column of the second table.
