40 Directors Remuneration Report At 31 December 2005 This report provides details of the remuneration of each of the directors and sets out the companys remuneration policies for the current financial year and, subject to ongoing review, for subsequent financial years.
The report will be put to the Annual General Meeting for approval by the shareholders.
THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION HAS NOT BEEN AUDITED The Remuneration Committee met three times during the period under review.
The members of the committee, all of whom are considered to be independent, are Alf Duch Pedersen Chairman, Lord Condon, Bo Lerenius, Waldemar Schmidt and Mark Seligman.
Mr Schmidt joined the committee on 1 July 2005 in succession to Thorleif Krarup who on the same date assumed Mr Schmidts previous position on the Audit Committee.
Mr Seligman joined the committee in March 2006.
When Mr Duch-Pedersen succeeds to the chairmanship of the company in July 2006 he will leave the committee and Lord Condon will become its chairman.
The committee is responsible for setting all aspects of the remuneration of the chairman, the executive directors, the three other members of the group executive committee and the company secretary.
It is also responsible for the operation of the companys share plans.
Its terms of reference are available on the companys website.
Advice was provided to the committee by New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, compensation consultants, who were appointed by the committee.
The terms of their appointment are available on the companys website.
New Bridge Street Consultants did not provide any other services to the company during the period under review.
Nick Buckles, chief executive, provided guidance to the committee on remuneration packages for senior executives within the group.
Further guidance was received from the groups HR director, Irene Cowden.
Neither Mr Buckles nor Mrs Cowden participated in discussions regarding their own pay.
Remuneration policy The policy for the remuneration of the executive directors and the executive management team aims to achieve: the ability to attract, retain and motivate high calibre executives: a strong link between executive reward and the groups performance: alignment of the interests of the executives and the shareholders: provision of incentive arrangements which focus on both annual and longer-term performance.
A significant proportion of total remuneration is related to performance, through participation in both short-term and long-term incentive schemes.
For base target performance, the performance-related element amounts to around 40% of the total package.
For stretch target performance, the performance-related element amounts to around 60% of the total package.
The committee believes that the current balance is appropriate, although it is kept under review.
Bonus payments do not form part of salary for pension purposes.
Elements of remuneration a Base salary and benefits The salaries of the executive directors were set at 19 July 2004, on completion of the merger between Securicor and the security businesses of Group 4 Falck and, except as explained below, were reviewed for the first time with effect from 1 January 2006.
Subsequent reviews will take place with effect from 1 January in each year.
Interim salary reviews may be carried out following significant changes in responsibility.
The salaries take account of a benchmarking exercise based on similarly sized companies with a significant part of their business overseas and also reflect responsibility, individual performance, internal relativities and salary and other market information supplied by New Bridge Street Consultants.
The overall objective is to achieve salary levels which provide a market competitive base salary, with the opportunity to earn above median remuneration, on the delivery of superior performance, through the companys incentive schemes.
Benefits include pension arrangements and the provision of a company car, health insurance and life assurance.
41 Directors Remuneration Report continued At 31 December 2005 Elements of remuneration continued b Performance-related bonus scheme For the year under review, the executive directors participated in an annual performance-related bonus scheme, payments under which were dependent on the attainment of defined PBTA profit before tax and amortisation targets of the group, adjusted for the effect of any exceptional items and discontinued operations and using constant exchange rates.
The committee believes that PBTA best reflects the various key drivers of business success within the group.
For achievement of a threshold level of profits which is slightly below the budgeted profit target, a bonus payment of 25% of base salary was due.
For achievement of the budgeted target, a bonus payment of 50% of base salary was due, increasing on a straight-line basis up to a bonus payment of 100% of salary for achievement of a stretch profit target.
Any such bonus up to the value of 50% of the executive directors salary was payable in cash with any excess balance being awarded in the form of deferred shares.
Any deferred shares will normally only be transferred to the executive director if he remains in employment otherwise than where he leaves in certain specified circumstances for a period of three years from the date of the award of the shares.
A similar scheme operates for the current year, save that no payment will be due for achievement below the budgeted target.
The PBTA budgeted targets used for the above scheme are the same as the companys budgeted PBTA for the corresponding period.
As, due to the level of the companys profit performance, the stretch target for PBTA was exceeded, payment was at the maximum, 100%, level.
c Synergy bonus For transitional periods running from 1 July 2004 until 31 December 2004 and from 1 January 2005 until 31 December 2005, the executive directors participated in an additional bonus scheme, payment under which was dependent upon achievement of specified merger synergy savings.
For the 12 months to 31 December 2005, achievement of a specified target amount of savings entitled the executive directors to an award of deferred shares in the company equal in value to 25% of base salary, rising to 50% for achievement of a specified stretch target.
As the stretch target for synergy savings was exceeded, payment was at the maximum, 50%, level.
No further awards will be made under this plan.
d Performance Share Plan long-term incentive plan The performance share plan was introduced in July 2004.
Under the plan, the executive directors and certain other senior executives receive conditional allocations of the companys shares which are released to them only on the achievement of demanding performance targets.
The maximum annual award of shares under the plan is one times base salary, save that, in exceptional circumstances, the Remuneration Committee may determine that an award of up to one and a half times salary may be made.
The extent to which allocations of shares under the plan vest will be determined, as to half of the award, by the companys normalised earnings per share growth relative to the RPI over a single three-year period and, as to the second half of the award, by the companys ranking by reference to TSR total shareholder return, being share price growth plus dividends paid using the FTSE 100 constituent companies as at the date of the award as a comparator group, again over a single three-year period.
There is no provision for retesting.
The following targets apply to the first half of awards granted in the year under review, with the three-year adjusted earnings per share EPS period ending on 31 December 2007: Average annual growth in EPS Proportion of allocation vesting RPI 10% per annum 30% over three years 25% RPI 20% per annum 60% over three years 100% RPI 10-20% per annum Pro rata between 25% and 100% Less than RPI 10% per annum Nil 42 Directors Remuneration Report continued At 31 December 2005 Elements of remuneration continued d Performance Share Plan long-term incentive plan continued The following targets apply to the second half of each such award: Ranking of the company against the FTSE-100 constituent companies by reference to TSR Proportion of allocation vesting Median 25% Upper quartile 100% Between median and upper quartile Pro rata between 25% and 100% Below median Nil In addition, there will only be a transfer of shares if a the growth in EPS of the company has exceeded the growth in RPI by 10% over a performance period of three financial years, and b the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the companys TSR performance is reflective of the companys underlying performance.
Awards will not normally vest where an employee ceases to be employed within the group unless cessation of employment is due to death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or following a change of control of, or sale outside the group of, his or her employing company.
In these situations, vesting will occur in the normal course and the performance targets will need to be satisfied pro rata to the time the allocation has been held.
However, only a proportion of the award, based on the time which has elapsed from the award date to the last day of the month in which employment ceased, may vest in these circumstances.
In respect of awards made in 2006, the RPI 10% and RPI 20% EPS average annual growth targets have been replaced by RPI 6% and RPI 11% respectively, reflecting the fact that the original EPS targets anticipated various merger synergy benefits which had all been realised by 31 December 2005 and that the new targets are more appropriate for the company going forward.
The companys current policy is to use market purchased shares to satisfy performance share plan awards.
The Remuneration Committee believes that a combination of earnings per share growth and total shareholder return targets is the most appropriate performance measure for the performance share plan, as it provides a transparent method of assessing the companys performance, both in terms of underlying financial performance and returns to shareholders.
The company calculates whether the EPS performance targets have been achieved by reference to the companys audited accounts which provide an accessible and objective measure of the companys earnings per share, whilst TSR comparative data will be supplied by New Bridge Street Consultants.
The committee will also ensure that the EPS targets are measured on a consistent basis and are not artificially impacted, either to the benefit or to the detriment of participants, by the change in accounting standards to International Financial Reporting Standards.
The committee also believes that continued shareholding by senior executives will strengthen the alignment of their interests with shareholders interests.
Accordingly, executive directors of the company will be expected to retain shares to the value of 30% of the after-tax gains made on the vesting of performance share plan awards until they have built up a shareholding equivalent to one times base salary.
43 Directors Remuneration Report continued At 31 December 2005 Fees, service contracts and letters of appointment The chairmans annual fee is 180,000.
The annual fee for the non-executive directors, which is set by the chairman and the executive directors, is 45,000, with a further 40,000 for the role of deputy chairman, 12,500 for the chairmanship of each of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and 15,000 for the role of senior independent director.
No other fees are paid for membership of the board committees.
These fees are subject to periodic review which takes into account comparative fee levels in other groups of a similar size and the anticipated time commitment for the non-executive directors.
The service contracts of those who served as executive directors during the period are dated as follows: Nick Buckles 2 June 2004 Trevor Dighton 2 June 2004 Grahame Gibson 4 August 2000 as amended by letter of 14 April 2005 Lars Nrby Johansen left 30 June 2005 3 June 2004 The contracts of Messrs Buckles, Dighton and Gibson are terminable by the company on 12 months notice.
The contract of Mr Nrby Johansen was terminable by the company on 24 months notice until 19 July 2006 after which it would have been terminable on 12 months notice.
The contracts are terminable by the executive directors on 12 months notice.
There are no liquidated damages provisions for compensation payable upon early termination, but the company reserves the right to pay salary in lieu of notice.
It is the companys policy that it should be able to terminate service contracts of executive directors on no more than 12 months notice and that payments for termination of contract are restricted to the value of salary and other contractual entitlements for the notice period.
The chairman and the other non-executive directors do not have service contracts but letters of appointment which provide for initial three-year terms which began on 19 May 2004 and, in the case of Mr Seligman, on 1 January 2006.
All directors are required to stand for re-election by the shareholders at least once every three years.
It is the companys policy that executive directors may each hold not more than one external non-executive appointment and may retain any associated fees.
Mr Buckles is a non-executive director of Arriva plc for which he received fees of 15,166 in the year ended 31 December 2005.
Neither of the other executive directors currently holds an external non-executive appointment.
Performance graph The performance graph below shows the total cumulative shareholder return of the company from its first day of listing, 20 July 2004, until 31 December 2005, based on a hypothetical shareholding worth 100, compared with the return achieved by the FTSE 100 constituent companies over the same period.
The directors believe this to be a more appropriate form of broad equity market index against which to base a comparison than the support services sector, where there are no companies directly comparable to Group 4 Securicor.
The FTSE 100 index has also been selected for comparative total shareholder return purposes in the companys performance share plan.
Total Shareholder Return Source: Datastream 140 Group 4 Securicor PLC FTSE 100 Index 130 120 110 100 90 20 July 2004 31 December 2004 31 December 2005 This graph shows the value, by 31 December 2005, of 100 invested in Group 4 Securicor plc on 20 July 2004 compared with the value of 100 invested in the FTSE 100 Index.
The other point plotted is the value at the intervening financial year-end.

47 Directors Remuneration Report continued At 31 December 2005 Mr Duch-Pedersen acquired 20,000 shares and Mr Seligman acquired 10,000 shares on 13 March 2006.
No other changes in these holdings have taken place since 31 December 2005.
Each of Nick Buckles, Trevor Dighton and Grahame Gibson also has a deemed interest in 4,206,332 ordinary shares held in the Group 4 Securicor Employee Benefit Trust.
Directors Pension Entitlements For the period under review, the executive directors participated in non-contributory categories of the groups defined benefit pension schemes with a normal retirement age of 60.
Trevor Dighton accrued pension at a rate of 1 30ths of the statutory earnings cap.
Nick Buckles and Grahame Gibson accrued pension at a rate of 1 52ths of their final pensionable salary.
An actuarial reduction is applied to pensions payable before normal retirement age and an increase is applied where retirement is deferred beyond normal retirement age.
Between 6 April 2002 and 5 April 2003, Mr Dighton received a salary supplement of 30% of base salary in excess of the earnings cap in lieu of pension provision in respect of his base salary in excess of the cap.
Following the Governments announcement of proposed changes to the tax rules for pensions, these payments were suspended with effect from 6 April 2003, pending a review of Mr Dightons pension arrangement.
In September 2005, it was agreed that Mr Dighton should be granted an Unfunded Lump Sum Retirement Benefit ULSRB to be calculated as the accumulation of notional contributions of 30% of his base salary in excess of the earnings cap, deemed to be invested in the FTSE All Share Total Return Index.
The ULSRB is money-purchase in nature and will be consolidated with Mr Dightons benefits from the Securicor Group Pension Scheme under the transitional arrangements following 6 April 2006.
Going forward, Mr Dighton will participate in the pension at the current accrual rate of 1 30ths on an uncapped basis, which is considered to be consistent with the terms of his original appointment given that the tax legislation no longer imposes a bar on such accruals.
For death before retirement a capital sum equal to four times pensionable salary is payable, together with a spouses pension of 50% of the members prospective pension at the age of 60 plus a return of any contributions paid prior to the admission to the non-contributory category.
For death in retirement, a spouses pension of 50% of the members pre-commutation pension is payable.
Post retirement pensions increase in line with the increase in the Retail Prices Index subject to a maximum of 5% per annum.
Pension entitlements and corresponding transfer values increased as follows during the 12 months ended 31 December 2005 all figures are in 000s.

iii The value of net increase 4 represents the incremental value to the director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption that service terminated at the year-end.
It is based on the increase in accrued pension 2. iv The change in transfer value 5 includes the effect of fluctuations in such value due to factors beyond the control of the company and the directors, such as stock market movements.
v The accumulated value of the ULSRB for Mr Dighton as at 1 September 2005 is 157,220.
The salary supplement of 30% of salary in excess of the earnings cap from 1 September 2005 to 31 December 2005 is 24,440. vi All figures relate to the twelve month period from 31 December 2004 to 31 December 2005.
However, Mr Gibson was not appointed a director until 1 April 2005.
