Remuneration report Compliance This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
As required, this report is being put to shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting for an advisory vote.
Throughout 2005 the company complied with Schedule A of the Combined Code the Code regarding best practice on the design of performance-related remuneration.
The remuneration, including pensions and compensation payments, of all executive directors is determined by the Remuneration Committee the Committee and ratified by the Board.
The Committee also reviews and advises on the general principles under which remuneration including any bonus or long-term incentive schemes and pensions is applied to employees of the company.
The Committee is composed entirely of non-executive directors whom the Board considers to be independent, and comprises Mr J R W Orange, who chairs the Committee and is the companys senior independent director, Messrs S J Dobbie, R V Emerson and I Gray.
Mr S C Lockett is not a member of the Committee but usually attends meetings by invitation, except when his own remuneration is being discussed, as the company considers it important that the Chief Executive is fully aware of discussions concerning remuneration policy and the remuneration packages of its most senior employees.
The Committee acts within its agreed written terms of reference and complies with the relevant provisions of the Code in implementing its remuneration policy.
The terms of reference are published on the companys website www.
None of the executive directors of the company are involved in determining their own remuneration.
The Committee takes independent advice from Inbucon Consulting, a leading firm of remuneration consultants, which is appointed as an advisor to the Remuneration Committee in respect of executive remuneration and share schemes, including total shareholder return calculations.
The Inbucon Group acts as trustees and administrators of the companys Share Incentive Plan.
The Inbucon Group does not provide any other services to the company.
No other person or company materially assisted the Committee during the year.
Remuneration approach The companys remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages which ensure that directors and senior management are fairly and responsibly rewarded for their contributions.
The aim is to provide remuneration packages which are sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the quality required to achieve the groups objectives and thereby enhance shareholder value.
The Committee takes account of the level of remuneration paid to executive directors and senior managers of comparable public companies.
The main components of executive directors remuneration are basic salary, an annual performance-related cash and share bonus scheme with a deferred element, benefits, longer-term incentives and pension provision.
Each element is discussed in detail below.
The remuneration therefore contains a suitable balance of direct performance related remuneration, which links both the short-term financial performance of the group and the long-term shareholder return with the executives total remuneration.
The remuneration package is weighted so that the majority of reward may potentially come from the performance-related elements of the package.
The Committee endorses the principle of mitigation of damages on early termination of a service contract.
It is the Committees current intention to continue with the above remuneration approach for 2006 and subsequent years although the Committee will keep the matter under review.
The Committees current intention with regard to share options is that they will continue to be awarded only in special circumstances.
Shareholders approved the adoption of the Asset and Equity Plan AEP at the AGM in 2004 and the Committee continues to regard this plan as the most appropriate method of rewarding the companys executives for achieving growth in share price and the underlying asset value of the company.
The companys Articles of Association provide that the remuneration paid to non-executive directors is to be determined by the Board within the limits set by the shareholders.
22 Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Performance chart The chart below shows the companys total shareholder return TSR over the last five financial years compared with the equivalent information in respect of the Oil & Gas Exploration and Production sector, which the Committee considers to be the closest equity market index.
The company has recorded six consecutive years of positive TSR.
Total Shareholder Return % Premier Oil vs FTSE Oil & Gas Exploration and Production Premier Oil FTSE Oil & Gas Exploration and Production 100% 80% 60% 40% 20% 0 -20% 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 Contracts of service Save for automatic termination when each executive director becomes 60 years of age, the executive directors have rolling service contracts, subject to re-election by shareholders under the companys Articles of Association and the provisions of the Code.
The service contract of each executive director may be terminated on 12 months notice in writing by either side, in accordance with current market practice.
In such event, the compensation commitments in respect of their contracts could amount to one years remuneration based on base salary, annual bonus and long-term incentive scheme entitlement, benefits in kind and pension rights during the notice period.
There are provisions for earlier termination by the company in certain circumstances.
If such circumstances were to arise, the executive director concerned would have no claim against the company for damages or any other remedy in respect of the termination.
There are no other provisions, such as liquidated damages clauses, which expressly provide for compensation in the event of early termination.
The Committee would apply general principles of mitigation to any payment made to a departing executive director and would consider each case on an individual basis.
Details of the contracts of employment for the executive directors are as follows: Provision for payment Effective date Unexpired Notice upon early Director of contract term period termination R A Allan 09.12.03 12 months None specified A R C Durrant 01.06.05 12 months None specified C J A Jamieson 15.09.83 24 months None specified S C Lockett 09.12.03 12 months None specified J A van der Welle 01.04.99 Statutory minimum See below On 30 June 2005 Messrs C J A Jamieson and J A van der Welle left the Board and Mr A R C Durrant became a director.
Under the terms of Mr J A van der Welles contract, he was paid an amount equivalent to nine-twelfths annual remuneration.
In addition, he will be paid a bonus for 2005 under the normal bonus arrangements as if he had remained in position until 31 December 2005, and disapplying any deferral conditions.
Mr C J A Jamieson will be paid one half of the bonus for 2005 under the normal bonus arrangements as if he had remained in position until 31 December 2005, and disapplying any deferral conditions.
Non-executive directors have letters of appointment, which are all effective from 15 July 2003 for a period of three years subject to reappointment by the members in a General Meeting and which all have notice periods of three months.
It is the current intention that, on expiry, these letters of appointment will be replaced by new letters, which are effective for a further three years, also with notice periods of three months.
Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2005 23 Remuneration report continued Remuneration structure The remuneration package for the executive directors comprises base salary, benefits, bonus, pension, and entitlement to participate in the companys all-employee share schemes and long-term executive share schemes.
Base salary Base salary is reviewed each year against other comparable companies in the oil sector and general market data on the basis of companies in similar industries and those of a similar size.
The object is to ensure that the base salary, when taken together with the rest of the package, provides a competitive but performance-driven remuneration package.
The base salaries of the executive directors are currently positioned between the median and the upper quartile.
While salary is reviewed by reference to market conditions, the performance of the company and the performance of the individual, the Committee would not regard this element of remuneration as directly performance-related.
Annual bonus scheme The annual bonus, which is non-pensionable, consists of a payment of up to 50 per cent of salary which is paid immediately, providing certain performance conditions are met, and a deferred payment of up to 50 per cent of salary for the same performance conditions.
Payment of the deferred part of the bonus is made in shares and deferred for three years.
The deferred element of the bonus is contingent upon the relevant beneficiary remaining in employment for the three years from the date of the award, but is not dependent on any further performance-related measures.
The performance measures for 2005 were based as to 20 per cent of the maximum bonus potential on the achievement of cash flow targets, 70 per cent of the maximum bonus potential on the achievement of key targets in exploration, portfolio management and strategic development, and 10 per cent of the maximum bonus potential on the achievement of health, safety and environmental targets.
The cash flow target was to achieve the operating cash flow number contained in the 2005 budget approved by the Board.
In respect of the exploration, portfolio management and strategic development targets, the Committee set guidelines at the beginning of the year against which they would determine the extent to which the targets had been achieved.
The exploration target was to increase reserves through exploration drilling by 30 mmboe.
The portfolio management and strategic development targets comprised a number of strategic business opportunities against which the Committee judges performance as well as the measurement of the performance of the companys share price.
The HSE target was to achieve combined frequencies of lost-time injuries and restricted work-day cases of at or below 2.6 losttime injuries or restricted work-day cases per million man-hours worked.
Based on these targets, the Committee decided at its meeting on 21 March 2006 to award 40 per cent of salary 20 per cent paid as cash and 20 per cent deferred in shares as indicated above for performance against the above targets.
The annual bonus scheme for the 2006 financial year has the same structure and maximum award level.
The performance measures for the 2006 bonus scheme are based as to 20 per cent of the maximum bonus potential for cash flow.
The base cash flow target is to achieve the operating cash flow number contained in the 2006 budget approved by the Board, 10 per cent of salary will be awarded for this.
The stretch cash flow target is to achieve the base target plus 15 per cent.
10 per cent of salary will be awarded if this target is met.
The second target relates to HSE performance and is a target of combined frequencies of lost-time injury frequencies and restricted work-day cases of at or below 2.1 cases per million man-hours worked.
10 per cent of the maximum bonus potential is payable for achievement of this target.
The third target relates to the achievement of key measures in exploration, portfolio management and strategic development, with a focus on the milestones needed to achieve the end-2008 targets agreed by the Board in the companys strategic plan.
These are production of 50,000 boepd and an increase in reserves of 100 million barrels.
The portfolio management and strategic development targets comprise a number of strategic opportunities against which the Committee judges performance.
70 per cent of the maximum bonus potential is payable for achievement of this third target.
Benefits Mr J A van der Welle received the benefit of a car fully expensed by the company, together with petrol cost and medical insurance.
Messrs R A Allan, A R C Durrant, C J A Jamieson and S C Lockett each received the benefit of a car allowance and medical insurance.

3 26,244 of Mr S C Locketts remuneration relates to a salary supplement as part of his pension arrangements.
4 Mr J A van der Welle left the company on 30 June 2005 the salary and fees figure above contains a loss of office termination payment of 168,750.
It also includes a pension supplement payment of 90,044.
5 20,240 of Mr van der Welles remuneration relates to a salary supplement as part of his pension arrangements.
6 The 2004 total for Sir David John includes part-year fees for the role of Chair of the Nomination Committee: Sir David has waived these fees for 2005.
7 In addition to the above Mr M A K Alizai was paid US$116,600 2004: US$116,600 for advisory services undertaken for the group outside the UK.
Benefits in kind represent car and fuel benefits and medical insurance.
The published 2004 figures included incorrect cash bonus amounts: the correct amounts were: R A Allan 65,625, C J A Jamieson 121,875, S C Lockett 65,625 and J A van der Welle 80,625.

Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2005 25 Remuneration report continued Pension schemes Audited Mr S C Lockett is a member of the Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan the Scheme subject to the Inland Revenue Earnings Cap.
The Scheme is a funded, Inland Revenue-approved final salary scheme, which provides a pension of up to two-thirds salary at the normal pension age of 60.
Benefits are actuarially reduced on early retirement before age 60 and pensions in payment increase in line with the lower of inflation or five per cent per annum.
Mr R A Allan is a member of a money-purchase pension arrangement to which the company contributed 57,735 during 2005: contributions to this arrangement are made in respect of basic annual salary as restricted to the Inland Revenue Earnings Cap.
The company has agreed to provide Messrs R A Allan, A R C Durrant and S C Lockett with a pension substantially as if they were contributing members of the Scheme and, in regard to service completed subsequent to their appointment as directors, not subject to the Inland Revenue Earnings Cap.
The additional value of this target pension provision, relative to the standard terms applied to staff, is made available at the directors option in the form of either an enhanced scale of pension contributions or a non-pensionable salary supplement.
As at the year-end, Mr R A Allan had elected the former and S C Lockett had elected the latter: subsequent to the year-end, Mr A R C Durrant elected the latter.
For life insurance purposes, Messrs R A Allan and A R C Durrant are members of the Scheme.
The accrued pension entitlements of the directors who were members or deemed members of the Scheme during 2005 are as follows: a b c d Increase from e Accrued Transfer value in Accrued Transfer value in d to b less Increase in pension as at respect of a as pension as at respect of c as contributions value on basis 31 December at 31 December 31 December at 31 December by director of listing 2005 2005 2004 2004 during 2005 requirements 000 pa 000 000 pa 000 000 000 R A Allan 7.1 58.6 3.2 24.2 22.8 19.7 A R C Durrant 2.5 21.4 14.1 14.1 C J A Jamieson 221.6 4,568.3 211.2 4,034.8 533.5 77.4 S C Lockett 23.9 142.3 18.9 103.4 24.9 12.5 J A van der Welle 27.9 298.7 22.0 214.0 78.5 49.6 Notes: 1 The amounts of accrued pension under a and c represent the accrued pension entitlements of the director as at the stated dates.
2 The transfer values under b, d and e have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the guidance note GN11: Retirement Benefit Schemes Transfer Values issued by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries.
3 The amounts under e represent the increase in value of the directors benefits in terms of the value, on the transfer value basis in force at the end of the year, of the excess of the end-year accrued benefits over the start-year accrued benefits as revalued by price inflation, less contributions by the directors.
4 The values stated in respect of Messrs R A Allan, A R C Durrant, S C Lockett and J A van der Welle correspond with the target level of their final salary pension provision: in practice, the pension benefits for these directors are principally established through individual money purchase arrangements and salary supplements.
5 Mr C J A Jamieson reached normal pension age on 30 September 2004 and deferred drawing his pension until his retirement on 1 July 2005, no pension was commuted at retirement: the accrued pension under a represents the amount of pension in payment at 31 December 2005.
6 Mr J A van der Welle left service on 30 June 2005 at which time the companys obligations in regard to pension provision were settled by lump sum payments: the accrued pension under a represents the target level of final salary pension provision as at 30 June 2005.
7 In addition to the current provision noted above, Mr R A Allan is entitled to a deferred pension under the Scheme in respect of a prior service period with the company between September 1986 and November 1999.
8 Members of the Scheme have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions, none of the directors have elected to do so.
The following payments were made to former directors of the company in respect of unfunded pension liabilities: Amount of unfunded Amount of unfunded pension paid during 2005 pension paid during 2004 J A Heath 29,312 28,320 R J Lascelles 18,327 26,561 The company and Mr R J Lascelles concluded an agreement, effective 1 September 2005, to commute the unfunded pension noted above for a lump sum of 336,000.
26 Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Share option schemes Audited The company currently operates four share option schemes.
The Scheme of Arrangement relating to the groups capital in 2003 affected two of the schemes in operation at that time.
The company therefore adopted two new share option schemes to replace the Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 and the Savings-Related Share Option Scheme 1999.
Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 Options granted under the 1995 scheme are now normally exercisable not less than three years after their date of grant and will lapse unless previously exercised on their tenth anniversary.
No payment is made for the grant of an option.
Options cannot be exercised until pre-determined performance conditions have been achieved.
For options granted prior to 2000, the performance requirement was that the share price plus the value of dividends paid must, as measured at the end of any consecutive three-year period, have grown at a rate equal to or greater than the Oil Exploration and Production Index over the same period.
Options granted during and after 2000 are dependent upon growth in the companys earnings per share of at least 3 per cent pa compound above the retail price index over a three-year period.
The Committee believes that this is a challenging performance measure that in the long-term should reflect a good shareholder return.
This scheme was affected by the Scheme of Arrangement.
The options could be exercised within six months of the Court approving the Scheme of Arrangement or the options could be rolled over into options over shares of the new company.
Where the option holder elected to roll over his options the performance criteria continued to apply.
The performance conditions relating to all options granted to directors under the 1995 Scheme have been met.
Messrs C J A Jamieson and S C Lockett held options under this scheme during the financial year.
Options granted under the scheme are normally exercisable not less than three years after their date of grant and will lapse unless previously exercised on their tenth anniversary.
In the case of certain employees, the performance condition is growth in earnings per share of at least 3 per cent pa compound above the Retail Price Index RPI over a three-year period.
In other cases, including a grant made to Mr A R C Durrant under the scheme during the year, the performance condition is based on the companys total shareholder return in comparison with a group of eight companies as follows: Burren Energy, Cairn Energy, Dana Petroleum, Paladin Resources, Tullow Oil, Venture Production, Soco International and JKX Oil & Gas, measured between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2007.
Options will vest as to 30 per cent in the event that median performance is achieved, with proportionate vesting on a straight-line basis up to 100 per cent if upper quartile performance is achieved.

28 Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Premier Oil plc Asset and Equity Plan Audited This plan is designed to reward an improvement in the asset value of the business and the market value of the company over a three-year period.
The plan therefore has two bonus pools, an equity bonus pool and an asset bonus pool, each pool being dependent upon the performance measures set out below.
Under this plan awards can be made annually and they will mature on the third anniversary of the date of grant.
The Asset and Equity Plan is a broadly based plan, with participation points being awarded to eligible employees, including executive directors, throughout the group.
No bonus pool is created unless there is a minimum compound growth in net assets per share or increase in market value of the company of 10 per cent per annum and the maximum pool is generated if growth is 20 per cent per annum.
The maximum benefit that an individual may receive will normally be limited to twice his or her base salary per annum.
A total of 823 participation points were awarded in 2004.
Of these, the directors received the following points: Number of participation points R A Allan 36.85 C J A Jamieson 64.00 S C Lockett 36.85 J A van der Welle 36.85 A total of 742 participation points were awarded in 2005.
Of these, the directors received the following points: Number of participation points R A Allan 36.85 A R C Durrant 36.85 C J A Jamieson 64.00 S C Lockett 36.85 J A van der Welle 36.85 It has been agreed that Mr C J A Jamieson will retain his 2004 and 2005 awards and that any payments to be made under those awards will be made in full.
It has been agreed that Mr J A van der Welle will retain his 2004 and 2005 awards: any payment made to him in respect of the 2004 award will be reduced by one-third: any payment made to him in respect of the 2005 award will be reduced by two-thirds.
Premier Oil Annual Report and Accounts 2005 29 Remuneration report continued Premier Oil plc Share Incentive Plan Audited Under this plan employees, including executive directors, may make contributions to acquire shares in the company Partnership Shares.
In addition to the Partnership Shares, the Board has awarded a number of shares to each employee being an outright award of shares Free Shares, and if an employee agrees to buy Partnership Shares, the company currently matches the number of Partnership Shares bought with an award of shares Matching Shares, on a one for one basis.
In the case of the award of Free Shares and Matching Shares, the company has not required performance criteria to be fulfilled, as the purpose of the plan is to encourage all employees to become shareholders in the company.
The company made an award of Free Shares to all company employees in the UK and overseas on 8 February 2002 of 526 shares per employee.
Following the one for ten share consolidation, these have been adjusted to 52 or 53 shares in a manner approved by the Inland Revenue.
These shares will be held in a trust for a period of three years after which each employee may leave the shares in trust, hold the shares in his her own name, or sell them, provided the employee is in employment at the end of the three-year period.
Should an employee leave the SIP scheme before the end of the three-year period, he she will lose the right to the Matching Shares, unless he she leaves due to injury, redundancy, TUPE transfer, retirement, death or sale of the company.
The company invites all UK employees to make contributions to acquire Partnership Shares on a monthly basis.
Messrs R A Allan, A R C Durrant, S C Lockett and J A van der Welle contributed the maximum monthly amount of 125 to the plan.
For each Partnership Share purchased, the company provides a Matching Share.
The plan was amended following the Scheme of Arrangement to allow the use of shares in the new company.
Shares held beneficially in this plan by the directors during the financial year were as follows: Total Partnership Total Matching Shares Shares held Shares purchased awarded in 2005 at prices Shares held on Partnership and Matching on 1 January in 2005 at prices between 531p and 825p, 31 December 2005 Shares acquired between 2005 between 531p and 825p vesting in 2008 or date of leaving 1 January and 1 March 2006 R A Allan 2,276 232 232 2,740 86 A R C Durrant 100 100 200 88 C J A Jamieson 52 52 S C Lockett 2,285 232 232 2,749 86 J A van der Welle 2,285 149 149 2,583 Mr R A Allans shares include shares held in the International Plan.
His Matching Shares in that plan are held by the trustees on his behalf in the form of a conditional award of shares.
