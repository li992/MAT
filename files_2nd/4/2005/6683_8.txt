Directors remuneration report This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985.
The law requires the companys auditors to audit certain of the disclosures provided.
Where disclosures have been subject to audit, they are indicated as such.
The auditors opinion is included in their report on page 25.
Remuneration committee procedures Meetings Details of the members, the number of meetings and attendees in the year are shown on page 17.
The board continues to believe that, in the circumstances of this group, the chairman of the board is the proper person to be chairman of the remuneration committee as he has more direct lines of communication with the business than the other non-executives.
Support to the committee At the meetings considering payments to the executive directors, the committee receives independent advice from Watson Wyatt LLP, a remuneration specialist.
In addition to the advice to the committee, Watson Wyatt LLP are consulting actuaries to the group and advise on various pension issues.
At those same meetings the committee receives recommendations from the chief executive on executive directors remuneration other than his own: and information on the remuneration of senior managers in the group.
The recommendations are supported by analysis of relevant data from reports by the Monks Partnership, and by analysis of the remuneration paid to executive directors in Stagecoach, FirstGroup, National Express and Arriva.
The committee considers the chief executives remuneration in his absence.
At one of the meetings each year, the committee considers executive directors bonuses.
In respect of those bonuses, in addition to the comparators already referred to, the bonuses are referenced to the achievement of financial and other targets in the relevant financial year.
Again, the committee is assisted by the views of Watson Wyatt LLP and, again, the chief executive is absent while the committee considers his bonus.
Acceptance by the board of remuneration committee proposals Following the meetings, the committee recommends salary increases and bonus payments for the executive directors to the board.
During the relevant period, the board accepted the recommendations of the committee without amendment.
Policy on directors remuneration Policy The policies for the following financial year and for years subsequent to that are as follows.
The overall policy adopted by the remuneration committee is to ensure that the group is paying sufficient to attract, retain and motivate executive directors of the desired calibre.
The committee also considers the pay, incentives and benets packages of senior executives in the group and its subsidiaries.
The remuneration committee recognises that, for this groups business, shareholder value is dependent on factors not all necessarily appearing within the published financial statements, although their effect on later financial statements can be dramatic.
Chief among thesecorporate governance issues are safety and the control of risk.
But there are other executive actions of a strategic nature that may take several accounting periods to show changes in shareholder value.
Executives in the group are encouraged to take corporate governance and strategy extremely seriously and always to consider the long-term implications of their decision-making.
The remuneration committee has regard to these factors, as well as the annual reported financial statements, in arriving at the directors overall remuneration and in considering the mix between xed and variable pay.
Executive directors salaries Salaries are intended to be sufficient to attract and retain directors of the high calibre required by the group.
Salaries are reviewed annually, normally in April.
A special review was undertaken in January 2005 following changes in executive responsibility as a consequence of the retirement of the former group chief executive.
Consequently, executive salaries were not reviewed again in April 2005.
Salaries may be increased beyond ination if justied by reference to the performance of the individual and if there is clear evidence from the Monks Partnership reports and or the comparator companies that the existing salaries are not competitive.
Executive directors cash bonuses Executive directors are paid a bonus in addition to salary.
The bonus is paid in October November on the basis of achievement of financial and other targets in the financial year ended in the previous June July.
The targets are normally notied to the executive directors before the start of the year in question.
The bonus is non-pensionable and is paid in cash.
Achievement of performance targets in the year ended 3 July 2004 resulted in the maximum bonus entitlements of 30% of basic salary being confirmed in October and paid in November 2004.
In respect of the year ended 2 July 2005, the remuneration committee has proposed, and the board has approved, maximum bonus entitlements of 30% of basic salary, as at 2 July 2005, to be paid in October 2005.
Executive directors share bonus scheme In addition to the cash bonus referred to, the group chief executive and the group finance director were offered a bonus in Go-Ahead shares to a value of 3% of the groups adjusted net profits before tax above budget for 2005 subject to a cap respectively of 180,000 and 150,000.
The group finance director was eligible for a similar bonus in 2004 and this was awarded in full in November 2004.
The chief executive rail is also eligible for a bonus in respect of 2005 to a value of 3% The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Review for the year ended 2 July 2005 19 Directors remuneration report continued of rail division adjusted net profits above budget, subject to a cap of 150,000.
A similar bonus was awarded in respect of 2004 before he became a main board director.
The remuneration committee has awarded all share bonuses for 2005 in full to buy group shares.
The shares are placed in a trust on behalf of the executive directors and remain in the trust for a period of three years from the purchase date, when title will be transferred to them, provided they are still employed by the company.
If a participating executive director leaves employment before the expiry of the three years, transfer of title is subject to the discretion of the remuneration committee.
Two senior executives in the group also participate in share bonus schemes related to the performance of the subsidiary businesses they control.
The remuneration committee controls the approval process for those awards.
The company operates a savings related employee share option scheme and, from 1 July 2003, has introduced a Share Incentive Plan.
The group finance director and the chief executive rail participate in the share option scheme and the group finance director participates in the Share Incentive Plan.
Their eligibility and involvement in them are no different from the terms of any other participating group employee and are not separately regulated by the remuneration committee.
There are no other share option or long-term incentive schemes available to executive directors, though the remuneration committee is considering a change in bonus schemes for 2006.
Pension funds All three executive directors, together with 5,100 other group employees, are members ofThe Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan.
Other benets The company does not allocate motorcars to directors or other staff.
Instead, personnel who would have been allocated a motorcar as part of their benets, or to accomplish their work, are given a car replacement allowance.
