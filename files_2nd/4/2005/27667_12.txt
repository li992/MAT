Old Mutual plc 66 Annual Report and Accounts 2005 C Employee Share Ownership Trusts The Group operates a number of Employee Share Ownership Trusts ESOTs, through which it collateralises some of its obligations under employee share schemes relating to the Companys shares.
At 31 December 2005 the following shares in the Company were held in ESOTs: Old Mutual plc Trust Country shares held in trust 1 Capital Growth Investment Trust Zimbabwe 2,089,738 2 Old Mutual Employee Share Trust Guernsey 7,943,010 4 OMGA Conversion Trust South Africa 1,558,872 4 OMGA Limited Trust South Africa 25,588,503 4 OMIOPT Limited Trust South Africa 160,813 4 OMIOPT Share Trust South Africa 1,085,226 3 OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Trust South Africa 31,254,207 3 OMSA Management Incentive Trust South Africa 83,700,000 4 OMSA Share Trust South Africa 63,638,050 Notes: 1 The Capital Growth Investment Trust is used to satisfy restricted share awards or Deferred Delivery Shares in Zimbabwe.
Any surplus shares held in trust because of nonvesting are taken into account when purchasing shares in respect of future grants.
2 The Old Mutual Employee Share Trust is primarily used to satisfy awards under the Old Mutual Restricted Share Plan around the Group excluding South Africa and Zimbabwe.
The strategy is to hold shares approximately equal to the number of shares awarded, but not yet vested, at any time.
Any surplus shares held in trust because of non-vesting are taken into account when purchasing shares in respect of future grants.
3 The OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Trust and the OMSA Management Incentive Trust were established during 2005 to subscribe for and hold shares in the Company in connection with the Black Economic Empowerment ownership transactions relating to Old Mutual South Africa.
The OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Trust holds shares for the purposes of the OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Plan, while the OMSA Management Incentive Trust holds shares for both the OMSA Senior Black Management Share Plan and the OMSA Management Incentive Plan.
Awards to white employees under the OMSA Management Incentive Plan will continue to be settled by the OMSA Share Trust.
4 There are various trusts in existence in South Africa relating to current and historic share incentive schemes.
The strategy for each scheme has been to ensure that sufficient shares are acquired to match at least 90% of the obligations of each share incentive grant.
Where excess shares are held by any of the trusts, transfers between them are made to rebalance holdings appropriately.
The general practice of the ESOTs mentioned above save for the Black Economic Empowerment-related trusts is not to vote shares held at shareholder meetings, although beneficiaries of restricted shares may in principle give directions for those shares to be voted.
The Trustees of the OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Trust and the OMSA Management Incentive Share Trust may vote any unallocated shares held in these trusts.
