Corporate Governance 25 | Summary of the Boards Report to Shareholders on Directors Remuneration Dear Shareholder Since the introduction of the current Executive Remuneration Policy in 2002 the Policy, the Remuneration Committee has conducted annual reviews to ensure that the Policy continues to serve the Company and shareholders.
This year, the Chairman and I have again maintained proactive dialogue on remuneration matters with the Companys major shareholders and relevant institutions.
The objectives of this dialogue are to provide information about the Company and its views on remuneration issues and to listen to shareholders opinions on any proposed adjustments to the Policy and remuneration governance generally.
As a result of this years review, the Remuneration Committee has concluded that the existing policy remains appropriate.
The key principles of the Policy, which have not changed, are: the expected value of total remuneration will be benchmarked against the relevant market: a high proportion of total remuneration will be delivered through performance-related payments: performance measures will be balanced between absolute financial measures and sector comparative measures to achieve maximum alignment between executive and shareholder objectives: the majority of performance-related remuneration will be provided in the form of equity: and share ownership requirements will be applied to executive directors.
The Committee has approved three changes within the existing framework.
In March 2005, the Chairman stepped down as a member of the Remuneration Committee to address the issue of the Remuneration Committee comprising only independent nonexecutive directors.
Sir John Bond has been appointed a member of the Committee with effect from 1 April 2005.
Secondly, the Short Term Incentive Plan has been reviewed to ensure that performance measures continue to align with the Companys strategy.
The current financial year sees a change from EBITDA to Operating Profit EBIT, greater focus on total service revenue, and a change in the measure of customer satisfaction.
Finally, re-testing provisions will be removed from share options granted in 2005.
At the start of this years review, I examined how well incentive awards made in previous years had aligned with the Companys performance.
I am pleased to say that the Policy implementation has worked well and forecast rewards are commensurate with actual performance.
I am confident that the Policy will continue to align executives interests with the interests of shareholders, whilst enabling the Company to engage a high calibre team to successfully lead the Company.
During the year, Committee members and I conducted a formal review of the Committees effectiveness and concluded that it was effective and able to fulfil its terms of reference.
I hope that we receive your support at the AGM on 26 July 2005.
