Remuneration report The remuneration committee comprises four non-executive directors as detailed on page 33.
Sharon Studer was appointed as chair with effect from 1 January 2005.
All current members of the remuneration committee are considered by the board to be independent in corporate governance terms.
Mike Petch, Group Human Resources Director and Jane Drysdale, Group Compensation and Benefits Director provided support to and information for the remuneration committee in 2005.
The remuneration committee's role is to advise the board on overall remuneration policy and, on its behalf, to determine the remuneration packages of the executive directors and senior executives.
The committees responsibilities are to ensure that: in determining salary, its policy and practices support business strategy by being competitive and cost-effective: the structure and level of total remuneration are broadly consistent with the principles of corporate governance as contained within the Combined Code, incorporating appropriate emphasis on reward for performance: the interests of executive directors and senior executives are aligned with those of shareholders, through the establishment of appropriate short and long-term incentives: performance targets applicable to variable remuneration are agreed: comments are solicited from principal shareholders regarding the companys remuneration principles: the determination of remuneration packages follows formal and transparent procedures, and that due regard is given to any relevant legal requirements, the provisions and recommendations of the Combined Code and the UK Listing Authoritys Listing Rules and associated guidance.
To achieve its goals, the committee needs access to consistent, standardised information regarding remuneration in comparable companies and ongoing remuneration trends.
To that end, it receives input from New Bridge Street Consultants NBSC, Mercer Human Resource Consultants Mercer and ORC Worldwide ORC on remuneration matters that affect senior executives.
In addition, the group participates in and purchases a number of remuneration surveys, the data from which are used to help formulate remuneration decisions.
NBSC, Mercer and ORC provide compensation advice to the human resources team on other remuneration-related matters, but do not undertake tax or audit services, or any other services that may lead to a conflict of interest.
The group defines its key management as set out in note 28 to the financial statements.
Remuneration policy The groups remuneration principles were reviewed in 2005 to increase the focus on incentivisation and to strengthen the link between remuneration and individual, team and company performance.
These principles are applied across the group to all employees, including executive directors and senior executives, and remain relevant for 2006: total remuneration should be structured to facilitate the recruitment, retention and incentivisation of key individuals: performance excellence should be rewarded with highly competitive remuneration packages: remuneration should be competitive in local and global market places: annual bonus plans should be in place to encourage delivery against challenging and appropriate annual financial targets: executives long-term interests should be aligned with company performance through the groups long-term incentive plan, which is designed to motivate and incentivise delivery of sustained, long-term growth: individuals should have an appropriate balance of fixed and variable elements within their total remuneration, with increased emphasis on reward for performance.
In reviewing executive directors base pay, the committee takes into account external market data supplied by independent professional sources.
For competitive benchmarking purposes, the group continues to position itself against companies in the FTSE mid-250, with specific focus on those organisations with sector and size similarities where possible.
A number of the groups key senior executives are located outside the UK.
Total remuneration, therefore, is compared both internationally and locally.
In 2005, the company continued to work with ORC to extend the depth and breadth of coverage of a market research sector remuneration survey, which was established in 2004.
Specific industry data are therefore now available for some senior posts.
The remuneration committees policy remains that cash remuneration should be positioned at the median of the comparable market place, with high-performing individuals able to increase their total remuneration above the median through their annual bonus plans and incentive arrangements.
the sixth sense of business 41 The objective remains to create a harmonised approach to total compensation across the group, including employee benefits.
This approach is essential to facilitate career development and international movement of employees and to serve as an attraction and retention tool.
The fees of the non-executive directors are a matter reserved for the executive directors.
The non-executive directors do not participate in the companys pension, annual bonus or equity plans and their fees are paid entirely in cash.
The group currently has no plans to pay part of non-executive directors fees in shares.
Fee levels for non-executive directors were increased with effect from 1 January 2005, to bring them in line with market practice and to continue to reflect the time commitments of the role in line with the requirements of the Combined Code.
The company will be reviewing fee levels again in 2006.
Board changes As outlined in the Directors report on page 34, Pedro Ros joined the board as an executive director with effect from 16 January 2006.
Following his appointment, Pedro Ros remuneration package has been reviewed and is in line with the policy statements in this report and is consistent with that of the other executive directors.
Donald Brydon joined the group as Chairman on 12 January 2006.
His remuneration has been externally benchmarked and approved by the remuneration committee.
The group announced on 13 October 2005 that Mike Kirkham would stand down as Chief Executive in 2006.
He continues to be employed by the group, working his 12 months notice until 13 October 2006.
During this time, he will receive remuneration in line with his existing employment contract.
Details of other board changes and committee structure are given in the Directors report on pages 34 to 36 and the Corporate governance report on pages 37 to 40.
Base pay This is normally reviewed annually on 1 January and reflects the rate for the specific role.
Base pay is the only pensionable element of remuneration and base pay increases recognise external pay movements and individual performance.
Tony Cowling, Mike Kirkham, David Lowden and Andy Boland all received increases in their base pay in January 2005, in line with individual performance and market data.
Annual incentive Executive directors and senior executives have annual cash bonus plans that reward growth in profit and operating margin.
Each years results provide the threshold for the next years target, encouraging a continuous drive for higher levels of performance.
In 2005 the bonus potential was a maximum of 100 per cent of base salary for Mike Kirkham, 90 per cent for David Lowden, and 75 per cent for both Tony Cowling and Andy Boland.
The groups executive bonus plan remains in place for 2006 and bonus payments for all senior executives are capped.
In 2005, bonuses for the main board were based entirely on financial performance measures, comprising earnings per share EPS, operating profit, operating margin and free cash flow.
Bonuses for senior executives excluding the main board were based 80 per cent on financial and 20 per cent on selected non-financial measures.
The financial measures covered profit and cash flow as applicable to the relevant, specific regions or global business sectors, as well as a group element based on EPS.
Bonus structure and financial goals for each performance measure are reviewed at the start of each year.
The 2006 senior executive bonus plan will be broadly similar to that for 2005.
Pension Mike Kirkham, Tony Cowling, David Lowden and Andy Boland are members of a defined contribution pension plan governed by an independent trust.
Company pension contributions for directors were reviewed in 2004 and were increased with effect from 1 January 2005, to bring them in line with the market median for defined contribution pension plans.
In light of pending pension legislative changes due to take effect on 6 April 2006 A-day, the company has continued its policy of flexible funding of pensions during 2005.
Executives may choose to sacrifice salary and bonus in return for additional company contributions to their pension fund.
Post A-Day, the remuneration committee has agreed that there will be no compensation for any executive for whom the pension plan is no longer tax efficient.
However, an executive will be able to elect to take taxable cash in lieu of company pension contributions at neutral cost to the company.
42 TNS annual report 2005 Benefits Executive directors receive individual private medical insurance, permanent health insurance, independent financial and taxation counselling, life assurance and health screening benefits.
In line with TNS UK benefits policy, there is no company car benefit for the UK-based board directors.
Equity-based incentive plans for employees and executives The groups policy is that, wherever feasible, employees should have the opportunity to participate in equity-based incentive and ownership plans.
This helps the group to drive business growth, to align the interests of employees from diverse backgrounds and cultures and to retain and attract key senior executives.
In 2005, the remuneration committee approved the use of approximately 4.9 million shares across all the equity-based plans.
Long-term incentive arrangements Long-term incentive arrangements are used to encourage performance and as a retention tool.
In 2005, the remuneration committee undertook a review of the groups share incentive plans for executives.
They concluded that the 2001 Executive Share Option Plan and the 1993 Long-term Incentive Plan should be replaced with a new long-term incentive arrangement, the 2005 Long-term Incentive Plan 2005 LTIP.
The implementation of this new plan, which is centred on the grant of performance shares conditional free shares, was approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting AGM on 11 May 2005.
The first awards under the 2005 LTIP were made in October 2005.
In addition, executive directors were eligible to participate in the Equity Participation Plan EPP.
Participation in any of the plans remains at the discretion of the remuneration committee, subject to the rules of the plans and within the terms of the agreed remuneration policy.
It is anticipated that, under the revised long-term incentive arrangements, approximately 3.5 million shares will be necessary to meet the LTIP requirements for 2006.
These will be provided through a combination of newly issued shares and trust shares.
With effect from 1 September 2005, minimum share ownership guidelines for executive directors were introduced.
The Chief Executive is expected to hold one and a half times base salary in TNS shares and other executive directors are expected to achieve a share holding of one times base salary.
Executives must retain at least 50 per cent of the profit shares delivered through the companys LTIP until they have achieved the appropriate shareholding level.
2005 Long-term Incentive Plan 2005 LTIP Executive directors and selected employees of the company are eligible to participate in the plan at the discretion of the remuneration committee.
It is expected that awards will be made to executive directors and approximately 200 of the companys senior executives on an annual basis.
Awards of up to 200 per cent of annual base salary may be made in any financial year, as detailed in the Shareholders Circular in 2004.
In 2005, 3.5 million shares in total were awarded to 204 people and additionally 40,000 phantom shares were granted to four participants.
This compares with approximately 6.7 million shares under option granted in 2004.
In relation to the groups retrospective 14 per cent dilution limit, by 31 December 2005, 38 million shares 8.48 per cent were used.
Against the forwardlooking 10 per cent dilution limit from June 2002, 26.3 million shares 5.88 per cent were used by the same date.
In 2010, the group expects to be within the 10 per cent in 10 years guideline.
The award can be made in one of two forms: i conditional allocations, where a participant will receive free ordinary shares in the company automatically on the vesting of the award: or ii nil or nominal cost options, where a participant can decide when to exercise the award during a period of up to 12 months after it has vested.
Awards will normally vest following the third anniversary of the grant date once the extent to which the performance conditions have been met see overleaf has been assessed and provided the participant is still employed by the company.
the sixth sense of business 43 Vesting of awards is conditional on the achievement of two distinct performance conditions as detailed in the table below for each tier of management.

The 2004 EPS has been restated on a comparable basis for the purposes of this LTIP.
The total shareholder return TSR performance condition measures the companys TSR relative to a peer group comprising the FTSE 350 Media Sector.
2001 Executive Share Option Plan ESP The 2005 LTIP has replaced the 2001 ESP.
However, shareholders have agreed further use of the approved schedule to the 2001 ESP, in order to grant tax efficient share options to UK based executives in exceptional circumstances.
In early 2005, prior to the approval of the 2005 LTIP, two awards were made at senior management level.
2001 Equity Participation Plan EPP Executive directors and selected employees have been eligible to participate in the EPP at the discretion of the remuneration committee.
Under the plan, employees may deposit shares in the group, which they already own, to a market value not exceeding 50 per cent of their net base salary in any one year.
In return, a matching award is granted over shares with a market value on the day of grant equal to half the pre-tax amount that would have been required by the individual to acquire the deposited shares.
A matching award will normally be exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of its grant, and is conditional upon the deposited shares being retained and the executive remaining in employment at the time of exercise.
The plan has been structured primarily as a recognition and retention vehicle for high-performing, key employees.
It also provides an incentive for executives to build and maintain a shareholding in the company through share purchases, thereby creating a clear alignment with shareholders.
The maximum value of matching awards is 25 per cent of gross base pay and, given this conservative level, there have been no performance conditions attached to awards up to and including 2005, with the exception of any main board participants.
Mike Kirkham was offered an award under this plan in 2005, which will lapse, in line with the companys principles under the EPP, when he leaves the group.
In 2005, 21 high-performing, key employees received and accepted the groups invitation to participate in the EPP, depositing an average of 35 per cent of net base salary in company shares.
These will be matched after three years, conditional upon continued employment and the retention of their deposited shares as outlined above.
Following the review of TNS long-term incentive arrangements, the EPP will be replaced by the Key Employee Equity Plan KEEP in 2006, details of which are given below.
There will be no further awards under the EPP.
Key Employee Equity Plan KEEP Under the 2005 LTIP, the group may operate a discretionary share matching plan, KEEP, for approximately 20 specifically targeted participants each year, excluding the executive board and the most senior executives.
KEEP is primarily designed to act as a retention tool and additionally, it allows directors to recognise exceptional performance by individuals.
Participants may deposit ordinary Taylor Nelson Sofres plc shares with a TNS group employee trust the deposited shares.
44 TNS annual report 2005 The maximum value of deposited shares is approximately 25,000.
These shares are held in the trust for three years and on the third anniversary the vesting date, the group will transfer to the participant one share for every one of the deposited shares, providing the participant is still employed by the group on the vesting date.
For 2006, there will be no performance conditions attached to KEEP awards, although the remuneration committee reserves discretion to attach performance conditions to subsequent awards if deemed appropriate.
Worldwide Employee Sharesave Plan WESP The companys WESP was adopted in 1999.
The plan is a share option plan in which the employee saves from salary, up to a maximum of 150 per month, over a fixed period of time minimum three years and is then given the opportunity to purchase fixed price shares, which may sometimes be at a discount to market value, from his or her fund.
The group uses the plan to encourage ownership of shares by employees and the WESP will be operated again in 2006.
In the US, the group operates a section 423 qualified stock purchase plan, the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP in place of the WESP.
This allows US employees to benefit from local tax dispensations and encourages increased participation.
In 2005, options over 0.46 million shares were granted to 480 employees in 11 countries under the WESP and the ESPP.
1993 Long-term Incentive Plan 1993 LTIP The 2005 LTIP has replaced the 1993 LTIP.
There was one award in 2005 at senior management level prior to the approval of the 2005 LTIP.
Performance graph This graph illustrates the performance of Taylor Nelson Sofres plc and the FTSE All Share Media Index over the past five years.
The group has selected this index following the approval of the 2005 LTIP.
An element of the awards under this plan is based on TSR, which reflects relative performance against a peer group, largely comprising constituents of the FTSE All Share Media index.

This mix was examined as part of the 2005 long-term incentive review and as a result, the ratio of fixed pay to variable pay has been adjusted to approximately 45:55.
