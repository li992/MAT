Remuneration Report The directors present the Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 March 2005.
This report is unaudited except for those parts which are indicated otherwise.
The members of the remuneration committee during the year were: Richard Saville Chairman until his retirement from the Board on 31 May 2004, Philip Stephens who succeeded Richard Saville as Chairman of the committee, Dennis Clark and Peter Kane.
During the year and at the request of the remuneration committee, the Groups Chief Executive, Paul Carvell, and Deputy Chairman, Bill Cockburn, gave advice and assistance to the remuneration committee.
Remuneration policy The remuneration policy of the Group, including the policy for executive directors, is determined by the remuneration committee of the Board, the membership of which consists entirely of non-executive Board members.
The Companys non-executive Chairman, Pete Kane, is not considered to be independent but his experience within both the Company and the industry for over 30 years is considered to be invaluable to the committee.
The remuneration policy for non-executive directors is determined by the Board.
The objectives of the committee are: 1.
To ensure that directors and senior executives are fairly rewarded for their individual contributions to the Groups overall performance.
To ensure that the remuneration of the executive directors and senior executives of the Group is set by a committee of Board members who have no personal interest in the outcome of the decisions and who will give due regard to the interests of shareholders and to the financial and commercial health of the Group.
The remuneration policy of the Group is to provide competitive remuneration arrangements for executive directors and senior executives which are commensurate with those of other companies of a similar nature, size and standing and which reflect the Groups business and financial objectives and the goals of Corporate Governance.
Remuneration arrangements are addressed within the context of the Groups current performance, its progress towards strategic objectives and individual executives personal performance.
As part of its periodic review of best practice, the remuneration committee will be seeking advice from external consultants during the coming year concerning the continuing relevance and appropriateness of the Companys remuneration arrangements.
Elements of the remuneration package of executive directors Remuneration of executive directors comprises the following elements: Base salaries Base salaries are determined in relation to job responsibilities and sustained level of individual performance, and are reviewed annually.
Bonuses The company operates a bonus scheme for executive directors.
The level of bonus payment is dependent upon the Groups performance evaluated against both the prior year and annual budget, and also upon each directors achievement of personal objectives, set out at the beginning of the year.
In normal circumstances, the maximum payment is limited to 50% of annual salary and payments in respect of personal objectives may not exceed payments in respect of the Groups financial performance.
Because the achieved profits for the year fell short of the targets set out at the beginning of the year, no payments under the bonus scheme were made.
However, due to the exceptional result achieved by UK Mail in its first year of operation, the remuneration committee awarded a discretionary bonus of 20,000 to Guy Buswell, Managing Director, UK Mail.
Benefits Health and sickness insurance schemes are provided for executive directors and include private health cover and permanent health insurance.
Executive directors receive an annual car allowance and contributions of 12.5% of each individual directors base salary into a defined contribution pension scheme.
Share-based incentive schemes The company utilises a Long Term Incentive Plan, Executive Share Options and a Share Matching Plan to provide longer term share-based incentives for executive directors.
The schemes are designed to motivate and reward achievement of a combination of corporate financial targets and enhancement of shareholder value.
Executive directors also participate in the Groups Sharesave scheme.
The remuneration committee determined in 2004 that awards made under the Companys Long Term Incentive Plan would be a more effective means of incentivising the Companys directors than share options and, accordingly, share options will only be granted in exceptional circumstances.
Specific details of the incentive schemes are shown later in this report.
Report & Accounts 30 Remuneration Report The Long Term Incentive Plan, Executive Share Options and Share Matching Plan all use growth in earnings per share as a performance criterion.
During the transition to International Financial Reporting Standards, the remuneration committee will ensure that a consistent basis is used in the measurement of earnings per share performance.
The targeted composition of each executive directors remuneration, excluding long term incentives, is that 75% is non-performance related and that 25% is performance related.
The remuneration of each non-executive director is 100% non-performance related except that, in addition to his directors and consultancy fees, Bill Cockburn has a long-term incentive arrangement whereby he is entitled to receive bonuses if the profit of UK Mail exceeds specified targets within a four year period of the commencement of trading.
Directors service contracts It is the Companys policy that, whilst there should not be a fixed duration in respect of directors service contracts, each contract contains notice periods of not more than one year and contains a clause whereby the contractual termination payments do not exceed the directors remuneration for the previous calendar year.
Non-executive directors are initially appointed for a three year term.
All directors are required by the Companys Articles of Association to submit themselves for re-election at least every three years.
The details of the service contracts of those who have served as directors during the year are: Contract date Notice period Contractual termination payment Guy Buswell 01.02.01 6 months 6 months remuneration Paul Carvell 26.02.01 12 months 12 months remuneration Dennis Clark 01.10.01 3 months None Bill Cockburn 01.04.02 3 months None Peter Fitzwilliam 01.02.99 6 months 6 months remuneration Russell Hodgson 02.01.01 6 months 6 months remuneration Michael Kane 01.10.01 3 months None Peter Kane 01.10.01 12 months None Alec Ross 01.02.01 6 months 6 months remuneration Richard Saville resigned 31 May 2004 01.10.01 3 months None Philip Stephens appointed 1 April 2004 31.03.04 3 months None In the event of termination following a change of control, executive directors are entitled to termination payments of 12 months remuneration.
Performance graph The adjacent graph compares the total shareholder return for an investment in the shares of Business Post with the return for the same investment in the FTSE Support Services index over a five year period commencing on 1 April 2000.
In the opinion of the directors, the FTSE Support Services index, of which the Company is a constituent, is currently the most appropriate index against which the total shareholder return of the Company should be measured because it is widely used by our investors, shareholders and management as a measure of performance.

Pensions This part of the Remuneration Report is audited information The following amounts were contributed during the year to the directors personal pension schemes, which are defined contribution schemes.
No other directors have been granted share options in the shares of the company or other group entities.
None of the terms and conditions of the share options were varied during the year.
33 Business Post Group plc Remuneration Report The exercise of options is subject to the condition that the growth in the Companys earnings per share shall exceed the increase in the index of retail prices from the date of grant by more than 3% p. a.
In addition, the exercise of share options granted to Paul Carvell in July 2001 is conditional upon the Companys share price exceeding certain targets for a minimum of 100 consecutive days between 48 and 66 months from issue.
Of the 294,117 options granted, 98,039 become exerciseable if the share price exceeds 600p, a further 98,039 become exerciseable if the share price exceeds 750p and a further 98,039 become exerciseable if the share price exceeds 900p.
Following the decision of the remuneration committee in the prior year that awards made under the Companys Long Term Incentive Plan would be a more effective means of incentivising the Companys directors than share options, no share options were granted during the year.
The Sharesave scheme provides a savings plan to purchase shares and has no performance criteria in order to participate.
The market price of the Companys shares at the end of the year was 660p and the range of prices during the year was between 469p and 702.5p.

Report & Accounts 34 Remuneration Report Long Term Incentive Plan This part of the Remuneration Report is audited information Directors interests in shares held in the Long Term Incentive Plan are as follows Date of Award Performance Number at Granted Exercised Lapsed Number at Gains on Award Price Period 1 April in year in year in year 31 March exercise Ending 2004 2005 000 Guy Buswell 02.06.00 345p 31.03.03 12,928 3,232 9,696 16 16.11.04 545p 31.03.07 16,063 16,063 Paul Carvell 16.11.04 545p 31.03.07 34,422 34,422 Peter Fitzwilliam 02.06.00 345p 31.03.03 15,641 3,910 11,731 20 16.11.04 545p 31.03.07 16,637 16,637 Russell Hodgson 16.11.04 545p 31.03.07 20,940 20,940 Alec Ross 02.06.00 345p 31.03.03 12,928 3,232 9,696 16 16.11.04 545p 31.03.07 10,372 10,372 Exercise gains in the above table are calculated as at the exercise date, although shares may have been retained.
Awards at 31 March 2005 may be exercised between three and ten years following the date of grant, determined primarily by reference to the Companys Total Shareholder Return performance over a period of three years.
"Under this condition, the Companys Total Shareholder Return ""TSR"" is measured against the TSR of all the other companies in the Support Services sector listed in the FTSE All Share Index at the start of the financial year in which an Award is granted over a period of three financial years."
The proportion of the Award which may be exercised depends upon the ranking of the Companys TSR, whereby 10% of shares may be exercised if the Company achieves median ranking, rising pro-rata to 100% if the Companys ranking falls within the top 10%.
No shares are exerciseable if the Companys ranking is below the median.
TSR has been chosen as the primary performance condition since it aligns the interests of directors with shareholders by requiring outperformance of broadly comparable companies.
The exercise of awards is also subject to the condition that the growth in the Companys earnings per share shall exceed the increase in the index of retail prices from the date of grant by more than 3% p. a.
Furthermore, on the exercise of awards under the Plan or options previously granted under any of the Companys executive share option schemes, directors are expected to retain a proportion of the after-tax profit in the form of shares until they have acquired a shareholding equal to their basic salaries.
In relation to prior years this proportion was expected to be 25%.
An increase in this proportion was introduced during the year and, with effect from 1 April 2005, this proportion is expected to be 50%.
The Companys Employee Share Ownership Trust holds shares in the Company for subsequent transfer to employees under the Long Term Incentive Plan.
Shares held by the Trust are not voted at shareholder meetings and do not accrue dividends.
At 31 March 2005, the Trust held a total of 214,252 shares in respect of its future obligations under the Companys Long Term Incentive Plan.
35 Business Post Group plc Remuneration Report Share Matching Plan This part of the Remuneration report is audited information.
The remuneration committee considers it appropriate to align further the interests of senior executives with those of long-term shareholders through the operation of a share matching scheme.
"Under the rules of the Business Post Group Share Matching Plan ""SMP"", approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in July 2004, selected executives may be invited to invest a proportion of their cash bonus in the acquisition of Company shares up to 25% of their pre-tax salary."
Where such an investment is made, the executives will receive the grant of a matching award over shares in the Company with an equivalent value.
Details of shares purchased and matching grants awarded during the year are as follows: Date of Earliest Number at Granted Number at Grant Exercise Date 1 April in year 31 March 2004 2005 Guy Buswell 16.11.04 16.11.07 870 870 Paul Carvell 16.11.04 16.11.07 870 870 Peter Fitzwilliam 16.11.04 16.11.07 1,400 1,400 Russell Hodgson 16.11.04 16.11.07 870 870 Alec Ross 16.11.04 16.11.07 870 870 Awards may be exercised between 36 months and 42 months following the date of grant.
"The proportion of the award which may be exercised depends upon the growth in the Companys earnings per share and is subject to a minimum growth of 4% p. a. above the index of retail prices ""RPI"" over the three year performance period."
Earnings per share has been chosen as the performance condition since it requires substantial improvement in underlying financial performance.
One third of the award may be exercised if growth is in excess of RPI growth by 12% over the period, two thirds if growth is in excess by between 12% and 15%, and in full if growth exceeds RPI growth by 18% over the period representing RPI 6% p. a..
The awards lapse if the minimum condition is not achieved at the end of the three year performance period.
