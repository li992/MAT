Executive directors shareholdings Executive directors are required to build up and retain a target shareholding equal to 1x yearly salary, normally within five years of appointment.
Performance share plan awards are delivered in shares and executives can retain all the shares that vest if they make a cash payment to meet their PAYE statutory liabilities.
The company prefers a exible approach to the accumulation of a shareholding, which takes account of individual circumstances, and has decided not to require executives to retain a proportion of shares which vest under its incentive plans.
However, it has retained the option to pay the annual bonus in shares if it considers this to be appropriate.
Executive directors interests in shares, as at 31 March 2005, are listed in tables 12, 13 and 14 of the directors report on pages 35 and 36.
