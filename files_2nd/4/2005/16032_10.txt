TRA VIS PERKINS PLC Remuneration report For the year ended 31 December 2005 Introduction This report sets out the companys remuneration policies for its directors and senior executives and describes how those policies are applied in practice.
The directors confirm that this report has been drawn up in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 the Schedule and the 2003 Combined Code on Corporate Governance the Code.
As required by the Schedule, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Unaudited information Remuneration committee The committee was established in July 2003, having previously been a combined Remuneration and Nominations Committee.
Its principal roles are to establish the companys policy on executive directors and senior executives remuneration, to determine the remuneration packages for each of the executive directors, and to review with the chief executive the remuneration packages for other senior executives.
It is required to give due regard to the best practice provisions contained in the Code.
Peter Maydon served as chairman during 2005 until his retirement on 31 December 2005.
The committee members are Michael Dearden acting chairman together with Tim Stevenson and Andrew Simon.
Andrew Simon will become chairman of the committee on 1 May 2006.
These directors are non-executive and have no day-to-day involvement in the running of the business, no financial interest in the business except as shareholders and no conflicts of interest arising from other directorships.
The committee has been advised during the year by four independent external consultants engaged by it, namely, Mercer Human Resources Consulting, Hay Group, New Bridge Street Consultants and Towers Perrin.
In addition, Andrew Pike, the company secretary and Rob Tansey, the group human resources director have advised the committee from time to time as requested, but never in respect of their own remuneration.
Policy on executive directors remuneration The companys policy on executive remuneration is to ensure that it has an appropriate mix of fixed and variable pay over the short and long term, to attract and retain high quality executives with an appropriate blend of skills and experience.
The committee consults with the chief executive on the remuneration of the other executive directors and senior executives.
It aims to pay salaries and make available variable remuneration to reward out-performance, in line with the median of the top 250 companies in the FTSE All Share index and of a selected comparator group.
The committee believes this has and will continue to enable the company to recruit and retain staff of high quality, contributing to the delivery of long-term shareholder value.
As a consequence the companys focus is on the following elements of the remuneration package: Basic salary: to remain competitive in the labour market: Annual bonus payment: to provide variable remuneration, both in the form of cash and deferred shares, which directly reflects company performance during the year: Long term incentive scheme: the Share Matching Scheme, under which executives may invest part of their annual bonus in order to receive matching shares the vesting of which depends on company performance over a 3 year period: Share options: through the regular grant of options to reward outstanding performance over the longer term: Pension arrangements: to enable executives to make appropriate provision for retirement.
A significant proportion of a directors total remuneration package is variable, being subject to the achievement of specified business objectives.
In applying this policy the committee has taken account of the provisions of Schedule A of the Code.
Consistent with the recommendations of the ABI guidelines, the committee regularly reviews its remuneration policy.
The committee received from its external advisors during the year, market data on the above remuneration elements including the performance in comparator groups.
36 TRA VIS PERKINS PLC Basic salary A directors basic salary is generally determined by the Remuneration Committee annually and when an individual changes role.
Salaries are normally reviewed in November each year, with increases taking effect from 1 January in the following year.
In the case of the three executive directors, with effect from 1 January 2006, their basic annual salaries and percentage increases are: J. P. Carter 315,000 5.0% G. I. Cooper 461,250 2.5% P. N. Hampden Smith 315,000 5.0% When awarding these salary increases, the committee considered the salary increases awarded to other managers and employees of the group.
Annual bonus payments At the beginning of the year, the committee establishes the targets that must be met in order for a bonus to be paid.
In the past, bonus payments for executive directors have generally been based on the level of net earnings per share achieved by the group.
However in 2005, after consultation with shareholders, the committee introduced a second bonus criterion, namely the extent to which the companys net debt was reduced.
This reflected the companys wish to reduce the debt incurred for the Wickes acquisition as quickly as possible.
Taking the two elements together, a cash bonus of 36 per cent of salary would have been payable on achievement of budget, with maximum cash bonus of 75 per cent of salary payable on achieving 103 per cent of budget in respect of earnings per share and an improvement over budget in net debt reduction of 37.5 million.
With the exception of a specific bonus paid to F. J. McKay, as previously reported, no bonuses are payable in respect of 2005.
For 2006, the committee is introducing a third bonus criterion namely, return on capital employed as a proxy for shareholder value.
The three criteria net earnings per share growth, net debt reduction and return on capital employed have an equal weighting.
The calibration of the criteria has been made more demanding in that a bonus of only 15 per cent of salary compared with 36 per cent in 2005 will be payable on achievement of budget, and maximum bonus will be payable on achieving 107.5 per cent of budget for earnings per share, 105 per cent of budget for return on capital employed, and an improvement over budget in average cleared net debt reduction of 16m.
Consistent with past policy, in addition to the cash bonus, an executive director may earn bonus payable under the Share Matching Scheme in deferred shares which only vest three years later of up to 35 per cent of the cash bonus.
This effectively means that for executive directors, the maximum annual bonus has a value of 101 per cent of salary.
Share incentive schemes The Committee believes, on the basis of external advice, that the schemes described below, including their current grant levels and performance conditions, are presently an appropriate means of motivating directors and senior executives.
However a fundalental review of all long term incentive arrangements is planned for 2006.
Share matching scheme In 2004, shareholders approved the introduction, for the most senior executives, of a Share Matching Scheme to complement the annual bonus scheme.
Under this scheme executives can be awarded shares in the company of a value up to 35 per cent of their annual cash bonus Deferred Shares.
These shares are to be held in trust for three years and generally will be forfeited if an executive leaves during this time.
This provides a retentive element to the annual bonus scheme and assists executives in building up a holding of shares in the company.
A key feature of the scheme is the award of shares in the company known as Matching Shares the vesting of which is subject to a three year earnings per share EPS performance condition.
Awards of Matching Shares are linked to the Deferred Shares and, in addition, executives have the opportunity to invest up to 35 per cent of annual salary in the companys shares, Investment Shares using the proceeds of their annual cash bonus.
The Matching Shares performance criteria, applying over the 3 year performance period approved by shareholders, is: for EPS growth of less than inflation plus 12 per cent, no Matching Shares vest: for EPS growth of inflation plus 12 per cent, one Matching Share vests for every three Deferred Investment Shares: 37 TRA VIS PERKINS PLC for EPS growth of inflation plus 24 per cent or higher, one Matching Share vests for every one Deferred Investment share: and straight line pro-rating applies between EPS growth of inflation plus 12 per cent and inflation plus 24 per cent.
However, for awards of Matching Shares made in 2005, and taking into account the acquisition of Wickes, the committee made the performance condition more demanding by requiring that the full one-to-one match would only be achieved for EPS growth of inflation plus 30 per cent over the three year performance period.
The committee currently regards the use of earnings per share as an appropriate performance measure for the share incentive schemes.
However, it has recognised the potential impact of changes in accounting standards and intends to adopt an approach whereby the basis used for measuring EPS growth for each performance period is static even if the method of measurement of earnings per share in the company accounts develops over the same period.
This will ensure consistency in the measurement of the performance of the business for the purposes of the share schemes.
There were no occasions during the year on which the Committee exercised its discretion to transfer shares to early leavers.
Share options For many years, the company has further motivated directors and senior executives through granting them share options.
The 2001 Executive Share Option Scheme, which covers all executive directors and other senior executives, provides for the grant of options on an annual basis, with a nominal value limit up to twice basic salary.
Options are not granted at a discount to the market value.
For options granted before 2005, for all eligible executives, options may only be exercised if the growth in the companys EPS exceeds inflation by at least 9 per cent over a three-year period.
In the case of executive directors and certain other senior executives, achievement of this target will allow only 50 per cent of options to be exercised.
For all options to be exercisable, EPS growth must exceed inflation by at least 15 per cent over the three-year period.
Between 9 per cent and 15 per cent the number of options exercisable is calculated on a straight-line basis.
For options which were granted to the executive directors and senior executives in 2005, the committee again imposed more demanding EPS targets so as to ensure that those targets remained challenging over the three-year performance period following the Wickes acquisition.
Twenty five per cent of those options may be exercised if the growth in the companys EPS exceeds inflation by at least 9 per cent over the performance period while exercise of the remainder of the options will only be possible if the EPS growth exceeds inflation by 21 per cent over the performance period.
Between 9 per cent and 21 per cent the number of options exercisable will be calculated on a straight-line basis.
The approach to measurement of EPS as a performance measure is described in the section above headed Share Matching Scheme.
The performance conditions for options granted between 2002 and 2003 may be retested for two years if they are not satisfied at the end of the original three-year period.
However, in 2004 the committee recognised that this provision was no longer in line with best practice and therefore options granted in 2004 and thereafter do not permit retesting of the performance conditions.
During the year the Committee exercised its discretion to allow exercise for early leavers in two cases.
In March 2005, the company issued shareholding guidelines to its most senior executives encouraging them to build up a shareholding in the company over a five-year period.
The target shareholding is 100 per cent of salary for the executive directors and 50 per cent of salary for the other executives.
While these guidelines are not mandatory, the committee has reserved the right to take into account an individuals position relative to the target, when making future awards under the executive share option scheme or the share matching scheme.
Pension arrangements The general policy has been for executive directors to be members of the companys final salary pension scheme and to accrue benefits at a rate of 1 30 of pensionable salary for each years pensionable service after appointment as a director.
In the case of John Carter and Paul Hampden Smith, the effective accrual rate is less than 1 30 due to their potential length of service up to retirement age, so that their pension does not exceed two thirds of pensionable salary.
38 TRA VIS PERKINS PLC Normal retirement age is 60.
As with all other members, executive directors dependants are eligible for dependants pensions and a payment of a lump sum in the event of death in service.
Except in the case of Frank McKay, who retired in 2005, the pension arrangements provide for a pension in retirement based on the directors length of service in the group pension scheme and the average of the best three of the last ten years of pensionable salary.
Frank McKay was guaranteed, on retirement at age 60, a pension of thirty per cent of his final pensionable salary including the pension from a previous employment.
This pension was funded partly by the group scheme and partly by separate funded and unfunded arrangements established for him.
In the event that a directors pension benefits are limited by the Inland Revenue earnings cap, the general policy is to pay an age related annual salary supplement.
Geoff Cooper and Paul Hampden Smith receive such a salary supplement.
From April 2006, an earnings cap will be applied only in respect of benefits based on service to that date.
For many years, bonus payments to executive directors and management formed a part of scheme members pensionable emoluments and both the company and the employee contributed a proportion of any such bonus to the scheme funds.
This has now been changed and, for pensionable service from 1 December 2004, pensionable salary for all members is basic salary only.
There have been no changes in the basis of directors pension entitlements during the year.
Except as described above for Frank McKay, there are no unfunded pension commitments or similar arrangements for directors.
During the year the committee considered the impact of changes in the taxation of pension arrangements at April 2006, which are expected to affect some senior executives in the company.
It has recognised that the company should not compensate such executives for any additional tax for which they would be liable under the new arrangements, but will make available at the members option, a cost neutral alternative to continued pension provision for members the value of whose benefits are at least 80% of the Lifetime Allowance.
The alternative benefit will be a salary supplement calculated with regard to the cost the company would have incurred in providing continuing pension accrual.
This supplement will not be taken into account for the purposes of bonuses or other benefits.
During the year, the board also carried out a general review of pension arrangements.
As a result of this review, the final salary scheme closed to all new entrants other than those in the waiting period for entry, on 1 February 2006.
In future, all employees, including directors and other senior executives, will be invited to join the money purchase scheme which was established in 2003.
A number of other changes will be made to the final salary scheme in April 2006 to better manage cost and risk and to take advantage of the greater flexibility offered by recent legislation to make the scheme more attractive to members.
Service contracts The companys policy for executive directors is to have contracts which are not for a fixed period, and which are terminable on twelve months notice from the company, and six months from the director.
It is not the policy to specify what compensation would be payable on termination by the company.
If such compensation was due, it would be calculated by reference to the unexpired part of the notice period, and the directors salary and other benefits, including pension rights, taking due account of the directors duty to mitigate his loss.
Service contracts do not specify any particular level of compensation in the event of termination following change of control of the company.
Each of the executive directors has a service contract, the date of which is shown below, which will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
John Carter 6 August 2001 Geoff Cooper 1 February 2005 Paul Hampden Smith 8 October 1996 39 TRA VIS PERKINS PLC Non-executive directors The policy of the board is to recruit non-executive directors of the highest calibre, with a breadth of skills and experience appropriate for the companys business.
Non-executive directors are appointed for a period of three years, at the end of which the appointment may be renewed by mutual agreement.
It is the boards policy that non-executive directors should serve for six years two three year terms and that any term beyond this should be subject to a rigorous review.
This review would take into account both the need for progressive refreshing of the board, and the particular requirements of the company at the time of the possible extension.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the board.
Each non-executive director receives an annual fee.
In addition Michael Dearden and Chris Bunker receive an additional fee for the role of senior independent director and for chairing the Audit Committee, respectively.
Ted Adams, who retired on 31 December 2005, receives an additional fee for chairing the companys pension trusts.
Non-executive directors do not receive any other benefits and are not eligible to join a company pension scheme.
No compensation is payable on termination of their employment, which may be without notice from the company.
They cannot participate in any of the companys share option schemes.
Non-executive directors do not have a service contract, but each has received a letter of appointment expiring on the following dates: Michael Dearden November 2006 John Coleman February 2008 Chris Bunker January 2007 Andrew Simon February 2009 Tim Stevenson September 2007 Travis Perkins total shareholder return Total shareholder return The company considers 300 itself distinctive in its sector, as there are no directly 250 comparable competitors in terms of size, demographic spread or activities.
