These awards were granted in the years 2001 to 2005, and include mandatory bonus deferrals.
For mandatory bonus deferrals under ESAS, the size of any award under ESAS is subject to the same Group and individual performance criteria as the annual cash bonus.
Normally, the trustees will permit the executive to call for the shares from the end of the third year from grant of an award by granting a right to acquire shares a nil cost option exercisable for two years.
As this nil cost option is part of the structure of an ESAS award described above, which is a deferred share award plan, it would not be appropriate to attach a performance condition to the exercise of options.
If the right is not exercised, the trustees, will normally at the end of the fifth year, release all of the shares, including bonus shares equal to 30% of the basic award.
If the right is exercised, an executive may lose the opportunity of receiving one-third of the bonus shares.
The number of shares shown in the table includes the bonus shares where applicable.
b The trustees may release additional shares to participants which represent accumulated net dividends in respect of shares under award.
During 2005, the trustees released the following accumulated dividend shares 6,074 to John Varley, 17,515 to Robert E Diamond Jr, 3,038 to Gary Hoffman, 2,081 to David Roberts and 27,780 to Roger Davis.
These are not awarded as part of the original award and consequently are not included in the Released column.
c The trustees may release additional shares to participants which represent accumulated net dividends in respect of the shares under award.
During 2005, the trustees released 8,167 accumulated dividend shares to Matthew W Barrett.
These are not included as part of the original award and consequently are not included in the Exercised column.
d The number shown in the column headed Number at 1st January 2005 includes shares held by Robert E Diamond Jr which reflect interests built up over the course of successive years service with Barclays.
The awards were related to Mr Diamonds contribution to the performance of Barclays Capital, BGI and the Barclays Group.
The number shown is at 1st June 2005, when he was appointed to the Board.
e The shares under option shown in this column are already included in the numbers shown at 1st January 2005 and relate to provisional allocations made in 2001 and 2002 except that the figures do not include accumulated dividend shares under option as follows: 5,459 shares for John Varley, 40,501 for Robert E Diamond Jr, 3,428 for Gary Hoffman, 29,466 for Naguib Kheraj, 3,005 for David Roberts and 9,367 for Roger Davis.
Under ESAS, a participant pays 1 to exercise an option, irrespective of the number of shares involved.
f The shares under option in this column are not included in the numbers shown at 1st January 2005.
Voluntary ESAS is an additional award under ESAS following a Director requesting that part of the cash bonus to which he would otherwise become entitled to be waived and is granted as a right to acquire shares which will be fully exercisable after five years.
g Awards in respect of 2005 will be made in April 2006.
Including a maximum potential 30% bonus shares, the awards will total 601,250 to John Varley, 3,250,000 to Robert E Diamond Jr, 243,750 to Gary Hoffman, 357,500 to Naguib Kheraj and 357,500 to David Roberts.

The shares are scheduled for release in June 2008, to the extent that the relative TSR performance condition is achieved.
Dividend shares will also be provided on the vested shares only.
b The price used to convert the present fair value of the award to a number of shares was 5.28.
This was an average over the period 8th June 2005 to 15th June 2005. c The price shown is the mid-market closing price on the date of the award.
d The details of the performance conditions for PSP are included earlier in the Remuneration Report.

It is intended to maintain close alignment of reward with Mr Diamonds continued contributiontothe performance of Barclays Capital.
The performance measure is the cumulative Economic Profit EP performance of Barclays Capital during the period 1st January 2005 to 31st December 2007.
To achieve the maximum potential value shown above, Barclays Capital would need to generate cumulative EP of 2bn over the performance period.
If EP for the performance period is less than 500m, Mr Diamond will not be eligible for any award.
If the minimum performance requirement of 500m EP is met, the potential value of the award would be in a range of 0.65m to 1.08m.
The potential value of the Retained Incentive Opportunity between 500m cumulative EP and 2bn cumulative EP is subject to a performance curve graduated to deliver higher proportionate value at higher levels of cumulative EP.
Mr Diamond must normally be in the employment of the Barclays Group on the vesting date, to remain eligible.
In determining the potential value of the Retained Incentive Opportunity, the HR and Remuneration Committee will take into account Mr Diamonds individual contribution during the performance period, and the underlying financial health of the Barclays Group.
The amount and basis for determining any entitlement under the Retained Incentive Opportunity will not be altered to the advantage of Mr Diamond without prior approval of shareholders in general meeting.
b Under the Retained Incentive Opportunity, 50% of any potential award would be payable in cash on the vesting date.
A recommendation would be made to the trustee of the ESAS for an award of Barclays shares, deferred for 12 months in the form of a provisional allocation, in respect of the remaining 50%.
The value under the Retained Incentive Opportunity is not pensionable.

The performance target for the 1999 ESOS grant was met.
b Under the ISOP, executives were awarded options at market value over Barclays PLC ordinary shares which are normally exercisable after three years.
The number of shares over which options can be exercised depends upon performance against specific targets.
For ISOP awards granted in 2000 to 2003, the first 40,000 target shares under option for each award was subject to an Economic Profit metric.
Any amount above 40,000 target shares was subject to a relative TSR metric.
Awards in 2004 were subject to a relative TSR metric.
c Robert E Diamond Jr received a grant under the BGI EOP in March 2004.
He was not a Director of Barclays PLC at that time.
The EOP is an option plan, approved by shareholders in 2000.
Under the plan, participants receive an option to purchase shares in Barclays Global Investors UK Holdings Limited.
The exercise price is based on the fair value at the time of grant.
The option normally vests in three equal tranches on the first, second, and third anniversary of the date of grant.
Participants are required to retain their shares for 355 days after the date of exercise, before they may be offered for sale.
d The register of Directors interests, which shows full details of Directors current share awards and options, is available for public inspection at the Groups head office in London.
e No options were granted under these plans during 2005. f The independent trustee of the Barclays Group ESOS employees benefit trust granted Matthew W Barrett a share award in 1999 comprising of an option on similar terms to options granted under ESOS.
For convenience these are described as granted under ESOS in the above table.
g The number of shares shown represent the target award shares under option, or the actual number of shares under option if the award has vested.
The target number of shares takes account of the stretch in the performance condition and the probability of vesting.
