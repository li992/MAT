10 Chairman and Non-Executive Directors 11 The Combined Code 12 Shareholding guideline 13 Directors interests 1 Role and membership of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee decides both the level and structure of Executive Directors pay and the remuneration of the Chairman.
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is a matter reserved for the Chairman and the Executive Directors and no Director is involved in setting their own remuneration.
2 Terms of reference The Remuneration Committee is a Board committee consisting exclusively of independent Non-Executive Directors: Peter Wilson Chairman, Michel Brossard, Bernard Dufau and Andrew Robb.
It has written terms of reference from the Board, which currently specify the major duties to be as follows: To make recommendations to the Board, within these terms of reference, on the Companys framework of executive remuneration and its cost, its aim being to demonstrate that executive remuneration is set objectively and that Executive Directors are fairly rewarded.
To determine, on behalf of the Board, specific remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors, following the process described below, together with conditions of employment including pension rights, contracts of employment and any compensation package in the event of the early termination of a contract.
To monitor the remuneration of senior executives below main Board level so that it can be sensitive to the wider scene especially when determining annual salary increases for main Board Executive Directors.
To establish incentive schemes for Executive Directors, set performance criteria and monitor their performance.
Pay decisions are made on the advice of or proposals prepared by the Chairman, the Group Chief Executive and the Company Secretary who are invited to attend meetings of the Committee as and when appropriate.
In addition, in making its decisions, the Committee has had access to the relevant external advisers appointed by the Remuneration Committee and the Company.
The Committee has sought advice in the past 12 months from Towers Perrin in connection with the benchmarking of executive remuneration.
The Committee has also used KPMG, Ernst and Young and Michael Maher, an experienced HR professional, to assist in the design and implementation of the Long-Term Incentive Plan and All-Employee Share Scheme.
3 Remuneration policy and description of Kesa pay elements Kesas businesses are well positioned to achieve sustained growth.
The key element to achieving this is the move towards a more performance-oriented culture with a clear link between remuneration and performance.
The five core principles on which the remuneration structure is founded are as follows: 1 Base pay levels are established on a market competitive basis on the basis of mid-market practice amongst UK and European companies of comparable size.
2 Benefits for example pensions are provided on a basis that is appropriate to the local market in which the employee is employed.
3 Performance-related incentives provide the opportunity to deliver substantial rewards for high performance.
4 Wherever reasonable, total remuneration is aligned to shareholders interests.
This is reflected in the choice of performance standards targeted at upper-quartile levels to produce a highly leveraged package if our growth objectives are attained.
32 Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2004 05 5 Encourage wider share ownership amongst all Kesa employees, by offering all employees the opportunity to purchase shares via tax effective vehicles, and by creating a Long-Term Incentive Plan, which reflects the Anglo-French nature of the Company and is available to all senior managers.
The Demerger Award Plan was implemented in July 2003 to act as a retention tool for Kesa executives together with recompense for options granted in October 2002 that had lapsed and their non-inclusion in the regular Kingfisher option grant which took place in April 2003.
The first awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in May 2004 will be made in early April 2005.
4 Performance linkages Each element in the reward package is designed to support the achievement of different corporate objectives.
In fair value terms, the proportion of total pay excluding pensions and benefits, which is variable, is equal to approximately 40 per cent.
We believe that linking incentives to profit growth helps to reinforce our growth objectives and is an appropriate measure for a predominantly retail business.
The pay elements are further explained below: a Base salary To ascertain the jobs market value, external remuneration consultants annually review and provide data about market salary levels and advise the Remuneration Committee accordingly.
These market rates are based on peer-group data and derived from the pay position described above.
Before making a final decision on individual salary awards, the Committee assesses each Directors contribution to the business to reflect individual performance.
b Annual bonus To reward annual performance, the Chief Executive is eligible for an annual incentive with a target of up to 60 per cent of base salary and a maximum of 80 per cent of salary for substantially exceeding targets.
Other Executive Directors are eligible for an annual incentive with a target of up to 50 per cent of base salary and a maximum of 60 per cent of salary for substantially exceeding targets.
If minimum targets are not met there is no bonus.
Directors and senior managers receive 50 per cent of their bonus in Kesa shares and 50 per cent in cash.
The Company then makes a matching award on a ratio of 1:1 on the gross value of the shares received as a bonus.
The release of both the invested and the matching shares is deferred for four years, and if an executive resigns during the four-year period he will forfeit the right to the matching shares.
The target bonus for the Chief Executive is currently awarded for achieving budgeted profit after interest and for the other Executive Director the target bonus is based on achieving a combination of profit after tax and cash generation.
c Pensions and other benefits Pensions are offered in line with local competitive practice.
The retirement age for directors in France is 60.
Senior employees have the benefit of le plan fide retraite complementaire Kesa Internationale which is a defined benefit scheme and provides life insurance of 4.25 times annual basic salary including travel allowance.
Pensionable salary is the annual gross remuneration received over the three preceding years, excluding profit-sharing plans, any termination payments and any exceptional compensation.
The retirement age for directors in the UK is 60 under arrangements which broadly provide a pension of two-thirds of final salary subject to Inland Revenue limits, life assurance at four times salary and ill health and dependents pensions.
Incentive payments such as annual bonuses are not pensionable.
To the extent that the salary of an Executive Director exceeds the permitted maximum the earnings cap, a supplement of 13 per cent of the excess over the earnings cap is paid to the executive as a pension supplement.
Further details are provided under the disclosure of the arrangements for each Director.
Cars or a car allowance are provided on a basis that is consistent with competitive practice.
Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2004 05 33 Report on Directors remuneration and related matters d Share incentives At present the Company has two share award plans.
The Demerger Award Plan was designed to ensure executives interests were aligned with those of shareholders, and to reflect the lost opportunity to participate in the 2002 and 2003 Kingfisher Option Awards.
In addition, executives would face a financial penalty if they left the Company in the threeyear period following the demerger.
The Company Long-Term Incentive Plan was approved at the Annual General Meeting in May 2004 and consists of two elements.
The first element is the grant of a matching award of shares on a ratio of 1:1 based on the gross value of the shares received as part of the annual bonus for up to 140 senior executives.
The number of matching shares that vest will depend on Kesas total shareholder return TSR performance compared to the TSR performance of the companies in the FTSE 250 measured over the four-year period from grant.
TSR is a measure of performance based on share price and dividends.
If Kesas TSR performance is at the middle point of the FTSE 250 then 25 per cent of the matching shares will vest.
For 100 per cent of the matching shares to vest, Kesas TSR performance must be in the top quarter of the companies in the FTSE 250, and there is a sliding scale between this and the mid-point.
The second element is a Performance Share Plan PSP, which applies up to a maximum of 40 senior employees.
There is a base award equal to 30 per cent of the eligible executives basic salary, and the award would normally be made irrespectively of any achievement of Group or operating company bonus targets or overall Group financial performance.
The PSP is intended to both build a shareholding and reward individual performance as opposed to corporate performance.
An eligible executive may also receive up to a further 20 per cent based on each individuals personal performance and contribution to the Group rather than on any specific financial metrics.
All awards made under the PSP are subject to the same TSR performance hurdle as that applying to the vesting of the matching shares under the bonus scheme set out above.
It is also the Companys intention to formally launch the All-Employee Scheme as approved at the last Annual General Meeting in the early summer months of 2005. e Service contracts The Boards policy is to limit service contracts of Executive Directors to one-year rolling terms.
In the event of termination of the Directors contract, any compensation payment is calculated in accordance with normal legal principles, including the application of mitigation to the extent which is appropriate to the circumstances of the case and local legislation.
5 Performance graph illustrating Kesas performance against the FTSE 250 The following performance graph shows the Total Shareholder Return TSR for Kesa versus the FTSE 250 for the period 13 July 2003 being the date of demerger and 31 January 2005.
The Committee believes that the FTSE 250 is the most objective comparator group for measuring the Companys Total Shareholder Return and provides a transparent and accessible method of gauging performance.

CEO 150 per cent of base salary Other Executive Directors 100 per cent of base salary Executive committee members 50 per cent of base salary 13 Directors interests The beneficial interests of the Directors, which includes holdings by their spouses or other related parties, together with non-beneficial interests in the ordinary shares of the Company are shown below.
