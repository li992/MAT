Keki Dadiseth was appointed as a director of Prudential plc with effect from 1 April 2005, and as a member of the Audit Committee with effect from 5 May 2005.
In accordance with an agreement that the Company entered into with Keki Dadiseth, he did not retain his directors fee for his first two months of his appointment: instead his fee was paid to Unilever PLC, where he served as an executive director until May 2005.
For those first two months, no portion of the fees which were paid to Unilever in lieu of payment to him was applied to the purchase of shares in the Company.
With effect from June 2005, Prudential paid non-executive director fees to Keki Dadiseth, and a portion of those fees were used to purchase shares in the Company, as is the practice for all of Prudential's non-executive directors.
In addition the Company pays an allowance of 10,391 per annum to Keki Dadiseth in respect of his accommodation expenses in London whilst on the Company's business, in lieu of reimbursing hotel costs, as is the usual practice for directors who are not resident in the UK.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed each executive directors individual contribution and the continuing strong operating performance of the Group in 2005 against the 2005 business plans and was satisfied that the bonus payments made for the year are fully justified.
Executive directors non-executive director earnings Executive directors who are released to serve as non-executive directors of other external companies retain the earnings resulting from such duties.

52 Prudential plc Annual Report 2005 Directors outstanding long-term incentive awards The section below sets out the outstanding awards under the Restricted Share Plan and the additional long-term plans for the executive directors who run specific businesses.
The 2004 RSP awards had the same performance conditions.
For RSP awards prior to 2004, no rights are granted if the Companys TSR performance as ranked against the comparator group is at the 60th percentile or below.
The maximum grant is made only if the TSR ranking of the Company is 20th percentile or above.
Between these points, the size of the grant made is calculated on a straight-line sliding scale basis.
In normal circumstances, directors may take up their right to receive shares at any time during the following seven years.
The awards made in respect of 2004 and 2005 under the RSP run to 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2007 respectively.
As at 31 December 2005, TSR performance under these plans was ranked respectively at percentile positions 70 and 47 on the basis of TSR performance.
In determining the 2005 conditional awards the shares were valued at their average share price during the preceding calendar year, and the price used to determine the number of shares was 437.2 pence 2004: 398.3 pence.
For the awards made in 2002 under the RSP, the Companys TSR was ranked at 89th percentile at the end of the three-year performance period on 31 December 2004 and as a result the 2002 awards lapsed.
For the 2003 and 2004 conditional RSP awards to Jonathan Bloomer, the ranking of the Companys TSR in the month prior to his leaving date was 72nd and 65th respectively and as a consequence the awards lapsed.

For the 2005 conditional RSP award to Jonathan Bloomer, the ranking of the Companys TSR in the month prior to his leaving date was 14th and as a result 11.11 per cent of his award was released.
This percentage takes into account pro-rating for his service during the three-year performance period.
For the 2003 conditional RSP award the ranking of the Companys TSR at the end of the three-year performance period ending on 31 December 2005 was 71st and as a result no release will be made from this award.
For the 2003 conditional RSP award to Mark Wood, the ranking of the Companys TSR in the month prior to his date of resignation of his directorship was 67th percentile and as a result no release will be made from this award.
For the 2004 conditional RSP award to Mark Wood, the ranking of the Companys TSR in the month prior to his date of resignation of his directorship was 61st percentile and as a result no release will be made from this award.
For the 2005 conditional RSP award to Mark Wood, the ranking of the Companys TSR in the month prior to his date of resignation of his directorship was 27th percentile and as a result, subject to non-competition and non-solicitation conditions, 27.5 per cent of his award will be released.

Directors pensions and life assurance It is the Companys policy to offer executive directors the facility to save for retirement through efficient pension vehicles and UK executive directors are offered a combination of HM Revenue and Customs approved pension schemes and supplementary provision.
Changes to UK pensions regulations take effect from April 2006 A-Day.
Executive directors will not be compensated for the effects of any change in their taxation position as a result of these changes.
The Company has reviewed its policy and for future executive director appointments its policy will be a simple salary supplement for executive directors of 25 per cent of salary.
This would include, where relevant, any company contributions to the staff defined contribution pension plan, which directors would be eligible to join.
For defined benefit schemes, the policy will be to retain a notional scheme earnings cap, replicating the HM Revenue and Customs earnings cap, which will no longer exist after A-Day.
The effect of this will be to maintain the current policy for pension provision for executive directors who are currently eligible for defined benefit arrangements.
The description below applies to both 2005 and 2006, with the exception that, after A-Day, where the HM Revenue and Customs earnings cap is referred to, this will mean the notional scheme earnings cap and the Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme FURBS is being discontinued.
UK HM Revenue and Customs approved pension schemes Executive directors employed in the UK are eligible to participate in HM Revenue and Customs approved pension schemes on the same basis as other employees who joined at that time, providing benefits based on basic salary up to the HM Revenue and Customs earnings cap.
The schemes include defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements.
Philip Broadley participates in a non-contributory scheme that provides a pension of one-sixtieth of Final Pensionable Earnings for each year of service on retirement at age 60, as did Mark Wood.
Michael McLintock participates in a contributory scheme that provides a target pension of two-thirds of Final Pensionable Earnings on retirement at age 60 for an employee with 30 years or more potential service, for which his contribution is four per cent of basic salary.
Jonathan Bloomer was only eligible to receive a lump sum death benefit of four times basic salary up to the earnings cap from the pension scheme.
On death in service a total sum from all these schemes of four times pensionable salary plus spouses and childrens pensions are payable.
No employees with employment offers after 30 June 2003 were eligible for membership of the defined benefit schemes.
Other supplementary arrangements Sir David Clementi is provided with a salary supplement, part of which is a contribution to a personal pension, and life assurance of four times his annual fees.
Mark Tucker is provided with a salary supplement only.
Philip Broadley and Michael McLintock are entitled to supplements based on the portion of their basic salary not covered for pension benefits under an HM Revenue and Customs approved scheme, as were Jonathan Bloomer and Mark Wood.
These supplements are paid directly to them, or to a FURBS established in their name up to A-Day.
They are provided with life assurance cover related to salary over the HM Revenue and Customs earnings cap.
The cover is broadly equivalent to the death in service benefits provided under the relevant UK HM Revenue and Customs approved pension scheme.
Clark Manning participates in a US tax-qualified defined contribution plan a 401k plan.
He is also provided with life assurance cover of two times basic salary.
56 Prudential plc Annual Report 2005 Mark Norbom is provided with a salary supplement for pension purposes, and life assurance provision of four times his basic salary.
From 1 January 2006, Nick Prettejohn is provided with pension benefits the same as those described above in the policy to apply after A-Day.
