Directors remuneration report for the year to 31 December 2005 The Directors remuneration report sets out the Companys policy on the remuneration of executive and non-executive directors together with details of directors remuneration packages and service contracts.
The Remuneration Committee, which met three times during the year, is responsible for recommending to the Board the Companys general policy on remuneration and in particular to determine the remuneration packages of the Chairman and the executive directors, and the grant of all options and awards of shares.
The members of the Committee are appointed by the Board and the membership of the Committee is reviewed at least annually.
The Chairman of the Committee is appointed by the Board and cannot be the Chairman of the Board.
The Chief Executive is given notice of all meetings and, at the request of the Chairman of the Committee, attends the meetings.
The Chief Executive may request that he attends and speaks at Committee meetings.
In normal circumstances, the Chief Executive will be consulted on general policy matters and matters concerning the other executive directors and employees.
The written Terms of Reference are available on the Companys website and from the Company on request.
They will also be on display at the Annual General Meeting.
The Remuneration Committee, chaired by Mr A J Reading, comprises the Chairman, Mr N J Keen, and Mr A J Reading, Mr J B McDowall, Sir Geoffrey Owen, Mr A M Robb and Dr W R Spivey, all independent non-executive directors.
Mr D Morton was a member of the Committee until his retirement on 13 May 2005 and Mr McDowall chaired the Committee until 13 May 2005 when he became the senior independent non-executive director.
Mr Keen is a member of the Committee because the Board considers it essential that the Chairman be involved in setting remuneration policy.
Mr D J L Hudson, the Company Secretary, acts as Secretary to the Committee.
The Board, as a whole, is responsible for setting the remuneration of the non-executive directors.
The Remuneration Committee has during the past year retained Watson Wyatt Limited and New Bridge Street Consultants LLP to provide independent external professional advice.
Watson Wyatt Limited also provide pension actuarial services to The Laird Group and to the Trustees of two of The Laird Group pension schemes.
The Remuneration Committee has also sought the views of the Chief Executive, Mr P J Hill, during the year.
Remuneration Policy The Remuneration Committee has established a policy on the remuneration of executive directors and the Board has established a policy for the non-executive directors.
Executive Directors The current policy for providing remuneration for the executive directors is to have an incentive driven remuneration package which promotes the alignment of interests of executive directors and shareholders.
That policy is based upon the following principles: the need to link remuneration to achieving strategic objectives and to sustainable long-term corporate success: the reward opportunity offered to executive directors should be sufficiently competitive to recruit and retain management of the appropriate calibre and experience: and the need to provide a total compensation package which reflects the international complexity of the Groups operations.
The executive directors receive base salary, annual performance awards up to a maximum percentage of base salary, pensions and other benefits, and long term performance awards.
Base salaries, benefits and performance awards of the executive directors are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee.
Base salaries are determined with reference to an appropriate comparator group of companies which is reviewed annually.
Benefits comprise the provision of a car or car allowance, life, disability and health insurance, participation in the annual performance scheme and membership of a pension scheme.
Neither performance incentive awards nor benefits in kind are pensionable.
Performance linked incentives are a key component of the total remuneration package and, in 2003, the Remuneration Committee proposed a new framework for share incentive awards, encompassing new executive share option plans and a Long Term Incentive Plan, which was approved by shareholders at the 2003 Annual General Meeting.
A summary of these arrangements is set out below.
Service Agreements Each of the executive directors has a service agreement.
Messrs Drabble, Hill and Silvers service agreements are dated 8 March 2004.
Mr Rapps service agreement is dated 31 December 2004.
In line with the Companys policy, the executive directors service agreements are not for a fixed term and provide for twelve months written notice of termination from either party.
Mr Rapps service agreement is with Laird Technologies, Inc. and he has a separate letter also dated 31 December 2004 from the Company in respect of his appointment as an executive director.
This appointment is for an initial period of three years but is subject to the termination provisions in his service agreement.
The terms of employment for executive directors in the UK currently terminate automatically at the executives Normal Retirement Date of age sixty.
The Companys policy on termination is to comply with the contractual terms and conditions set out in the service agreement.
The Company may, at its election, make a payment in lieu of notice.
The payment would be calculated as the total of the directors basic salary plus the value of his benefits, in each case by reference to the period of the unexpired notice of termination.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts but their appointments are subject to review every three years and the rotation provisions of the Companys Articles of Association.
26 The Laird Group PLC Shareholding Guidelines Shareholding guidelines, under which executive directors will be expected to retain as shares all of the after-tax profit on the gains made on the vesting of Long Term Incentive Plan awards and the exercise of existing or future executive share options, until they have acquired a shareholding equal in value to their basic salaries, were introduced in 2003.
Non-Executive Directors The Laird Groups policy is to establish and maintain a body of non-executive directors with a breadth of international skills and experience that is relevant to The Laird Groups global businesses.
In this context, it is the Boards policy for the non-executive directors to be paid a level of fee that reflects market conditions and is sufficient to attract individuals with appropriate knowledge and experience.

Mr Drabble was a non-executive director of Ashtead Group plc for part of the year and he is entitled to retain the non-executive director fees of 17,436 paid in addition to the above.
Annual Performance Incentive Awards The awards in 2005 for the executive directors were determined by the Remuneration Committee.
For the UK executive directors, up to a maximum of 75% of base salary could be earned and for Mr Rapp the maximum was 100%.
The level of the award for 2005 took account of the improvement in financial performance and the achievement of specific financial targets in relation to profit and cash generation and measurable progress in meeting defined key strategic objectives of the Group and its divisions.
Pensions M L Rapp, who is based in the USA, is a member of an employee managed defined contribution program to which Laird Technologies, Inc. makes a 50% match of the members contributions up to 6% of gross earnings.
The amount paid in by the company in 2005 was 3,850.
G Drabble, P J Hill and J C Silver are members of a UK Group contributory defined benefits plan, which is supplemented, where necessary, by unfunded arrangements to maintain the same level of benefits as if the earnings cap did not apply.
The main benefits are: on retirement at age sixty, a maximum pension of two thirds final salary excluding bonuses and other benefits, dependent on service: on death in retirement, a dependants pension of 60% of the members pension: on death in service, a lump sum of four times salary and a dependants pension of 20% of salary or 60% of the members expected pension, if higher.
The changes to the tax regime applying to UK pension schemes as a result of the Finance Act 2004, which are due to take effect from 6 April 2006, are being reviewed.
Pensions in payment increase by the lesser of the increase in the retail price index or 8.5% per annum compound.

Executives are eligible for annual awards of shares.
The maximum annual award value under the Plan is one times basic salary.
In setting the level of awards the Remuneration Committee takes into account options granted to executives under the 2003 executive share option plans in the same financial year.
The extent to which awards granted under the Plan in 2005 vest will be determined by reference to the Companys total shareholder return relative to FTSE 250 companies excluding investment trusts and the following targets will apply: Total Shareholder Return Amount of Award Vesting Performance Level % Upper Quartile Full vesting Median to Upper Quartile Pro rata between 30% and full vesting Below Median Nil These performance conditions will be measured only over a single three year period.
There is no provision for retesting.
In addition, no awards will vest unless the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the Companys underlying financial performance.
The Long Term Incentive Plan may use either market purchased shares or new issue shares, provided that any new shares issued will count against the overall dilution limit.
Awards under the plan in 2003, 2004 and 2005 took the form of nil cost options to be satisfied by market purchased shares from the ESOP.
Further details on the ESOP are on page 31.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account during the year in respect of the Long Term Incentive Plan granted to the directors was 0.5m.
The directors interests in the Long Term Incentive Plan are as follows: Granted Vested 1.1.

Share Options The executive directors have outstanding options under the 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme and the 2003 Executive Share Option Plan No.
The 1994 scheme was replaced by new share option schemes approved by shareholders at the 2003 Annual General Meeting.
Since May 2001 the basis for calculation of the maximum grant of options to executive directors and other employees is the equivalent of shares with a market value at the time of grant of up to one times salary in any one year and up to two times salary in special circumstances, such as the recruitment or promotion to a key management position.
Following the move to annual awards in 2003, the date on which awards are made was harmonised to bring the timing more into line with the Companys financial year.
The performance criteria used since 2003 has been to measure the increase in earnings per share against the rate of UK retail price inflation plus a specified percentage per annum over a fixed three year period.
The Committee considers that growth in earnings per share is an appropriate performance target as it is a good guide to the underlying financial performance of The Laird Group.
The rules of the 2003 plan permit the waiver of performance criteria in certain limited circumstances, such as a change of control, death or retirement.
1994 Share Option Scheme The 1994 scheme granted options over new shares to be issued at the time of exercise and also over existing shares.
The exercise of options under the 1994 scheme is dependent upon the attainment of performance criteria set by the Remuneration Committee.
The scheme permitted the grant of both approved and unapproved options.
Options were granted at the middle market price on the last dealing day prior to grant and are exercisable after three years but not more than ten years from the date of grant.
28 The Laird Group PLC The performance criteria set by the Remuneration Committee for grants made in 2002, the last year in which options were granted under this Scheme, is that the increase in earnings per share must not be less than the increase in the rate of United Kingdom Retail Price Inflation plus an average of 3% per annum over a three year period.
The Committee considered that the performance criteria had been met and that there had been a significant and sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company.
The 2003 Executive Share Option Plans There are two plans which were approved by shareholders in 2003.
One plan permits the grant of options approved by Her Majestys Revenue and Customs to be made to individuals who may be eligible for capital gains tax relief on the exercise of options: otherwise both plans are identical in all material respects.
The value of shares under options granted to an executive in any financial year will be limited, as under the previous 1994 scheme, to one times basic salary, unless there are exceptional circumstances e. g. a high level recruitment, in which case the limit will be twice basic salary.
When granting options, the Remuneration Committee will take into account both the level of awards made to executives under the new Long Term Incentive Plan and the prevailing share price.
The performance conditions under the plans are based on the Companys earnings per share growth adjusted to exclude items which do not reflect the Companys underlying financial performance.
The following targets applied for options granted in 2005 and the earnings per share growth is measured from a base point of 25.9p.
Tier of Option Grant Applicable Performance Target: Average Annual growth in earnings per share in excess of inflation Up to 0.5 x salary UK RPI 3% per annum 0.5 x salary 1 x salary and above UK RPI 3% to 5% per annum applied pro rata to the multiple of salary The performance conditions will be measured over a three year period.
To the extent that the performance conditions have not been met after three years, the options will lapse.
In order to allow for the grant of options to employees who are not executive directors, there is an overall dilution limit of 10% of the ordinary share capital in issue from time to time for allocations in respect of newly issued shares over a ten year period under these plans and all other share schemes operated by the Company.
The directors interests in options under the 1994 executive share option scheme in respect of new shares to be issued are shown in the table below: Granted Exercised Lapsed 1.1.
