22 Report on Directors remuneration Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with The Directors Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations.
The auditors are required to report on the auditable part of this report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
The report is therefore divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
The Board have reviewed the Group's compliance with the Combined Code the Code on remuneration related matters.
It is the opinion of the Board that the Group complied with all remuneration related aspects of the Code during the year.
Change to executive remuneration policy for 2005 2006 The Remuneration Committee carried out a comprehensive review of its executive compensation arrangements with its retained consultants, Halliwell Consulting.
This occurred at the end of the financial year 2004 2005 in line with its commitment to shareholders to review continually on an annual basis the appropriateness of its policy.
The Remuneration Committee, while noting that there was no obligation by the Company to consult with shareholders on the proposals arising from the review, endorses current corporate governance best practice and therefore chose to consult with shareholders in advance on the proposals.
This consultation was extensive involving the Companys major shareholders at that time and the main shareholder representative bodies the ABI and NAPF.
The Remuneration Committee discussed all elements of the new Policy with shareholders including: the constituents of the new Comparator Group: salaries for the Executive Directors for 2005 2006: the annual bonus potential and structure for 2005 2006: Company pension contributions: and share grants for 2005 2006 and performance conditions.
In light of the Remuneration Committees desire to have full shareholder support for a new Executive remuneration policy for 2005 2006 a number of amendments to the original proposals were made to address shareholders views coming out of the consultation process.
On completion of the review and consultation process the Remuneration Committee would like to thank shareholders who took part in the process and is pleased that the new policy has their support.
Unaudited information This part of the Remuneration Committee Report has been split into two sections as a result of the review of the Executive remuneration policy and the resulting introduction of a new policy for 2005 2006: 2004 2005 the policy that applied during the year reported on in these Report & Accounts: and 2005 2006 the policy that will apply for this and future financial years, subject to the Remuneration Committees commitment to shareholders to review continually its appropriateness.
Remuneration Committee Your Board believes that a properly constituted Remuneration Committee is key to ensuring that the Company's policy on Executive Directors' remuneration supports the creation of enhanced shareholder value.
The Board has therefore delegated to the Board's Remuneration Committee the assessment and recommendation of a broad policy on executive remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee of the Board comprises Fritz Ternofsky Chairman, Mike Foster and Martin Glenn, all of whom are independent Non-executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee members have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee determines the remuneration and benefits packages for Executive Directors and any changes to their service contracts, as well as the remuneration of Senior Group Executives.
The Committee also approves any share incentive and performance bonus arrangements.
The Remuneration Committee has formal written terms of reference, a copy of which is available from the Company Secretary or from the Companys website.
The full remit of the Committee role is described below: the Committee has been delegated responsibility by the Board to determine and agree with the Board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of the Executive Directors and Senior Group Executives of the Company: the remuneration of Nonexecutive Directors is a matter for the Executive members of the Board who take advice from the independent consultants.
No Director or Executive is involved in any decisions as to their own remuneration: within the terms of the agreed policy, determine the total individual remuneration package of each Executive Director including, where appropriate, bonuses, benefits, long-term incentive payments and share options: determine the policy for and scope of pension arrangements for each Executive Director: determine targets for any performance-related pay and share schemes operated by the Company: in determining such packages and arrangements, give due regard to the comments and recommendations of the Code as well as the UK Listing Authoritys Listing Rules and associated guidance: ensure that contractual terms on termination, and any payments made, are fair to the individual and the Company, that failure is not rewarded and that the duty to mitigate loss is fully recognised, in line with the statement of best practice in the ABI Guidelines: ensure that provisions regarding disclosure of remuneration, including pensions, as set out in the Regulations and the Code, are fulfilled: be aware of and advise on any major changes in employee benefit structures throughout the Company or Group: www.
com 23 be exclusively responsible for establishing the selection criteria, selecting, appointing and setting the terms of reference for any remuneration consultants who advise the Committee: meet as required during the year, at least twice a year: and report the frequency of, and attendance by members at, Remuneration Committee meetings in the annual report.
The Remuneration Committee appointed and received wholly independent advice on executive compensation from Halliwell Consulting and associated share scheme administration.
No other services were provided to the Company by Halliwell Consulting during the year.
In determining Executive Directors and Senior Group Executives' remuneration for the year, the Remuneration Committee consulted with the Chief Executive, Giles Thorley.
No Executive played a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
The Company Secretary, Neil Preston, was available to provide advice to the members of the Remuneration Committee when required.
The Remuneration Committee met formally three times during the year.
Other than the Chief Executive, the Executive Directors do not have any external appointments as directors of other companies.
The Chief Executive is a Non-executive Director of Ducati Holding S. p. A. for which he receives a fee of 15,000 euros per annum which he retains.
Philosophy behind Remuneration Committees approach The objective of the remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages that will retain talented people in the business, enable the recruitment of appropriately skilled and experienced newcomers and be seen as competitive in the markets in which the Company operates.
The Remuneration Committee believes that shareholders' interests are best served by remuneration packages having a large emphasis on performance-related pay.
It is therefore the aim of the Remuneration Committee to encourage and reward superior performance by Executives.
2004 2005 Overview The Remuneration Committee's policy during the year was to set the main elements of the remuneration package at the following quartiles in comparison to the Company's Comparator Group: Base salary Annual bonus potential Pension Benefits in Kind Share incentives Median Upper Quartile Lower Quartile to Median Market Practice Upper Quartile For the purposes of benchmarking remuneration during 2004 05 the Remuneration Committee used the FTSE 350 Leisure and Hotels Index.
The chart below demonstrates the balance between fixed and variable performance-based compensation for each Executive Director: Balance between fixed & performance-based compensation 000s Key 743.0 Fixed compensation is: salary paid pension contribution benefits 337.3 Performance compensation is: 320.4 269.8 bonus available fair value of LTIP on grant 419.0 236.0 228.0 200.0 fair value of option on grant Thorley McDonald Fawcett Paveley Varible compensation Fixed compensation Elements of Executive Directors remuneration Basic salary Policy 2004 2005: Median The salaries paid to the Executive Directors during 2004 2005 and the salaries payable for 2005 2006 are set out in the section of the Report dealing with the new Executive remuneration policy.
Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 24 Report on Directors remuneration continued Annual performance-related bonus Policy 2004 2005: Upper quartile bonus potential Bonus payments are not pensionable.
Executive Directors and Senior Group Executives participate in the Punch Taverns plc Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
The objectives of the Plan are: to ensure the satisfaction of stretching performance targets before bonuses are earned: to provide an element of bonus earned in shares: to provide a retention mechanism for Executives by rewarding the retention of the share element of their bonus provided additional performance conditions are satisfied: and to provide a Plan which assists Executives in meeting their minimum shareholding requirements.
The following table summarises the main features of the Plan all percentages in the table are percentages of basic salary : All Executive Directors Maximum Annual Bonus Potential 100% Cash Element 75% paid net of tax through payroll at the end of the financial year Bonus Shares 25% acquired net of tax and held in the Plan Deferred Bonus Shares 25% calculated on the pre-tax amount of bonus used to acquire the Bonus Shares Performance conditions Cash Element and Bonus Shares Annual Performance Targets see table below Deferred Bonus Shares Will only be released if the following conditions are satisfied over the three year holding period from the date of award: continued employment by the Executive: 1 Company average EPS growth RPI 5%p.

"1 Earnings per Share ""EPS"" is the total profits of the Company divided by the number of shares in issue which gives the profit generated per share."
2 Fair Market Value FMV for an option is calculated using an option pricing model and is designed to give the current value of the option at the date of grant.
For an award under the Plan or an LTIP award it is based on the value of the shares at the date of grant discounted to take into account the probability of the performance conditions being satisfied.
com 25 Share incentives Policy 2004 2005: Upper quartile The Remuneration Committee's policy is to provide annual share grants to Executives at the upper quartile level compared to the Comparator Group.
The Remuneration Committee believes that a mixture of share options and share awards retains the strengths of both methods of providing shares: in addition the disadvantages are minimised by enabling the Company to provide a competitive incentive and retention tool which is also cost-effective in respect of both shareholder dilution and P&L cost.
Further, the use of combined grants 1 with the various attached performance conditions ensures that the Company's comparative Total Shareholder Return TSR performance is at least at the upper quartile, that absolute share price has increased since the date of grant and that the Company's earnings per share growth over the measurement period is a minimum of RPI 12%p.
a. before Executives will receive the full benefit of their share incentives.
This structure demonstrates the Remuneration Committee's desire to correlate incentive arrangements with the achievement of substantial performance.
The EPS figures used by the Company to calculate the vesting of options will be the audited EPS figures tax normalised disclosed in the Company's financial statements.
The following table summarises the main features of the discretionary share arrangements operated by the Company for its Executive Directors and Senior Group Executives and the grants made to the Executive Directors during the year.

It should be noted that the real value received by the Executive Directors under the share incentive arrangements will be dependent upon the degree to which the associated performance conditions have been satisfied at the end of the three year performance period and the share price of the Company at this time.
"1 Total Shareholder Return ""TSR"" is a measure showing the return on investing in one share of the Company over the performance period the return is the value of the capital gain and reinvested dividends."
It is normally used comparatively and the company which achieves the best return is ranked number one.
2 Face Value for an option is the number of shares multiplied by the exercise price.
For awards under the Bonus Plan and LTIP face value is the aggregate market value of the shares subject to the award at the date of grant.

5 2004 2005 salary used for the calculation: the share price used of 7.635 was the price of a Company share on 20 August 2005.
6 The Remuneration Committee will satisfy itself that the recorded TSR is a genuine reflection of the underlying financial performance of the Company.
Due to the combined nature of awards made under the current share incentive policy one of the corporate performance measures that the Remuneration Committee will be considering in determining whether the recorded TSR is a genuine reflection of the underlying financial performance of the Company is its EPS performance over the measurement period.
Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 26 Report on Directors remuneration continued Basis of performance condition selection and measurement The Remuneration Committee took the following factors into account when deciding the appropriate earnings per share performance measure for grants of options during 2004 2005: the median and upper quartile historic levels of year on year growth in earnings per share for the Comparator Group companies: and the projected EPS growth for the Company provided by external analysts.
Earnings per share was selected as the performance condition for options by the Remuneration Committee as in combination with options it ensures that both the Company's share price and its underlying financial value increases before any benefit is provided to Executives.
Comparative TSR was selected as the performance condition for LTIP awards by the Remuneration Committee as it ensures that the Executives have outperformed their peers in the Comparator Group over the measurement period in delivering shareholder value before being entitled to receive any of their awards irrespective of general market conditions.
The Remuneration Committee determines whether the performance conditions for share awards or options are satisfied.
Where the performance requirements are based on earnings per share EPS, the Committee will use the principles behind the audited figures disclosed in the Company's financial statements, and may take advice from independent advisors as to whether any adjustments are required to ensure consistency in accordance with the terms of the performance conditions.
"Where the performance measure is Total Shareholder Return ""TSR"", Halliwell Consulting, the Remuneration Committee's advisors, shall calculate the TSR in accordance with the principles behind the Regulations and sign-off these figures prior to the release of any award."
Dilution The following table sets out the current level of dilution against the ABI limits for all share plans and discretionary plans principally Executive Plans and sets out the commitments to issue shares made during the financial year reported: Additional Dilution During the Year in Maximum Current Dilution Question 10% dilution in ten years 1.03% 0.22% 5% dilution in ten years 0.82% 0.20% In accordance with the ABI guidelines the Company can issue a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital in a rolling ten year period to employees under all its share plans.
In addition, of this 10% the Company can only issue 5% to satisfy awards under discretionary or executive plans.
The additional dilution considers the commitments the Company has made under its share plans during the financial year.
It should be noted that the above figures exclude 3.56% of dilution relating to options granted prior to the Companys flotation in May 2002 and therefore not subject to the ABI guidelines.
Pension Policy 2004 2005: Lower quartile to median Giles Thorley, Robert McDonald, Adrian Fawcett and Jonathan Paveley are entitled to receive a contribution to their personal pension arrangements representing 12% of their salary.
Benefits in kind Policy 2004 2005: Market practice In line with market practice, the Companys policy is to provide Executive Directors with standard benefits in kind appropriate for executive directors, such as a car or car allowance, medical insurance and life assurance.

Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 28 Report on Directors remuneration continued Non-executive Directors' fees Policy: Median level fees All Non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board based upon recommendations from the Chairman and Chief Executive or, in the case of the Chairman, based on recommendations from the Senior Independent Non-executive Director and the Chief Executive within the limits set by the articles of association and based on the median level of fees payable to peers in the same Comparator Group as that used for Executive Directors' remuneration.
Non-executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Companys share incentive schemes or performance based plans and are not eligible to join the Companys pension scheme.
The fees paid to the Non-executive Directors during 2004 2005 and the fees payable for 2005 2006 are set out in the section of the Report dealing with the new Executive remuneration policy.
2005 2006 new policy Overview The Remuneration Committee, with input from the Executive Directors and Haliwell Consulting, continually reviews the Comparator Group for its appropriateness to the current stage of the Companys development and market factors generally.
As part of the review process a new Comparator Group for remuneration benchmarking was agreed by the Remuneration Committee.
This new Comparator Group was discussed with shareholders as part of the consultation process.
The new Comparator Group for benchmarking remuneration consists of companies that are members of the FTSE 350 Leisure and Hotels Index and are one of the 250 largest as measured by market capitalisation companies listed on the Stock Exchange this Group excludes Carnival plc at the request of shareholders.
The following table sets out the current members of the new Comparator Group: fide Vere Group plc Mitchells & Butlers plc Enterprise Inns plc MyTravel plc First Choice Holidays plc Rank Group plc Greene King plc Stanley Leisure plc Hilton Group plc Whitbread plc Holidaybreak plc William Hill plc Intercontinental Hotels Group plc Wolverhampton & Dudley Breweries plc Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc The basis of the selection of the new Comparator Group was: companies with related businesses to the Company: companies of a comparable size to the Company.
The substantial increase in the size of the Company since the original selection of the Comparator Group was one of the most significant factors in the change to the new Comparator Group: companies with similar types of operation to the Company: and companies competing for the same pool of executive talent.
The Remuneration Committee's policy for 2005 2006 is to set the main elements of the remuneration package at the following quartiles in comparison to the Company's Comparator Group: Base salary Annual bonus potential Pension Benefits in Kind Share incentives Lower Quartile Upper Quartile Lower Quartile to Median Market Practice Upper Quartile The most significant change from the policy applied during 2004 2005 is the change of the benchmarking position for base salary from median to lower quartile.
The Committee felt that the change was appropriate because: the Remuneration Committee wishes to re-emphasise the performance bias of the Executive compensation package: of the larger size of the companies in the Comparator Group: and the relative simplicity of the business of the Company compared to some members of the Comparator Group.
com 29 Basic salary Policy: Lower quartile The following table sets out the base salary paid in 2004 2005 and the salaries which will apply for 2005 2006: Salary Salary Percentage Name 2004 2005 2005 2006 Rise Giles Thorley 350,000 410,000 17% Robert McDonald 200,000 240,000 20% Adrian Fawcett 190,000 215,000 13% Jonathan Paveley 160,000 190,000 19% When determining the salary of the Executive Directors the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration: the levels of base salary for similar positions within comparable status, responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity, in particular the lower quartile salary levels of those companies within the Comparator Group.
It is not the intention of the Committee, while operating the current remuneration policy, to depart from the salary benchmarking quartile.
The Remuneration Committee are committed to consulting with shareholders about any substantial proposed change to its policy: the performance of the individual Executive Director: the individual Executive Director's experience and responsibilities: and pay and conditions throughout the Company.
Non-executive Director fees Policy: Median level fees It is the Board's policy to take into account the following factors in determining the fees of the Non-executive Directors: the median level of fees for similar positions in the Comparator Group: and the time commitment each Non-executive Director makes to the Company through membership of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees.
The Senior Independent Director SID was paid the same basic fee in 2004 2005 as the other Non-executive Directors with no additional fees for the SID role.
For 2005 2006 the total basic fee for the SID has been increased to 40,000 p. a. a 21% rise.
The Chairs of the Audit and Remuneration Committee were paid an additional 7,000 p. a. in 2004 2005, this remains unchanged for 2005 2006.
The increase in basic fee was in recognition by the Company of the increased workload on the Non-executive Directors as a result of changing corporate governance requirements, the substantial growth in the Company and also to take into account levels of fees in the Comparator Group.
Other elements of the Executive compensation package for 2005 2006 The following table summarises the other elements of the Executive compensation package for 2005 2006 with particular emphasis on whether there is any change from 2004 2005: Annual bonus Same bonus potential, structure of bonus payments and type of performance conditions as applied during 2004 2005.

The level of the EPS performance condition applying to the option grant has been changed so that 40% of options will vest for average EPS growth of RPI 8%p.

Punch Taverns plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 30 Report on Directors remuneration continued Total shareholder return performance graph The graph shows the Companys performance, measured by total shareholder return TSR, compared with the FTSE 350 Leisure and Hotels Index which was the Company's Comparator Group for 2004 2005 and remains the Comparator Group for TSR based performance awards under the LTIP.
