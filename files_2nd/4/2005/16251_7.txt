Charles Gregson is a member of the United Pension Plan.

Pensions in payment are increased by 5% per annum or RPI if less.
The widows pension is two thirds of the individuals pension.
Under the terms of Charles Gregsons previous service contract, the definition of pensionable salary included annual bonus up to 50% of base salary.

If his services were terminated by the company without his consent he would be entitled to an immediate pension calculated as a proportion of his pension entitlement at age 60, based on his final pensionable salary at the date of termination.
Charles Gregson will cease to be an active member of the United Pension Plan on 1 April 2006 and will cease to accrue benefits from that date.

Options are subject to a performance condition which requires growth in earnings per share to exceed the increase in UK inflation by an average of at least 3% per annum over the period of three years from the date of grant.
If this condition is met, options with a face value equal to 0.75 times salary will vest.
In order for the whole award to vest, growth in earnings per share must exceed the increase in UK inflation by an average of 5% per annum over the measurement period.
A sliding scale applies between these two figures.
The committee considers that the performance condition is in line with market practice at the time the scheme was set up and is appropriately stretching.
Options granted prior to 2004 may be re-tested up to six years from the date of grant from a fixed base.
No re-testing is permitted of options granted after February 2004.
Options granted under the 1994 Executive Scheme are subject to a performance condition which requires EPS growth to exceed the increase in UK inflation by an average of 2% per annum over a three year period.
At the time of the plans inception this performance condition was in line with existing market practice.
The performance condition has been met in respect of all outstanding options held under the United 1994 Executive Scheme, which are consequently fully vested.
All options were granted at market value and for no consideration.
Directors interests in the Senior Executive Equity Participation Plan SEEPP The SEEPP offers selected senior executives including executive directors the opportunity to waive part or all of their annual bonus and receive an interest in shares in the company bonus shares to the equivalent value.
The executive may also be granted a right to acquire further shares matching shares in the company equal in value to the gross amount of the bonus foregone.
Matching share awards will vest after four years but only to the extent that the associated bonus shares are still held on that date.
Matching share awards are also subject to a performance condition which is measured over the four year vesting period.
One third of the award may only be exercised if growth in earnings per share during that period exceeds inflation by an average of 3% per annum: a further one third requires such growth to exceed inflation by an average of 5% per annum: the remaining one third requires no performance condition.
No re-testing of performance conditions is permitted.
These conditions are in accordance with the committees policy as outlined above.
Charles Gregson and Nigel Wilson each waived their cash bonuses for 2004 and received awards under the SEEPP which are included in the table below.
Following the introduction of the Bonus Investment Plan, no further awards will be made under the SEEPP.
Awards becoming exercisable prior to 3 March 2004 were granted under the 1996 SEEPP, which operates in a similar manner to the 2000 SEEPP, except that the matching awards are subject to a longer vesting period up to 7 years but no performance conditions are attached.
At the time the 1996 SEEPP was established, it was not customary to attach performance conditions to matching awards.
p. 31 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Directors Remuneration continued Notes The directors gave up cash bonuses that would otherwise have been receivable by them in order to receive awards under the SEEPP.
For Clive Hollick and Charles Gregson, the bonus was paid to each individuals Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme FURBS and used by the FURBS Trustees to purchase shares from the SEEPP Trustees at full market value.
A matching award was granted over an equal number of shares.
The table shows the total bonus shares and matching awards.
The bonus shares are included in the directors beneficial interest in shares shown on page 33.
The amount used to purchase the bonus shares was included in the directors reported remuneration for the year in which the award was made.
Following exercise of the matching awards, the bonus shares cease to have any restrictions attached to them and are no longer considered to form part of the directors SEEPP interests.
The SEEPP bonus shares options and matching awards were adjusted to reflect the capital reorganisation which took place on 23 April 2001, whereby every shareholder received 44 B shares and 29 new ordinary shares in place of every 44 ordinary shares previously held.
The performance condition was not met for awards made in 2001 and consequently two thirds of the matching options under these awards lapsed during 2005.
The market value of the matching awards is calculated at 637 pence per share, the closing mid market price on 30 December 2005, and 245 pence per B share.

The market value of shares is calculated at 637 pence per share, the closing mid market price on 30 December 2005.
Thus the companys results for 2004 formed the basis for awards made in 2005, with the number of options granted being calculated by reference to the average share price during December 2003.
Awards made in 2005 will vest as to 50% in January 2007 and the balance in January 2008, provided the director remains in the groups employment.
Awards will also vest if employment ceases due to redundancy, disability, injury, death, retirement at or after contractual retirement age, or in other circumstances at the discretion of the remuneration committee.
Only purchased shares may be used to fulfil awards under the MTIP.
The market value is calculated at 637 pence per share, the closing mid market price on 30 December 2005.
Executive directors are no longer eligible to participate in the MTIP.
