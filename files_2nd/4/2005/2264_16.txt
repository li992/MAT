72 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Report on remuneration The remuneration committee The remuneration committee comprises all the independent non-executive directors, namely Guy Dawson chairman, Andrew Bonfield, Matthew Miau, Sir Christopher ODonnell, Anne Quinn and Rebecca McDonald appointed 1 July 2005.
Whilst neither the Group chairman nor the chief executive are members of the remuneration committee they both attend the meetings by invitation but are not present when their personal remuneration is discussed and reviewed.
The Group human resources director acts as secretary to the committee and provides it with information and data from national and international surveys.
He is assisted by the Group compensation and benefits director.
In addition the remuneration committee has appointed Towers Perrin to advise on the remuneration arrangements for senior executives.
The remuneration committee sets the overall remuneration policy of the Group and makes recommendations to the board on the framework of executive remuneration.
Individual member attendance at the meetings is shown on page 66.
The terms of reference are reviewed annually to ensure that they conform with best practice.
Specifically, the remuneration committee determines, on behalf of the board, the detailed terms of service of the executive directors and other members of the executive management team including basic salary, performance-related bonus arrangements, benefits in kind, long-term incentives and pension benefits.
The remuneration committee also reviews the remuneration of the chairman, following a recommendation from the chief executive and the senior independent director.
The board as a whole determines the non-executive directors fees.
Remuneration policy Current expected value chart 1 BOCs remuneration policy for executive directors and other executive management is designed to attract and retain executives of the highest calibre so that the Group is managed successfully to the benefit of its stakeholders.
1 Fixed 33% 1 2 Annual In setting remuneration levels the remuneration committee takes into account the remuneration practices found in variable 24% other UK listed companies of similar size, internationality and complexity.
The policy is to pay salaries and total 3 Long-term remuneration around mid-market levels for on target performance and to provide the opportunity, via annual and incentives 43% long-term incentives, for executives to be rewarded at the 75th percentile if this is justified by the achievement of 2 top of the range performance goals.
It is the view of the remuneration committee that performance-related 3 remuneration should form a substantial element of total remuneration.
Based on assumptions about expected values for awards from the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP and the Share Matching Plan SMP, the proportion of performance-related remuneration to fixed remuneration excluding pensions and benefits in kind for current arrangements is approximately 67 per cent to 33 per cent see chart 1.
Last year, the remuneration committee made a number of changes to the performance-related elements of the executive remuneration package.
These changes were approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in January 2005.
The changes included the ceasing of option awards under the Executive Share Option Scheme, an increase in target and maximum value of the Variable Compensation Plan VCP with one third of the bonus being compulsorily transferred into a new SMP, and an increase in the maximum award level for the LTIP.
The increase in the maximum LTIP award level was to ensure that the remuneration committee has the flexibility to remain fully competitive in the event that a higher level of award was required for an appointment to an executive role.
The remuneration committee does not propose to make any significant changes to the executive remuneration package this year.
Remuneration components Basic salary Salaries for executive directors and executive management board members are based on median market rates drawn from market data provided by remuneration consultants, Towers Perrin, and take account of an executives experience, responsibilities and performance.
Performance is assessed both from an individual and business perspective.
Remuneration for those executives of businesses outside the UK is denominated in the local currency.
Benefits in kind Benefits in kind comprise company car benefits and membership of BOCs healthcare insurance scheme.
Where appropriate, directors on international assignment receive overseas allowances such as housing and childrens education fees.
These allowances are on similar terms to those applying to other employees on the international programme.
Such benefits are in line with those offered by peer group companies.
Benefits in kind do not form part of pensionable earnings.
Report on remuneration 73 Variable Compensation Plan VCP The executive directors and senior management participate in the variable compensation bonus plan.
The plan focuses on annual objectives and links individual performance with business plans.
Last year, as part of the review of performance-related elements of the executive remuneration package, the remuneration committee agreed that the target and maximum value of the VCP be increased to 110 per cent and 160 per cent of salary respectively and that one third of the VCP bonus be compulsorily deferred into the Share Matching Plan.
Details of the plan are shown on page 74.
The financial targets for the executive directors and other executive management board members are set on an annual basis by the remuneration committee and performance against these targets is reviewed by the remuneration committee on a six monthly basis.
The remuneration committee considers that a six monthly review acts as a significant incentive and is conducive to sustaining performance throughout the year.
The financial targets are based equally on adjusted earnings per share EPS and adjusted return on capital employed ROCE at Group level.
Adjusted means excluding exceptional items.
Bonuses are assessed two thirds on these financial targets with the remaining third based on personal objectives.
These are based on BOCs strategic priorities and include safety, growth, people and change management and productivity.
Performance is measured against key performance indicators determined during formal appraisals.
There is a threshold performance level below which no bonus is paid.
For the financial year 2005 the financial targets set by the remuneration committee were EPS 66p and ROCE 15.3 per cent and the achievement against these targets was EPS 64.3p and ROCE 15.3 per cent.
The bonus payable in respect of the financial targets amounts to 58.6 per cent of salary.
In addition, an amount equal to 29.3 per cent of salary has been deferred into the Share Matching Plan.
The bonuses for the executive directors and other members of the executive management board are paid half yearly following the remuneration committee review.
Details of the payments to directors are included in the directors remuneration for the year on page 78.
Current long-term incentive arrangements Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP Executive directors, members of the executive management board and a number of other key executives selected from the companys global operations participate in the LTIP.
The remuneration committee has the discretion to grant awards up to a maximum of 2.5 times salary.
The award made in November 2004 to the chief executive was based on 2 times salary and for other board directors 1.5 times salary.
There are three performance conditions: total shareholder return TSR, adjusted earnings per share EPS and adjusted return on capital employed ROCE.
Up to one third of the award could vest in respect of each performance condition.
The TSR performance condition compares BOCs TSR performance with two separate comparator groups, a UK comparator group comprising 31 industrial and manufacturing companies and a global industrial gases group of six leading companies as follows: UK group Aggregate Industries BPB Invensys Scottish & Southern Energy AMEC Centrica Johnson Matthey Scottish Power Anglo American Corus Group Kelda Group Severn Trent AWG FKI National Grid T ransco Shell T ranspor t & T rading BAE Systems Hanson Pilkington Smiths Group BG Group IMI Rio Tinto Tomkins BHP Billiton ICI RMC Group United Utilities BP International Power Rolls-Royce Aggregate Industries and RMC Group were taken over in 2005.
Their TSR performance to the point at which they were taken over has been included in the performance measurement.
Global gases group Airgas US S&P 500 Index Air Liquide France CAC 40 Index Air Products & Chemicals US S&P 500 Index Linde Germany DAX 30 Index Taiyo Nippon Sanso Japan NIKKEI 225 Index Praxair US S&P 500 Index The BOC Group UK FTSE100 Index When determining BOCs performance relative to the global gases group, the TSR for BOC and the comparator companies is adjusted adjusted TSR so that it reflects the excess or shortfall in returns relative to the local stockmarket index where each company has its primary listing.
The nationality and the local stockmarket index that is used to calculate the adjusted TSR for each company is shown in the parentheses.
74 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Report on remuneration For the awards made in November 2004 which will vest in November 2007, the target set by the remuneration committee is such that if the companys TSR position measured over a three year period is median in respect of both comparator groups, then 40 per cent of the shares in respect of the TSR part of the award will vest.
If the companys TSR position is upper quartile, all of the shares in respect of the TSR part of the award will vest.
If the TSR performance is between the median and upper quartile, a proportion of between 40 per cent and all of the shares in respect of the TSR part of the award will vest.
If the companys TSR position is below the median for both comparator groups, the TSR part of the award will lapse.
The same TSR performance criteria were used for the awards made in the financial year 2004.
The remuneration committee has decided that for any awards made in the financial year 2006 onwards, 25 per cent rather than 40 per cent of the shares for the TSR part of the award will vest at median.
The adjusted EPS performance condition is based on the companys EPS relative to three year targets on a sliding performance scale.
For the awards made in November 2004 which will vest in November 2007, the target set by the remuneration committee is 70.3p at the end of the three year performance period for minimum vesting.
If this is achieved, 40 per cent of the shares in respect of the EPS part of the award will vest.
All of the shares in respect of the EPS part of the award will vest if the company achieves 80.8p at the end of the three year performance period.
If the EPS performance is between 70.3p and 80.8p, a proportion of between 40 per cent and all of the shares in respect of the EPS part of the award will vest.
If EPS is less than 70.3p at the end of the three year period, the EPS part of the award will lapse.
The EPS targets for the financial year 2004 awards were 60.3p for threshold vesting and 69.3p for full vesting.
The adjusted ROCE performance condition is based on the companys ROCE relative to three year targets on a sliding performance scale.
For the awards made in November 2004, and for further awards, the remuneration committee decided that it would be appropriate to widen the ROCE band.
The threshold target set by the remuneration committee for the November 2004 awards, which will vest in November 2007, is 13.5 per cent at the end of the three year performance period.
If this is achieved, 40 per cent of the shares in respect of the ROCE part of the award will vest.
All of the shares in respect of the ROCE part of the award will vest if the company achieves a ROCE of 16 per cent.
If the ROCE performance is between 13.5 per cent and 16 per cent a proportion of between 40 per cent and all of the shares in respect of the ROCE part of the award will vest.
If the ROCE is less than 13.5 per cent the ROCE part of the award will lapse.
The ROCE targets for the financial year 2004 awards were 13.5 per cent for threshold vesting and 15 per cent for full vesting.
In setting three performance conditions for the LTIP awards, the remuneration committee took the view that these were the most important measures that drive or measure sustainable improvements in shareholder value: the TSR performance condition measures comparative performance while EPS and ROCE reflect a core part of the companys business strategy, enabling high levels of both earnings growth and capital efficiency.
Details of the awards made to directors are shown on page 82.
For the awards made for the financial year 2003, the performance conditions have been met to the extent that 52.6 per cent of the shares vest on the third anniversary of the award date.
Share Matching Plan SMP The plan was adopted by shareholders at the 2005 Annual General Meeting.
Executive directors, members of the executive management board and other senior managers who participate in the VCP are eligible to participate in the SMP.
One-third of any VCP award is compulsorily applied to the acquisition of BOC shares.
The executives will become entitled to these shares only if they are still in service with BOC three years after the award is made or are considered to be good leavers.
The executives will receive an additional number of shares equal to the value of the dividends paid during the deferral period of the shares and they may also receive a matching share award of up to 100 per cent of the number of shares originally allotted.
The percentage award will depend on the companys performance over the deferral period.
Adjusted EPS will account for 75 per cent of the performance weighting, with TSR accounting for the remaining 25 per cent.
The adjusted EPS performance condition is based on the companys EPS relative to three year targets.
These targets will be on a sliding scale, where five per cent per annum growth rate over three years is required for threshold vesting of 25 per cent of that portion.
Full vesting will be achieved if EPS growth is 12 per cent per annum over the three year period.
The TSR performance condition compares BOCs TSR performance against the same UK comparator group as used for the LTIP.
Awards will vest for this portion where BOCs TSR position is median, measured over three years.
At this point 25 per cent of this portion of the award will vest.
Full vesting occurs if the company is ranked at or above the upper quartile.
Details of the value of VCP awards for directors that will be applied to the acquisition of BOC shares under the SMP are shown on page 78.
Executive Share Option Scheme 2003 ESOS 2003 The last grant under the ESOS 2003 to executive directors and employees who participate in the SMP took place in November 2003.
The scheme was retained for selected middle management throughout the companys global operations.
However, it is intended to develop an alternative scheme for this group in the financial year 2006.
The performance condition set for the ESOS 2003 by the remuneration committee is that the growth in the adjusted EPS over a three year performance period must be equal to or greater than the growth in the UK retail prices index RPI plus three per cent per annum over the three year performance period.
In line with current corporate governance best practice there is no rolling retesting of performance.
In the event that the performance condition is not satisfied over the original three year period then the remuneration committee has the discretion to re-test performance after five years, but only where the remuneration committee believes the extension to be a fair and reasonable basis for assessing the sustained underlying performance of the company.
Report on remuneration 75 Current measures and their weights Awards under the LTIP, SMP and ESOS 2003 which vest may be satisfied in cash, for example, where it is necessary for variable incentives using on for legal or tax reasons.
The amount to be paid will, in the case of share options, be equal to the participants gain target VCP awards and the expected on the exercise of the share option.
Also, the remuneration committee may decide, prior to grant, that an award values of long-term incentives chart 2 shall be expressed to be a right to acquire a cash sum rather than shares.
This type of award, known as a phantom 1 Personal 17.6% 1 award, will normally only be granted to participants in jurisdictions where, because of local securities laws or 2 TSR 14.8% 3 EPS 36.7% exchange control provisions, it is difficult to issue or transfer shares to employees.
The LTIP, SMP and ESOS 2003 4 ROCE 30.9% 2 awards may be satisfied by using existing shares purchased in the market through The BOC Group plc Employee Share Trust or by issuing new shares.
In addition, the SMP awards may be satisfied by using shares held in treasury.
4 Awards under the LTIP, SMP and ESOS 2003 are not pensionable.
3 The current performance measures as a percentage of salary for on target performance are shown in chart 2.
Savings Related Share Option Schemes New schemes were adopted by shareholders at the 2005 Annual General Meeting.
These are operated in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland and are open to all employees, including executive directors, with one years service or more.
The UK scheme is approved by HM Revenue and Customs.
Percentage 80 TSR performance The graph to the left has been included to meet the requirement set out in the Directors Remuneration Report 60 Regulations 2002.
It shows BOCs TSR performance, assuming dividends are reinvested, compared with all FTSE100 40 companies.
This has been chosen because it provides a basis for comparison against companies in a relevant, broad 20 based equity index of which BOC is a constituent member.
The remuneration committee decided that other 0 comparator groups were more appropriate as performance measurement for the LTIP.
A graph showing BOCs -20 TSR performance compared with the six major gases companies relative to respective local indices, which is one of -40 the comparator groups chosen for the LTIP, is shown in the chairmans statement on page 5.
-60 Former long-term incentive arrangements Oct-00 Oct-01 Oct-02 Oct-03 Oct-04 Oct-05 BOC FTSE100 Executive Share Option Scheme 1995The last grant of options to the executive directors and members of the executive management board took place in February 2002 and the last award to other Group employees took place in December 2002.
No further awards will be made under this scheme.
The options vest when the companys adjusted EPS growth is equal to, or exceeds, the growth in the retail prices index RPI by three per cent per annum over any three year performance period.
Details of directors individual remuneration, share options, LTIP awards, amounts deferred from VCP bonus to SMP and shareholdings are given on pages 78 to 82.
Retirement benefits Pension arrangements for executive directors are in line with those of comparable executives in the countries in which the directors are located.
In the UK, the BOC senior executive pension scheme is a funded, tax-approved, defined benefit pension arrangement.
Where necessary, the directors pensionable pay is limited by the earnings cap provisions of the Finance Act 1989.
In such cases, the company pays the director a salary supplement on earnings above the earnings cap to reflect the loss of pension coverage.
This supplement is recorded in the directors emoluments and is not taken into account in calculating bonuses or any other form of remuneration.
BOC closed its UK defined benefit pension arrangements to all new employees on 30 June 2003.
Pension arrangements for new employees are provided under a defined contribution Retirement Savings Plan.
The company makes contributions to the plan equal to two times the employees core contributions which can be three, four or five per cent of salary.
From 6 April 2006, the new Life Time Allowance rules will apply to UK pension provision.
BOC will continue to provide benefits under its defined benefit and defined contribution pension arrangements as set out above.
As an alternative, it will allow employees whose benefits will, or are likely to, exceed the Life Time Allowance to opt out of some, or all, further tax-approved pension provision.
In such cases, the company will pay the individual a salary supplement on earnings which no longer benefit from pension coverage.
For members of the defined benefit arrangements, the supplement will be at the same rate as now applies to earnings above the earnings cap and for members of the defined contribution pension arrangements, the supplement will be at the rate which would have been paid into the Retirement Savings Plan.
In both cases the supplement, when paid, will be similarly recorded in the directors emoluments.
In the US, the Cash Balance Retirement Plan is a funded, tax-qualified, defined benefit arrangement.
In the US, the BOC Senior Executive Retirement Plan is an un-funded, non-tax-qualified, defined benefit arrangement which tops up the benefits provided under the Cash Balance Retirement Plan.
In Australia, the BOC Gases Superannuation Fund is a funded, defined contribution arrangement underpinned by a defined benefit guarantee for long-serving employees who were members under a prior benefit structure.
76 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2005 Report on remuneration Outside appointments The remuneration committees view is that non-executive directorships are a significant benefit in broadening executives experience.
Any such appointments are subject to review by the nominations committee and the approval of the board.
The executive is permitted to retain any fees for the service.
Tony Isaac received fees of 50,000 as a non-executive director of International Power plc and US$70,000 and an annual award of 2,000 shares as a non-executive director of Schlumberger Ltd. Dr Raj Rajagopal received fees of US$15,000 and an option over 15,000 shares at an option price of $4.21 as a non-executive director of FSI International Inc. and 13,542 as a non-executive director of Foseco plc.
Non-executive directors Non-executive directors are initially appointed for a three year term after which, whilst not automatic, their appointment may be extended for a second term subject to mutual agreement and shareholder approval.
The fees are set at a level which will attract individuals with the necessary experience and ability to make a significant contribution to The BOC Groups affairs and are benchmarked with those fees paid by other UK listed companies.
The basic fees for the non-executive directors are 40,000 per annum, 10,000 of which, less tax, is invested in BOC shares.
In addition, the fees for chairing a committee are 10,000 per annum, 5,000 of which, less tax, is invested in BOC shares.
Following a review in November 2005 the board agreed that the basic fee should be increased by 5,000 per annum with effect from 1 January 2006.
This increase, less tax, will be invested in BOC shares.
The fee for Rob Margetts, company chairman, is 260,000 per annum.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts.
They do not participate in the Groups variable compensation arrangements, its long-term incentive arrangements or its pension arrangements.
They do not receive any benefits in kind.
Appointment of director Alan Ferguson joined the company on 15 September 2005 and was appointed a director on 30 September 2005.
2R 2 of the Listing Rules, Mr Ferguson received an award of shares to the value of 550,000 on the day he joined the company.
Two thirds of this award will vest in March 2006.
The remaining shares will vest in March 2007.
He also received an award of shares to the value of 200 per cent of salary under the LTIP.
Vesting will be in accordance with the performance conditions and performance period set by the remuneration committee for the November 2004 LTIP award.
In addition, the number of shares vesting will be pro-rated to the number of months worked during the performance period.
This will amount to twenty four months at the expected vesting date.
These awards were used to facilitate the recruitment of Mr Ferguson.
He held a significant number of share options and restricted shares under his previous employers share plans.
The value of the awards provided was calculated on a straight swap basis and will be payable unless his employment is terminated by reason of summary dismissal.
The details of Mr Fergusons contract are included below.
Future arrangements for chief executive Tony Isaac, the chief executive is due to retire in 2007.
The remuneration committee wish to ensure that he continues to be rewarded appropriately.
With this in mind the remuneration committee has decided that he should continue to participate in the long-term incentive arrangements during the financial year 2006.
However for the financial year 2007 the remuneration committee have agreed that he should not participate in these arrangements and propose to award delivery of his 2007 objectives solely in cash, based on salary and cash bonus and linked to additional specific and rigorous performance conditions.
This approach will align Mr Isaacs pay with that of the other directors, although at a lower level of deferred pay.
Service contracts The companys policy is for all executive directors to have contracts of employment that terminate on the attainment of retirement age.
In order to mitigate its liability on early termination, the companys policy is that it should be able to terminate such contracts on no more than 12 months notice, and that payments on termination are restricted to the value of salary, car benefit and bonus entitlement calculated on the basis of the average of actual payments over the preceding two years for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
The company has revised this policy further for all new appointments, so that in the event of early termination, the company will pay either monthly compensation calculated as per the terms set out above for the unexpired portion of the notice period, or else a lump sum payment equal to the base salary pro-rated to the unexpired portion of the notice period.
In the event that monthly compensation is paid, should an individual obtain alternative employment during the period of the monthly payments, the companys obligation is reduced by the amount of the monthly remuneration from the alternative employment.
The revised policy has applied to all new appointments during the financial year and will apply to subsequent appointments.
Pension provisions on termination are detailed in the individual service contracts below.
Report on remuneration 77 Individual service contracts Mr Bevan has a contract dated 5 December 2002 that can be terminated by the company on 12 months notice.
In the event of early termination, the contract provides for the payment of compensation based on the value of salary, car benefit and bonus entitlement calculated on the basis of the average of actual payments over the preceding two years for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
Mr Bevan would also be entitled to his deferred pension, with the unexpired portion of the notice period being added to his pensionable service in the calculation of his pension entitlement.
Mr Isaac has a contract dated 19 November 2002, varied by letter dated 1 June 2004, which expires upon the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in 2007 subject to possible extension by mutual agreement.
The contract can be terminated by the company on 12 months notice.
Mr Isaac would also be entitled to a contribution to his funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme amounting to the sum of 40 per cent of his pay above the pension cap imposed by the Finance Act 1989 and 58.33 per cent of his pay up to the cap for the unexpired portion of his notice period.
Dr Rajagopal has a contract dated 1 May 1999, amended 22 November 2002, that can be terminated by the company on 12 months notice.
Dr Rajagopal would also be entitled to have his deferred pension from the UK senior executive pension scheme a calculated with the inclusion of the unexpired portion of his notice period in the calculation of pensionable service: and b paid without actuarial reduction from age 55.
Mr Masters has a contract dated 11 March 2005, effective from 1 March 2005, that can be terminated by the company on 12 months notice.
In the event of early termination, the contract provides for the monthly payment of compensation based on the value of salary, car benefit and bonus entitlement calculated on the basis of the average of actual payments over the preceding two years for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
Should Mr Masters obtain alternative employment during the period for payment of the monthly payments then each monthly payment still outstanding would be reduced by the basic monthly remuneration received from his alternative employment.
Alternatively, the contract also provides for the company to pay a lump sum termination payment in lieu of the unexpired portion of the notice period instead of the monthly termination payments.
Such a payment would be equal to the base salary pro-rated to the unexpired portion of the notice period.
The unexpired portion of Mr Masters notice period would be added to his pensionable service in the calculation of his pension entitlement from the US Senior Executive Retirement Plan.
His US Cash Balance Retirement Plan and Savings Investment Plan benefits would be credited with an amount equivalent to the amount the company would have contributed during the unexpired portion of his notice period.
His active participation in the Cash Balance Retirement Plan and Savings Investment Plan would cease on termination.
Mr Ferguson has a contract dated 5 May 2005 that can be terminated by the company on 12 months notice.
Should Mr Ferguson obtain alternative employment during the period for payment of the monthly payments then each monthly payment still outstanding would be reduced by the basic monthly remuneration received from his alternative employment.
Mr Ferguson would be entitled to a contribution to his personal pension plan or a cash amount in lieu of his pay supplement for the unexpired portion of his notice period.
If the contract is terminated within two years of his date of appointment, the company, with Mr Fergusons agreement, has the discretion to make such termination payments in one lump sum or on a monthly basis.
All of the above contracts can be terminated by the individual director on six months notice.
Mr Walsh resigned from the board on 1 March 2005 and left the company on 31 March 2005.
He received no severance payment.
All of his long-term incentive plans lapsed on his resignation.
Mr Mdori resigned from the board and left the company on 31 May 2005.
He was entitled to exercise one vested share option which he was granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 within three months of leaving the company.
All of his other long-term incentives lapsed on his resignation.
Shareholding guidelines The remuneration committee encourages the executive management group to grow personal shareholding in the business over time.
It is anticipated that each executive would build towards a shareholding of one times salary.
The remuneration committee believes that the vehicle of the long-term incentive arrangements will facilitate the building of such a shareholding over a period of time.

This represents the amount charged to operating profit for those elements of the various share incentive schemes relating to directors.
Allowances and benefits include car, fuel, medical insurance and international assignment benefits.
The latter includes housing, utilities, home leave flights, education, relocation, shipping costs, and any other assignment allowances not covered in this indicative listing.
Mr Masters and Mr Bevan are international assignees, and Mr Walsh was an international assignee prior to his resignation.
The pay of international assignees is managed under a tax equalisation programme funded by the company.
This programme ensures that they are not penalised financially by accepting roles of an international nature which would result in higher taxation costs than would have been the case if they had remained in their home country, as in the case of Mr Walsh and Mr Masters, or benefit from a tax windfall as in the case of Mr Bevan.
Mr Bevans basic salary fees is set by reference to his UK notional salary of 342,000.
Total remuneration disclosed in the 2004 Report and Accounts did not include a correction for the tax associated with international assignments.
Mr Isaac was the highest paid director in 2005.
Mr Masters was appointed to the board on 1 March 2005 and Ms McDonald was appointed to the board on 1 July 2005.
The remuneration above is the total remuneration earned since their appointment.
Fees in respect of Sir Christopher ODonnell are paid to Smith & Nephew plc.
Mr Mdori, Mr Walsh, Ms Baddeley and Mr Napier resigned from the board on 31 May 2005, 1 March 2005, 28 February 2005 and 22 December 2004 respectively.
The remuneration above is the total remuneration earned to their date of resignation.
The allowances and benefits of Mr Mdori include a salary supplement of 84,000 2004: 103,600 in respect of the pensions earnings cap.
The aggregate remuneration charged against profits for directors and members of the executive management board in the year was 10.5 million.
Remuneration of members of the executive management board other than directors is given on page 79.
