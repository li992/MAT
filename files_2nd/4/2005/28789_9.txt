RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 28 Directors Remuneration Report Directors Remuneration Directors remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2005 is shown below, with comparative figures for the previous year where applicable.
Comparative figures for the individual Directors emoluments are shown in brackets if they differ from the emoluments for the year ended 31 March 2005.
For the current year, to 31 March 2006, Lord Rothschilds salary is 357,000 per annum 2004 5: 340,000 per annum and Duncan Budges salary is 262,500 per annum 2003 4: 250,000 per annum.
The Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee, has adopted an Executive Bonus Plan.
The Plan provides that each executive Director, and such other participants as may be determined by the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee, shall be entitled to an annual bonus.
The amount payable under the Executive Bonus Plan is calculated by reference to the Companys three-year moving average outperformance over the three most relevant total return indices.
The indices are currently the FTSE All-Share Total Return Index, the Investment Trust Net Assets Total Return Index and the Morgan Stanley Capital International Total Return Index expressed in Sterling.
The percentage of salary payable as a bonus rises on a straight line basis from 0% to 100%, if the average annual outperformance is between 0% and 7%.
Thereafter, the percentage of salary payable as a bonus rises from 100% in a straight line to the maximum bonus payable under the Plan of 125%, if the average annual outperformance is between 7% and 10%.
The bonuses payable under the Plan to Lord Rothschild and Mr Budge in respect of the year ended 31 March 2005 amounted to 425,000 year ended 31 March 2004: 425,000 and 312,500 year ended 31 March 2004: 312,500 respectively.
In addition to the bonus entitlements under the Executive Bonus Plan, Lord Rothschild and Mr Budge each received a 900 bonus which was paid to all of the Groups employees in December 2004 year ended 31 March 2004: 900.
RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Directors Remuneration Report 29 Long-term Incentive Plan Long-term incentive arrangements were approved by shareholders on 10 July 1996, as they constituted related party transactions under Stock Exchange rules.
Under their respective participation in the Share Appreciation Rights plan as at 31 March 1999, Lord Rothschild and Duncan Budge were both entitled, at a time of their choice between the third and tenth anniversary of the grant and in respect of any subsequent grants to a bonus.
This would be calculated by reference to a notional number of the Companys shares in each case 587,371 at 340.5p.
The amount of the bonus will represent the increase, since the date of grant, in the Companys share price multiplied by the notional number of shares.
This is, however, conditional on any increase in the share price, plus dividends paid, exceeding the increase in the Retail Price Index plus 3% per annum for any three year period between the date of grant and the tenth anniversary thereof.
The Board, on the recommendation of the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee, has resolved that the performance condition relating to any further grants under the Share Application Rights Plan shall apply to the fixed three year period from the date of grant.
The Remuneration and Conflicts Committee decided that further participations in the Share Appreciation Rights plan should be granted to both Lord Rothschild and Duncan Budge on 22 March 2000 and 26 March 2003.
The notional number of shares involved was 228,833 at 437p and 262,467 at 381p respectively in each case.
As at 31 March 2005 the amount accrued under all three participations was 6,971,960 payable in equal parts to Lord Rothschild and Duncan Budge.
This compared with an accrued amount of 4,458,654 as at 31 March 2004 and followed an increase in the middle-market price of RITCP shares during the period from 577.5p to 694p.
The lowest closing price of the Companys shares during the year was 544.5p and the highest was 739p.
Should either participant leave their employment involuntarily at any time, the bonus accrued to the relevant date will be payable, subject to there being no grounds for non-payment arising out of negligence or other misconduct.

Performance Graph In accordance with the regulations made under the Companies Act 1985, it is necessary to include a performance graph which measures the Companys total shareholder return calculated by reference to the Companys share price, including dividend reinvestment against that of a broad equity market index.
For this purpose the Committee considers that the Morgan Stanley Capital International Total Return Index in Sterling, the FTSE All-Share Total Return Index and the Investment Trust Net Assets Total Return Index are the most suitable indices for comparative purposes.
The graph below therefore compares the Companys total shareholder return to that of these three indices over the last 5 years.

A proposal to increase this limit to 300,000 is to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Non-executive Directors do not take part in discussions on their own remuneration.
The Board, on the recommendation of the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee, adopted the following structure for the determination of the annual fees of the non-executive directors from 1 October 2004: Basic fee 20,000 Committee membership fees: Audit Committee 3,000 Nominations Committee 1,000 Remuneration and Conflicts Committee 3,000 Valuation Committee 3,000 Committee Chairmanship fee per committee 1,500 The non-executive Directors each have letters of appointment that are subject to termination upon one months written notice on either side.
Directors Service Contracts It is the policy of the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee not to grant service contracts with notice periods in excess of one year.
The terms and conditions of the Directors service contracts are detailed below and are reviewed as required.
Lord Rothschild and Duncan Budge both have service agreements with J. Rothschild Capital Management Limited.
Lord Rothschilds service agreement is dated 29 April 1996, but was initially with an associated company and originally dated 20 October 1993.
The agreement can be terminated, inter alia, by either party giving the other not less than twelve months written notice.
It provides for benefits in kind in line with normal company practice, including pension provision, private health insurance and a company car.
The agreement determined on Lord Rothschilds 65th birthday and is currently on a rolling one year basis.
The agreement does not specify compensation payable in the event of early termination.
Duncan Budges service agreement is dated 29 August 1996, but was originally with an associated company and dated 6 August 1985.

It provides for benefits in kind in line with normal company practice, including pension provision, life assurance, permanent health insurance, private health insurance and a company car.
When considering the size of any proposed termination payment, the Committee would take into account a number of factors including the health, length of service, age and the performance of the relevant executive, including the duty to mitigate his own loss, with a broad aim to avoid rewarding poor performance while dealing fairly with cases where the departure is due to other reasons, such as illness.
