0138 11-20 Remuneration Report 6 4 05 9:32 am Page 11 Remuneration report This report to shareholders provides information on the remuneration and share interests of all Kingfisher Group Directors, and the criteria by which that remuneration has been determined.
It has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 and the applicable UK Listing Authorities UKLA listing rules.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee has responsibility delegated to it by the Board for determining the remuneration and benefits of Executive Directors and approving those of senior executives who report directly to an Executive Director or the Chief Executives of B&Q, Castorama France or Brico Dpt.
The Committee also oversees the administration of Kingfishers employee share schemes and determines the level of fees for the Chairman of the Board, which are set by reference to his time commitment and relevant benchmark data.
The Committee aims to ensure that senior executives including Executive Directors of the Company are rewarded for their contribution to Kingfisher and are motivated to enhance returns to shareholders.
It advises the Board on the remuneration framework and policy for such senior executives and, once formally endorsed by the full Board, it applies the policy.
The Committee is chaired by John Nelson and comprises a further two independent, Non-Executive Directors, Michael Hepher and Margaret Salmon: all three of whom have been members for at least two years.
The Chairman of the Company, Sir Francis Mackay, resigned as a member in September 2004 to comply with the requirements of the Combined Code.
There have been no other members during the year.
The Chairman of the Board and the Group Chief Executive are invited to attend meetings of the Committee but not when their own arrangements are considered.
Advice During the year the Committee sought the advice of Kingfishers Group Director of Human Resources Tony Stanworth and was supported by the Company Secretary Helen Jones.
The Committee has also appointed the following external advisers: New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, also appointed by the Company to advise on the ongoing operation of employee and executive share plans: Allen & Overy appointed by the Committee to provide ongoing legal advice to the Committee on contracts for and other employment and remuneration issues in relation to Executive Directors and senior executives.
Allen & Overy were appointed in 2004 following a tender process and the Remuneration Committee intends to review the appointment of New Bridge Street against other similar firms.
This will not necessarily result in a change.
New Bridge Street currently also provides advice to the Company on the technical aspects of the operation of the shares element of the Kingfisher Incentive Scheme KIS scheme as well as the Save As You Earn and Executive option schemes.
Additionally, Towers Perrin is requested by the Company periodically to provide advice on market positioning of remuneration for executives and Non-Executive Director fee levels in the UK and overseas.
Information subject to audit The following sections, on pages 11 to 20, of the Directors Remuneration Report are audited: Components of Executive Directors Remuneration Annual bonus and long-term incentives the summary of performance criteria upon which the award or exercise of share options are conditional: Executive Directors remuneration table and notes: Executive Share Options: Savings-related share option scheme: Other Share Awards: Closed incentive plans except for compliance with guidelines on dilution limits: Directors pension benefits and the Non-Executive Directors remuneration table and notes.
Remuneration policy for Executive Directors The Committee intends that Executive Director remuneration, both in terms of base salary and total remuneration, should be competitive by reference to the individual experience of the executive concerned, the role fulfilled and the markets in which the Company competes.
This is designed to promote business success through the recruitment, retention and motivation of the highest quality executives.
This policy is consistently applied across the Group for the remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior managers.
Components of Executive Directors remuneration Salaries and benefits Salaries are reviewed annually in August, taking into account criteria such as market conditions affecting executive remuneration, affordability, the level of increases awarded to staff generally and the individuals contribution.
In addition, the Company provides a range of additional benefits, including life and medical insurances, membership of a Company pension scheme, subsidised staff canteen, staff discount card, 30 working days holiday per year and a company car or a cash allowance.
Current salaries for each Executive Director are detailed in the Remuneration Overview section starting on page 14.
Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 05 11 0138 11-20 Remuneration Report 5 4 05 1:34 pm Page 12 Remuneration report continued Annual bonus and long-term incentives In 2003 the shareholders supported the adoption of the Kingfisher Incentive Scheme comprising the Kingfisher Annual Cash Incentive Scheme 2003 KIS Cash scheme and the Kingfisher Incentive Share Scheme 2003 KIS Shares scheme through their approval of the KIS Shares scheme.
Under these arrangements, all senior executives receive a performance-related cash bonus under the KIS Cash scheme.
This is matched by a contingent share award under the KIS Shares scheme equal in value at the time of award to the cash bonus.
The contingent share award must be held for three years before it vests, with the shares being subject to forfeiture should the executive leave Kingfisher during the three-year deferral period as a result of voluntary resignation or dismissal for cause.
The number of shares conditionally awarded may be increased by up to 40% multiplier award depending on the relative Total Shareholder Return TSR performance of the Company against the constituents of the FTSE 100 over the three-year period following the year for which the bonus was earned.
At above median performance, 10% of these shares will vest, increasing on a straight-line basis to 40% at above upper quartile performance.
In addition, the Committee must also be satisfied that the TSR performance is reflective of underlying performance for such awards to vest.
The FTSE 100 was chosen as the comparator group because there is a general lack of directly quoted home improvement businesses against which to compare the Companys TSR specifically and because major shareholders, when consulted, indicated their preference for the chosen comparator group.
TSR was selected as the most appropriate measure for the multiplier award as it is robust, aligns executives interests with those of shareholders and is generally favoured by the Companys leading UK institutional shareholders.
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP will independently carry out the relevant TSR calculations for the Committee.
Awards under the Kingfisher Incentive Scheme result in up to 63% approximately of Executive Directors annual remuneration opportunity excluding pensions being performance-related: an approach that is appropriate for Kingfisher as a dynamic international retailer.
Substantial awards under the KIS Cash scheme and the KIS Shares scheme are only payable to executives on achievement of demanding performance targets as agreed with the Committee at the beginning of each year, based on Kingfishers strategic and financial planning process and the economic and competitive environment in which the Company and its principal businesses operate.
Assuming target performance is fully achieved, each component is valued at 60% of base salary for Executive Directors, giving a combined value equivalent to 120% of salary.
In years when Kingfisher achieves performance significantly in excess of target, Executive Directors can earn up to a maximum of 82.5% of base salary in each of cash and contingent share awards, giving a maximum performance related potential of 165% of base salary before any impact of the TSR multiplier.
The Committee has discretion to adjust awards up or down where it concludes that a particular individuals contribution warrants a different level of award but subject to the maximum combined level of 165% of base salary.
If the executive does not work for Kingfisher throughout the whole of the financial year, payment under the KIS Cash scheme for that year is at the discretion of the Committee to determine the appropriate level.
Where Kingfisher terminates an executives contract without notice or without proper cause, or on retirement, then, reflecting the fact there will be no entitlement to awards under the KIS Shares scheme, the executive may receive a cash replacement of the equivalent value of the KIS Shares scheme award, pro rata for the period of the financial year he was employed, subject to the discretion of the Committee to decide the appropriate level of such bonus.
The Committee has established formal Share Ownership Guidelines which prohibit Executive Directors selling shares obtained through the plans except to meet tax obligations until they hold shares worth at least 1 times base salary 2 times for the Group Chief Executive.
The Committee believes that this, together with the KIS Shares scheme deferral period, will provide a longer-term retention mechanism and means that, over time, executives will have a significant personal interest in Kingfisher shares.
The Committee believes these arrangements align executives and shareholders interests effectively and encourage a long-term view of performance.
Key performance targets For Kingfisher Directors and senior executives at the corporate centre, the key performance targets for the annual bonus applicable to the KIS Cash scheme and the KIS Shares scheme for the financial year ended 29 January 2005 focused on: 1.
Group return on invested capital: 3.
Total Group sales growth: and 4.
Ian Cheshire, having divisional responsibilities, was judged against Group return on invested capital for 25% of his total bonus potential with the remaining 75% potential being assessed on the International divisions performance in the areas shown below excluding return on invested capital for the operating company targets.
Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 05 12 0138 11-20 Remuneration Report 2 4 05 10:29 am Page 13 The operating company targets were: 1.
Operating profit for the relevant company: 2.
Return on invested capital for the relevant company: 3.
Operating company total sales growth: and 4.
For the financial year ended 29 January 2005, the bonus payments for each of the Executive Directors are set out in the table in the section Directors Remuneration Overview on page 14.
As, in certain respects, the performance achieved was below the targets set for the year, bonus payments fell below on-target levels to between 67.0% and 78.1% of salary, including the value of the KIS shares 2003 04: 150.5% to 154.9%.
In respect of the financial year ending 28 January 2006, the key performance targets for Gerry Murphy and Duncan Tatton-Brown are: 1.
For Ian Cheshire 25% of his bonus will be on Group profit after tax with 75% being targeted in respect of the International divisions performance on: 1.
Return on invested capital of the relevant companies: 2.
Apart from the Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, all other option and incentive arrangements have been discontinued, but awards made in previous years will vest over time, in accordance with the rules governing the various plans.
The details are shown in the section entitled Directors Remuneration Overview on pages 14 to 18.
The Committee has been advised that this remuneration structure is competitive but not excessive when compared with relevant external benchmarks.
Executive Directors service contracts All Executive Directors and UK senior executives have service contracts terminable by no more than 12 months notice by either side, with no different arrangements applying in the event of termination following a change of control.
For senior executives not employed from the UK, the same principles apply, but there are local laws and regulations which mean it is possible that, subject to length of service and reasons for termination, more than 12 months notice has to be given.
The full details of the Executive Directors contracts are summarised below.
The contracts for Gerry Murphy, Ian Cheshire and Duncan Tatton-Brown provide that termination payments would be paid on a phased basis at a monthly rate of 15% of annual salary for a maximum of 12 months.
Lower amounts are payable if the Director starts lower paid employment during the 12 month period and payments cease immediately when employment providing the same or higher value remuneration is started.
To reflect the arrangements entered into on his appointment, Gerry Murphy would, in addition, continue to receive for the same period a monthly Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme FURBS pension contribution or Earnings Cap supplement at a reduced rate of 30% of his monthly salary above the Earnings Cap see pensions paragraph on page 14.
Bill Whiting, whose contract was dated 16 March 2004, resigned as an Executive Director on 28 January 2005 and retires from the Company on 31 March 2005 at the age of 57.
At the point of retirement his contract provided for a three month notice period, with liquidated damages in lieu of notice had the contract been terminated in breach of its terms or on a change of control.
However, no compensation was or will be paid and no additional contributions in excess of the normal requirements of the pension scheme have been or will be made.
Date of Notice last contract period Gerry Murphy 16 03 2004 12 months Ian Cheshire 16 03 2004 12 months Duncan Tatton-Brown 16 03 2004 12 months All Executive Directors contracts terminate automatically upon reaching normal retirement age, currently 60.
Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 05 13 0138 11-20 Remuneration Report 2 4 05 10:30 am Page 14 Remuneration report continued Payments to former Directors Salary and benefits, totalling 42,707, were paid to a former Director, Helen Weir.
This was in respect of her continued employment with the Company for the period to 31 March 2004 after her resignation as a Director on 31 January 2004.
In the year ended 29 January 2005 no Director received any payment in compensation for loss of office.
Pension provision Scheme details Bill Whiting joined Kingfisher before the introduction in 1989 of the Earnings Cap under which the Company is restricted from providing an approved funded pension entitlement in respect of salary above the Earnings Cap, 102,000 as at 29 January 2005.
He is a member of the Kingfisher Pension Scheme, a funded pension arrangement providing a pension on retirement at age 60 of up to two-thirds of his final pensionable salary, most normally the highest base salary in the three years immediately prior to retirement.
He retires on 31 March 2005 at age 57 with an entitlement to an annual pension which will be actuarially reduced to reflect his retiring three years early.
Gerry Murphy, Ian Cheshire and Duncan Tatton-Brown joined Kingfisher after the introduction of the Earnings Cap and are members of the main funded arrangement which was available to all UK employees who joined the Group prior to 1 April 2004, the Kingfisher Pension Scheme, which provides a pension on retirement at age 60 of 1 60th of base salary up to the Earnings Cap for each year of pensionable service.
In the event of death during employment, dependants would receive a pension and a lump sum from the scheme relating to the employees contributions during the period of membership and life insurance equal to four times the amount of the Earnings Cap.
On leaving the employment of the Group before retirement, they would become entitled to a deferred pension.
All three Executive Directors accrue benefits in Kingfishers final salary pension scheme on earnings up to the limit of the Earnings Cap.
This limit is set to fall away in April 2006 as a result of announced tax changes but, to avoid escalation of costs, the Company intends to introduce a scheme Earnings Cap broadly in line with the Government set Earnings Cap.
Gerry Murphys pension arrangements also include a contribution to a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme FURBS of 176,331 for the year to 29 January 2005 which, when aggregated with the Earnings Cap supplement explained above and detailed in note 1 to the the table below, gives a total combined pension supplement of 40% of his salary above the Earnings Cap.
The provision of a FURBS will be reviewed in the light of the impending changes to pension provision required by the Finance Act 2004.
There is no intention to increase the Companys costs as a result of this review or as a result of introducing a scheme determined Earnings Cap.
Under the Kingfisher Pension Scheme Gerry Murphys benefits accrue at the same rate as those for Ian Cheshire and Duncan Tatton-Brown.

Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 05 14 0138 11-20 Remuneration Report 6 4 05 9:31 am Page 15 KIS share awards In the financial year ended 29 January 2005 the following share awards were made under the KIS shares scheme, in respect of the financial year ended 31 January 2004 and were disclosed last year.
These shares would normally vest from April 2007.
As they are structured as nominal cost options on payment of 1 they can be exercised within a period of six months starting from the vesting date.

To receive further shares under the application of the TSR multiplier the TSR over the three-year period following the year for which the bonus was earned must be above the median for the comparator group FTSE 100 Index.
Further details of the TSR multiplier are described on page 12.
2 Unlike the other Executive Directors, Gerry Murphy did not receive the normal and final grant of options in April 2003.
Consequently his contingent share award made under the KIS in April 2004 is subject to the TSR multiplier, details of which are described on page 12.
In addition, as explained on page 12, under the KIS Shares scheme contingent shares, vesting in April 2008, to the value of 335,187, 113,866 and 128,865 are due to be awarded on 6 April 2005 at the average mid-market price over the period 1 April to 5 April 2005 to Gerry Murphy, Ian Cheshire and Duncan Tatton-Brown respectively.
As provided under the KIS Shares scheme rules, the share award can increase by up to 40% depending on the Companys TSR performance over the next three years.
As the share award will be made after approval of the accounts for the financial year ended 29 January 2005, these details will be included in an appropriate table in next years annual report.
Under the KIS Shares scheme rules no allocation of shares can be made to Bill Whiting as he retires before the award of KIS shares is granted.
In view of his contribution to the Group over 23 years, the Remuneration Committee, as allowed under the rules, awarded all of his bonus in cash.
Half of the 149,000 cash bonus awarded to Bill Whiting, therefore, is equivalent in value to the element he would have received in shares had he not retired on 31 March 2005.
With effect from 1 August 2004, Gerry Murphy, Ian Cheshire and Duncan Tatton-Brown were awarded base salary increases of between 3% and 10% per annum.
The increases were reflective of the market for each role.
As Bill Whiting retires on 31 March 2005, no salary increase was awarded in August 2004.
A similar market driven approach was taken with other salary increases awarded to management, administrative staff and store staff in the UK.
Overall, the increases for the management, administrative and store staff averaged 4.3%.
Year-on-year the total base salary bill for Executive Directors fell, in absolute terms, from 2,013,750 to 1,695,000 15.8% and increased by 20,000 1.2% in total from 1,675,000 when comparing the salaries of the same roles adjusting Bill Whiting to half time.
The total costs including benefits and cash bonuses fell, in absolute terms, from 3,743,250 to 2,577,000 31.2% and from 3,238,100 to 2,687,100 17.0% when comparing the same roles adjusting Bill Whiting to half time.
The current base salaries of the Executive Directors are: Gerry Murphy 865,000 Ian Cheshire 340,000 Duncan Tatton-Brown 330,000 The following fees for acting as Non-Executive Directors of companies not part of the Kingfisher Group were earned and retained by the individual: Gerry Murphy 56,811 Ian Cheshire 42,500 Kingfisher allows each Director and senior executives other than Gerry Murphy to accept and hold one non-executive role outside the Group.
Gerry Murphys contract allows him to take two non-executive roles with the consent of the Chairman, but, in accordance with the Combined Code requirements, only one FTSE 100 company directorship.
To date he has only held one non-executive appointment at any one time and holds none at the publication date.
All appointments are subject to conflict checks.
Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 05 15 0138 11-20 Remuneration Report 6 4 05 9:28 am Page 16 Remuneration report continued Savings-Related Share Option Scheme A UK Savings-Related Share Option Scheme will continue to be open to all eligible employees, including Executive Directors, in the UK.
As is the case with all savings-related share option schemes open to all employees, there are no performance criteria provisions.
Following his retirement, Bill Whiting will be entitled to continue to save the monthly amount for a further six months, after which he can either exercise options over the number of shares to which his then level of savings entitles him, or continue to save under the savings contract and lose the right to the options.

In accordance with the terms of his appointment the value of the award was 360,000 as of the date of his appointment and the number of shares awarded was based on the Companys share price of 192.5p on that date 3 February 2003.
2 Awards were granted on 17 April 2003 when the share price was 239.17p pre the seven for eight consolidation in July 2003, equivalent to 273.34p per share post consolidation.
The number of shares shown in the table are the number of shares awarded on a post consolidation basis.
3 No matching shares vest for below median performance.
490,908 is the post consolidation maximum number of matching shares which may vest for upper quartile TSR performance over the three-year performance period reducing to one-third for median performance.
4 If Gerry Murphys employment terminates before any vesting date by reason of death, injury, ill health, early termination by Kingfisher other than for cause or resignation for good reason as defined in his service contract, then the investment shares will vest at that date and, subject to the discretion of the Committee in certain limited circumstances, such of the matching shares as can be treated as vested, taking into account TSR performance up to the date of cessation of his employment, but reduced on a time pro-rated basis.
5 Following an investment of 275,000 in the shares of the Company by Gerry Murphy, up to a further 285,960 matching shares, which vest for upper quartile TSR performance over the three-year performance period reducing to one-third 95,320 for median performance, were awarded on 28 April 2004 at a price of 288.5p when the market price of the shares was 286p.
6 As the awards are structured as nominal cost options on payment of 1 they can be exercised within a six month period starting from the vesting date.
No variations to the terms and conditions of the awards were made during the year and no awards vested or lapsed during the year.
If Gerry Murphy invests his own funds in the Companys shares at the beginning of the 2005 06 financial year up to a limit of one-third of his then base salary and meets the required TSR performance targets in the three-year period following the date of purchase, he will also be awarded matching shares up to a maximum of three times the number of shares he has purchased.
Gerry Murphy has already invested in an additional 50,394 Kingfisher shares current value approximately 149,000 against which matching shares will be awarded in due course.
He has indicated his intention to purchase further shares before the end of April and is, therefore, likely to qualify to be awarded the maximum number of matching shares.
The precise number of matching shares will be disclosed in next years Remuneration Report.
No further awards under this arrangement will be made after the end of April 2005.
Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 05 16 0138 11-20 Remuneration Report 5 4 05 1:42 pm Page 17 Closed incentive plans There are three further long-term incentive plans, the Executive Share Option Scheme, the Incentive Growth Plan IGP and the Kingfisher Incentive Plan KIP, which are now closed and under which no further awards will be made, but where there are amounts from prior awards which may still become exercisable or due at the end of their respective vesting periods, performance cycles or deferral periods.
Any such amounts will vest or be paid, before the plans are wound up.
The full details of each can be found in previous Annual Reports.
The outstanding awards are as follows: Executive Share Options This scheme closed in June 2003.
The last grants were made on 17 April 2003.
Other than those granted to Gerry Murphy, the options vest from three to 10 years of the grant date subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition which generally requires the Earnings Per Share EPS of the Company to have increased over a three-year period by Retail Price Index RPI plus 6%.
The criteria were set and approved by shareholders when the scheme was established in 1993 and were judged at the time to be appropriate criteria.
The options granted to Gerry Murphy were part of the terms of his recruitment and have the same performance criteria except that he has agreed that they can only be tested on the third anniversary of grant or, if not satisfied, on the fourth anniversary of grant from a fixed base.
In the period 1 February 2004 to 29 January 2005, the highest and lowest market price for Kingfisher shares was 270.5p and 317.25p respectively.
The market price at close of business on 28 January 2005 was 303.75p.
Although the standard does not apply to this type of disclosure, and there are certain features of the standard that would not be appropriate for this purpose, the Committee will have regard to the standard when providing similar information in the future.
This may result in restatement of the figures for the current year.
2 In addition to these options, phantom options of 91,350 and 113,757 were granted to Ian Cheshire and Bill Whiting respectively, at the same price, with the same performance conditions and over the same maturity periods.
On exercise only the cash equivalent to any gain will be paid and disclosed as remuneration at that time.
