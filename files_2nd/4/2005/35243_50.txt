Report on directors remuneration Remuneration committee The committee consisted of Mr Yeatman and Mr Neathercoat and was chaired by Mr Farnes.
None of the members has any personal interest in the matters decided by the committee, nor any day to day involvement in the running of the business and, therefore, are considered to be independent.
The committee meets at least three times a year to consider the terms and conditions of employment of the executive directors, to set remuneration levels and to operate the groups performance related bonus scheme and share-based long-term incentive schemes.
During the year, New Bridge Street Consultants LLP provided the performance statistics required to operate the share option scheme and long-term incentive plan and advised the committee on the impact that the pensions simplication legislation to be enacted on 6th April 2006 A day will have on remuneration policy.
They provide no other services to the company.
No director had any involvement in determining his own remuneration although some of the matters considered by the committee were discussed with Mr Burns.
Policy The committees objective in formulating the remuneration policy for the executive directors is to ensure that the company attracts, employs and motivates executives with the skills and experience necessary to make a significant contribution to the delivery of the groups objectives.
When setting the level of remuneration, the committee aims to achieve broad comparability with other FTSE 250 companies that have delivered similar long-term returns to shareholders whilst having particular regard to the levels of remuneration prevailing in the property sector.
The committee recognises the importance of aligning, as far as possible, the interests of the directors with those of the shareholders.
To this end, a combination of basic salary, annual bonus and long-term incentives is used, by which the committee aims to provide a significant proportion of the directors total remuneration through performance related elements.
Service contracts The service contracts of Messrs Burns, Silver and Odom are dated 20th May 1997 whilst those of Messrs George and Williams are dated 31st March 1999.
The contracts have no stated termination date but require 12 months notice of termination.
A provision is included whereby the company will pay, by way of liquidated damages, a cash amount equivalent to 12 months salary and benets in kind plus a pension contribution or salary supplement of at least 20% of basic salary.
The remuneration committee reviews the service contracts periodically.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts and are appointed for three year terms which expire as follows: Mr Ivey, 12th December 2008: Mr Yeatman, 30th November 2006: Mr Neathercoat, 28th February 2008 and Mr Farnes, 31st March 2006.
Basic salary and benets The basic salaries for the executive directors are reviewed annually by the remuneration committee having regard to the remuneration policy set out above.
Pension contributions for the executive directors are based solely on basic salaries and paid into a dened contribution scheme.
As a result of the changes to pension legislation introduced by A Day, the committee has decided that, if requested, directors may receive, at no extra cost to the company, a salary supplement in lieu of their pension contribution.
The principal benets in kind comprise a company car and medical insurance.
The remuneration for non-executive directors, which consists of fees for their services in connection with board and board committee meetings and, where relevant, for additional services such as chairing a board committee, is set by the whole board.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for pension scheme membership and do not participate in the companys bonus or share-based incentive schemes.

No bonus will become payable for below median performance.
A further one-third of base salary will be available by determination of the remuneration committee but only where performance is considered truly exceptional.
