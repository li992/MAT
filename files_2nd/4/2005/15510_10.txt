Report to shareholders by the Board on directors remuneration A Introduction This Report outlines the Companys policy on remuneration of executive and non-executive directors of the Company and senior executives of the Group and details actual remuneration of both executive and non-executive directors of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2005.
During the year the remuneration of the Chairman and the executive directors was considered by the Companys Remuneration Committee.
The fees of non-executive directors were reviewed and determined by the Board.
This Report will be put to an advisory vote of shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The Board unanimously recommends that shareholders vote in favour of this Report.
B The Remuneration Committee: i Membership The Remuneration Committee was established by the Board with effect from 19 May 2003.
The Committee currently comprises the following non-executive directors: P C F Hickson Chairman M K Atkinson K R Flaherty W K Koepf D F McWilliams P C F Hickson became a member and was appointed Chairman of the Committee on 6 May 2004.
D F McWilliams became a member of the Committee on 30 November 2004.
In accordance with the best practice recommendations of the Combined Code the Committees members are all independent of management and free from any business or other relationship, which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
ii Terms of reference The Committee operates in accordance with written terms of reference, which have been determined by the Board and take into account best practice and the requirements of the Combined Code.
The Committee meets formally at least twice a year and otherwise as required.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board on broad policy to be adopted for executive remuneration and on the total remuneration packages of the Chairman and the executive directors and certain other senior executives of the Group.
This includes, where appropriate, the determination of basic salary, cash bonuses and other incentive scheme entitlements, other benefits including pensions and the terms of individual service agreements.
The Committee has access to the advice and services of Elisa Nardi, the Group Human Resources Director, and Peter Harris, the Head of Compensation, Pensions and Benefits, neither of whom have been formally appointed by the Committee.
The Committee also takes the advice of the Chairman and Chief Executive, as appropriate, on the performance of executive directors and other senior executives but they do not participate in any discussion relating to their own remuneration.
Kepler Associates have advised the Committee on executive remuneration policy and practice and provide no other services to the Company.
iii Remuneration policy and practice Since 1 April 2004, the Committee has undertaken a review of the Companys remuneration arrangements for executive directors and certain other senior executives of the Group and of market practice in conjunction with its advisers Kepler Associates.
The key principles adopted by the Committee following the review are: remuneration will be set at levels which enable the recruitment and retention of talented executives: short and long-term incentives are required to retain and motivate executives to continue to deliver value to shareholders: and rewards will be dependent on performance and top-performing executives should attain base salaries and total remuneration above market medians and vice versa.
The main elements of remuneration of the Chairman and the executive directors during the year to 31 March 2005 were: basic salary: share based incentives: and pension.
31 Report to shareholders by the Board on directors remuneration continued During the year to 31 March 2005 the Chairman and the executive directors were remunerated by a combination of fixed and performance related elements.
Fixed remuneration consists of basic salary, pension and benefits in kind.
Performance related remuneration consists of share options.
The performance related elements of remuneration are intended to provide a significant proportion of their potential total remuneration.
Following the review of the Companys remuneration plans shareholders will be asked at the Companys forthcoming Annual General Meeting to amend the Companys Articles of Association to allow participants in the Management Plan see below to participate in the Companys Annual Incentive Plan.
Basic salary Basic salaries for the Chairman and the executive directors are normally reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee.
The general approach adopted by the Committee, when determining the level of salaries, is to take into account business performance, individual performance and skills and external competitiveness in conjunction with other elements of remuneration.
In assessing competitiveness, the Committee considers pay levels primarily across European companies in similar or adjacent market sectors, companies of a similar size, companies with whom we may compete for executive talent and pay levels generally across the Marconi Group.
As a result of the 2005 annual review, the basic salary of P S Binning was increased to 325,000 with effect from 1 July 2005.
During the year the Committee reviewed the remuneration arrangements for the Chairman, J F Devaney.
The Committee determined that, with effect from 1 December 2004, he would no longer participate in any future performance related incentive plans although he will retain historical option awards.
His basic salary was accordingly revised to 350,000.
Share based incentives The Company currently operates the Marconi Corporation plc Senior Management Share Option Plan the Management Plan, the Marconi Corporation plc Employee Share Option Plan the Employee Plan and the Marconi Corporation plc Sharesave Plan the Sharesave Plan.
The Remuneration Committee will determine, if appropriate, any future grants under these plans.
1 The Management Plan Options may be granted under the Management Plan for a period of up to five years from 19 May 2003 the Plan start date.
Under the initial grant made on 24 June 2003, options become exercisable in five tranches between 12 and 63 months after the Plan start date subject to the achievement of the following performance conditions: Percentage of shares subject to option that vest Participants who released Retention and emergence Other Tranche plan rights participants Condition 1 20 10 Repayment of 30% of the Junior Notes within 24 months after the Plan start date.
Options will not be exercisable before 12 months after the Plan start date.
2 10 10 Repayment of 50% of the Junior Notes within 27 months after the Plan start date.
Options will not be exercisable before 15 months after the Plan start date.
3 20 20 Repayment of 100% of the Junior Notes within 30 months after the Plan start date.
Options will not be exercisable before 18 months after the Plan start date.
4 20 30 The Company achieving a market capitalisation of 1 billion and repayment of 100% of the Junior Notes within 39 months after the Plan start date.
Options will not be exercisable before 27 months after the Plan start date.
5 within 51 months within 51 months The Company achieving a market capitalisation of 1.5 billion and of the Plan start date of the Plan start date repayment of 100% of the Junior Notes within 63 months after the 30 30 Plan start date.
Options will not be exercisable before 39 months after the Plan start date.
between 51 months between 51 months and 63 months of the and 63 months of the Plan start date Plan start date 20 20 Does not apply to P S Binning and J F Devaney.
P S Binnings options became exercisable in relation to 20 October 2003 being the date of commencement of his employment with the Company, rather than the Plan start date.
32 These performance conditions and the numbers of options granted to each participant were determined in order to: provide an incentive to deliver value to the Companys shareholders through the repayment of debt and growth in market capitalisation: and provide a level of reward appropriate to the Companys performance.
In order for tranche 5 to become exercisable, the rolling average market capitalisation must exceed the stated target for a 90-day period.
The performance criteria in respect of tranches 1 to 4 have now been met and tranches 1 to 4 have vested.
Options were granted to P S Binning, J F Devaney and M W J Parton under the Management Plan.
Details are set out on page 41 of this report.
Each of these grants is subject to the performance conditions explained above although the dates on which the option granted to P S Binning becomes exercisable differ.
No director holds any share options or any other long-term incentive, which are not subject to performance conditions.
No further grants will be made to the Chairman or the executive directors under the Management Plan.
2 The Employee Plan Options may be granted under the Employee Plan for a period of up to five years from 19 May 2003.
Options granted under the Employee Plan only become exercisable to the extent that the performance targets to which they are subject have been satisfied.
The performance targets and vesting schedule for the initial grant of options are the same as those for the initial grant under the Management Plan.
Further options were granted under the Employee Plan in December 2004 subject to performance conditions, which are aligned with the initial grant of options.
These conditions are: Market capitalisation achieved after date of grant Percentage of shares under option that become exercisable Below 1.35 billion 0% 1.35 billion 25% if achieved before 19 August 2007 16.67% if achieved before 19 August 2008 1.5 billion and above 100% if achieved before 19 August 2007 66.67% if achieved before 19 August 2008 Between 1.35 billion and 1.5 billion percentage of shares vesting will be prorated i no option can become exercisable within 24 months of grant: and ii any option, which does not become exercisable before 19 August 2008, will lapse.
The exercise price of options under the Employee Plan is determined by the Remuneration Committee and is not less than the middle market price of the Companys shares as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List on a date or dates, in the case of an average quotation not more than 30 days prior to the date of grant of the options or such other period as the Inland Revenue may agree in relation to Inland Revenue Approved Options.
No options have been granted to the Chairman or the executive directors under the Employee Plan.
3 The Sharesave Plan The Sharesave Plan was approved by shareholders at the 2004 annual general meeting.
Options granted under the Sharesave Plan are linked to a savings contract, the proceeds of which may be used to exercise the option.
All employees including the Chairman and the executive directors are eligible to participate in the Sharesave Plan.
A total of 1,724, 274 options were granted to employees under the Sharesave Plan on 3 February 2005.
The Remuneration Committee will determine if any future grants will be made under the Sharesave Plan.
Cash bonuses Annual Incentive Plan As referred to above, the Company, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, will ask shareholders, at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, to amend the Companys Articles of Association, by the deletion of Article 111, to allow participants in the Management Plan to join the Companys Annual Incentive Plan with effect from 1 October 2005.
Article 111 provides that without the approval, by ordinary resolution, of the members of the Company in general meeting, no participant in the Management Plan other than persons eligible to receive sales related bonuses or commissions can participate in any annual bonus arrangement or any long-term incentive plan before the date on which all the tranches of options granted in the initial grant under the Management Plan have lapsed or become capable of exercise.
More details on this proposal can be found in the letter from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee to shareholders accompanying this Report.
33 Report to shareholders by the Board on directors remuneration continued Pension P S Binning, J F Devaney and M W J Parton are members of the Groups approved UK pension scheme, the GEC 1972 Plan.
Payment of pension benefits is not linked to performance.
They have a normal retirement age of 62, other than J F Devaney who has a normal retirement age of 65.
J F Devaney was admitted to the GEC 1972 Plan under standard terms and conditions with effect from 19 May 2003 and has accrued benefits in the GEC 1972 Plan since that date.

Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Schemes FURBS were operated during the year for P S Binning and M W J Parton.
A review of retirement benefits for the Chairman and the executive directors has been instigated as a result of the enactment of the Finance Act 2004 and the Pensions Act 2004.
Proposals resulting from this review will be presented to the Remuneration Committee during the financial year ending on 31 March 2006.
Further details about the benefits of the Chairman and the executive directors under the GEC 1972 Plan and FURBS can be found in section G. Other benefits In addition to basic salary the Chairman and the executive directors receive certain other benefits including car allowance, private medical insurance and life assurance.
C Directors service agreements The Remuneration Committee determines the terms and conditions of the Chairmans and the executive directors service agreements with the Company including duration, notice period and termination provisions.
It is the Companys policy that: service agreements should be on rolling terms subject to individual retirement and termination provisions see below and have notice periods not exceeding one year: and in determining any termination provisions or payments, the Remuneration Committee will pay due regard to both individual circumstances and the need for mitigation.

35 Report to shareholders by the Board on directors remuneration continued D Non-executive directors The policy on remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the Board, by reference to practice in companies similar in size to the Company and reflects the importance and increasing complexity of the role.
Prior to 1 January 2005 the basic fee of each non-executive director was based on two days service to the Company per month.
The non-executive directors could also be paid a fee of 1,500 per day for each additional day devoted to the Companys business over and above the threshold of 24 days per annum in respect of Board service plus an additional four days per annum in respect of chairmanship of Board committees where applicable.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee received an additional fee of 15,000 per annum and the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee an additional fee of 10,000 per annum.
A new fee structure for all non-executive directors was agreed by the Board on 22 December 2004, and was effective from 1 January 2005.
The new arrangements are as follows: Committee Senior Committee Chairman Independent membership Name of director Basic fee fees Director fee fees Total fees M K Atkinson 35,000 20,000 15,000 5,000 75,000 K R Flaherty 35,000 5,000 5,000 45,000 P C F Hickson 35,000 15,000 5,000 55,000 W K Koepf 35,000 13,000 48,000 D F McWilliams 35,000 10,000 45,000 The non-executive directors are also paid advance fees, which, by agreement with the non-executive directors, are specifically used to purchase shares in the Company.
These fees are paid in advance for each of the corresponding years of their appointment as follows: Name of director Year one Year two Year three M K Atkinson 100,000 30,000 30,000 K R Flaherty 30,000 30,000 30,000 P C F Hickson 30,000 30,000 W K Koepf 100,000 30,000 30,000 D F McWilliams 30,000 30,000 30,000 The non-executive directors must hold the shares purchased in year one included in section H i for three years from the date of their appointment and those purchased in years two and three for one year from the respective purchase dates.
If an appointment is terminated for any reason during any year, for which an advance fee has been paid, the director concerned is obliged to repay the advance fee for that year, less an amount pro rata to the time served during the year.
The Chairman has discretion to waive the holding periods if he considers there to be a valid reason to justify this.
Non-executive directors do not participate in any other incentive scheme or the Groups pension arrangements and receive no further benefits or entitlements.

TSR is defined as the return shareholders would receive if they held a notional number of shares in the Company.
It measures the percentage growth in the Companys share price together with the value of any dividends paid, assuming that the dividends are reinvested in the Companys shares.
The following graphs show, since 19 May 2003, being the date on which the Companys shares commenced trading on the London Stock Exchange, the TSR on a holding of shares in the Company as against that of a hypothetical holding of shares made up of shares of the same kinds and number as those by reference to which the FTSE 250 Index is calculated.
The FTSE 250 Index was selected for this purpose as it is a widely recognised performance comparison for UK companies of a similar size to the Company.

2 All directors are reimbursed all necessary and reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of their duties.
3 M J Donovan resigned as a director of the Company on 1 November 2004.
Remuneration detailed above relates to the period until 31 December 2004, being the date on which his employment with the Company terminated.
The salary payment shown includes an additional allowance paid in respect of holiday entitlement accrued but not taken before 31 December 2004.
The termination payment shown relates only to those payments made, or costs accrued, by the Company in the period from 31 December 2004 until 31 March 2005.
Fuller details of his severance arrangements are included in sections C and G. 4 Fees for non-executive directors also include any additional fees where appropriate.
Advance fees shown above are those applicable, on a pro rata basis, to the year ended 31 March 2005.
Fuller details are set out in section D. W K Koepfs remuneration also includes additional sums paid to him in respect of his non-executive chairmanship of two German subsidiary companies of the Company.
G Retirement benefits The Chairman and the executive directors are members of the Groups principal pension scheme, the GEC 1972 Plan, which is a defined benefit scheme.
The last actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2002.
Members contribute at the rate of 3% of pensionable earnings, subject to limits imposed by the Inland Revenue.
Company contributions made during the year ended 31 March 2005 amounted to 8.2% of pensionable earnings.
Such Company contributions were restricted in a similar manner to the members own contributions.
Details of the Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Schemes FURBS operated during the year for P S Binning, M J Donovan and M W J Parton are set out below.
The Company made contributions to the FURBS established for M W J Parton during the year ended 31 March 2005.
A gross contribution of 35% of basic salary is paid as a pension allowance, 60% of which is payable to the FURBS established for him and the balance of 40% is paid direct to M W J Parton.
The Company made contributions to the FURBS established for P S Binning during the year ended 31 March 2005.
A gross contribution of 25% of basic salary is paid as a pension allowance, 60% of which is payable to the FURBS established for him and the balance of 40% is paid direct to P S Binning.
Until the date that M J Donovan left the employment of the Company, contributions were made to the FURBS established for him to provide benefits at his normal retirement age of 62 equivalent to a pension of two-thirds of average final pensionable salary.
The targeted benefit took into account the capital value of benefits arising from Mr Donovans membership of the GEC 1972 Plan and any relevant benefit in payment or otherwise arising from previous employment.
The contribution rate was 39% of his base salary, although while he was posted to the United States the rate was 46% owing to local tax legislation.
Contributions were paid in the ratio of 60% directly to the FURBS established for him and 40% to M J Donovan, or as required under United States tax law.
38 As Mr Donovan had a defined benefit promise, in respect of his FURBS, an actuary assessed the amount that was paid in contributions periodically in order to meet the promise.
In such an arrangement, the amount actually required to meet the promise can only be assessed accurately at the date at which the benefit is paid.
The settlement payment, as referred to in section C above, was paid to Mr Donovan in order to finalise his retirement benefits as at his date of leaving the employment of the Company.
The Company took advice from an independent actuary about the settlement payment which was deemed fair and reasonable and in the interests of both parties.
In the event of death in service, a lump sum of four times basic salary, plus additional benefits for a surviving spouse and or children, inclusive of any death benefits arising from the GEC 1972 Plan and from previous employment where specified, will be held in trust for the benefit of dependants of P S Binning and M W J Parton.
In the case of J F Devaney a lump sum of four times basic salary, inclusive of any death benefits arising from the GEC 1972 Plan, will be held in trust for the benefit of his dependants.
In accordance with the requirements of the Listing Rules and the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, the disclosures required for the year ended 31 March 2005 are set out below.
Listing Rules tax unapproved benefits The pension benefits earned by the directors of Marconi Corporation plc under the FURBS arrangements are: Increase decrease in accrued pension Cost of pension Length of over the period to benefits accrued Accumulated total pensionable 31 December 2004 during the period net of accrued pension at service net of inflation members contributions 31 December 2004 Name of director Years 000 000 000 M J Donovan 6 8 48 79 M J Donovans appointment as a director of the Company terminated on 1 November 2004 and his employment with the Company terminated on 31 December 2004.
Until the date that M J Donovan left the employment of the Company, his defined benefit FURBS arrangement existed to provide a pension equivalent to two thirds of average final pensionable earnings, inclusive of benefits provided by the GEC 1972 Plan and from other employment retained benefits.
The value of retained benefits and those from the GEC 1972 Plan have increased during the year resulting in a lower cost to fund the FURBS promise.
The pension entitlement shown above is that which would be paid annually at normal retirement based on service to 31 December 2004.
The increase in accrued pension during the period excludes any increase for inflation.
Contributions paid to M J Donovans FURBS during the period were 61,303 2004: 87,648.
