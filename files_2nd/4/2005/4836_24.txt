Apart from the information relating to individual remuneration, share options, share interests and pensions information on pages 48, 49 and 51 to 54, the information contained in this report is not subject to audit.
The purposes of this report are to inform shareholders of the Companys policies on directors remuneration in operation for the 52 weeks ended 30 April 2005, of the policies applicable to the 52 weeks ending 29 April 2006 and the intended policies thereafter, and to provide details of the remuneration of individual directors as determined by the Remuneration Committee.

REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The Board has delegated to the Remuneration Committee responsibility for determining the Groups policy in relation to and specic approval of the remuneration package and terms and conditions of employment for each of the executive directors and for other senior executives of the Group and policy in relation to the implementation and operation of the Groups employee share schemes.
In setting the policy the Committee has regard to pay scales, bonus arrangements and benets below senior management level.
The Committees full terms of reference may be found on the corporate website.
Throughout the period, the Remuneration Committee comprised three of the independent non-executive directors, John Whybrow Chairman, Andrew Lynch and Rita Clifton.
The Remuneration Committee met five times during the period.
The members of the Committee attended all of its meetings.
The Chairman, Chief Executive and the Group Human Resources Director attend meetings of the Committee by invitation in an advisory capacity.
Meetings are also attended by the Director of Employee Reward and the Company Secretary who acts as secretary to the Committee and occasionally by representatives of remuneration consultants.
Nobody attends any part of a meeting at which their own remuneration is discussed.
At the beginning of the financial period, the Committee implemented a revised remuneration policy for the executive directors and other members of senior management based on a report commissioned from KPMG LLP in the previous year.
The Committees report setting out details of the revised policy was overwhelmingly approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting held on 8 September 2004.
No significant changes to the principal elements of the policy have been introduced for the financial period beginning on 1 May 2005.
KPMG LLP has continued to provide advice to the Committee from time to time.
KPMG LLP received fees from the Group of 1,264,000 in respect of internal audit, corporate finance work and other accounting advice throughout the year.
The Committee remains satisfied of their independence of view in relation to remuneration matters.
Watson Wyatt Partners LLP has provided advice to the Committee in relation to the impact of the Finance Act 2004 on the Groups pension arrangements.
Separate partners of Watson Wyatt provide actuarial advice to the trustees of the Dixons Retirement and Employee Security Scheme DRESS and to the Company, and investment advice to the trustees.
Fees of 155,000 were paid to Watson Wyatt Partners LLP.
REMUNERATION POLICY Executive directors The remuneration policy aims to: ensure that remuneration fairly recognises and rewards the contribution of individual directors and senior executives to the attainment of the Groups short and longer term results and in appropriate cases the performance of individual trading divisions and business units: maintain, particularly through reward schemes based on performance, a competitive package of pay and other benets which provides the motivation for future achievement: facilitate, in an increasingly competitive retail and international environment, the building and retention of a high calibre and focussed team which will work effectively to achieve the Groups longer term strategic objectives: align the directors interests with those of shareholders by offering participation in schemes which provide opportunities to build shareholdings in the Company: and facilitate effective succession planning.
46 Dixons Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 05 In implementing this policy, the Remuneration Committee takes account of information and surveys from internal and independent sources and the remuneration paid for comparable positions in FTSE 100 companies, especially those operating internationally.
It reviews data and surveys provided by remuneration consultants and market research companies on the scale and composition of the total remuneration packages payable to people with comparable responsibilities, qualications, skills and experience in businesses of similar size and structure.
The main components of the remuneration of the executive directors are as follows: i Basic salaries These reect the Remuneration Committees assessment of the market rate for relevant positions and levels of responsibility and the individual directors experience, performance and value to the business.
Basic salaries were increased at the start of both the 2004 05 and the 2005 06 financial periods, to coincide with the Group-wide pay reviews.
ii Performance related remuneration The performance based element of remuneration is designed to strengthen the alignment between the interests of the Companys shareholders and its senior management and to encourage management retention.
For years prior to and including 2003 04, the executive directors participated in the Deferred Equity Participation Plan DEPP which provided both an annual cash bonus and deferred equity participation.
A bonus based on the level of growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share EPS was payable partly in cash and partly in shares, the share element being matched by the Company on a basis determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Shares awarded under the DEPP were allocated to a share bank, a proportion of which was released to participants annually after a retention period whilst they remained in the Groups employment.
In this way the value of share awards reected the performance of the Company over a number of years, the participants retained a continuing interest in the shares of the Company and were encouraged to remain with the Group.
For the financial period ended 1 May 2004, the maximum bonus payable to the Group Chief Executive was based on 100 per cent of basic salary for EPS growth of 20 per cent with a maximum payable to other participating executive directors of 85 per cent of basic salary.
EPS growth of 10 per cent would generate bonuses of 70 per cent and 59.5 per cent, respectively.
Any bonus earned was payable 60 per cent in cash and 40 per cent in shares with a one for one match.
No bonuses were payable unless EPS growth exceeded 5 per cent.
Bonuses earned in relation to the financial year 2003 04 were based on EPS growth of 9.5 per cent.
For this purpose, EPS growth excluded the additional operating profit arising from the changed accounting policy in relation to customer support agreements described in the Annual Report and Accounts 2003 04.
The cash element earned 60 per cent is shown in the directors remuneration table on page 51.
The value of shares earned 40 per cent with a one for one match were: John Clare 312,000, David Longbottom 124,000, Kevin OByrne 69,000.
The DEPP has ceased to operate for financial years beginning after 1 May 2004.
Half of the shares held in share banks were released on 29 April 2005.
The balance will be released at the end of April 2006 subject to participants remaining with the Group.
For 2004 05 and 2005 06 performance based remuneration comprises an annual cash bonus plan based on the achievement of the Groups or, in the case of other participating executives below Board level, divisional targets and participation in the Companys Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
Bonus payments relating to 2004 05 were as follows: John Clare 70,000, David Longbottom 35,000 and Kevin OByrne 35,000.
For 2005 06 the performance measures will be EPS growth and free cash ow.
Free cash ow is a key focus for the Group and has therefore been incorporated into the annual bonus plan.
Maximum overall cash bonuses remain at 100 per cent of basic salary for the Chief Executive, 85 per cent for the other executive directors and 80 per cent for other participating Executives.
50 per cent of the maximum bonus will be earned for achievement of the targets and the maximum bonus will be earned for substantially exceeding targets.
Targets are set using benchmarks that reect both internal and external expectations, along with earnings estimates for other retailers in the forthcoming year.
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the targets are challenging.
Before approving bonus payments, the Remuneration Committee will confirm that awards reect genuine improvement in the Groups underlying financial performance.
Dixons Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 05 47 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Under the LTIP, which replaced the DEPP in 2004 05 and will operate also in 2005 06, performance is measured in terms of the Total Shareholder Return TSR achieved by the Company over a three year period relative to the companies comprising the FTSE 100 Index.
The maximum award of performance shares, for performance in the upper quartile, is equivalent to 50 per cent of basic salary at the date of the provisional award in the case of the executive directors, 45 per cent for the members of the Group Executive Committee and 40 per cent for other participating executives.
No awards are payable for performance below the median TSR achieved by the comparator group.
At the median performance, awards will be 20 per cent, 18 per cent and 16 per cent of basic salary respectively.
Prior to vesting, the Remuneration Committee will satisfy itself that the TSR performance achieved reasonably reects the financial performance of the Group and will reserve the right to vary awards accordingly.
The number of shares which have been provisionally awarded under the LTIP are: 2005 06 2004 05 Median Maximum Median Maximum award award award award John Clare 93,802 234,507 81,674 204,186 David Longbottom 44,366 110,915 38,132 95,330 Kevin OByrne 49,295 123,239 36,714 91,787 Shares held in share banks under the DEPP and shares provisionally awarded under the LTIP are shown in the table of directors restricted interests on page 52. iii Share options The Remuneration Committee approves the bases on which options are granted to executive directors and employees throughout the Group under the Companys discretionary share option schemes.
Options are granted annually to executive directors and other senior executives over shares having a market value equal to twice their basic salary.
Prior to 2005 06, options were granted to other employees in the UK and overseas on the basis of management grade and to employees with more than three years service.
Options were granted to over 14,000 employees in 2004 05.
Executive directors are also entitled to participate in the Sharesave Scheme on the same conditions as other employees.
Over 11,000 employees currently participate in Sharesave schemes.
