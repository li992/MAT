Taylor Woodrow Report and Accounts 2005 41 Directors Remuneration Report continued Directors contracts It is the companys policy that executive directors should have contracts of employment providing for a maximum of one years notice.
However, it may be necessary occasionally to offer longer notice periods to new directors.
Where this arises, it is the companys policy to reduce the notice period to one year within one year of appointment of the director.
The details of the directors contracts are summarised in the table below: Name Date of contract Unexpired term Notice periods Notice periods Normal retirement Age months Company months Director months age Iain Napier 10 January 2002 12 12 12 60 56 Peter Johnson 1 November 2002 12 12 12 60 51 Graeme McCallum 2 October 2003 12 12 12 60 59 It is the companys policy that liquidated damages should not apply on the termination of an executive directors contract.
In accordance with this approach, payment for early termination of contract without cause by the company is, in the case of each of the executive directors, to be determined in accordance with normal principles of English law, which requires mitigation of liability on a case by case basis.
Any such payment would typically be determined by reference to the main elements of a directors remuneration, namely, salary, contractual bonus, benefits-in-kind and pension entitlements.
The executive directors' contracts contain no express provisions relating to a change of control of the company.
In such event the directors rights and entitlements would be ascertained as stated above.
Non-executive directors None of the non-executive directors has a service contract, as their terms of engagement are regulated by letters of appointment as follows: Name of director Date of initial letter Term of Notice period by Notice period by of appointment appointment Company months Director months Norman Askew 25 July 2003 3 years 3 3 Mike Davies 29 September 2003 3 years 1 1 Lady Robin Innes Ker 21 May 2001 Initially 3 years, 1 1 now 1 year and reviewed annually Andrew Dougal 31 October 2002 1year, reviewed 1 1 annually Vernon Sankey 15 December 2003 3 years 1 1 Proposed for re-appointment at the Annual General Meeting Initial term, subject to review on first anniversary and annually thereafter.
Their fees are determined by the Board based on research of fees paid to non-executive directors of similar companies within the FTSE 150 index and the sector peer group, subject to the aggregate annual limit of 600,000 imposed by the Articles of Association.
The fees of the chairman were increased on 1 July 2005 from 150,000 to 170,000 per annum.
The basic fees of each nonexecutive director were increased on 1 January 2005 from 37, 500 to 39,000.
The Senior Independent Director and the Audit Committee Chairman each receive an additional fee of 10,000 and the Remuneration Committee Chairman receives an additional fee of 5,000 in respect of these services.
Nonexecutive directors cannot participate in any of the companys share option plans and are not eligible to join the companys pension scheme.
Their fees are generally reviewed at two-yearly intervals.
