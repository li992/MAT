Vedanta Resources plc Annual Report 2005 Remuneration Report Introduction The Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policies and practices adopted by the Company during the year ended 31 March 2005 in respect of members of the Board.
The Groups operations are primarily managed in India and the senior management team is largely based there.
It is not possible, therefore, to gain a meaningful understanding of the Companys approach to Executive Directors remuneration without putting it into the context of the wider management structure.
This Remuneration Report therefore also sets out the remuneration policies and practices relating to the Executive Directors in this broader Group context.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations.
Part II of this report contains the information on which the auditors are required to report to the Companys members.
PART I Remuneration Committee the Committee The Chairman of the Committee is Mr Naresh Chandra, who was appointed to this role on 24 November 2004, having previously been appointed to the Committee on 14 June 2004.
The other members of the Committee are Messrs Euan Macdonald and Aman Mehta.
The Committee is primarily responsible, on behalf of the Board, for setting the remuneration policy and remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and for maintaining an awareness of the overall remuneration of the key operational and functional heads within the Group the Senior Management Group.
The Committees aim is that the Executive Directors and the Senior Management Group are rewarded appropriately for their contribution to the Group and are motivated to enhance the return to shareholders.
The Committee is directly responsible for setting the remuneration packages for the Executive Directors.
Mr Anil Agarwal, in his capacity as Executive Chairman, and Mr KK Kaura, in his capacity as Chief Executive, attend meetings of the Committee by invitation.
No Director plays a part in any discussions about his own remuneration.
The Committee has involved Mr S Venkatesh Head of Human Resources, in his capacity as Minutes Secretary to the Committee, in determining the remuneration and benets offered to the Executive Directors during the year, and the Committee has also consulted Mr Anil Agarwal to a lesser degree in this regard.
During the year, the Committee sought independent advice from  LLP PwC, in their capacity as remuneration advisers to the Committee, concerning remuneration levels for certain of the Directors.
PwC provided no other services to the Company in the UK during the year.
The Indian associate rm of PwC provided internal assurance services to the Group during the year.
The Australian associate rm of PwC are the external auditors to one of the Groups operating companies in Australia, Thalanga Copper Mines Pty Limited.
PwC are no longer the remuneration advisers to the Committee.
The Committees terms of reference have been reviewed during the year to ensure that they reect the recommendations of the Code.
A copy of the terms of reference of the Committee is available from the Company Secretary.
Remuneration Policy Over the past few years, the Group has moved its emphasis away from developing the capability of its senior management team through active external recruitment, towards a policy of developing management from within the existing operations.
Consequently, the remuneration policies adopted by the Group are less concerned about remuneration packages that support an aggressive approach to the recruitment of senior managers, seeking rather to ensure the continued retention and incentivisation of managers.
This principle applies to the Executive Directors and Senior Management Group as a whole, most of whom are located in India, and who are critical to ensuring the successful management of the Groups activities and implementation of the strategy.
The policy of the Group, therefore, is to reward the management competitively, enabling the Group to motivate and retain high calibre executives.
The Group is particularly concerned to ensure that managers are motivated and incentivised to continue to perform at the highest levels.
The following factors are taken into account when setting remuneration levels for the Executive Directors and the Senior Management Group: levels of remuneration throughout the Group: market practices prevailing in the countries in which executives work: and market practices in the Indian mining and industrial sectors in respect of operational management and in all sectors in respect of corporate and supporting functions.
DELIVER Y AND GROWTH 55 Vedanta Resources plc Annual Report 2005 Remuneration Report continued The Group attempts to align the interests of the Executive Directors and Senior Management Group with those of the shareholders by linking share and cash incentives to corporate performance.
Therefore, the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and Senior Management Group comprise: a salary for day-to-day performance of duties: an annual bonus as an incentive to meet short-term goals these are set by reference to personal Key Result Areas KRAs and the financial performance of the Group: awards under the LTIP, referred to below, to incentivise long-term and strategic performance: and benets in kind in accordance with local market practice.
Salaries, Pensions and Other Benets Salaries and Cost to Company Salaries for the UK-based Executive Directors are established by reference to those prevailing in the employment market for company directors in the mining sector and comparable UK listed companies.
In India, salaries for Executive Directors and members of the Senior Management Group are set by reference to those positions of comparable status, skills and responsibility in the metals and mining industries, and in the manufacturing and engineering industries more generally.
The basic remuneration of executives in India is referred to as Cost to Company CTC which represents an aggregate gure encompassing basic pay, pension contributions and allowances.
Messrs Navin Agarwal and Kaura both have service agreements with Sterlite which have been augmented by letters of appointment with the Company.
On the dates of their respective appointments to the Board until 31 March 2005, Mr Navin Agarwal was entitled to CTC of INR 20,001,264 per annum and Mr Kaura was entitled to CTC of INR 12,500,000 per annum, pursuant to their Sterlite service agreements.
Letters of appointment were also agreed with Vedanta, under which Messrs Navin Agarwal and Kaura are each to be paid fees of 50,000 per annum, to reect the amount of time that they spend on Board business.
Messrs Navin Agarwals and Kauras remuneration have been set by reference to individuals with comparable roles and responsibilities in similar sized organisations in India.
Salaries are reviewed on an annual basis and changes will generally be implemented with effect from 1 April each year taking into account the period of service during the year.
The salary levels of the Executive Directors agreed by the Committee on 1 June 2005, to take effect from 1 April 2005, are as follows: Vedanta salary Sterlite salary level level from 1 April from 1 April 2005 Total Designation 2005 INR Equivalent Anil Agarwal Executive Chairman 467,500 467,500 Navin Agarwal Deputy Executive Chairman 50,000 22,001,390 326,400 KK Kaura Chief Executive 50,000 13,750,000 222,700 Peter Sydney-Smith Finance Director 275,000 275,000 Using an exchange rate of INR 79.61: 1 Pensions The Company does not provide pension benets to either Mr Anil Agarwal or Mr Sydney-Smith and this is reected in the determination of their overall remuneration packages.
The Indian-based Executive Directors are entitled to membership of the Central Provident Fund and a Superannuation Fund which provide pension benets consistent with local market practice.
These are dened contribution pension arrangements.
Contributions to the Central Provident Fund and Superannuation Fund are included within the CTC payable to an individual in India.

Mr Anil Agarwal is provided with a car and fuel in the UK for business and personal use.
For his frequent business trips to India, Mr Anil Agarwal is provided with a car and driver for business use and is entitled to the exclusive use of Company-owned accommodation.
Benets in kind provided to Indian-based senior executives are set in line with local market practice, and include private medical insurance, accident insurance, the use of a car and driver, and for certain individuals, the provision of accommodation, either in Company-owned or leased premises.
Messrs Navin Agarwal and Kaura are provided with Company-owned and leased accommodation, respectively.

Mr Navin Agarwal was also reimbursed club membership fees.
56 DELIVER Y AND GROWTH Vedanta Resources plc Annual Report 2005 Remuneration Report continued Annual Bonus The Company operates an annual bonus scheme providing the Executive Directors and the Senior Management Group with an opportunity to earn a cash amount based on the achievement of demanding annual performance targets.
The bonus targets are reviewed by the Committee at the beginning of the financial year over which performance will be measured.
The annual bonus is non-pensionable.
The maximum bonus payable to the Executive Directors is 100% of annual salary.
In respect of Messrs Navin Agarwal and Kaura salary means the aggregate of their salary payable from Vedanta and their CTC payable by Sterlite.
Performance conditions are attached to all bonus arrangements which are all set by reference to personal KRAs and the financial performance of the Group.
The majority of KRA targets relate to financial or operational measures, however certain KRAs monitor performance in respect of softer issues, or enablers, for example, people management and environmental performance.
For the year ended 31 March 2005, the payment of the annual bonus was dependent on the achievement of a combination of individual and corporate objectives, which closely correlated to the responsibilities of the individual and the Group budget for the year.
EBITDA was taken as the single parameter of corporate performance, and the weighting for this parameter was 50%.
An individuals performance against his KRAs, as reviewed in the annual performance appraisal, accounted for 40% of an individuals bonus weighting, with the remaining 10% of the bonus weighting being for the personal qualities of an individual.
Employee Share Schemes The Group aims to provide superior rewards for outstanding performance and a high proportion of at risk remuneration for Executive Directors.
Three employee share schemes were approved by shareholders on Listing.
The Board has no present intention to introduce any further share schemes.
The LTIP The Group intends that the LTIP will be the primary arrangement under which share-based incentives will be provided to the Executive Directors and Senior Management Group.
The Committee has decided to change the timing of the main awards under the LTIP to bring them in line with the Groups financial reporting cycle.
This will enable future grants to be awarded on the basis of performance during the previous financial year, as well as being subject to the performance conditions described below.
During 2005, the Committee will grant the main awards under the LTIP following the announcement of the Groups results.
A small number of awards were granted at the meetings in June 2004 and November 2004 for senior managers who joined the Group after the last main award in February 2004.
After November 2004, the majority of awards are expected be made on an annual basis following the announcement of the Groups results.
The maximum value of shares that can be conditionally awarded to an Executive Director in a year is 100% of annual salary.
In respect of Messrs Navin Agarwal and Kaura salary means the aggregate of their salary payable by Vedanta and their CTC payable by Sterlite.
The maximum value of shares that can be awarded to members of the Senior Management Group is calculated by reference to the balance of basic salary and share-based remuneration consistent with local market practice.
The performance condition attaching to outstanding awards under the LTIP is that the Companys performance, measured in terms of Total Shareholder Return TSR being the movement in a companys share price plus reinvested dividends, is compared over a three-year period with the performance of the companies constituting the FTSE Worldwide Mining Index excluding precious metals from the date of grant.
The extent to which an award vests will depend on the Companys TSR rank against the comparator group at the end of the three-year performance period.
The vesting schedule is shown in the table below, with straightline vesting in between the points shown and rounding down to the nearest whole share.
Vedantas TSR Performance against Index % of Award Vesting Below median 0 At median 40 At or above upper quartile 100 The performance condition will be measured by taking the Companys TSR over the four weeks immediately preceding the date of grant and over the four weeks immediately preceding the end of the three-year performance period, and comparing its performance with that of the comparator group described above.
The information to enable this calculation to be carried out on behalf of the Committee will be provided by the Companys advisers.
The Committee considers that this performance condition, which requires that the Companys total return has out-performed the mining sector, provides a reasonable alignment of the interests of the Executive Directors and the Senior Management Group with those of the shareholders.
No awards will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that the Companys TSR performance reasonably reects the Companys underlying financial performance.
Details of the awards held by the Executive Directors at 31 March 2005 are shown in the table of Directors Long Term Incentive Awards on page 61.
DELIVER Y AND GROWTH 57 Vedanta Resources plc Annual Report 2005 Remuneration Report continued The Reward Plan The Reward Plan was adopted for the purpose of rewarding 43 employees none of whom were Executive Directors at the time of the Group who had contributed to the Companys development and growth over the period leading up to Listing.
It was used solely to provide awards on Listing and no further awards will be granted under the Reward Plan.
Under the Reward Plan, awards were made in respect of 776,000 shares on 26 February 2004 and vested in two instalments.
The first half of the award vested immediately and the shares were issued on 31 March 2004.
The other half of the award, vested on the first anniversary of the date of award subject generally to the employees continued employment at that date.
Consequently a total of 388,000 shares were issued on 18 and 31 March 2005.
Awards made under the Reward Plan are not subject to performance conditions as these were considered to be rewards for past service rather than incentives for future performance.
Two Executive Directors Messrs Navin Agarwal and Kaura received vested shares under the Reward Plan, although, in both cases, the initial awards were made prior to their appointments to the Board.
The Vedanta Resources Share Option Plan the Share Option Plan The Share Option Plan was adopted to provide maximum exibility in the design of incentive arrangements over the long-term.
However, at this stage, it is not intended that share options will be granted in the foreseeable future under the Share Option Plan.
Total Shareholder Return Performance Graph The graph below shows the TSR performance of the Company in comparison with that of the FTSE 250 Index and the FTSE Worldwide Mining Index excluding precious metals for the period from 10 December 2003 the date of Listing to 31 March 2005.
The FTSE 250 Index has been chosen as a suitable comparator index because it comprises UK listed companies of similar size and complexity to the Company.
The FTSE Worldwide Mining Index excluding precious metals is presented as it is the comparator group for the LTIP.
To provide more detail, the graph presents performance on a monthly basis rather than using year end dates as required by the Regulations.

Assuming the Executive Directors receive the maximum bonus entitlement and full vesting of the maximum LTIP awards, the chart above right demonstrates the balance of fixed and variable pay in these circumstances for the Executive Directors.
Executive Directors Service Contracts Mr Anil Agarwal and Mr Sydney-Smith are both employed under contracts of employment with the Company which may be terminated by not more than six months and twelve months notice, respectively.
Provision is made in both their contracts for payments to be made in lieu of notice on termination.
