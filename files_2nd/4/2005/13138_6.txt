159711 Reed Report 28-54 7 3 06 12:04 Page 42 42 Directors remuneration report d 2005 awards In this section, we set out the awards made to executive directors during 2005 under the terms of our long term incentive plans.
LTIS awards 2005 was the second year of the 200406 performance cycle under the LTIS, for which a single block grant was made in 2004.
ESOS grants made in the year and executive directors elections under the Bonus Investment Plan BIP are shown in the following table: BIP Matching Share Options Shares Share Type No.
of Shares Option Price No.
At executive director level, the current requirement is that they should own shares equivalent to 1.5 times salary and that this shareholding should be acquired prior to any payout being made under the LTIS in February 2007.
Under the proposed terms of the revised LTIS, the shareholding requirement for the Group Chief Executive Officer will subject to shareholders approval increase from 1.5 times to three times salary and for other Executive Directors from 1.5 times to two times salary the revised shareholding requirements to be met by February 2009.
Details of directors shareholdings, as at 31 December 2005, are set out on page 53. f Service contracts Executive directors are employed under service contracts which generally provide for one years notice and neither specify severance payments nor contain specific provisions in respect of change in control.
The service contracts for executive directors and for approximately 130 other senior executives contain the following provisions: covenants which prevent them from working with specified competitors, recruiting Reed Elsevier employees and soliciting Reed Elsevier customers for a period of 12 months after leaving employment: in the event of their resigning, they will immediately lose all rights to any awards under the LTIS, ESOS and BIP granted from 2004 onwards, whether or not such awards have vested: and in the event that they join a specified competitor within 12 months of termination, any gains made in the six months prior to termination on the exercise of an LTIS, ESOS and BIP award made from 2004 onwards shall be repayable.
159711 Reed Report 28-54 7 3 06 12:04 Page 43 Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2005 43 g Policy on external appointments The Committee believes that the experience gained by allowing executive directors to serve as non-executive directors on the boards of other organisations is of benefit to Reed Elsevier.
Accordingly, executive directors may, subject to the approval of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, serve as non-executive directors on the boards of up to two non-associated companies of which only one may be to the board of a major company and they may retain remuneration arising from such appointments.
Sir Crispin Davis is a non-executive director of GlaxoSmithKline plc and received a fee of 70,000 a102,200 during 2005.
Erik Engstrom is a non-executive director of Eniro AB and received a fee of 22,108 a32,277 during 2005.
Andrew Prozes is a non-executive director of the Cott Corporation and received a fee of 27,377 a39,971 during 2005.
B. Non-executive directors a Policy Reed Elsevier seeks to recruit non-executive directors with the experience to contribute to the board of a dual-listed global business and with a balance of personal skills which will make a major contribution to the boards and their committee structures.
With the exception of G J fide Boer-Kruyt, who serves only on the supervisory board of Reed Elsevier NV, non-executive directors, including the Chairman, are appointed to the boards of Reed Elsevier Group plc, Reed Elsevier PLC and the supervisory board of Reed Elsevier NV.
Non-executive directors remuneration is determined by the three boards as appropriate to the director concerned.
The primary source for comparative market data is the practice of FTSE50 companies, although reference is also made to AEX companies.
Non-executive directors, including the Chairman, serve under letters of appointment, do not have contracts of service and are not entitled to notice of, or payments following, termination.
During the year the Reed Elsevier Group plc board introduced a charity donation matching programme for non-executive directors.
Under the policy, where a non-executive director donates all or part of their fees to a registered charity, the company may, at its sole discretion, make a matching donation to any charity, provided the charitys objectives are judged to be appropriate and are not political or religious in nature.
Messrs Reid and Zelnick each donated a proportion of their fees in respect of 2005 to charity and, in accordance with the programme the company made matching charitable donations of 22,500 a32,850 and 30,000 a43,800, respectively.
b Fee levels Non-executive directors receive one annual fee in respect of their memberships of the boards of Reed Elsevier PLC, Reed Elsevier NV and Reed Elsevier Group plc.
The fee paid to G J fide Boer-Kruyt, who serves only on the supervisory board of Reed Elsevier NV, reflects her time commitment to that company and to other companies within the Reed Elsevier combined businesses.
Non-executive directors are reimbursed for expenses incurred in attending meetings.
They do not receive any performance related bonuses, pension provisions, share options or other forms of benefit.
Fees may be reviewed annually, although in practice they have changed on a less frequent basis and were last reviewed with effect from 1 May 2003.
The fee for Mrs fide Boer-Kruyt was last reviewed with effect from 1 January 2004.
Annual fee rates applicable to non-executive directors and to the Chairman are set out in the following table: Annual fee Annual fee 2005 2004 Chairman i J Hommen from April 2005 g350,000 i M Tabaksblat until April 2005 g280,000 a280,000 Non-executive directors 45,000 g65,000 45,000 a65,000 Chairman of: Audit Committee 7,000 g12,000 7,000 a12,000 Remuneration Committee 7,000 g12,000 7,000 a12,000 i Mr Hommen was appointed in April 2005, when Mr Tabaksblat retired.

159711 Reed Report 28-54 7 3 06 12:04 Page 44 44 Directors remuneration report C. Statutory disclosures a Report authorship This report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee of Reed Elsevier Group plc.
It has been prepared in accordance with the UK Regulations and the Dutch Code issued in December 2003 in order to meet the requirements of the UK Combined Code of Corporate Governance issued in July 2003, the Dutch Code and the Netherlands Civil code.
b Remuneration committee constitution and terms of reference The Committee is responsible for: recommending to the boards the remuneration in all its forms of the Chairman and the executive directors, including terms of service contracts and all other terms and conditions of employment: providing advice to the Board and to the Chief Executive Officer on major policy issues affecting the remuneration of executives at a senior level below the board: and the operation of all share-based plans.
A copy of the Terms of Reference of the Committee can be found on the Reed Elsevier website www.
The Remuneration Committee met six times during the year.
Mr van Lede was unable to attend one meeting, otherwise there was full attendance.
c Advisors The Committee has appointed Towers Perrin, an external consultancy which has wide experience of executive remuneration in multinational companies, to advise in developing its performance-related remuneration policy.
Towers Perrin also provide actuarial and other Human Resources consultancy services directly to some Reed Elsevier companies.
The following individuals also provided material advice or services to the Committee during the year: Sir Crispin Davis Chief Executive Officer : Ian Fraser Group HR Director : and Philip Wills Director, Compensation and Benefits.
d Total Shareholder Return TSR As required by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, the following graphs show the Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV total shareholder return performance, assuming dividends were reinvested.
They compare the Reed Elsevier PLC performance with that achieved by the FTSE 100, and the Reed Elsevier NV performance with the performance achieved by the Euronext Amsterdam AEX Index, over the five year period from 20012005.
For the five year period since 1 January 2001, the TSR for Reed Elsevier PLC was a negative 13%, against a FTSE 100 return of 4%.
For Reed Elsevier NV during the same period, TSR was a negative 16%, against an AEX Index return of negative 22%.
As Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV are members of the FTSE 100 and AEX Index respectively, the Committee considers these indices to be appropriate for comparison purposes.
Reed Elsevier PLC total Reed Elsevier NV total shareholder return v shareholder return v FTSE 100 20012005 AEX Index 20012005 Reed Elsevier PLC Reed Elsevier NV FTSE 100 AEX Index The total shareholder return set out above is calculated on the basis of the average share price in the 30 trading days prior to the respective year ends and on the assumption that dividends were reinvested.
159711 Reed Report 28-54 7 3 06 12:04 Page 45 Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2005 45 e Service contracts Each of the executive directors has a service contract, as summarised below: Contract Date Expiry date Notice period Subject to: subject to notice period i G J A van fide Aast 15 November 2000 17 July 2017 12 months English law i M H Armour 7 October 1996 29 July 2014 12 months English law i Sir Crispin Davis 19 July 1999 19 March 2009 12 months English law i E Engstrom 25 June 2004 14 June 2025 12 months English law ii A Prozes 5 July 2000 Indefinite 12 months base salary New York law payable for termination without cause ii P Tierney 19 November 2002 Indefinite 12 months base salary New York law payable for termination without cause i Employed by Reed Elsevier Group plc ii Employed by Reed Elsevier Inc The Committee believes that as a general rule, notice periods should be twelve months and that the directors should, subject to practice within their base country, be required to mitigate their damages in the event of termination.
The Committee will, however, note local market conditions so as to ensure that the terms offered are appropriate to attract and retain top executives operating in global businesses.
No loans, advances or guarantees have been provided on behalf of any director.
f Auditable disclosures i Pensions in more detail The target pension for Sir Crispin Davis at normal retirement age of 60 is 45% of base salary in the 12 months prior to retirement.
Other executive directors based in the UK are provided with pension benefits at a normal retirement age of 60, equivalent to two thirds of base salary in the 12 months prior to retirement, provided they have completed 20 years service with Reed Elsevier or at an accrual rate of 1 30th of pensionable salary per annum if employment is for less than 20 years.
The target pension for A Prozes, a US-based director, is US$300,000 per annum, which becomes payable on retirement only if he completes a minimum of seven years service.
The pension will be reduced in amount by the value of any other retirement benefits payable by Reed Elsevier or which become payable by any former employer, other than those attributable to employee contributions.
The target pension for P Tierney, a US-based director, after completion of five years pensionable service is US$440,000 per annum, inclusive of any other retirement benefits from any former employer.
In the event of termination of employment before completion of five years pensionable service, the pension payable will be reduced proportionately.
As US employees Messrs Prozes and Tierney also are eligible to participate in Reed Elseviers 401k plan, to which Reed Elsevier contributed 3,588 a5,239 and 4,031 a5,885, respectively for the year.
