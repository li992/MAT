Directors Remuneration Report Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the Report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on certain parts of this report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
This report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited Information Remuneration Committee The membership of the Remuneration Committee during 2005 was as follows: Period of membership 2005 P Kirby Chairman of Committee 10 Mar 31 Dec R Hooper 1 Jan 9 Mar S Watson 10 Mar 31 Dec D Mapp 1 Jan 31 Dec D Cruickshank 1 Jan 24 Jan Dr P Kirby replaced Mr R Hooper as Chairman of the Committee from 10 March 2005.
None of the members who served on the Committee during the year had any personal financial interest other than as a shareholder of the Company, conflicts of interests arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board.
In determining the Executive Directors remuneration the Committee consulted Mr P Rigby, Chief Executive, about its proposals although no Director played a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
The Committee also engaged independent advisers New Bridge Street Consultants LLP NBS to provide advice on the structure and operation of Directors remuneration packages.
NBS did not provide any other services to the Company or Group.
Remuneration Policy The remuneration of the Executive Directors is prudently designed to provide for a competitive compensation package which reflects the Groups performance against financial objectives and personal performance criteria.
It rewards above-average performance and is designed to attract, motivate and retain high-calibre executives.
The performance measurement of the Executive Directors and the determination of their annual remuneration packages are undertaken by the Committee.
There are five elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors as follows: basic annual salary: benefits: annual bonus: share incentives: and retirement and life assurance benefits.
The Companys policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the Executive Directors should be performance related.
As described further below, Executive Directors may earn annual bonus payments of up to 100% of their basic salaries, together with the benefits of participation in performance-based share incentive schemes.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside of the Company provided that the Chairmans consent is obtained.
During 2005 Mr P Rigby served as Non-Executive Chairman of Electric Word plc, for which he received and retained fees of 9,000 and, through October 2005, as Non-Executive Chairman of Conatus plc, for which no fees were received.
From February 2005 Mr D Gilbertson served as Non-Executive Chairman of John Brown Holdings Limited, for which he received and retained fees of 33,000.
From March 2005 Mr A Foye served as a Non-Executive Director of YouGov plc, for which he received and retained fees of 12,500.
Basic Salary The basic salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee prior to the beginning of each year and upon a change of position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers pay practices in the Group as a whole and makes reference to objective research which gives current information on appropriate comparator groups of companies.
Following a review at the end of 2004, the basic salaries of the Executive Directors were increased by 3% with effect from 1 January 2005.
Following the significant acquisition of IIR in July 2005, the Remuneration Committee considered whether to review again the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors, but chose to defer this review until the regular annual salary review at the end of 2005.
The review at the end of 2005 was undertaken with the assistance of independent remuneration consultants NBS and included a comparison of benchmark data from two comparator groups of companies one drawn from the FTSE All Share Media Index, of which the Company is a constituent company, and the other drawn from the FTSE All Share Index and comprised of companies of a broadly similar size to Informa in terms of market capitalisation, turnover and overseas operations.
Following its review the Committee concluded that it was appropriate to increase the basic salaries of the Executive Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 27 Directors Remuneration Report continued Directors with effect from 1 January 2006 to the following levels, which reflect the greater scale of the Groups business, the attendant increased responsibilities of the Executive Directors and their continued outstanding performance: 000 P Rigby, Chief Executive 550 D Gilbertson, Managing Director 520 A Foye, Finance Director 310 Benefits Each of the Executive Directors receives a benefit allowance of 25,000 per annum and private medical insurance cover.
In addition Messrs Rigby and Gilbertson receive permanent health insurance cover.
Annual Bonus Each of the Executive Directors has the opportunity to earn a bonus of up to 100% of basic salary, subject to the achievement of performance criteria set by the Committee.
In respect of the year ended 31 December 2005, as in the previous year, a bonus of up to 80% of basic salary could be earned based on achievement of adjusted diluted earnings per share EPS targets and up to 20% based on achievement of personal objectives, covering strategic, financial and operational areas.
On the basis of both corporate and individual performance and targets having been achieved, the Remuneration Committee determined that 100% bonuses had been earned by each of the Executive Directors, in a year in which exceptional operational demands had been placed upon them.
The Remuneration Committee continues to consider adjusted diluted EPS to be the most suitable financial measurement to determine performance and align the interests of the Executive Directors with those of the Companys shareholders as this measurement of performance can be directly influenced by the performance of the Executive Directors.
Therefore, the existing weightings will continue to apply for the year ending 31 December 2006.
Share Incentives Share Matching Plan In 2004 and 2005 the Company has operated a Share Matching Plan in which the Executive Directors could participate.
Following approval at the 2004 Annual General Meeting, the Share Matching Plan was amended to introduce a requirement for the Executive Directors to invest at least 50% of their annual bonuses net of tax and any other deductions, where such bonus exceeded half of annual basic salary, in the Companys shares.
Corresponding awards of free matching shares were then made under the Share Matching Plan.
In addition, the requirement was introduced for performance criteria to be achieved in order for the free matching shares to vest.
The first awards under the amended Share Matching Plan were made in April 2005, as set out on page 31.
Long-Term Incentive Plan Following a review by the Remuneration Committee and after consultation with the Companys principal institutional shareholders undertaken at the beginning of 2006, the Committee has concluded that the awards made to the Executive Directors in April 2005 should be the last made under the Share Matching Plan.
Instead, from 2006 the Executive Directors will be invited to participate in the Companys Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, introduced and approved by shareholders in 2005.
It is intended that the first grant of awards to Executive Directors under the LTIP will be made in 2006, when they will be given the alternative of: a maximum award of 100% of basic salary in the Companys shares, provided they are prepared to sacrifice 5% of that years basic salary: or a maximum award of 50% of basic salary in the Companys shares, with no salary sacrifice required.
The purpose of the higher award for a basic salary sacrifice is to encourage participants to share some of the risk for a greater level of potential benefit and also to help mitigate the cost to the Company of the LTIP.
The first awards made under the LTIP will vest subject to continued employment over a three-year performance period, including the year of award, and the satisfaction of performance conditions which will require both that: the Companys Total Shareholder Return is at least at the median compared to the companies constituting, at grant, the FTSE All Share Media Index: and the Companys average adjusted diluted EPS grows by at least RPI plus 5% per annum for 20% of the award to vest increasing to RPI plus 12% per annum for 100% of the award to vest.
The Remuneration Committee believes that these performance conditions are appropriate as they encourage both the generation of above market returns to shareholders and the delivery of substantial EPS growth.
The Committee will continue to review the performance conditions for appropriateness before making future grants under the LTIP.
Where applicable the Committee will also take account of the transition to International Financial Reporting Standards when determining the extent to which awards vest, with the overriding aim being to provide a consistent measurement of performance.
28 Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 Share Incentive Plan From January 2006 the Executive Directors, along with all other UK employees, are eligible to participate in the Companys Share Incentive Plan SIP, introduced and approved by shareholders in 2005.
The SIP is an Inland Revenue Approved All Employee Share Incentive Plan which offers UK employees the opportunity to purchase up to 1,500 of shares in the Company per annum out of pre-tax salary.
Share Options Prior to their merger in May 2004, both Taylor & Francis and Informa operated discretionary share option schemes for the benefit of the Executive Directors.
In the light of changes to the accounting treatment for share options and changing market practice, the Remuneration Committee decided not to grant options to Executive Directors during 2005 and does not intend to do so in the foreseeable future.
Details of subsisting options granted to the Executive Directors in 2004 and earlier are shown on page 32.
Share Ownership Guidelines During early 2006 the Remuneration Committee introduced formal share ownership guidelines requiring the Executive Directors to build up, over a three-year period and with pre-existing shareholdings taken into account, a holding in the Companys shares equal to at least 1.5 times annual basic salary.
Retirement and Life Assurance Benefits The Executive Directors are entitled to receive a contribution of 25% of basic salary toward their retirement arrangements.
Mr P Rigby receives a Company contribution of 25% of basic salary to his personal pension plan.
He received an additional employer contribution in respect of 2005 of 453,500 2004: 199,000, as described further on page 31.
The Company also provides life assurance cover providing for the payment of a lump sum in the event of the insureds death in service.
Mr D Gilbertson is a deferred member of the Informa Final Salary Scheme, a defined benefit scheme which provides for a pension on retirement of up to two thirds of final basic salary at the age of 60.
Dependants are eligible for dependants pension and the payment of a lump sum in the event of the members death in service.
Further details of the benefits accrued under the scheme are shown on page 33.
Mr Gilbertson also has a personal money purchase pension plan funding his pension above the earnings cap.
Through April 2005 the Company contributed to both schemes to the combined entitlement level of 25% of basic salary.
In consideration of forthcoming legislative changes, from May 2005 the Company ceased to contribute on Mr Gilbertsons behalf to either pension arrangement and instead began paying him a monthly payment in lieu of pension equal to 25% of basic salary after deducting any incremental National Insurance costs to the Company.
Mr A Foye was an active member of the Taylor & Francis Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme throughout the year.
This is a defined benefit scheme which provides for a pension on retirement of up to two thirds of final basic salary at the age of 63.
Performance Graph The graph below shows the Companys performance, measured by total shareholder return, compared with the performance of the FTSE All Share Media Index, also measured by total shareholder return, in the five-year period ended 31 December 2005.
The FTSE All Share Media Index has been selected for this comparison because the Company is a constituent company of that index.

In the event of early termination, each of the Executive Directors contracts provide for compensation equal to basic salary, bonus, benefits allowance and retirement benefit for the notice period.
Each of the Non-Executive Directors has specific terms of appointment, terminable by three months notice, but envisaged to be initially for three years.
The dates of the Directors original contracts are shown in the table below, although the contracts have been amended from time to time by letter agreement as required to reflect changes to, for example, salary or fee levels.
