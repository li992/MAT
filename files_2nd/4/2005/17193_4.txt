Directors remuneration report Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 the Act.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance the Code relating to Executive Directors remuneration.
As required by the Act, a resolution to consider and approve the report will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on certain parts of the Directors Remuneration Report and to state whether in their opinion these parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information.
Unaudited information Remuneration Committee Composition and advisors The Company has established a Remuneration Committee in accordance with the recommendations of the Code.
All the Companys independent Non-Executive Directors sit on the Remuneration Committee and have served throughout the year.
The names and personal details of the independent Non-Executive Directors can be found on pages 26 and 27.
Dr A D Portno is the senior Non-Executive Director and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
There have been no changes in the composition or chairmanship of the Remuneration Committee during the year.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest other than as shareholders, conflicts of interests arising from cross directorships, or day to day involvement in the running of the business.
The Remuneration Committee operates within agreed terms of reference, setting out its role and the authority delegated by the Board, which are reviewed at least annually.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the overall remuneration policy in relation to pay, incentives and benefits of the Executive Directors and the Chairman of the Company and for ensuring the appropriate implementation of that policy.
In addition, the Committee makes recommendations on and monitors the remuneration of the Directors of the principal subsidiary companies and monitors the remuneration policy of the first level of management below these subsidiary Boards.
The Remuneration Committee meets regularly and also periodically instructs external consultants to review the Executive Directors remuneration and the structure of the Companys share incentive schemes.
This review includes a comparison of the Directors remuneration with the remuneration of Directors in other companies of a similar size or within the sector.
These full reviews are undertaken at least every three years with other independent guidance sought as necessary.
The last full review by the Companys remuneration consultants, Towers Perrin, was completed in November 2004.
This review concluded that overall the remuneration of the Directors was at an appropriately competitive level and consistent with the Companys remuneration policy.
Following the review some changes have been made in the application of the Groups policy and these are explained in this report.
Since the review, the Committee is satisfied that the overall remuneration policy remains appropriate.
In determining the Executive Directors remuneration for the year, the Committee has consulted with Mr D W Wilson, the Chairman of the Board, and Mr I Robertson, Group Chief Executive.
None of the Executive Directors or the Chairman were involved in determining their own remuneration.
The following persons provided advice or services that materially assisted the Remuneration Committee in its consideration of Directors remuneration matters during the year: The Group Human Resources Director, Mr G A Headley, has provided information to the Remuneration Committee on relative pay both within the Wilson Bowden Group and in other organisations, particularly with regard to those sectors in which the Group operates: Towers Perrin have provided advice on specific matters in relation to the Executive Directors remuneration and the design and operation of the Companys share incentive schemes.
Towers Perrin do not provide advice on any other matters: Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, the Companys main legal advisors, have been appointed to advise the Remuneration Committee on compliance with the Act and the Code: and Internal support was provided to the Remuneration Committee by the Group Finance Director, Mr G M Brown, who acts as Secretary to the Committee.
Compliance The Company has complied with the Codes provisions relating to Directors remuneration throughout the year.
Remuneration policy General The Companys remuneration policy is designed to provide competitive packages to attract, retain and motivate highly talented and able executives consistent with the nature, scale and complexity of the Groups operations.
It is necessary to provide reward schemes that are fully competitive and offer sufficient incentive to secure and retain the services of knowledgeable and experienced individuals who have demonstrated a high level of ability and commitment, along with a high level of future potential.
To ensure the successful growth and development of the Group and maximise shareholder value, the highest levels of reward are targeted against the delivery of outstanding personal and corporate performance both in the short and long term.
No Director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.
Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report 2005 37 Directors remuneration report continued This report sets out the Companys remuneration policy for 2006 and, so far as practicable, for subsequent years.
The inclusion in the report of remuneration policy in respect of years after 2006 is required by the Regulations.
The Remuneration Committee is able to state its remuneration policy for 2006 with reasonable certainty, and this policy will continue unless changed by the Remuneration Committee in subsequent years.
The Remuneration Committee considers that a successful remuneration policy needs to be sufficiently flexible to take account of future changes in the Companys business environment and in remuneration practice.
Any changes to policy for years after 2006 will be described in future Directors Remuneration Reports, which will continue to be subject to shareholder approval.
The remuneration of the Executive Directors comprises four main elements: Basic annual salary and benefits in kind: Annual performance related bonus, which cannot exceed a specified percentage of salary: Share incentive plans: and Pension arrangements.
It is Company policy that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the Executive Directors should be performance related.
It is also Company policy that Executive Directors interests should be aligned with the interests of shareholders.
The Company achieves this by targeting bonus and share scheme awards against stretching performance criteria aimed at enhancing shareholder value and by encouraging Executive Directors to hold shares in the Company with a value equivalent to at least one times the Directors base salary.
Basic salary and benefits Salaries are normally reviewed annually, on 1st October, or when responsibilities change.
In deciding the appropriate levels, the Remuneration Committee takes into account the external advice it has received and the level of reward provided to comparable executives elsewhere in the sector, as well as the overall pay structure within the Wilson Bowden Group.
The benefits provided to each Executive Director comprise principally an appropriate fully expensed motor car, or equivalent cash allowance, and healthcare benefits.
The Executive Directors are encouraged to broaden their experience and knowledge by taking appropriate external non-executive appointments, provided the commitment required is consistent with their fulfilling their responsibilities to the Group.
Mr N H Richardson is a Non-Executive Director of Derby Cityscape Limited, a Government sponsored urban regeneration company, and Mr N J Townsend is Chairman of Leicester Shire Economic Partnership and a Director of Leicester Regeneration Company Limited.
No fees or other remuneration is received in respect of these external roles.
Annual performance related bonus Demanding budgets and targets are established by the Board, which are directly related to the delivery of the Companys strategy and business plans and to the achievement of personal and corporate objectives.
The performance achieved against these targets is reviewed by the Committee at the end of each financial year to determine the degree of achievement.
Each Executive Directors remuneration includes a performance related bonus expressed as a percentage of salary.
The percentage of salary payable as bonus in 2006, is dependent upon both the profit performance of the Company and its subsidiaries, and the successful delivery of personal objectives determined between each Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board and the Group Chief Executive at the beginning of each financial year.
The performance related bonus in 2006 will be earned on a similar incremental scale as 2005, with no bonus earned in the event of profit before tax and goodwill impairment falling 15% or more below budget.
For on budget performance the bonus will be 30% of the Directors average salary during the year.
For profit performance in excess of budget additional bonus is earned on an incremental scale with a maximum payment of 60% of average salary for achievement of profit before tax equating to 112% of budget.
Any bonus entitlement determined under the plan amounting to 40% or less of salary will be paid in cash, following approval by the Directors of the audited accounts for the relevant financial year.
For any entitlement in excess of 40% of salary one half of the excess will be paid in cash, with the balance discharged through the award of shares in the Company.
The vesting of such award will be deferred for three years and will be subject to satisfaction of income tax and national insurance liabilities.
In addition bonus amounting to 10% of salary is available for delivery of specific personal objectives, 80% of which must be quantifiable or measurable.
Mr D W Wilson in future will not participate in the Companys performance related bonus plan.
The Remuneration Committee may, if it considers it appropriate in the context of the business environment, substitute a rigorous and challenging target in lieu of budget but at a lower level.
Any decision to set such a target in lieu of budget may only be made during the first quarter of the financial year and the incremental scale of bonus awards set out above may be reduced by up to 50%, at the absolute discretion of the Remuneration Committee, in the event of such a target being set.
38 Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report 2005 The 2005 performance related bonus plan was described in the 2004 Directors Remuneration Report.
The bonuses earned in respect of 2005, included in the remuneration table on page 41, have been determined in accordance with the criteria described in that Remuneration Report and include elements based both on profit before tax and the achievement of specific personal objectives.
The Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion during the first quarter of the year to reduce the Housebuilding bonus target by 2% and the associated bonus entitlement by 5%.
Accordingly bonuses earned in 2005, excluding awards in respect of personal objectives, ranged between 2.0% and 72.4% of the Directors basic salaries.
Mr D W Wilson irrevocably waived bonus payable to him under his service contract for 2005 amounting to 16,777 2004: nil.
Share incentive schemes Mr N H Richardson, Mr I Robertson, Mr N J Townsend and Mr G M Brown all participate in the share incentive schemes listed below.
It is, however, the stated intention of the Committee that share incentive awards to the Executive Directors for 2005 and in future years will only be made under the Wilson Bowden Performance Share Plan PSP.
With regards to executives operating below Board level, the Remuneration Committee intends to reward and incentivise key profit accountable executives by making awards under the PSP where justified by their performance and contribution to the Groups success.
Executives receiving awards under the PSP will not also be entitled to share options.
The performance conditions attached to these incentive plans, the reasons for selecting them and the methods of measuring whether they have been met and why those methods have been chosen are set out below: The Wilson Bowden plc Performance Share Plan Shareholders approved the PSP at the 2002 Annual General Meeting.
Awards under the PSP are made to each of the Companys Executive Directors, except Mr D W Wilson, and other senior executives who contribute to the successful performance of the Group.
The value of shares subject to awards in any year under the plan may not exceed 100% of annual salary.
The Remuneration Committee determines appropriate performance criteria each year.
The Committee have determined that for awards made in 2006: 1. an Earnings per Share EPS criterion measured by reference to the increase in real EPS in the audited consolidated accounts of the Group for the period of three years starting with the financial year ended before the date of the award will apply to half the award: and 2. a Total Shareholder Return TSR criterion for the period of three years ending on the third anniversary of the date of the award and measured against a comparator group of eight companies in the Housebuilding sector, will apply to the balance.
The performance targets will not be subject to retesting over a further period if not met.
The comparator group of companies for the TSR performance criteria comprises Barratt Developments PLC, Crest Nicholson PLC, Taylor Woodrow plc, Bellway p. l. c. Persimmon PLC, Bovis Homes Group PLC, Redrow plc and George Wimpey Plc.
These performance criteria will be applied over a three year measurement period as follows: EPS growth in excess of RPI % of award receivable TSR Relative Performance % of award receivable Equal to greater than 40% 100% Upper quartile 100% Between 10% and 40% Pro rata Between upper quartile and median Pro rata Equal to 10% 10% Median 30% Below 10% Nil Below median Nil The reasons for selecting Earnings per Share as a measure of performance are that it directly reflects operational performance and is also a significant factor in determining the markets view of the Companys value.
TSR was selected as a measure of performance as Total Shareholder Return aligns management performance with shareholders interests.
The performance targets described above are considered to be appropriate based on current market practice and advice from the external consultants.
The Remuneration Committee determines whether performance criteria have been satisfied based on reports from the Companys corporate broker and may request the Companys auditors to report on whether the calculations, and any adjustments required under scheme rules, have been correctly performed.
Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report 2005 39 Directors remuneration report continued The Wilson Bowden plc Senior Executive Share Option Scheme WBSESOS Shareholders originally approved the WBSESOS at the 2000 Annual General Meeting and amended it at the 2002 Annual General Meeting.
Options are granted under the WBSESOS to management who contribute directly to the successful strategic direction and operational performance of the Group.
The performance condition relative to the exercise of options granted prior to 17th April 2002, is that the growth in Earnings per Share shown in the audited consolidated accounts of the Group for any consecutive period of three years, starting with the financial year commencing immediately before the date of grant, must exceed the increase in the Retail Price Index all items over the same period by 3% per annum.
The performance condition relative to the exercise of options granted after 17th April 2002, is that the growth in Earnings per Share in the audited consolidated accounts of the Group for any consecutive periods of three, four or five years, starting with the financial year commencing immediately before the date of grant: 1. must exceed the increase in the Retail Price Index all items over the same period by 3% per annum in respect of awards in any one year, the value of which does not exceed the basic annual salary of the executive: and 2. must exceed the increase in the Retail Price Index all items over the same period by 5% per annum in respect of awards in any one year, the value of which exceeds one times basic annual salary of the executive.
The value of options granted under the WBSESOS to a participant in any one year is up to a maximum of four times their annual salary, but options would not normally be granted in excess of twice annual salary.
The reasons for selecting Earnings per Share as the measure of performance are set out under the PSP and apply similarly to the WBSESOS.
The real growth targets of 3% and 5% respectively referred to above are considered to be appropriate levels of achievement based on current market practice and advice from the external consultants who assisted in the design of the WBSESOS.
The Remuneration Committee determines whether performance criteria have been satisfied based on calculations performed internally and may request the Companys auditors to report on whether the calculations, and any adjustments required under scheme rules, have been performed correctly.
Wilson Bowden plc 2003 Savings Related Share Option Scheme WBSRSOS Under the WBSRSOS, participants are required to make monthly contributions to an approved savings authority under a contractual savings scheme for a period of three or five years.
On entering into the savings contract participants are granted an option to acquire ordinary shares in the Company at a discount, of no more than 20%, to the middle market price of the Companys shares immediately prior to the date of grant.
The exercise of options under the WBSRSOS is not subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition as the WBSRSOS is Inland Revenue approved and open to all eligible employees.
On 4th May 2005, the Company granted options to 278 employees under the WBSRSOS over 61,915 ordinary shares at a price of 1,068 pence per share, equivalent to a discount of 10% to middle market price.
Pensions The following section describes the pension arrangements currently in force for the Executive Directors.
All the Executive Directors, except Mr D W Wilson, are members of the Wilson Bowden plc Directors Pension Scheme, a defined contribution scheme.
The Company has established a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme the FURBS to provide, at the Companys discretion, additional Directors pension benefits equivalent to the effect of the restriction on their pension contributions caused by the limitation of the Inland Revenue earnings cap.
These methods of reward are in accordance with competitive market practice within the housebuilding and property development sectors and demonstrate the purpose of the remuneration policy to retain the services of high quality directors and motivate them to greater success in a highly competitive market.

The Shareholder Return of the FTSE Mid 160 250 index was chosen as it represents a national and broad equity 140 market index and because the Company has been a constituent of this 120 100 index throughout the period.
