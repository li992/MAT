The Remuneration Committee had taken full note of a number of comments raised on the report last year and, with its consultants, has reviewed the performance conditions applicable to future grants under the 2001 Executive Share Option Scheme.
It has concluded that for grants after October 2005, performance conditions will not be capable of re-testing.
The Remuneration Committee also reviewed the performance conditions themselves in light of comment that they were insufficiently demanding and determined that they remain appropriate conditions for the Group in line with the policy of being locally competitive in remuneration matters.

and are terminable at will.
Each agreement contains provisions that in the event of termination without cause payment will be made of an amount equivalent to 12 months salary, 12 months target annual bonus, 12 months pension contribution and bonus for the current year prorated to date of termination.
In addition, the employment agreement of David McCulloch contains provisions, which were in place before his appointment to the Board, whereby if the contract is terminated by a Group company without cause in the event of a change of control or by Mr McCulloch in the event of a change of control, a payment will be made of 24 months base salary, 24 months pension contribution and target annual bonus.
The Board has again noted investor comments on these provisions.
Advice received continues to confirm that these provisions of Mr McCullochs contract are not unusual for a Chief Executive Officer in the US.
The Board believes these provisions are consistent with the Groups policy of being locally competitive in remuneration matters and does not consider it appropriate to seek to amend them.
The effective dates of these agreements were 1 June 2003 for Mr McCulloch and 21 July 2003 for Messrs Wrench and Eimers.
The agreements reflect US employment practice, given that the Directors are based in the US.
As far as the unexpired terms of employment agreements of Directors offering themselves for reappointment at the Annual General Meeting are concerned, Messrs Cronk and Schmidt have no employment agreements, their responsibilities being set out in letters of appointment.
Mr Wrench has an employment agreement of an indefinite period terminable at will, as stated above.

Subject to performance conditions being achieved as described earlier in this report.
When these options are exercised pursuant to the rules of the Scheme, D S McCulloch is entitled to a payment of 404,203.
The employment agreement of Mr McCulloch entered into following his appointment as Chief Executive Officer on 1 June 2003 included a commitment by the Company to grant him share options at the market price prevailing at that time or an alternative benefit payable in cash.
For regulatory reasons the options could not be granted at that time and when they were granted the market price had risen.
As the rules of the share option scheme require options to be granted at the market price on date of grant, the sum of 404,203 was agreed to be paid.
If these options are not exercised, this sum will not be paid.
During the year it transpired that at the time of the grant of these options the date for measurement of performance conditions was stated as the date of grant whereas the date should have been the date from which they were to take economic effect, 1 June 2003.
Having consulted with its independent consultants, the Remuneration Committee determined the appropriate correction should be made.
options over 469,829 shares granted to a former Director, A J Allner, were exercised by him during the period.
The Company, fulfilling a contractual obligation, made a payment to him of 51,681.
The obligation arose from circumstances which are similar to those described above in respect of D S McCulloch: during the year the Companys shares have traded in the range 82p to 136p.
On 30 September 2005, the closing mid market share price was 128.5p.
