These twin factors have been key drivers in the progressive Through the latter two schemes Co-Investment Plan and Share development of the Groups business model, from a business Option Scheme the Group seeks to encourage and reward good focused solely on earnings growth to one which delivers long term performance by providing incentives to both invest in shareholder value from a combination of earnings growth and and retain equity in the Company.

58 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Shareholder reporting b Co-investment plan audited This plan, approved in March 2004, is directed at increasing the directors direct share ownership in the Company, incentivising them on a medium term base in relation to total shareholder return TSR and aligning shareholder and director interests.
Under the plan up to 100% of the annual bonus awarded to directors may be invested in the Companys shares.
The Company then buys in the market, a one for one net matching holding.
These shares are held over a subsequent three-year qualification period.
To qualify for full distribution of matching shares the TSR of Workspace Group over the reference period must exceed that of the company at the bottom of the top quartile of the FTSE Real Estate index of which the company is a constituent member.
To qualify for any matching shares, the TSR performance must be above that of the company at the bottom of the fourth decile.
In between these two measures there is a scaled award.
The Company believes that linking awards to above average TSR aligns the interests of shareholders and employees.
It believes also that such longer term incentives encourage the retention of senior staff.
In June 2004 under the plan executives invested 50% of their annual bonus and acquired the following shares: Shares Acquired H Platt 32,200 M Carragher 22,540 J P Marples 22,540 R M Taylor 22,540 The share numbers are stated after adjusting for the 9:1 capitalisation issue made in March 2005. c Share Options The Group believes that share ownership by executive directors and senior managers aligns their interests with those of ordinary shareholders.
The share option scheme encourages this whilst providing a longer term incentive to participants.
The Board considers that improvements in the Groups share price is dependent, inter alia, on the continued growth of the Groups earnings.
For this reason and to marry the interests of shareholders and employees, it has been the policy of the Group to grant options subject to criteria linked to the growth of earnings per share.
Ordinarily, this is linked to achievement of earnings growth at a level in excess of RPI over the measurement period.
Where grants in excess of one times earnings are made then these growth requirements are increased.
Details of exercise criteria related to options over shares are given on page 60.
Entitlements under share options lapse on termination of employment unless termination arises due to exceptional circumstances, such as redundancy or death.
All grants of share options awarded since 2004 have been on the basis of a single performance test and where this test is not fulfilled or is only partly achieved, no retesting in future periods is allowed.
Further, for all grants of options from this time, in the event of a change in ownership of the Company, options only vest to the extent that exercise condition tests have been fulfilled.
Fixed variable balance Assuming that the performance criteria for the exercise of options and receipt of co-investment plan matching shares granted during the year are satisfied and that the share price at maturity of these schemes is 60% above the option price option price 1.8075 allowing for the bonus share issued of 9:1, share price at 31 March 2005 2.35, then the variable part of total remuneration would be approximately 54% for all directors at 30% above the option price: approximately 48%.

Details of the exercise conditions for these options are given in the table following.
The above options were granted pursuant to the rules of the Companys 2000 Share Option Scheme which was approved at the July 2000 Extra Ordinary General Meeting EGM and amended at the EGM held in July 2003.
The options granted to directors this year equated to shares of a value equivalent at the time of the grant to one times the basic salary of the directors.
A further 100,720 allowing for the increase on bonus issue of shares options were granted during the year under the Groups SAYE scheme, which all employees are entitled to join following any probationary period relating to their employment.
Following the grant of these options the Group had at 31 March 2005 options over 6,890,630 shares outstanding, of which 5,609,010 were designated to be satisfied by shares held by the Groups ESOT and 1,281,620 through the issue of new shares.
The shares held by the ESOT represent 3.3% of the issued share capital at 31 March 2005 with options to be satisfied by the grant of new shares representing 0.8% of the issued capital.
All of the options granted during the year, were granted pursuant to an annex to the Scheme which is unapproved for income tax purposes.
All options have a 10 year life expiring on 30 June 2014.
All other options have been granted under the Rules of the Companys Executive Share Option Schemes.

All options were exercised before the bonus issue.

There have been no changes in directors interests over options in the period between the balance sheet date and 10 June 2005.
The middle market price of Workspace Group PLC ordinary shares at 31 March 2005 was 2.35 and the range during the year was 1.5775 to 2.444 adjusted for 9:1 bonus issue.

Per Inland Revenue Rules SAYE options with no terms for exercise Shareholder reporting Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Workspace Group PLC 61 All options to date have been subject to a single test which is related to published EPS growth.
The hurdle rates are set recognising the challenges presented in generating above average rates of growth in a business whose complexity increases with the scale of its operations.
The prescribed targets have been met in respect of all options granted in 2001 and earlier years amounting to 2,302,400 ordinary shares.
In reviewing the vesting conditions applied to the options granted in 2002 and vesting in 2005 the Committee considered the changes in accounting policies and standards together with impacts that did not align with its original intentions when awarding these options.
In particular it was considered that the charge for National Insurance on options following the substantial increase in the Companys share price over the last year should not be included in the calculation of EPS.
Taken together they have led the Committee to conclude that the options granted in 2002 will have met their vesting criteria so as to allow the options to be exercised over 74% of the shares under option.
The introduction of IFRS will affect the calculation of the Companys EPS and the Committee is working to ensure a successful transition from UK GAAP to the new standards.
Further details will be included in the next annual remuneration report.
ESOT In implementing its remuneration strategy, the Board established in 1999 an Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT.
The trust is used to purchase shares in the Company to meet its obligations under the share options schemes and the co-investment plan.
Use of the ESOT reduces the dilutive effect of the grant of options over new shares.
The ESOT purchased 2,000,000 shares at an average price of 50.7p per share figures adjusted for 9:1 bonus issue in March 1999 and a further 5,067,700 shares at a price of 1.03 figures adjusted for 9:1 bonus issue in September 2002.
Of these shares 1,447,330 have been transferred on exercise of options and a further 5,609,010 have been allocated to meet future exercises.
The market value of the ESOT holding at 31 March 2005 was 13,207,870 compared with a book cost of 5,518,800 and value due on exercise of options of 5,807,593.
Performance graph The following graph compares the total shareholder return TSR performance of the Group with benchmark indices.
Given the differing benchmarks used for such performance measurement your Board has decided to undertake this comparison against all of the FTSE All Share, FTSE Real Estate and FTSE 250 indices, all of which the Company is a constituent member.
In addition, it has constructed a comparator index composed of a basket of companies engaged in similar activities to the Group.
This has been calculated by reference to the TSRs of Ashtenne, Brixton Estates, Derwent Valley, MWB and Shaftesbury.
TSR indexed performance 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 -- Workspace Reference Group FTSE Small Cap -- FTSE Real Estate FTSE All Share The Company has used a TSR benchmark for the co-investment plan adopted for the first time this year details of which are given on page 58.
During the year the overall TSR for the Groups shares ranked second within the FTSE Real Estate Sector.
It is clear from these charts that the performance of the Group continues to be well above that of its peers.
62 Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Shareholder reporting Directors appointment The Groups policy is to engage all executive directors on rolling service contracts requiring 12 months notice of termination on either side.
Non-executive directors are ordinarily appointed on three year contracts.
The details of the service contracts of those who served as directors during the year are: Contract Date of last reappointment date at Annual General Meeting Unexpired term Notice period A J Hales 04.11.2002 2003 5 months 12 months A H Cherry 10.06.2003 Retired Retired Retired H Platt 01.12.1993 2002 N A 12 months M Carragher 01.01.1996 2004 N A 12 months B Cragg 01.06.2003 2003 12 months 6 months J P Marples 27.09.1996 2003 N A 12 months C J Pieroni 10.06.2003 2003 12 months 6 months R M Taylor 22.09.1995 2004 N A 12 months J Bywater 09.06.2004 2004 24 months 6 months Service contracts do not provide for compensation on termination of contract other than in the form of written notice provisions.
There are no express mitigation provisions in the directors service contracts.
Ordinary principles of contract law are, however, implicit in these contracts obliging contract parties to mitigate losses.
Non-executive directors remuneration policy Fees for non-executive directors are reviewed annually and determined by the Board in the light of market practice and surveys e. g. by Monks and IRS, and with reference to the time commitment and responsibilities associated with the roles.
Generally, the time commitment of the Chairman is expected to be 50 days a year and for other non-executives some 12-15 days a year.
Non-executive directors do not participate in discussions about their own remuneration.
During the year, the fees of the Chairmen of the Remuneration and Audit Committees were increased from 25,000 to 28,000 per annum.
Non-executive directors receive no other pay or benefits other than the reimbursement of expenses incurred in respect of their duties as directors of the Company.
Executive directors remuneration and wider Group remuneration policy The Groups wider people policies are reported separately on page 11.
The ratio of the average basic pay of executive directors to the average of all other full-time staff directly employed by the Group is 7.21 2004: 7.46.
The one scheme which only executive directors and no other staff currently benefit from is the long term incentive scheme established last year.
Following probationary periods, all staff in the Company are eligible to participate in the Companys bonus scheme, SAYE, pension scheme, and life assurance arrangements: most are eligible for medical insurance benefits: and some senior staff have share option awards.
The Remuneration Committee discusses the remuneration of senior staff outside the Executive Board, advised by the Chief Executive on the total emoluments of the three most senior posts, and following recommendations from the Executive Board, made share option awards to certain senior managers.
