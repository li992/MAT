Remuneration policy For Mr J A Monville, in the event that the sale of AMEC SPIE is The objective of the remuneration policy, in respect of the executive completed during 2006, and recognising his key role in achieving directors and other senior executives, is to offer remuneration a successful transaction, it is intended to replace the normal annual packages that are competitive in the markets in which the executives bonus with a special incentive linked to the sale proceeds on a sliding are based and which: scale above a minimum threshold and subject to the achievement in the business being divested of at least budgeted profit in the period allow AMEC to attract and retain senior executives of high prior to the sale.

Mr Monvilles pension arrangements are base salaries which broadly equate to the mid-market salary covered on page 66 of this report.
These arrangements are common practices of a relevant group of support services, engineering and for senior executives in France and are a contractual obligation that construction comparator companies and other companies regarded AMEC inherited with the acquisition of SPIE S. A. as comparable by virtue of, amongst other factors, revenue, employee numbers, market capitalisation and or geographic coverage: In the senior management group, no executive has a base salary or total remuneration higher than any executive director.
AMEC plc annual report 2005 61 The company has a second scheme in place the Executive Share Directors remuneration report Option Scheme 2002.
AMECs policy is now only to grant share options under this scheme selectively and in exceptional continued circumstances such as recruitment.
No awards were made under this scheme during 2005.
During the transition to International Financial Reporting Standards, the remuneration committee will aim to ensure that performance measurement for remuneration purposes will be consistent year on year.
In addition, executive directors may participate in relevant all employee share plans which provide options, without performance conditions, related to savings contracts with an aggregate limit of 250 savings per month.
Executive directors pension entitlements and benefits The executive directors, except for Mr J A Monville and, with effect from 31 October 2005, Mr J D Early, are members of the AMEC Staff Pension Scheme and have top-up benefits provided through the Executive directors long-term incentives AMEC Executive Pension Scheme.

Mr Early has received a supplement of 20 per cent of total salary since 1 November 2005 in lieu of further pension accrual.
ii The bonuses detailed above represented the following percentages of their base salaries for the year against a maximum potential of 80 per cent: Sir Peter Mason 23.0 per cent, Mr Early 35.4 per cent, Mr Monville 41.6 per cent and Mr Siddall 30.0 per cent.
No bonus has been paid this year in respect of AMEC plc profit performance.
The awards made reflect varying achievement against other specific business targets and personal objectives.
iii The value of benefits in kind received during the year relates principally to the provision of a company car or car allowance, travelling expenses and private medical expenses insurance.
Unemployment insurance is also made available to Mr Monville in accordance with French practice.
During 2004, Mr Riva received relocation expenses of 255,000 relating to when he originally joined AMEC.
None of these benefits are pensionable.
iv Mr Monvilles salary comprised 503,000 paid by SPIE S. A. and 30,000 paid by AMEC plc.
v Mr Riva received a compensation payment of 571,000 under the terms of a compromise agreement, reached through negotiations with Mr Riva and his legal advisers, in lieu of the balance of his notice and as compensation for loss of office, with a reduction to take account of mitigation.
In addition, all Mr Rivas share option and performance share awards lapsed on leaving.
The timing of the awards was delayed due to close period restrictions.
For the performance share awards made in April 2002, AMEC failed to meet the minimum performance conditions and, therefore, the awards lapsed in April 2005.
The terms and conditions of the Performance Share Plan have not been varied during the year other than in the composition of the comparator group for 2005 awards compared to those for previous years awards.
This change reflects the changed FTSE sector listing of the companys shares from Construction and Building Materials to Support Services.
The closing price of the shares at 31 December 2005 was 343.50 pence 2004: 297.75 pence.
The range of the closing prices for the shares during the year was 300.00 pence to 372.00 pence.
The register of directors interests, which is open to inspection at the companys registered office, contains full details of directors shareholdings, share options and awards under the Performance Share Plan.
Had the restricted shares detailed above vested in full as at 31 December 2005 the approximate latent value before appropriate taxes for each of the current directors would have been: Sir Peter Mason, 2,670,000: Mr Early, 942,000: Mr Siddall, 1,425,000: and Mr Monville, 1,377,000.
These hypothetical figures assume that all performance conditions would have been fully met, which in practice may not transpire.

The minimum performance condition which applies to the awards made in 2002 was not met at the first time of testing.
These awards are subject to two further retests in 2006 and 2007.
Executive Share Option Scheme awards made from 2004 onwards are not subject to retest.
iv Remaining awards made under the former Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 and not exercised during the year were capable of being exercised at 31 December 2005.
If these options had been exercised on that date the approximate gain before appropriate taxes for Sir Peter Mason would have been 901,000. v Had the remainder of the options been capable of being exercised and vested in full as at 31 December 2005, the approximate latent gain before appropriate taxes for each of the current directors would have been: Sir Peter Mason, 454,000: Mr Early, 214,000: Mr Siddall, 257,000: and Mr Monville, 116,000.
vi There were no grants under the Executive Share Option Scheme during the year.
Pension arrangements The following directors were members of defined benefit schemes provided by the company during the year.

ii Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with version 8.1 of guidance note GN11 issued by the actuarial profession.
iii The value of net increase represents the incremental value to the director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption service terminated at the year end.
It is based on the accrued pension increase after deducting the directors contribution.
Note that Mr Rivas pensionable service ended on 31 July 2005 and Mr Earlys pensionable service ended on 31 October 2005. iv The change in the transfer value includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the company and directors, such as stockmarket movements.
It is calculated after deducting the directors contribution.
v Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
Mr J A Monville is a member of the SPIE top-up pension scheme for senior executives.
Although the scheme, arranged through an insurance company, is a defined benefit scheme, it is not possible to disclose his pension benefits in the above format.
A pension is payable by SPIE only in the event of Mr Monville reaching his normal retirement age of 65 or, following the attainment of age 60, by agreement with AMEC.
No pension is due or payable in other circumstances and Mr Monville currently has no accrued right to a pension payment.
His pension at the normal retirement age, or as agreed by AMEC, would be based on the average of his last three years base salary and bonus, up to a maximum of 20 per cent of this figure.
It is not possible to attribute a value to the accrued funds as these are not separately identified by the insurance company.
