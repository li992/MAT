REMUNERATION REPORT Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 which introduced new statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after 31 December 2002.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Companys members on the auditable part of the Directors remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information Remuneration committee The Company has established a Remuneration Committee, which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code.
The members of the committee are Mr. McIntosh, Mr. Watson and The RT.
Mr. Jack who are all independent non-executive directors, with the committee chaired by Mr. McIntosh.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest other than as shareholders, conflicts of interests arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board.
No director plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
Remuneration policy Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the high calibre needed to maintain the Groups position as a market leader and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders.
The performance measurement of the executive directors and key members of senior management and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the Committee.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors and senior management: basic annual salary including directors fees and benefits: long-term incentive plan: annual bonus payments: pension arrangements.
TOPPS TILES PLC 31 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 REMUNERATION REPORT continued Basic salary An executive directors basic salary is determined by the Committee prior to the beginning of each year and when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a whole and relies on objective research which gives up-to-date information on a comparator group of companies.
Basic salaries were reviewed in September 2005 with increases taking effect from 1 October 2005.
Executive directors contracts of service which include details of remuneration will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
In addition to basic salary, the executive directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, principally a car and private medical insurance.
Long-term incentive Plan LTIP The Topps Tiles Plc 2003 Executive LTIP is a three year plan which is due to mature at the financial period ending 30 September 2006.
The LTIP is a cash based plan with performance targets based on the Group profitability over the three year period.
It is discretionary and will be operated by the Board acting through the Remuneration Committee.
The maximum total amount potentially payable to participants under the plan if performance criteria are met is 4,000,000.
N. D. Ounstead and A. Liggett each have been granted a 25% interest in the LTIP.
The payment of the individual awards under the scheme is dependent on the participant remaining in employment with the Group and the Group achieving a cumulative total of at least 80,000,000 pre-tax profits before any accrual for the LTIP over the three year period and the diluted earnings per share as shown in the Groups annual accounts must increase by an average of 15% per annum compounded annually over the same period.
In the event of a take-over, reconstruction or winding up of the Group, a proportion of awards will vest having regard to the number of months of the performance period that have elapsed and any other relevant factors.
Annual bonus payments A discretionary annual cash bonus scheme represents the short term incentive element of the overall remuneration package for Mr. Liggett and Mr. Ounstead.
The committee establishes the objectives that must be met in the financial period if a cash bonus is to be paid.
The maximum bonus achievable in the period was nil and for the period ending 30 September 2006 will be a total of 520,000 which is 100% of basic salaries.
Pension arrangements Mr. Bester, Mr. Ounstead and Mr. Liggett received contributions into their own personal pension schemes.
