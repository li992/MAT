com Report and accounts 2005 Page 32 Report on directors remuneration The Board presents the Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2005.
Remuneration policy for executive directors The aim of the remuneration policy is to provide a competitive remuneration package, having regard to comparable companies in the financial sector, that is sufficient to attract and retain the quality of director needed to manage and develop the company successfully.
The stated policy shall apply in 2006 and, subject to review, in subsequent financial years.
Remuneration packages Remuneration packages are designed to include fixed and variable elements and to provide rewards for both the long and short term as follows: Short term Long term Fixed Basic salary and benefits Pension Variable Profit share Long Term Incentive Plan The Remuneration Committee the Committee considers that the key objectives of a remuneration package are to motivate directors to generate long term shareholder value and to increase short-term profitability.
The first objective is met by long term incentive plan LTIP awards providing directors with the opportunity to build a meaningful shareholding in the company, performance permitting.
Executive directors are actively encouraged to build up and maintain a shareholding to the equivalent value of at least one years salary within five years of their appointment to the Board.
The second objective is met by profit share payments.
The link between corporate and individual performance is reinforced through the very substantial shareholdings of the executive directors set out on page 19.
Current and former directors, staff and their families own over 20% of the company.
Basic salary and benefits An executive directors basic salary is determined by the Committee and any change implemented on 1 January of each year or when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers salaries throughout the group as a whole and the information obtained on comparable companies in the financial sector.
Board salary costs for the year increased to 2.1m, up from 1.9m in 2004, an increase of 0.2m 10.5%.
This was due in part to an increase in the number of executive directors following the appointment of Peter Pearson Lund to the Board on 5 January 2005.
When setting salary levels, use is made of survey data and information provided by the advisers to the Committee.
The views of the chairman and chief executive are also taken into consideration.
All directors are entitled to take part in the Share Incentive Plan SIP on the same terms as all other employees.
This allows all employees to purchase shares in the company and currently these are matched on a one for one basis by the company.
Performance shares are also offered to employees based on earnings per share growth.
In addition Rathbones provides a range of benefits, the most significant of which is a company car or cash alternative.
Profit share Certain executive directors on the Executive Committee are eligible for a discretionary profit share payment from a pool based on approximately 1% of group pre-tax profits.
Directors with direct responsibility for investment management, unit trust or trust departments receive a profit share payment based on the profits of the department concerned.
This may be supplemented by a payment from the pool.
Profit share payments are not capped and are not pensionable.
Details of payments for 2005 are shown in Table 6.
com Report and accounts 2005 Page 33 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP At an Extraordinary General Meeting in November 2000, a long term incentive plan LTIP was approved by shareholders to start in 2001.
No awards from the current plan will be made after November 2010.
Executive directors are provisionally awarded rights to acquire ordinary shares at the start of a three year plan cycle the provisional award.
The maximum value of a provisional award is 75% of a participants basic salary.
At the end of each plan cycle, the Companys performance is assessed against the performance targets for that cycle.
The extent to which the targets have been achieved determines the actual number of shares if any attributable to each participant the actual award.
The performance targets used to date have been a mixture of growth in earnings per share EPS before goodwill amortisation and total shareholder return TSR.
TSR is a measure of the overall return to shareholders.
It reflects both the change in the share price and dividends and any other cash payments made, assuming that they are reinvested.
If a participant ceases to be employed as an executive director by reason of retirement at normal retirement age or earlier with the companys consent, ill-health, redundancy or death, or any other circumstances which the Committee deems to be appropriate, the Committee may, at its discretion, recommend to the trustee that any distribution be based on the performance during the plan cycle as a whole but that the actual award be reduced pro rata to reflect the fact that the participant was not an executive director for the whole plan cycle.
2001 03 and 2002 04 plan cycles The performance target for the 2001 03 and 2002 04 plan cycles was average annual compound EPS growth over the plan cycle.
No actual awards were made from these plans.
2003 05 plan cycle The performance targets for the 2003 05 plan cycle are set out in Table 2.
Actual awards of 100% of the provisional award before any pro rata service related adjustment totalling 136,991 ordinary shares or the equivalent cash value or a combination of the two will be made for the 2003 05 plan cycle in March 2006 as both EPS and TSR performance conditions were fully satisfied.
EPS before goodwill amortisation increased from 33.91p in 2002 to 60.13p in 2005, an increase of 77% whilst the TSR for the three year period was 102.7% Source: Datastream.
A 100% award is made for each element of the Plan if the relevant percentage exceeds 37.5%.
2004 06 plan cycle The performance targets for the 2004 06 plan cycle were unchanged and are set out in Table 2.
2005 07 and 2006 08 plan cycles The performance targets for 2005 07 were changed taking into consideration feedback from shareholders and changes to expectations of best market practice.
The Committee particularly took note of the preference for the use of a relative rather than an absolute TSR measure.
With effect from 2005 07, TSR performance relative to the FTSE All Share Index rather than absolute TSR has been used as set out in Table 3.
The use of a peer group rather than a broad index was ruled out due to the small number of similar businesses in the speciality and other finance sector, and the risk that numbers would fall still further due to consolidation.
The Committee considers that the revised targets are as demanding, in the current climate, as those put in place for earlier cycles were considered to be at the time.
Details of the provisional awards for the 2004 06, 2005 07 and 2006 08 plan cycles are set out in Table 4.
On 15 April 2005, the trustee acquired a further 25,000 Rathbone Brothers Plc ordinary shares at an average price of 765p to be held for future actual awards and at 31 December 2005 held 55,000 shares 2004: 30,000. Dividend entitlements in respect of this holding have been waived and voting rights will not be exercised.
Were the maximum possible provisional awards to be made to current and former directors, 472,506 ordinary shares 2004: 516,624 would be issued, representing 1.1% 2004: 1.3% of the issued share capital at 31 December 2005.

TSR is calculated assuming that dividends are reinvested on receipt.
The FTSE All Share Index has been selected as a comparator as it is a suitably broad market index and is used as a performance comparator for the 2005 07 and 2006 08 LTIP plan cycles.
The company is in the speciality and other finance sector.
Long term incentive arrangements for Peter Pearson Lund Following his appointment to the Board, Peter Pearson Lund continues to participate in the Rathbone Unit Trust Management Limited RUTM deferred profit sharing plan rather than the LTIP.
A deferred profit sharing pool, which in a normal year equates to 20% of RUTMs pre-tax profits, is allocated to participants on the recommendation of a RUTM Plan Committee.
Allocations are held in trust and invested on behalf of participants.
The release of an award is conditional on continued employment unless the participant is a good leaver.
Funds are released in two equal tranches two and three years after the period end.

This opportunity will not be offered in future.
The provisional LTIP awards listed above are the maximum awards achievable assuming all performance targets are met and that the participant is an executive director for the whole plan cycle.
The value of these awards when made was 75% of a participants basic salary.
The market value of shares at the date of provisional award is the average mid-market price over the 20 dealing days prior to the start of the plan.
Share options Share options are granted to senior employees who it is considered will have a significant impact on the earnings and profitability of the group during the following five years.
Options are no longer granted to directors after their appointment to the Board, except where an undertaking has been given prior to appointment.
Option grants to senior employees have generally been made annually.
Option grants to a participant in a ten year rolling period are capped at four times remuneration.
The Board is of the view that, following the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards, share options are increasingly expensive to administer and that there is a mis-match between their cost to the business and their perceived value to employees.
It is therefore likely that fewer option grants will be made in future.
Options granted prior to 21 June 2004 can be exercised if the earnings per share of the group during the period from grant to the date of notification of exercise has increased in percentage terms by more than the increase in the Retail Price Index RPI plus 2% per annum or pro rata for any part thereof.
Options granted after 21 June 2004 can be exercised if the earnings per share of the group between the accounting period immediately prior to the option grant and the accounting period immediately prior to the third anniversary of grant has increased in percentage terms by more than the increase in the RPI plus 3% per annum or pro rata for any part thereof.
There is no automatic waiving of performance conditions in the event of a change of control or the early termination of a participants employment.
Options may not normally be exercised before the third anniversary of the date of grant and expire on the tenth anniversary of grant.
Details of outstanding options at the start and end of the year together with details of options granted and exercised during the year are set out in Table 5.
The terms and conditions of all options have remained unchanged during the year.
P G Pearson Lund was appointed to the Board on 5 January 2005. a No options were exercised by directors in 2005.
No options lapsed in 2004 or 2005. b The mid-market closing price of the Companys shares on 31 December 2005 was 992p 2004: 852.5p and the range during the year was 725p to 1015p 2004: 607.5p to 863.5p.
c Options granted to directors in 2003 and 2004 will vest in one-third phases, on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant subject to the performance condition being met.
Dilution Not more than 15% of the issued ordinary share capital of the company adjusted for bonus and rights issues should be issued for all share incentive schemes operated by the company in any ten year period.
Of that 15%, not more than 10% applies to shares allotted under share option schemes and not more than 5% to shares allotted under both the LTIP and SIP.
In the ten years to 31 December 2005, options over 3,362,928 ordinary shares 2004: 3,329,394 have been granted which represents 8.1% of the issued share capital at that date 2004: 8.1%.
744,893 ordinary shares 2004: 511,218 have been allotted in respect of the SIP, representing 1.8% of the issued share capital at 31 December 2005 2004: 1.3%.
No shares have been allotted for the LTIP to date.
Pension arrangements UK staff who joined Rathbones prior to April 2002 were offered membership of the Rathbone Group 1987 Pension Scheme the Scheme.
The Scheme provides for members to retire at the age of 60 with a pension based on 1 60th of final pensionable salary for each year of membership of the Scheme and various previous schemes.
The Scheme also provides dependants pensions and lump sum benefits on death in service.
In 2005, the normal funding rate was 11.5% of pensionable payroll.
Since April 2002, new employees have been offered membership of a group defined contribution plan, established with Scottish Widows.
In the case of certain directors and senior staff, the group contributes to their personal pension arrangements.
Paul Chavasse, Sue Desborough, Richard Lanyon, Andrew Morris, Peter Pearson Lund and Richard Smeeton are members of the Scheme.
Ian Buckley, James Lifford, Andy Pomfret and Mark Powell participate in the Scheme for death in service benefits only.
Ian Buckley, James Lifford, and Andy Pomfret have arrangements under Self-Invested Personal Pension Schemes and Paul Egerton-Vernon and Mark Powell have personal pension schemes.
Rathbones pays annual contributions of 11.5% of salary to those schemes, subject to HM Revenue & Customs maximum limits, where applicable.
The changes in pension entitlements arising in the financial year, required to be disclosed by the UK Listing Authority, are shown in Table 7.
There have been no changes in the terms of directors pension entitlements during the year.
There are no unfunded pension promises or similar arrangements for directors.
com Report and accounts 2005 Page 38 Report on directors remuneration continued The Governments simplification of the pension taxation regime that comes into effect on 6 April 2006 will affect the pension arrangements of some senior staff.
The company has commissioned a briefing note for UK employees and has arranged workshops at which the changes have been explained.
Employees have been encouraged to take independent advice if they believe they may be affected by the changes and it has been made clear that Rathbones will not incur additional pension costs arising from the changes.
During the year, retirement benefits accrued under money purchase schemes in relation to five directors 2004: six.
Benefits include the provision of a company car and medical health insurance cover.

iv The increase in transfer value represents the additional capital amount less directors contributions necessary to fund the increase in the accrued pension that a director would take with him as part of the total transfer value if he were to leave the Company and move his benefits to another scheme.
com Report and accounts 2005 Page 39 The directors have the option to take early retirement on or after their 50th birthday, in which case their pension benefits would reduce by 0.5% per month of early retirement or by other actuarially based rates.
Pensions will increase at a rate of 5% per annum or the lesser of 5% per annum or the rise in the Retail Price Index if less for pension entitlement accrued after 1 April 2001 or for pension accrued under the Laurence Keen Scheme and being in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pension after early retirement subject to Inland Revenue limits.
There is no undertaking or expectation for any other pension benefit to be arranged for any director by the Company.
Service contracts for executive directors The Company has service contracts with its executive directors.
It is Company policy that such contracts normally should contain notice periods of not more than twelve months.
Details of the contracts of employment of directors serving during the year are as follows: Executive director Date of contract Notice period I M Buckley 27 November 2003 6 months P D G Chavasse 5 December 2002 6 months S M Desborough 1 October 2004 6 months M P Egerton-Vernon 31 March 2000 12 months R P Lanyon 1 October 1997 12 months Viscount Lifford 29 August 1996 12 months A T Morris 1 July 2003 6 months P G Pearson Lund 5 January 2005 6 months A D Pomfret 1 October 2004 6 months G M Powell 9 March 1995 12 months R I Smeeton 9 March 1995 6 months There are no provisions within the contracts to provide automatic payments in excess of payment in lieu of notice upon termination by the Company and no pre-determined compensation package exists in the event of termination of employment.
Payment in lieu of notice would include basic salary, pension contributions and benefits.
There are no provisions for the payment of liquidated damages nor any statements in respect of the duty of mitigation.
Compensation payments will be determined on a case by case basis in the light of current market practice.
Compensation will include loss of salary and other contractual benefits but mitigation will be applied where appropriate.
The Board will take steps to ensure that the director is aware of his or her legal obligation to mitigate the loss incurred through severance by seeking other employment.
Executive directors contracts of service, which include details of remuneration, will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
Shareholdings New executive directors are encouraged to build up and maintain a shareholding at least equivalent to the value of one years basic salary within five years of taking up their appointment.
External appointments Executive directors are encouraged to take on external appointments as non executive directors, but are discouraged from holding more than one position in a major company.
Prior approval of any new appointment is required by the Board with fees being payable to the Company.
Ian Buckley and Viscount Lifford were appointed to the Boards of other public companies prior to their appointment to the Board.
In 2005, Ian Buckley received fees of 25,000 from NXT Plc whilst Viscount Lifford received fees of 36,667 from Basepoint PLC.
Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee consists solely of the independent non-executive directors, James Barclay, Caroline Burton, Jamie Cayzer-Colvin and Giles Coode-Adams.
With effect from 7 March 2006, Oliver Corbett and Mark Robertshaw will join the Committee.
The Committee is chaired by Caroline Burton.
None of the committee has any personal financial interests other than as shareholders, conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships or day to day involvement in running the business.
The chairman and chief executive, at the invitation of the Committee, attend the meetings but are not present when their own remuneration is discussed.
The Committee met on four occasions in 2005.
Details of attendance at meetings are shown on page 29.
com Report and accounts 2005 Page 40 Report on directors remuneration continued Advisers to the Remuneration Committee At a meeting on 19 February 2002, the Remuneration Committee appointed Deloitte as advisers to the Committee.
Their appointment is reviewed annually.
Deloitte attend at least one Remuneration Committee meeting per annum and advise on best practice and latest developments in senior executive remuneration.
Their appointment is reviewed on an annual basis.
Deloitte also advise the group on share scheme issues and in 2005 on the transition to International Financial Reporting Standards.
The Committee is also assisted by the personnel department and by the company secretary.
Non-executive directors Non-executive directors do not have contracts of employment but, as with all other directors, are required to stand for election at the Annual General Meeting following their appointment and thereafter every three years.
The executive directors are responsible for determining the fees of the non-executive directors, who do not receive pension or other benefits from the Group and do not participate in any group incentive scheme, other than the SIP.
For 2005 and 2004, all non-executive directors receive a fee of 27,000 per annum reduced pro rata if appointed during the year with an additional payment of 5,000 per annum to the chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
Annual General Meeting AGM The Committee considers that, taken together, these various remuneration components help to align the interests of directors with those of shareholders and conform to the principles laid down in The Combined Code on Corporate Governance published in July 2003 as an appendix to the UKLA Listing Rules and effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 November 2003.
The Board will move at the AGM an ordinary resolution seeking approval of the Directors Remuneration Report for 2005.
Notice of the AGM is on pages 97 and 98.
Approved by the Board on 7 March 2006 and signed on its behalf by: Caroline Burton Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
