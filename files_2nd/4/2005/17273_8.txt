Directors Remuneration Report for the financial year ended 29 January 2005 The following is a report by the Remuneration Committee which has been approved by the Board for submission to shareholders.
Composition and Terms of Reference The Remuneration Committee consists of the independent Non-Executive Directors who are Andrew Beeson Chairman, Prue Leith OBE and Roger Jones.
Its composition and terms of reference are in line with the Combined Code.
The Company complies with Section B of the Combined Code provisions on Directors remuneration and in respect of the Remuneration Report content.
The Committees aim is to ensure that the Executive Directors are rewarded for their contribution to the Group and are motivated to enhance the return to shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible, on behalf of the Board, for setting the remuneration policy for Executive Directors.
In addition, they have regard to pay and conditions for other employees in the Group especially the arrangements for Directors of subsidiaries who are not Directors of the Company.
The Committee is advised internally by the Human Resources Director of Woolworths plc and the Head of Group Reward.
External advice was provided during the year by Towers Perrin in relation to salary benchmarking and the overall levels of remuneration packages in comparative companies.
Towers Perrin was appointed by the Head of Group Reward on behalf of the Remuneration Committee.
In addition to data provided by Towers Perrin, the Committee also took into account information from other remuneration surveys.
Remuneration Policy The Committee continues to maintain a policy consistent with Group Reward Principles applied for all employees throughout the Group and in line with the Companys business objectives which: attracts, retains and motivates high calibre Directors: is appropriate to the Company, taking into account information from independent sources and from within the retail sector as well as other companies of a comparable size: aligns the interests of Directors and shareholders by linking share and cash incentives to performance: complies with best practice and comprises a mix of xed and variable pay with longer-term incentives.
When comparing remuneration packages with those in other companies, particular regard is taken of companies in the FTSE 250 and other retailers.
The reward principles applied throughout the Group provide for basic salaries to be set at the median for a range of comparative companies with reward for performance aimed at delivering an overall package that is competitive.
For Executive Directors the variable, performance-related remuneration the Performance Share Plan and the Annual Incentive Plan, currently represents 40 per cent of the total package for on-target performance.
Components of Remuneration Basic Salary Basic salary for each Director is reviewed annually in the context of market conditions affecting executive remuneration, affordability and the level of increases awarded to staff throughout the Group.
Basic salary levels are generally set at not more than the median for a range of comparative companies.
Benets In addition to salaries and the items described below, the Company provides a range of competitive benets including pension, a fully-expensed car or non-pensionable cash allowance and private medical insurance.
Service Contract The policy of the Committee is that notice periods should be set at not more than 12 months.
No Executive Director has a service contract with a notice period longer than 12 months.
Bonus For Executive Directors and Directors of subsidiaries, the Woolworths Group Annual Incentive Plan AIP applied during the year see page 21.
Gerald Corbett, the Chairman, is not entitled to participate in the AIP.
Incentives and bonuses Executive Share Option Schemes Following the adoption of new incentive plans at the Annual Meeting in 2004, the Company no longer grants share options under the Woolworths Group plc 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme.
Options were granted in March 2004 under the 2002 Executive Scheme.
These were half-yearly grants set at 35 per cent of salary for Senior Executives, 42.5 per cent of salary for Directors of subsidiary companies and at 50 per cent of salary for Executive Directors of the Company.
20 Woolworths Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Directors Remuneration Report continued for the financial year ended 29 January 2005 Incentives and bonuses continued Executive Share Option Schemes continued For the options granted in March 2004, the performance targets declared in the 2003 Directors Remuneration Report apply.
Fully diluted, adjusted Earnings Per Share EPS must increase by 6 per cent per annum commencing with the Companys financial year immediately prior to the date of grant in addition to the increase in the Retail Prices Index RPI over a three-year period in order for the option to be exercised in full.
If this is not achieved, growth in EPS of 5 per cent per annum plus RPI over the same period is required in order for up to 50 per cent of the option to be exercised.
If either of these targets is not met after the first three-year period there will be a retest one year later over a four-year period, from the same base, and the same proportion of the option will be available for exercise.
If neither of the targets has been achieved after four years the option will lapse.
The Committee believes that using EPS as the performance measure is consistent with the Companys strategy to grow profits at this stage in its development.
EPS is a measure used by the majority of companies of similar size and provides a simple calculation which is clear to all interested parties.
In the event of a change of control of the Company, the performance conditions will not be automatically waived.
A minimum target of an increase in EPS of 2 per cent per annum in addition to the increase in RPI will normally have to be met.
The option will normally be exercisable only in proportion to the number of months that have elapsed from grant to the date of early exercise against a total of 36 months.
A limit of 5 per cent of the total issued share capital on the number of new shares that can be issued to satisfy executive options granted under Executive Share Schemes applies over a ten-year period.
At the year-end outstanding share options represented 4.9 per cent of the total issued share capital.
Savings-Related Share Options A savings-related share option scheme ShareSave is open to all eligible employees in the UK.
The fourth grant of options under ShareSave was made in May 2004 and it is intended that options will be granted annually under this arrangement provided the scheme continues to provide a cost-effective method of enabling employees to share in the success of the Group.
The Committee is aware of the changes to the accounting treatment of employee share options and will review the operation of ShareSave during the next year.
Woolworths Group Incentive Plan The Woolworths Group Incentive Plan WIP has been replaced by the Annual Incentive Plan described below.
For the year ended 31January 2004, Executive Directors had an opportunity to defer receipt of their declared bonus for three years, at the completion of which it is matched by 25 per cent in shares which are purchased in the market at the time of the election to defer.
The matching share awards made to Executive Directors are shown on page 24.
The Woolworths Group Annual Incentive Plan This Plan was adopted at the Annual General Meeting in 2004.
Executive Directors, Directors of subsidiaries and other senior employees participate in the Plan.
It operates on an annual basis and participants do not participate in any other annual bonus schemes.
The Plan provides for two types of Award: a Cash Award, which will be paid after the end of the financial year and which, for Executive Directors will be based on the achievement of financial targets and meeting personal objectives.
The principal financial target is Group profit and, if the relevant profit target is not met, no award will be made for that portion of the Award.
If profits exceed the relevant targets then a greater percentage of bonus will be paid.
Penalties apply if stock and cash targets are not met.
For Executive Directors the Cash Award for achieving target performance will be 20 per cent of salary rising to a maximum of 40 per cent for exceptional performance: a Share Award, which will be made after the end of the financial year and which will be based on the achievement of Group financial targets.
For Executive Directors the Share Award for achieving target performance will be 30 per cent of salary rising to a maximum of 60 per cent for exceptional performance.
Shares comprised in a Share Award will be held in an employee share trust for a vesting period of three years.
At the end of the vesting period a multiplier will be applied if a performance target is met.
For on-target performance the multiplier for Executive Directors will be 1.3 rising to a maximum of two for exceptional performance.
If a participant leaves the Company during the vesting period no multiplier will apply.
On a change of control of the Company the Committee will determine whether the multiplier will apply taking into account the performance from the Award date to the date on which the change of control occurs.
The Company does not intend to issue any new shares for this Plan.
The Committee considers it important that Directors and senior employees focus on delivering annual targets set each year.
Cash Awards and Share Awards are based on the achievement of these targets.
The performance measure for the multiplier is growth in fully diluted adjusted Earnings Per Share EPS for the Company.
Awards for the year ended 29 January 2005 Awards are earned for the achievement of profit targets based on budgets and compared with broker estimates.
The Group profit was lower than the median of expectations and the Cash Award for Executive Directors is 16 per cent of salary with a supplementary 15 per cent payment to reect awards made in the entertainment and publishing division following this years strong performance.
Share Awards at 10 per cent of salary are due to all participants.
For Executive Directors this may increase by a multiplier of 1.3 if EPS growth over three years is 6 per cent per annum in addition to the increase in the Retail Prices Index rising to a maximum of two if EPS growth over three years is 12 per cent per annum in addition to the increase in the Retail Prices Index.
No extra shares will be awarded if EPS growth over three years is less than 6 per cent per annum and there will be no retesting if this is not achieved.
These awards will be made following the announcement of the results for that year.
21 Woolworths Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Directors Remuneration Report continued for the financial year ended 29 January 2005 Incentives and bonuses continued The Woolworths Group Annual Incentive Plan continued Awards for the year ending 28 January 2006 For the Cash Award the main financial target will again be profits based on budgets and broker estimates.
For Executive Directors this will be Group profit whilst for other participants it will be a mixture of Group and operating company profits.
Up to 10 per cent of salary may be awarded for achievement of personal objectives.
Penalties will apply if stock and cash targets are not met.
Share Awards, to be made after the end of the financial year, will also be based on the achievement of Group profit targets with additional shares awarded on the basis described above.
In the event of a change of control of the Company, the Committee may consider it appropriate to waive the performance targets for the Chief Executives Awards so that the Chief Executive receives a cash bonus of up to 100 per cent of salary in lieu of any other Cash or Share Award that may be payable for that year under the Plan.
The Woolworths Group Performance Share Plan This Plan was also adopted at the Annual General Meeting in 2004.
Executive Directors and Directors of subsidiaries participate in this Plan.
It provides for participants to receive an Award of Shares every six months, after the announcement of annual and half-yearly results.
For Executive Directors the value of the shares comprised in each Award will be equal in value to 20 per cent of basic salary at the date the Award is made.
The shares will be held in an employee trust for a vesting period of three years.
For exceptional performance the Award may increase to 50 per cent of salary.
The Committee has decided that fully diluted, adjusted Earnings Per Share EPS is the most appropriate performance measure.
It is a clearly understood, published gure, which strips out the effect of exceptional items.
By using a single consistent measure for annual and long-term incentives the participants will be focused on delivering forecast profit targets.
The growth in EPS will be calculated in addition to the increase in the Retail Prices Index and no Award will vest unless the growth in EPS is 6 per cent per annum or more.
Targets for the Awards to be made to Executive during the 2006 financial year will be as follows: Increase in EPS Award as a % of salary Less than 6% nil 6% 10% 8% 20% 10% 30% 12% 40% 15% 50% There will be no retesting after the three-year performance period.
Awards made to Executive Directors during the year to 29 January 2005 are shown on page 25.
Performance Graph The Committee is required to include a graph showing the Total Shareholder Return TSR for the Company against an appropriate index.
The Committee has decided that the Index of General Retailers is appropriate and for further comparison, the TSR for companies in the FTSE 250 is also shown.
