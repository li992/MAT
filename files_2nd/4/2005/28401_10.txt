58.22 PF DirectorsR P9 DW 24 3 06 11:36 am Page 57 Directors remuneration report 1 Introduction This is the directors remuneration report of Provident Financial plc the company for the financial year ended 31 December 2005 which has been prepared pursuant to, and in accordance with, section 234B of the Companies Act 1985 the Companies Act.
In accordance with section 241 of the Companies Act, a resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the annual general meeting AGM of the company to be held on 17 May 2006.
2 The remuneration committee 2.1 Throughout 2005, the remuneration committee the committee consisted of Ray Miles and Graham Pimlott under the chairmanship of John Maxwell.
2.2 The committee met seven times during the year.
2.3 Pursuant to its terms of reference, the committee considers the framework of executive remuneration and makes recommendations to the board.
It determines the specific remuneration packages and conditions of service of the Chairman, the executive directors and the Company Secretary, including their service agreements.
It also monitors the level and structure of the remuneration of the most senior management below board level within the group.
No director is involved in determining his own remuneration.
2.4 The Chairman and the Chief Executive each have the right to attend and speak but not vote at meetings of the committee other than when their own remuneration or any matter relating to them is being considered in which case they absent themselves from the meeting.
In 2005, the committee consulted with the Chairman, John van Kuffeler, about the Chief Executives remuneration and with the Chief Executive, Robin Ashton, about the remuneration of the other executive directors.
The Company Secretary, Rosamond Marshall Smith, is secretary to the committee and attended the meetings of the committee in 2005: as a solicitor she provided legal and technical support to the committee.
2.5 The committee has appointed Kepler Associates Kepler as remuneration consultant.
This consultant is independent and does not provide any other services to the group.
Kepler has provided advice to the committee in 2005.
The committee has also been advised by Slaughter and May which is the groups city solicitor and has advised the group on other legal matters during the year.
In all cases the advisers were instructed by the secretary on behalf of the committee.
3 Statement of the companys policy on directors remuneration Remuneration policy 3.1 The remuneration policy applied by the committee is based on the need to attract, reward, motivate and retain executive directors in a manner consistent with the long-term accumulation of value for shareholders.
The committee is also conscious of the need to avoid paying more than is reasonable for this purpose.
3.2 The executive directors remuneration consists of a basic salary, an annual cash bonus subject to performance conditions and other benefits.
They also participate in pension schemes.
Additionally, they participate in a performance share plan which necessitates the waiver of part of the annual cash bonus, which is subject to performance conditions, and an employee savings-related share option scheme which is not subject to performance conditions.
It is also proposed that they should participate in a long-term incentive scheme and a new senior executive share option scheme, subject to shareholder approval at the forthcoming AGM to be held on 17 May 2006: the executive scheme is designed to replace the two senior executive share option schemes which have expired.
Before recommending these new schemes to the board, the committee carried out a review of the existing equity incentive schemes and current best practice.
The remuneration policy is designed to ensure that a significant proportion of the executive directors remuneration is linked to performance, through the operation of the annual cash bonus and the equity incentive schemes.
3.3 The committee normally reviews the executive directors remuneration annually.
The policy of the committee is to pay remuneration at the median level, subject to performance.
In December 2005 the committee reviewed the salaries of the executive directors but decided not to award any increase.
3.4 The fees for the non-executive directors, other than the Chairman, are fixed by the board and are designed both to recognise the responsibilities of non-executive directors and to attract individuals with the necessary skills and experience to contribute to the future growth of the group.
Their business expenses are reimbursed by the company.
Full details of their fees for 2005 with 2004 comparative figures are set out in the table of directors remuneration on page 60 in paragraph 4.
Provident Financial Annual Report & Financial Statements 2005 57 58.22 PF DirectorsR P9 DW 24 3 06 11:37 am Page 58 Directors remuneration report continued 3 Statement of the companys policy on directors remuneration continued Cash bonus 3.5 An annual cash bonus is payable, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions.
The bonus is calculated as a percentage of salary.
The purpose of the bonus scheme is to provide a meaningful incentive for executive directors which is clearly focused on improving the groups performance and aligns, so far as is practicable, shareholder and executive director interests.
Executive directors are eligible for annual cash bonuses by reference to audited earnings per share as defined in the bonus scheme and achievement of objectives.
The total bonus payable cannot exceed 100% of salary.
In exceptional circumstances, the committee may make such adjustments to the calculation of earnings per share as it considers fair and reasonable.
Bonuses do not form part of pensionable earnings.
Share options 3.6 The grant of options under equity incentive schemes to executive directors and senior managers is normally considered once in each year after the announcement of the companys results in accordance with a formula determined by reference to salary.
3.7 The company has granted options under two senior executive share option schemes the schemes.
No further options can be granted under these schemes.
Further details are set out in paragraphs 3.7.
1 The Provident Financial plc Senior Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 is an Inland Revenue approved scheme.
The aggregate exercise prices of the options held by an executive under this scheme must not exceed 30,000.
The Provident Financial plc Unapproved Senior Executive Share Option Scheme 1996 is not approved by the Inland Revenue.
2 Both schemes have performance targets which have to be met before any options can be exercised.
3 For options granted prior to 2002 the performance condition is that over a three-year period the real growth in earnings per share as defined must average 3% a year after making appropriate adjustments for inflation.
4 For options granted in 2002 and thereafter the following performance conditions apply: a where the option is granted over shares with an aggregate exercise price of up to one times the directors salary, the real growth in earnings per share after adjusting for inflation must average 3% a year over a fixed three-year period this period may be extended to four or five years : b to the extent that the option is granted over shares with an aggregate exercise price in excess of one times and up to two times the directors salary, the condition referred to in 3.7.
4 a above is 4% rather than 3% real growth in earnings per share.
5 A performance condition based on earnings per share has been used in both executive schemes since their establishment in 1995 and 1996.
It is considered that this aligns, so far as is practicable, the interests of the directors with those of the shareholders.
The performance conditions permit limited retesting by reference to a fixed base.
6 No executive options have been granted at a discount.
3.8 The executive directors together with other eligible group employees may participate in the Provident Financial plc Employee Savings-Related Share Option Scheme 2003.
Participants save a fixed sum each month for three or five years and may use these funds to purchase shares after three, five or seven years.
The exercise price is fixed at up to 20% below the market value of the shares at the date directors and employees are invited to participate in the scheme.
Up to 250 can be saved each month.
This scheme does not contain performance conditions as it is an Inland Revenue approved scheme designed for employees at all levels.
58 Provident Financial Annual Report & Financial Statements 2005 58.22 PF DirectorsR P9 DW 24 3 06 11:37 am Page 59 Directors remuneration report continued 3 Statement of the companys policy on directors remuneration continued Performance share plan 3.9 The Provident Financial Performance Share Plan the performance share plan entitles executive directors who waive up to 50% with a minimum of 25% of their annual cash bonus, and other eligible employees who waive up to 50% or 30% depending on their level of seniority of their annual cash bonus, to be considered for participation.
Participants receive a basic award of shares of up to the value of the waived bonus, together with a matching award of an equivalent amount which is subject to a performance condition.
For awards granted in 2003, 2004 and 2006, the matching award will vest only if the companys average annual growth in earnings per share is equal to or greater than RPI plus 3% over a period of three consecutive financial years, the first of which is the financial year starting immediately before the grant date of the matching award.
For awards granted in 2005, the matching award will vest only if the companys average annual growth in earnings per share is equal to or greater than RPI plus 3% over a period of five consecutive years, the first of which is the financial year starting immediately before the grant date of the matching award.
Although basic earnings per share is generally used for the performance calculation, for 2006 awards earnings per share before Yes Car Credit closure costs is being used for the starting point to avoid participants benefiting from the impact of the closure of the Yes Car Credit business.
The performance conditions were selected by the committee after consideration of other possible types of condition.
The committee took the view that the use of this earnings per share target aligned, so far as is practicable, the interests of the directors with those of the shareholders.
Other benefits 3.10 The executive directors are provided with company-owned cars and fuel or a cash alternative, long-term disability cover under the companys insured permanent health policy and medical cover for them and their immediate families.
Benefits in kind are not pensionable.
Shareholding policy 3.11 The company has a share retention policy for executive directors.
A director should retain half of vested shares, net of tax and exercise costs, until he has a beneficial shareholding equivalent to one times his annual salary: in performing the calculation, post-tax embedded gains on vested unexercised share options will be included.
The committee reviews the shareholdings of the executive directors in the light of this policy once a year.
Service agreements 3.12 The current policy is for executive directors service agreements to provide for both the company and the director to give one years notice.
No director has a service agreement containing a liquidated damages clause on termination: in the event of the termination of an agreement, particularly for poor performance, it is the current policy to seek mitigation of loss by the director concerned and to ensure that any payment made is the minimum which is commensurate with the companys legal obligations.
Where possible, the company would seek to make any payment in instalments and subject to appropriate conditions.
Other directorships 3.13 The company will normally permit an executive director to hold one non-executive directorship and to retain the fee from that appointment.
However, any proposed appointment will require the approval of the board.
In accordance with the Combined Code, the board would not permit an executive director to take on the chairmanship of a FTSE 100 company.
None of the executive directors currently holds a non-executive directorship.
Changes to the remuneration policy 3.14 During the year, the committee carried out a review of the existing equity incentive schemes and current best practice.
As a result of this review, the committee is proposing to introduce the Long-Term Incentive Scheme the LTIS and replace the two senior executive share option schemes, which have expired, with the new senior executive share option scheme the ESOS, subject to shareholder approval at the forthcoming AGM.
3.15 The LTIS would reward total shareholder return TSR percentage outperformance against a tailored peer group of financial services.
The committee believes that relative TSR is the most objective measure of the companys success, is a fair measure of management performance and helps align the interests of directors and shareholders.
It is intended that the initial target will require the companys TSR over a three year performance period, when measured against the tailored peer group, to be at least median 25% vesting with full vesting if TSR exceeds the median by 8.5% a year and straight line vesting in between these two levels.
Participation will initially be limited to executive directors and maximum annual awards will normally be limited to 100% of salary.
3.16 The ESOS will contain both a Revenue approved and unapproved section.
All options will be subject to a performance target.
Initially, it is intended that options will be granted with a target which will require annual earnings per share growth to exceed RPI plus 3% averaged over a three-year period.
At that level 25% of the shares under option would be exercisable with the option becoming fully exercisable at average annual growth in earnings per share in excess of RPI plus 6% over the three-year period.
A sliding scale for vesting will apply between these levels.
The committee believes that earnings per share is the best measure of the companys financial performance, and will complement the use of relative TSR in the LTIS.
Executive directors will participate in the ESOS and maximum annual awards will normally be limited to 100% of salary.

5.2 The performance conditions which apply to the exercise of executive share options are as set out in paragraphs 5.2.
1 Performance condition A referred to in the table below applies to options granted prior to 2002.
Over a three-year period the real growth in the companys earnings per share must average 3% a year after making appropriate adjustments for inflation.
2 Performance condition B referred to in the table below applies to options granted in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005.
Where the option is granted over shares with an aggregate exercise price of up to one times the directors salary, the performance condition is that, over a fixed three-year period, the real growth in earnings per share after adjusting for inflation must average 3% a year if the condition is not satisfied after the three years the period will be extended to four years and then, if the condition is still not satisfied, to five years, whereupon if the condition is still not satisfied, the option will lapse.
For options granted in excess of one times the directors salary, the condition is 4% rather than 3% real growth in earnings per share.
5.3 The committee has adjusted the performance conditions of the options to reflect the fact that earnings per share is now calculated under IFRS rather than UK GAAP.
This was achieved by taking the IFRS earnings per share figure for 2004 and applying the same percentage changes, as experienced under UK GAAP, for the years back to 2001, to derive equivalent IFRS figures.
5.4 The aggregate notional gain representing the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the shares at the date of exercise made by all the directors on the exercise of share options during 2005 amounted to 140,438 2004 502,240.
5.5 The companys highest paid director in 2005 was Robin Ashton, whose emoluments amounted to 524,000 2004 Robin Ashton 705,000 and whose notional gain representing the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the shares at the date of exercise on the exercise of share options amounted to nil 2004 Robin Ashton 157,502.
5.6 The mid-market closing price of the companys shares on 30 December 2005 was 547.5p and the range during 2005 was 547.5p to 745p.
5.7 No consideration is payable on the grant of an option.
5.8 None of the options held by the directors lapsed during the year.
5.9 There were no changes in directors share options between 31 December 2005 and 14 March 2006.
5.10 None of the directors has notified the company of an interest in any other shares, transactions or arrangements which requires disclosure.
There are no performance conditions attaching to the basic award.
6.3 No awards to executive directors were made during the period 1 January to 14 March 2006.
6.4 The dividends payable on the basic and matching award shares are paid to the directors.
The gross amounts received in 2005 were Robin Ashton 6,678: John Harnett 9,076: Chris Johnstone 8,073 and David Swann 8,131.
These figures have been included in the benefits column in the table of directors remuneration on page 60 in paragraph 4 above.
6.5 The committee has adjusted the performance conditions of the matching awards to reflect the fact that earnings per share is now calculated under IFRS rather than UK GAAP.
This was achieved by taking the IFRS earnings per share figure for 2004 and applying the same percentage changes, as experienced under UK GAAP, for the years back to 2002, to derive equivalent IFRS figures.
6.6 Other than as specified in paragraph 6.5 above, there have been no variations in the terms and conditions of plan interests during the year.
7 Pensions and life assurance 7.1 There are two directors 2004 three for whom retirement benefits are accruing under the Provident Financial Senior Pension Scheme, a defined benefit scheme the senior pension scheme, and two directors 2004 two for whom retirement benefits are accruing under defined contribution schemes.
Benefits are also accruing under the senior pension scheme for one former director, Chris Johnstone.
7.2 John van Kuffeler and John Harnett each have a defined contribution personal pension arrangement and each is also a member of the Provident Financial Supplemental Pension Scheme which was established for employees whose benefits from tax-approved schemes are restricted by the earnings cap.
Life assurance benefit up to the level of the earnings cap is provided by the senior pension scheme: additional death in service benefit is provided by the Provident Financial Unapproved Funded Death Benefits Scheme.
7.3 For John van Kuffeler, the company contributes 23% of his salary to his pension arrangements.
The contributions are invested to produce benefits at his normal retirement date at age 60 or on death.
He is also eligible for a lump sum death benefit of four times salary at date of death.
Provision of these benefits is through personal pension policies, the Provident Financial Supplemental Pension Scheme and the Provident Financial Unapproved Funded Death Benefits Scheme.
The companys contributions in respect of John van Kuffeler during 2005 including the cost of the life insurance amounted to 30,938 2004 30,580.

The companys contributions in respect of John Harnett during 2005 including the cost of the life insurance amounted to 105,263 2004 87,098.
7.5 The executive directors, other than John Harnett, participate in the senior pension scheme which provides pensions and other benefits within Inland Revenue limits.
The senior pension scheme provides, in respect of service from 1 January 2000, a pension of up to two-thirds of basic salary at the normal retirement date at age 60.
The pension provided in respect of service prior to 1 January 2000 is up to two-thirds of basic salary at the normal retirement date at age 60 reduced by an amount approximately equal to two-thirds of the single persons basic rate state pension from state pension age.
The senior pension scheme is contributory and directors currently contribute at the rate of 7% of basic salary.
7.6 Details of the pension entitlements earned during 2005 are set out below: Transfer value Transfer value of pension of pension benefits Increase Accrued benefits accrued at in transfer Age annual pension Increase in Directors accrued at 31 December value less 31 December 31 December 31 December annual pension contribution 31 December 2004 directors 2005 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 2004 2005 restated contribution Directors name 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Robin Ashton 47 179 154 21 23 33 30 2,806 2,074 699 Chris Johnstone 46 124 110 12 14 21 19 1,883 1,418 444 David Swann 58 196 176 16 19 21 19 4,973 3,987 965 Accrued annual pension is the pension to which the director would be entitled at his normal retirement date based on the number of years of pensionable service at 31 December 2005, assuming no further contributions after that date Increase in annual pension is the increase during the year in the accrued annual pension arising from the changes in pensionable service and salary, over and above any general increase to compensate for inflation The method used to calculate transfer values was changed in January 2005.
The transfer values as at 31 December 2004 shown above are calculated using the new transfer value method.
The actual transfer values as at 31 December 2004 calculated using the method in force at that time were Robin Ashton 1,878,000: Chris Johnstone 1,281,000 and David Swann 3,553,000.
The increases in transfer value less directors contribution on this basis were Robin Ashton 895,000: Chris Johnstone 581,000 and David Swann 1,340,000.
7.7 The senior pension scheme also provides spouses pensions of four-ninths of basic salary at date of death if the director dies in service and two-thirds of the directors pension if the director dies in retirement and lump sums on death in service of four times basic salary at date of death plus a return of the directors contributions.
If the director does not leave a spouse, the pension will be paid to any dependants at the discretion of the trustees of the senior pension scheme.
7.8 With the consent of the company, a director can retire under the senior pension scheme rules at any time between ages 50 and 60, in which case the pension payable would be the accrued pension based on salary and pensionable service at the date he leaves the service of the company reduced to reflect the longer period for which it will be paid.
7.9 Pensions in respect of service up to 1 January 2000 are guaranteed to increase, when in payment, at a rate of 5% each year.
Pensions in respect of service from 1 January 2000 are guaranteed to increase each year by the lower of the annual increase in the retail prices index and 5%.
Discretionary increases may be granted by the trustees with the consent of the company.
7.10 There are no discretionary benefits for which allowance is made when calculating transfer values on leaving service.
7.11 The senior pension scheme together with the Provident Financial Staff Pension Scheme was closed to employees who joined the group on or after 1 January 2003.
These employees are eligible to join the Provident Financial Stakeholder Pension Plan.
7.12 With effect from 1 April 2006, a cash balance section of the senior pension scheme is being introduced for future service.
For those who elect to remain in the final salary section of the senior pension scheme, the contribution rate will be increased to 14% of basic salary.
Where the value of an executive directors pension benefit is in excess of the lifetime allowance on 6 April 2006, he may elect to cease accruing benefits in respect of future service and receive a salary supplement of 30% of basic salary instead.
8 Directors service agreements 8.1 Six directors, Robin Ashton, Charles Gregson, John van Kuffeler, John Maxwell, Ray Miles and Graham Pimlott are offering themselves for re-election at the AGM to be held on 17 May 2006.
