GSK grants share options to Executive Directors and Senior Managers on an annual basis.
An initial grant was made following completion of the merger in March 2001.
The measurement period for the options granted in March 2001 commenced on 1st January 2001.
The measurement periods for options granted in November 2001 and 2002, and December 2003 and 2004 commenced on 1st January 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively.
The Directors hold these options under the various share option plans referred to in Note 37 to the fnancial statements, Employee share schemes.
The measurement period for options granted in February 2006 commenced on 1st January 2006.
None of the other Directors had an interest in any option over the companys shares.
Following the merger, each of the Directors above elected to exchange their outstanding options in the legacy share option plans for options over GSK shares.
These Directors, and all other participants in those legacy schemes who made such an election, will receive an additional benefit of a cash sum equal to 10% of the grant price of the original option.
This additional benefit will be given when the new option is exercised or lapses.
Prior to 2003, only those share options granted to the then Executive Directors were subject to a performance condition.
In order for the options to vest in full, business performance EPS growth, excluding currency and exceptional items, had on average to be at least three percentage points per annum more than the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index over any three-year performance period.
For share options granted in 2003 and 2004 vesting increases on a straight-line basis for EPS performance between the hurdles set out in the following table.
Annualised growth in EPS Percentage of award vesting RPI 5% 100% RPI 4% 75% RPI 3% 50% RPI 3% 0% In respect of the 2003 grant, if the performance condition is not met after the three-year measurement period, the performance will be measured again over the four financial years following the date of grant of the options.
If the performance condition is not met at the end of four years, the option will lapse.
The options granted to the Executive Directors in 2004 were subject to the same performance condition as set in 2003, but to the extent that the performance conditions have not been met at the end of the three-year performance period, the option will lapse with no retesting being permitted.
An EOI benefit of $174,472 95,864 was paid to Dr Garnier on exercise of these options.
This benefit has been included in the table on page 45.
At the average rate for the year, the above gain made by Dr Yamada amounted to 1,145,017.
An EOI benefit of $167,405 91,981 was paid to Dr Yamada on the exercise of these options.
Mr Coombe did not exercise any share options during 2005 or 2004.

The PSP awards for the performance period 1st January 2006 to 31st December 2008 were made on 21st February 2006 when the market price was 14.68 per share and $51.02 per ADS.
Dr Garnier was awarded 220,000 ADSs, and Mr Heslop 100,000 shares.
At the average exchange rate for the year, the above gains by Dr Garnier and Dr Yamada amounted to 897,500 and 256,429, respectively.
The PSP is a medium-term incentive scheme introduced during 2001.
The PSP replaces the LTI Plan and the Mid-Term Incentive Plan operated, respectively, by Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham.
Under the terms of the PSP the number of shares actually vesting is determined following the end of the relevant three-year measurement period and is dependent on GSKs performance during that period as described on pages 40 and 41.
The share awards were previously granted annually in November or December, but from 2005 they are granted in February of the following year.
The measurement period commences on the 1st January, in the year in which they are granted, ending after three years on 31st December.
The three-year measurement period for the awards with a performance period commencing 1st January 2003 ended on 31st December 2005.
Based on the performance of GSK during that period, 50% of the award vested in February 2006.
For awards with a performance period commencing on 1st January 2005 and subsequent awards, dividends are reinvested on the PSPs awarded to members of the CET.
Dividends are reinvested in the quarter in which payment is made.
Under the terms of the PSP, US participants may defer receipt of all or part of their vested awards.
Prior to the performance period beginning 1st January 2004, awards were in two parts: half can be earned by reference to GSKs TSR performance compared to the FTSE 100, of which the company is a constituent, and the other half of the award will be earned if the companys business performance EPS growth, excluding currency and exceptional items, is on average at least three percentage points per year more than the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index over the three-year performance period.
For these awards, if GSK is ranked in the top 20 of the FTSE 100 based on TSR performance, then all of the shares in this part of the award will vest.
For the 50th position in the FTSE 100, 40% of the shares will vest.
If GSK is ranked below the 50th position, none of the shares subject to this part of the award will vest.
Between the 20th and 50th positions, vesting will occur on a sliding scale.
GSK Annual Report 2005 51 REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS Remuneration Report continued The following vesting table applies to the awards with performance periods from 1st January 2004 to 31st December 2006 and 1st January 2005 to 31st December 2007.
It also applies to the awards made on 21st February 2006.
The performance comparator group for these awards comprised 14 other companies TSR rank with 14 companies & GlaxoSmithKline Percentage of award vesting and GlaxoSmithKline.
Both Aventis and Sano-Synthelabo were in the comparator 1 100% group prior to their merger to form Sano-Aventis.
For the purposes of calculating TSR over the performance period for the awards granted in December 2003, the 2 100% starting price of the shares of the two individual companies will be compared to the 3 90% price of the merged company at the end of the performance period, adjusted by the merger ratio.
Dividends will be treated as having been reinvested during the 4 80% performance period.
5 70% TSR is measured on a pro rata basis.
Where GlaxoSmithKlines performance falls 6 60% between two of the comparators, the level of vesting will be determined by the actual 7 50% relative level of TSR rather than simple ranking.

Dr Garnier deferred receipt of the full amounts vested in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003.

Dr Shapiro is a member of GlaxoSmithKlines scientific Advisory Board SAB.
Dr Shapiro was a member of SmithKline Beechams SAB from 1993 until the completion of the merger with Glaxo Wellcome.
Along with other members of the SAB, she received annual grants of SmithKline Beecham SARs which, in general, vested three years from the date of grant and will expire 10 years from the date of grant.
Grants of SARs to SAB members ceased in 1999.
SARs entitle the holder to a cash sum at a future date based on share price growth between the date of grant and the date of exercise.
Full provision is made in the financial statements for accrued gains on SARs from the date of grant.
In connection with the merger, all previously granted SARs became immediately exercisable.
