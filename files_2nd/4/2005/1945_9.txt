BELLWAY p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2005 35 Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration Introduction The remuneration of the executive directors is determined by the Board Committee on Executive Directors Remuneration the Committee within a framework set by the Board and on its behalf.
The Committee consists of three non-executive directors, namely Mr L P Finn Chairman, Mr D G Perry and Mr P M Johnson.
None of the Committee members has a personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided.
There are no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
During the period, the Group Company Secretary attended a number of Committee meetings at the invitation of the Committee and provided advice on issues other than those relating to his own remuneration.
The Committee also received independent external advice from New Bridge Street Consultants who were appointed by the Committee and who provided no services to the Company other than advice to the Committee on remuneration related matters.
Objectives The aim of the Committee is to ensure that the Company has competitive remuneration packages in place in order to recruit, retain and motivate executive directors in the overall interests of shareholders, the Company, its employees and its customers.
The Committee has set as an objective a policy of paying remuneration at around the median of a peer group of similar UK housebuilding businesses and it is satisfied that the structure of the executives packages, as described in this section, will broadly achieve this objective.
The Committee has used this comparative approach to benchmarking with caution, recognising the risk of upward only reviews of remuneration.
The structure of the package has been designed to ensure that the performance related elements of remuneration annual bonus and long-term incentives constitute a significant proportion of an executive's potential total remuneration package, but are only receivable if demanding and stretching performance targets are achieved.
In framing the Companys remuneration policy for executive directors, the Committee has given full consideration to the best practice provisions in the Combined Code, published in July 2003.
Service contracts The executive directors have fixed-term service contracts which specify that retirement is at age 60.
Mr H C Dawe had a service contract signed on 19 January 1996 and amended on 16 October 2003 which was terminable by the Company on 24 months notice but which reduced pro rata in the two years up to contractual retirement date which was 1 November 2004.
From that date he has operated with a letter of appointment with a fixed-term of three years, terminating on 31 October 2007.
Service contracts for Mr J K Watson signed on 16 March 2001, Mr P J Stoker signed on 19 January 1996 and amended with effect from 1 November 2003 and Mr A M Leitch signed on 1 September 2002 are terminable by the Company on 12 months notice, but with a condition that, on termination, an amount equivalent to one years salary, benefits and the average amount of the last two years annual bonus payments, would be payable.
The inclusion of average annual bonus in the calculation of compensation payable for early termination will ensure that there is variability in the potential level of compensation.
In particular, after a period of poor performance, it could be expected that little or no bonus would be payable, reducing potential payout in these circumstances.
The notice period of all executive directors service contracts is kept under review by the Committee.
It is the Committees view that the notice period for the executive directors is appropriate and consistent with current market practice.
All non-executive directors have letters of appointment with the Company of no more than three years.
Current agreements expire on the following dates: Mr H C Dawe 31 October 2007, Mr L P Finn Annual General Meeting in January 2007, Mr D G Perry - 31 October 2006, and Mr P M Johnson - 31 October 2006.
Salaries Salaries are reviewed on 1 August each year and any changes are implemented from that date.
For the year under consideration the executive directors were awarded rises varying from 5.26% to 20.63%.
Benefits in kind relate mainly to the provision and use of motor vehicles including, in relation to the Chairman, the part time use of a driver and the transfer to him of his motor vehicles at nil cost when he ceased to be executive Chairman on 1 November 2004.
In addition, private medical insurance and home telephone charges are also paid.
Annual bonus scheme The annual bonus scheme has a potential which is currently capped at 120% of basic salary other than in exceptional circumstances where outstanding performance may, in the view of the Committee, merit a higher bonus.
A range of EPS growth targets is set each year by the Committee around a challenging budgeted figure.
Only where budget is achieved or exceeded is there an opportunity for executives to earn a significant bonus.
BELLWAY p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2005 36 Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration continued One half of the bonus earned is payable in November each year following the announcement of the Groups annual results.
The other half is used to acquire Bellway shares at the then current market value, which are held in the Bellway p. l. c. Employee Share Trust 1992 for three years.
On the third anniversary of the acquisition of the shares, the executive directors are allowed to have the shares transferred into their name.
Deferred shares are at risk of forfeiture if the executive leaves employment, other than in certain compassionate circumstances.
In addition, on vesting, the executives receive the benefit of the accrued dividends on the deferred shares in the form of further shares.
Annual bonuses are not pensionable.
Long-term incentive schemes The Company operates Inland Revenue approved and unapproved long-term share incentive schemes to encourage the executive directors and employees to hold shares in the Company and to enhance share values.
1 The Bellway p. l. c. 1995 Employee Share Option Scheme has been in existence since 1995 and the last tranche of shares was awarded to directors in October 2003.
Options have been granted on a discretionary basis to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors.
No further options may be granted under this scheme.
A number of changes to the law governing discretionary share option schemes contained in the Finance Act 1996 changed the tax treatment of share options granted under Inland Revenue approved discretionary share option schemes, such as the 1995 Scheme.
This led to the Company introducing, in June 1996, the Bellway p. l. c. 1996 Employee Share Option Scheme, which is an unapproved discretionary scheme.
The 1996 Scheme enables members of the Board and certain other employees to be granted options to buy shares in the Company where the 1995 Scheme, as statutorily amended, would have restricted or prohibited this.
With regard to the exercise of options granted under both the 1995 Scheme and the 1996 Scheme, the Committee has set objective performance conditions which apply to all options granted under both the 1995 and 1996 Schemes.
Only on the achievement of such conditions will the options become capable of being exercised.
The conditions to be satisfied will be either: a the growth in earnings per share of the Company in any three consecutive years will not be less than the growth in the Retail Price Index plus six per cent over the same period: or b the growth in earnings per share of the Company in any three consecutive years exceeding the mean average growth in earnings per share in the same period of companies whose shares are quoted in the 'Building and Construction' sector of the FT-SE Actuaries Shares Indices or such other sector which from time to time lists companies whose undertakings in general are broadly similar to those of the Company.
On options being granted to the executive directors, it is intended that options for at least an equivalent number of shares will be set aside to be granted to the Group's other employees.
2 The Bellway p. l. c. Savings Related Share Option Scheme, which was established in 2003, is a share option scheme offered to all employees, including the executive directors.
The original scheme was established in 1990.
3 The Bellway p. l. c. 2004 Performance Share Plan is a long-term incentive plan introduced for senior executives.
For the executive directors and the Group Company Secretary it has replaced the Bellway p. l. c. 1995 and 1996 Employee Share Option Schemes.
The salient features of the plan are: A conditional right to acquire shares may be awarded to an executive each year.
The maximum value of each conditional award of shares would be 100% of basic salary.
The conditional award of shares may be released to the executive after three years, depending on the performance of Bellway against a comparator group of other housebuilding companies.
The performance measure used for awards is Total Shareholder Return TSR which measures the change in a Company's share price plus the value of dividends paid.
The TSRs of all of the companies in the comparator group will be ranked.
If Bellway is ranked at the median position, 33% of the award of shares will be released.
At the upper quartile 100% of the shares will be released.
Between median and upper quartile, shares will be released between 33% and 100% on a straight-line basis.
For performance below median, none of the shares will be released.
BELLWAY p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2005 37 Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration continued Long-term incentive schemes continued The companies comprising the comparator group for the first two awards were as follows: Barratt Developments PLC Crest Nicholson PLC Taylor Woodrow plc The Berkeley Group plc McCarthy & Stone plc Westbury plc Bovis Homes Group PLC Persimmon plc Wilson Bowden plc Countryside Properties PLC Redrow plc George Wimpey plc During the year, Countryside Properties PLC ceased to be listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The Committee will continue to review the composition of the comparator group as and when appropriate.
TSR is considered to be an effective measure of performance as it aligns the interests of directors with shareholders by requiring superior stock market performance compared to peer companies.
Furthermore, this performance measure provides an effective balance to the annual bonus, which is determined by earnings per share growth targets.
The TSR is independently supplied by the Companys brokers and verified by the Committee.
Pensions The executive directors are members of the Bellway p. l. c. 1972 Pension and Life Assurance Scheme defined benefit section and, in accordance with the Combined Code recommendations, only basic salary is pensionable.
The pensionable salaries of Mr J K Watson and Mr A M Leitch were redefined as 70% of basic salary with effect from 1 November 1999 and 1 November 2002 respectively, rising in equal instalments to 80% of pensionable salary by the time they attain normal retirement age of 60.
During the year, the restriction which had previously been applied to the pensionable salaries of Mr J K Watson and Mr A M Leitch, but not to that of Mr P J Stoker, was removed.
The committee felt, in the circumstances, that continuing to limit pensionable salary to no more than 80% of basic salary was inequitable.
This has resulted in an increase in the accrued pension of Mr Watson and Mr Leitch over the year.
The Scheme, on a non-contributory basis, provides for two thirds of final pensionable salary at normal retirement age.
Death in service benefits provide for a lump sum of four times pensionable salary together with a spouse's pension of two thirds of the executive directors pension.
These arrangements may be affected by the changes to the tax treatment of the current UK pension regime as contained in the Finance Act 2004.
The Committee is currently reviewing possible appropriate action to take account of these changes and will report, if appropriate, on the outcome next year.
Further details in relation to executive directors pensions can be found under Directors pension information on page 43.
Fees payable to non-executive directors Other than the Chairman whose remuneration is determined by the other non-executive directors, remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors Remuneration which comprises all of the executive directors.
Other than the Chairman, who has continued to receive benefits as noted above, the non-executive directors fees are payable in cash, they are not entitled to any benefits or pension, they do not participate in any bonus or long-term incentive plan and they are not entitled to compensation on termination of their agreements other than normal notice provisions of three months notice given by either party.
Fee levels reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of the role and are reviewed annually, taking into account the level of fees for similar positions in comparable companies.
Directors interests The directors' interests include family interests and holdings in which directors are interested only as trustees.
The numbers of ordinary shares recorded in the Register of Directors' Interests are as follows: Fully paid ordinary shares 31 July 2005 1 August 2004 Beneficial interests H C Dawe 100,352 86,852 J K Watson 276,753 204,351 P J Stoker 475,000 431,000 A M Leitch 53,700 33,388 L P Finn 29,747 29,747 D G Perry 5,000 5,000 P M Johnson 2,000 2,000 BELLWAY p. l. c.
