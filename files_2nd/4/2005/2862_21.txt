10697 Capita 2005 mid 14 3 06 09:53 Page 47 47 Capita Directors remuneration report As required by Section 234B of the Companies Act 1985, the Directors present the Report on Directors Remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2005.
In accordance with the requirements the report provides the disclosure in 2 parts: information that is not subject to audit and information that is subject to audit.
Information that is not subject to audit The Capita Group Remuneration Committee the Committee is a sub-committee of the Group Board with terms of reference agreed with the Group Board.
The purpose is to determine the terms of employment and the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on Capitas website and on request.
The Committee was made up during the year of the following independent Non-Executive Directors: Peter Cawdron, Eric Walters and Robert Alcock until his resignation on 24 February 2005.
Peter Cawdron was replaced as Chairman by Eric Walters during the year.
Martina King was appointed a member of the Committee with effect from 1 January 2005.
The Committee met twice during the year and all members attended each meeting.
The Committee consults the Executive Chairman about proposals for remuneration of the Executive Directors and other senior executives, except when issues relating to his own remuneration are discussed.
In 2004, KPMG LLP UK KPMG was appointed as advisers by the Committee to provide independent advice on executive remuneration and the structure of share schemes, and they acted in this capacity throughout 2005.
KPMG has provided tax advisory services to subsidiaries of the company during the year under review.
No other person or entity has provided material assistance to the Committee during the year.
The company has complied with the provisions set out in Section B of the Combined Code as relating to Directors remuneration annexed to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Directors remuneration a Overall policy The Committees overall policy is to provide a remuneration structure with a strong performance-related element which it feels is justied by the nature of the Groups activities, its growth and profit record and its developing characteristics.
The overall package is weighted towards share based incentives which the Committee strongly believes links the interests of the Executive Directors with those of shareholders in respect of shareholder value.
The Committee is satisfied that the remuneration policy is appropriate, particularly with regard to total executive remuneration and Group performance.
The Committee plans to continue to pursue this approach in its future remuneration policy.
Consistent with this principle approximately half of an executives target total remuneration is performance-linked and weighted to the long term.
This percentage would increase in the case of a performance above target.
The remuneration package for the Executive Directors consists of salary, annual bonus, long term incentives, pension and other benets.
The chart below compares the value of an investment of 100 in the companys shares with an investment of the same amount in the FTSE All Share Index and the FTSE 350 Support Services Index over the five years starting 1 January 2001 and ending 31 December 2005 assuming that all dividend income is re-invested.
The Committee is of the opinion that this comparison provides a clear picture of the performance of the Group relative to both a wide range of companies in the United Kingdom and also a specic group of companies within the same sector.
Comparison of total shareholder returns Capita vs FTSE All Share Index and FTSE 350 Support Services Index Value of investment of 100 on 1 January 2001 140 Capita Group FTSE All Share Index 120 FTSE 350 Support Services Index 100 80 60 40 20 0 01.01.2001 01.01.2002 01.01.2003 01.01.2004 01.01.2005 01.01.2006 Value of 100 invested on 1 January 2001 10697 Capita 2005 mid 14 3 06 09:53 Page 48 48 Capita Directors remuneration report A 100 investment in Capita shares on 1 January 2001 would be worth 88.28 at 31 December 2005 compared to 111.58 for an investment in the FTSE All Share Index and 73.83 for an investment in the FTSE 350 Support Services Index.
b Basic salary and benefits The Committee regularly commissions independent reviews of the salaries and benets of the Executive Directors.
The policy adopted by the Committee requires that salaries and benets be below those provided to comparable roles to enable the provision of a higher performance-related element.
This low basic salary policy allows the Directors to provide a lead in terms of keeping xed remuneration costs low across the Group as a whole and is reective of the Groups remuneration policy in general.
The continued success of the Group has enabled it to provide the benets of a highly geared reward structure which delivers a competitive total remuneration package.
c Annual Bonus Scheme The value of the annual bonus is determined at the start of each financial year and payments triggered at a predetermined Group profit before tax target.
The Committee takes the view that this performance condition is relevant, challenging and designed to drive business enhancement.
For the 2004 financial year, the maximum annual bonus potential for Executive Directors was 100% of basic salary.
In 2004 the Group exceeded its target profit before tax which resulted in annual bonuses being paid out in 2005 at 55% of base salary.
In conjunction with the introduction of the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan details are shown below, the Committee increased the maximum annual bonus potential for the 2005 financial year to 140% of salary.
Half of the annual bonus entitlement will be paid in cash and the remainder will be compulsorily deferred on a gross-basis into Capita shares Deferred Shares.
This reects the Committees policy of providing a significant proportion of performancerelated remuneration whilst maintaining low basic salaries.
d Deferred Annual Bonus Plan The Deferred Annual Bonus Plan DAB was approved and adopted at the AGM on 28 April 2005.
The DAB will comprise Deferred Shares, which are linked to the Annual Bonus Scheme, and Matching Shares.
The Committee believes that this plan will focus participants on delivering strong year-on-year annual performance, which will in turn drive long term shareholder value creation.
Executive Directors and Divisional Executive Directors as named on pages 40 and 41 will be eligible to participate in the DAB.
The first awards under the DAB will be made in 2006, in respect of the 2005 financial year.
No further awards will be made to participants under any other long term incentive plan.
The Deferred Annual Bonus Plan will operate as follows: The value of Deferred Shares will be determined by the entitlement under the Annual Bonus Scheme: half of the bonus entitlement will be paid in cash and the remainder will be compulsorily deferred on a gross-basis into Deferred Shares.
The Deferred Shares will be held for a period of 3 years from the date of award during which they will not be forfeitable, except in the case of dismissal for gross misconduct.
A conditional award of Matching Shares will be made at the same time as the award of Deferred Shares.
Participants will be eligible to receive up to 1.5 Matching Shares for every Deferred Share.
Matching Shares will vest after the 3 year holding period to the extent to which performance has been met.
The Committee has decided that the performance condition that will apply to the Matching Shares is earnings per share EPS growth against the UK Retail Price Index RPI.
33.3% of the Matching Shares will vest if growth in the companys EPS is equal to RPI growth plus 6% per annum, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting if growth in the companys EPS is equal to or greater than growth in the RPI plus 16% per annum.
The Committee believes that long term EPS growth is the most appropriate performance condition for Capita as it is a key indicator of shareholder value creation.
The performance condition attached to the awards made under the bonus scheme may be amended by the Committee from time to time, subject to the new performance condition being no less demanding than the original condition.
10697 Capita 2005 mid 14 3 06 09:53 Page 49 49 Capita Directors remuneration report e Long Term Indexed Share Appreciation Scheme LTISAS The scheme was only open to the Executive Directors and the Divisional Executive Directors.
Under the LTISAS, participants were provided with 2 equal tranches of 600,000 options.
The criteria are the same for each of these issues and therefore both tranches have performance periods that end on 31 December 2006.
The exercise price of the options increases in line with the FTSE All Share Index from the date of grant to 25 November 2007.
This feature ensures that participants only gain if the share price out-performs such index.
The final option price at which the awards can be exercised cannot be below the market value of the share at the date of grant.
The options will only be exercisable subject to the growth in the companys EPS over the performance period.
Options will become exercisable if, over the performance period, the growth in the companys EPS exceeds certain targets as follows: 25% of the options shall vest if growth in the companys EPS exceeds RPI growth by 8% per annum, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting if growth in the companys EPS exceeds growth in the RPI by 12% per annum.
The last award under the LTISAS was made in November 2004 and no further awards will be made under this plan.
f Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Awards under the LTIP were structured either as Restricted Share Awards or Indexed Performance Share Appreciation Rights.
Restricted share awards Restricted Share Awards were designed to deliver shares to participants 3 years after the date of award.
They would have been released if the company was ranked at or above the median in a comparator group selected from the support services sector.
5% of the awards would have been released at the 49th percentile, 50 percent at the 40th percentile and 100 percent at the 25th percentile or above.
If the companys TSR had been below the median at the end of the performance period, the Restricted Share Awards would have lapsed.
In addition, no shares would have been released if the growth in the companys EPS had not exceeded the growth in RPI over the 3 year performance period.
Indexed performance share appreciation rights IPSARs Only one award of IPSARs was made to participants under the LTIP and participation was limited to the Executive Directors.
Such appreciation rights were designed like share options except that the exercise price to be paid by the participants increased pro rata to the FTSE All Share Index.
IPSARs became exercisable five years after the awards were granted, subject to the companys TSR ranking relative to the comparator group of companies.
If the companys TSR had been at the upper quartile level, 40 percent of the IPSARs would have vested.
For 100 percent of the awards to have vested the companys TSR had to be at the 10th percentile or better within the comparator group.
If the companys TSR ranking had been below the upper quartile, the IPSARs would have lapsed.
In addition no IPSARs would have been exercisable if growth in the companys EPS had not exceeded the growth in RPI over the five year performance period.
Restricted Share Awards and awards of IPSARs vested in full in May 2001 and May 2003 respectively.
No further awards have been made under the LTIP.
g Share option schemes The Group has 2 share option schemes.
The 1997 Executive Share Option Scheme is a discretionary scheme for senior managers, in which the Executive Directors and Divisional Executive Directors no longer participate and the Capita Sharesave Scheme which is open to all Capitas employees.
Options granted under the 1997 Scheme currently become exercisable if the growth in the companys EPS exceeds growth in RPI by 8% over the 3 year period from the date of grant.
Subject to shareholder approval at the 2006 AGM, the 1997 Scheme, due to expire early in 2007, will be renewed for a period of 10 years until 25 April 2016.
Full details of the proposal, including some amendments to the Scheme rules, are given in the explanatory notes in the Notice of AGM.
h Non-Executive Directors Non-Executive Directors fees are reviewed annually and determined by the Executive Directors.

10697 Capita 2005 mid 14 3 06 09:53 Page 51 51 Capita Directors remuneration report b Share option schemes Options were granted under the 1997 Scheme and consist of Inland Revenue Approved and Unapproved share options.
Options become exercisable if the growth in the companys EPS exceeds the growth in the RPI by 8% over the 3 year period from the date of grant.
Since May 2002, the Directors became ineligible for further awards under this scheme.
The market value of one of the companys shares at 31 December 2005 was 416.75p, and the high and low values for the year were 421.00p and 345.25p respectively.
The options are exercisable in the period given above after having completed a 3 or 5 year savings period.
There are no performance criteria to be satisfied under this scheme.
The exercise price of the options increases in line with the FTSE All Share Index, measured from the date of grant to 25 November 2007.
Options will become exercisable, if over the performance period, the growth in the companys EPS exceeds certain targets as follows: 25% of the options shall vest if growth in the companys EPS exceeds RPI growth by 8% per annum, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting if growth in the companys EPS exceeds growth in the RPI by 12% per annum.
At 31 December 2005 the market price of a Capita share was 416.75p and the FTSE All Share Index stood at 2847 25 November 2002 1980 and 25 November 2004 2367. d Shares awarded under the Long Term Investment Plan Restricted Share Awards Restricted Share Awards were designed to deliver shares to participants 3 years after the date of award subject to the companys TSR ranking relative to a comparator group of companies and the growth in the companys EPS exceeding the growth in RPI over the 3 year performance period, as discussed on page 49.
The performance requirements were met in full on 4 May 2001.
Rod Aldridge has not exercised his right of transfer in respect of these shares and therefore has an entitlement to 279,069 shares.
Had he exercised his right to transfer on the 5 May 2001 when the shares vested, the share price would have been 509p and the gain would have been 1,420,461.
