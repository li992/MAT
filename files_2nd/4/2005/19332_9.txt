Pillar Property PLC Annual report and accounts 2005 Directors remuneration report 22 The company complies with the requirements of the Combined Code in relation to directors remuneration.
In preparing this report, the Remuneration Committee has complied with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
The regulations require the auditors to report to the companys members on various sections of the remuneration report and to state whether, in their opinion, those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
Introduction The remuneration policy is established by the board and is set out below.
The Remuneration Committee within the framework of this policy determines individual remuneration packages in respect of all executive directors having appropriate regard to the incentivation and remuneration levels of other employees of the company.
The board as a whole considers the remuneration of the non-executive directors in consultation with the Chairman and Chief Executive.
No director participates in setting his own remuneration.
Remuneration Committee Directors who were members of the remuneration committee during the year and are all non-executive directors, are: Sir Derek Hornby Chairman R A Hambro A J M Huntley J M Mara M C Stoddart J M Mara, is senior vice president of General Electric Investment Company of the United States, Pillars largest shareholder.
The board considers Mr Mara to be independent with regard to his role on the Remuneration Committee where he has acted in a fully independent manner throughout the year.
Otherwise, the members of the Remuneration Committee are fully independent non-executive directors.
The Remuneration Committee has access to independent advice where it considers it to be appropriate.
During the year advice was received from New Bridge Street Consultants, appointed by the Remuneration Committee and used solely by the Remuneration Committee.
Remuneration policy for the forthcoming year In setting remuneration policy, consideration is given to the importance of attracting, retaining and motivating executives of appropriately high calibre and experience.
The remuneration policy has been designed to address the interests of both executive directors and shareholders by including performance related elements to motivate the highest performance and currently comprises five main elements: basic salary and benets, pension, annual bonus, the Capital Reward Incentive Share Plan CRISP and management incentive plan.
Basic salary and benets Basic annual salaries of executive directors and employees are reviewed annually in line with the cost of living only.
The basic pay does not therefore ratchet up with the ever increasing median level of salary in the marketplace.
As a result a significant proportion of directors remuneration is variable and driven by performance rather than xed.
Taxable benets consist only of medical insurance.
Pension arrangements The company contributes 15% subject to statutory cap where appropriate to individual pension schemes on behalf of executive directors and employees on a xed percentage money purchase contribution basis.
The company contribution is calculated on base salary and no other part of remuneration is pensionable.
The companys pension liability is, therefore, limited to its annual contribution and there is no pension fund deficit to fund in future years.
Bonus scheme Annual discretionary bonuses are awarded to executive directors and employees on the basis of individual contribution and the groups comparative performance within the property sector.
When determining the level of bonus the Committee considers the performance of the group relative to the All Property Annual Capital Value Index the index published by the Investment Property Databank IPD and the benets to the group earned through third party income receivable by the group from management and performance fees.
All bonus payments are discretionary and do not form part of the executives contracts of employment, pension entitlement or entitlement to compensation in the case of dismissal.
Pillar Property PLC Annual report and accounts 2005 23 CRISP CRISP increases the focus of remuneration on net asset value NAV per share growth.
The scheme was approved by shareholders at the EGM of 25 October 1999.
The amount that can be allocated to any one individual is capped at 35% of the pool.
The highest award ever made to one individual was 23.75%.
Awards under the scheme are capped at 1.25% of NAV in any single year, with further three and five year caps.
Payments are only made into CRISP if the companys NAV per share outperforms the IPD All Property Index by 25% or more, then a maximum of 15% of such out performance can be paid into the scheme.
80% of this payment is used to acquire Pillar shares that vest equally over the next three-year period.
The remaining 20% is paid in the year of entitlement.
Participation in the scheme is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and it is intended that only executive directors and key employees will be invited to participate.
A participant who leaves voluntarily or is dismissed will forego any part of the 80% share not released through the three year lock-up.
In the last year in accordance with planned senior management development and acknowledging wishes expressed by the Association of British Insurers, the impact of CRISP has been widened across the senior management team.
Previously 60% of the benefit of CRISP accrued to the executive directors excluding those executive directors appointed in 2002.
In January 2004 the Remuneration Committee reduced this level to 42% and widened the participation base.
The highest level of award is 17.25% for any individual, compared to 23.75% in the previous year.
One additional person has been added to the participation share, increasing the number of participants from eight to nine.
Management Incentive Plan MIP In 2002 shareholders separately approved the introduction of the Management Incentive Plan to grant options at the prevailing market price as part of the proposals to return capital to shareholders.
These options have a maximum of a six year term and are only exercisable if all three performance targets are met up to five years following grant.
No more than 2 million shares may be optioned to any one individual out of a maximum of 8 million shares available under the plan.
The companys National Insurance liability on any option gains has been passed to employees to pay.
The performance targets are: Total Shareholder Return p. a. TSR Earnings per share outperformance of RPI p. a.
% of options that become exercisable 10.0% 10.0% 5% 12.5% 10.0% 15% 15.0% 10.0% 25% 17.5% 10.0% 50% 20.0% 10.0% 90% 25.0% 10.0% 100% In addition, for any vesting of options to occur the TSR must be at least equal to the median TSR of FTSE Actuaries Real Estate companies.
For more than 50% of options to vest, the TSR must be at least equal to the upper quartile TSR of FTSE Actuaries Real Estate companies.
Pro rata vesting for performance between the above absolute TSR percentage hurdles in column one will take place.
Options are exercisable in three equal tranches after the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant.
These performance conditions were selected by the Remuneration Committee, as they are considered to be collectively the drivers of value for shareholders in the company and were approved by shareholders at the July 2002 EGM.
Pillar Property PLC Annual report and accounts 2005 Directors remuneration report continued 24 Service contracts The company has service contracts with its executive directors.
It is company policy that such contracts contain a 364 day notice period that can be given either to or by the director.
Compensation for loss of ofce is, therefore, limited to a maximum of 364 days of basic pay benets and linked pension, with no allowance for previous bonus or future potential entitlements under CRISP.
There is no enhancement for a change of control of the company or in any other circumstances and it is the Remuneration Committees policy to recommend to the board that compensation is paid in instalments and not to introduce liquidated damages provisions.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts but provide services pursuant to letters of appointment.
In all cases, these letters of appointment will terminate if the director resigns and will terminate forthwith without any entitlement to compensation if the director is removed as director by a resolution passed at a general meeting or if the director ceases to be a director by reason of vacating ofce pursuant to any provisions of the companys Articles.
In addition the letter relating to J M Maras appointment can be terminated on one months notice given by General Electric Investment Company or the company.

As required by recent legislation regarding the directors remuneration report, graph A illustrates the performance of the company measured by total shareholder return share price growth plus dividends paid against a broad equity market index over the period since the August 2002 return of capital.
As the company is a constituent of the FTSE All Share Real Estate sector this index is considered to be the most appropriate benchmark for the purposes of the graph.
Given the short time that has elapsed since the return of capital, the Remuneration Committee felt that it would be helpful to provide an additional graph B illustrating performance compared with the FTSE All Share Real Estate sector over the previous five years of the company and its predecessor.
A graph C of the companys NAV per share and the IPD All Property annual index is also illustrated to show how the underlying assets of the company have performed.
