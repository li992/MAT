ii All interests at the dates shown are beneficial and are in respect of 50p ordinary shares of Balfour Beatty plc.
There were no changes between 31 December 2005 and 7 March 2006. iii Peter Zinkin was also interested at 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2005 in 325 cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares of 1p each of Balfour Beatty plc.
ii For the awards made in April 2004 and April 2005, the performance periods are the three years ending 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2007 respectively.
The maximum award of shares shown in the table above will vest only if earnings per share before exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and appropriations arising on the buy-back of preference shares EPS grows by at least 70% over the performance period.
If EPS growth is 25%, the Directors will be entitled to 30% of the maximum award of shares.
If EPS growth is between 25% and 70%, the number of shares vesting will be pro rata to actual growth.
No shares will vest if EPS growth is less than 25%, and there is no provision for re-testing.
iii For the awards made in April 2003, the performance period was the three years ended 31 December 2005.
The maximum award of shares shown in the table above would only vest if EPS grew by at least 100% over the performance period.
If EPS growth was 30%, the Directors would have been entitled to 30% of the maximum award of shares.
If EPS growth was between 30% and 100%, the number of shares vesting would have been pro rata to actual growth.
No shares would vest if EPS growth was less than 30%, and there is no provision for re-testing.
iv The performance period for the awards made in April 2003 was completed on 31 December 2005.
The growth in EPS for this period was 49.07% and as a result, 49.07% of each participants conditional award will vest on 16 April 2006. v The performance period for the awards made in April 2002 was completed on 31 December 2004.
The growth in EPS for this period was 65.96% and as a result, 65.96% of each participants conditional award vested on 17 April 2005.
The closing middle market price of ordinary shares on the vesting date was 297.0p.
vi The awards made to Alistair Wivell in 2004 and 2005 lapsed on his retirement from the Company on 31 December 2005.
However, since he had been employed by the Company for the entirety of the performance period for the 2003 award, the RemCo decided it was appropriate to exercise its discretion in his favour and allow him to retain this award on his retirement from the Company, exercisable at the same time and in the same proportion as the awards of other participants.
vii The average middle market price of ordinary shares in the Company for the three dealing dates before the date of the 2002 award under the PSP, which was used for calculating the number of awards granted, was 237.583p, for the 2003 award was 172.66p, for the 2004 award was 260.417p and for the 2005 award was 305.417p.
The closing middle market price of ordinary shares on the date of the awards was 251p, 170.5p, 260p and 290p respectively.
ii All outstanding executive share options held by Directors have satisfied performance conditions that were required to be met before exercise and are, therefore, exercisable at the discretion of the option holder.
iii The closing market price of the Companys ordinary shares on 31 December 2005 was 356p.
During the year the highest and lowest closing market prices were 362p and 290p.
iv Executive share options granted to Jim Cohen and Alistair Wivell in April 1995, exercisable at 311.9p, lapsed unexercised in April 2005. v Details of options exercised and the value realisable on exercise are shown in the table below.

Balfour Beatty plc Annual report and accounts 2005 49 Remuneration report continued Directors pensions Executive Directors participate in the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund.
The scheme provides for a pension at a normal retirement age of 62 and each Director pays an annual contribution equal to 5% of pensionable salary.
The pension for a Director who can complete 20 or more years pensionable service at normal retirement age is targeted at two-thirds of final pensionable salary, subject to Inland Revenue limits.
Directors have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions, but neither the contributions nor the resulting benets are included in the tables below.
The salaries of Jim Cohen, Anthony Rabin and Ian Tyler were subject to the Inland Revenue earnings cap for pension purposes and details of the Companys contributions to additional arrangements for them are noted underneath the second table below.
The table below sets out the accrued deferred pension which would be paid annually from the scheme at normal retirement age based on each executive Directors service to 31 December 2005 as well as the additional pension benefit secured in respect of service during the year.

ii Jim Cohen attained normal retirement age under the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund in February 2004 but has continued in service.
As at 31 December 2005 his pension had not commenced payment and it therefore continues to be determined in line with the rules of the fund for members past normal retirement age.
iii During the year, Anthony Rabin transferred benets into the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund from previous pension arrangements.
A total amount of 331,324 was received in exchange for which he was awarded additional pensionable service of 9 years 81 days.
A significant amount of the increase in deferred pension over the year is therefore due to this additional pensionable service.
The transfer value quoted in the final column is the increase in accrued deferred pension in excess of ination, less Anthony Rabins contributions over the year, less the transfer values actually received by the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund.
The table below sets out the transfer value at 31 December 2005 of each executive Directors accrued deferred pension at that date as well as the movement in that transfer value over the period.
The transfer values represent the cash equivalent values that would have been payable from the scheme had the Directors left service on the dates shown, and reect the age of the Director, his period of membership of the scheme and his pensionable salary.

ii The gure is the difference between the transfer value of the accrued benets at the start and end of the period, less the Directors contributions during the period.
In the above table, contributions made by the Director during the year includes the amount of the transfer values received by the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund.
iv Alistair Wivell retired on 31 December 2005 and took immediate pension benets.
The transfer value at 31 December 2005 is the actuarial value of these benets.
The salaries of Jim Cohen, Anthony Rabin and Ian Tyler were subject to the Inland Revenue earnings cap for pension purposes, and the Company has contributed to a Funded Unapproved Retirement benefit Scheme FURBS for each of them.
In 2005, the Companys contribution to Jim Cohens plan was 34,004, to Anthony Rabins 54,418 and to Ian Tylers 51,133.
Benets under these FURBS are additional to those set out in the tables above.
No past Director of the Company has received or become entitled to receive retirement benets in excess of his entitlements on the date on which those benets first became payable, or 31 March 1997 if later.
