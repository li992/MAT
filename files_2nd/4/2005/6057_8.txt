DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations.
It also meets the requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the main supporting principles of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance published by the Financial Reporting Council in July 2003 the Code relating to Directors remuneration.
The Company complies with all of the provisions of the Code.
A resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the Companys Annual General Meeting to be held on 14 July 2005.
The Regulations require the Companys auditors to report to the Companys shareholders on the auditable part of the Directors remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
This report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee is chaired by Jim Forbes.
The other current members of the Committee are David Dunn and John Sievwright.
The Board considers each of the members of the Committee to be independent in accordance with the Code.
None of the members of the Committee has any personal financial interest other than as a shareholder in the matters to be decided, conict of interest arising from cross-directorships or any involvement in the day-to-day running of the business.
The remit of the Remuneration Committee was adopted in March 2004 in the light of the recent revisions to the Code and its terms of reference are available on request and are also published on the Companys website.
These terms of reference will be kept under review to take into account any changes to the Code and corporate governance practice.
The principal purpose of the Committee is to consider matters related to the remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior management below Board level.
The Committee met four times during the year and all members attended each meeting, with the exception of John Sievwright, who attended three meetings.
In determining the Executive Directors remuneration for the year, the Committee considered publicly available information, including the remuneration packages of those holding equivalent posts at the Companys peers within the transport industry and the FTSE350 in general.
The Committee appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP Executive Compensation Consulting to provide advice on remuneration matters to the Committee including a benchmarking exercise in relation to the Group and its peers and advice on the structure of longer-term incentive schemes.
Deloitte & Touche LLP also acts as the Groups external auditor.
As such, the appointment as remuneration advisors is also subject to pre-approval by the Audit Committee.
Information on other services provided by Deloitte & Touche LLP is given in Note 7 to the financial statements.
All services provided by Deloitte & Touche LLP are carried out in accordance with the requirements of the UK Audit Practices Board Ethical Standard 5, relating to non-audit services performed by a companys auditors.
The Committee also consults with the Chief Executive although no Director participates in discussions concerning his own remuneration.
Remuneration policy Aim The aim of the Committee is to design remuneration packages for the Companys Executives which attract, retain and motivate the highcalibre individuals necessary to maintain the Groups position as a leader in the public transportation industry.
In implementing its policy, the Committee has given full consideration to the Principles of Good Governance of the Code with regard to Directors remuneration.
Structure of remuneration packages There are currently four main elements to the executive remuneration package: basic salary and benets in kind annual cash and deferred share bonus both paid under the Executive Annual Bonus Plan share options pension provision The Committee considers the remuneration package as a whole, balancing each of the individual elements to ensure that overall, the remuneration received by each Executive Director is competitive but not excessive, contains an appropriate balance between xed and variable performance-related remuneration and that each Executive Director has sufficient long-term incentive to ensure that his interests are aligned with those of shareholders.
A high proportion of each Directors potential remuneration is performance-related.
During the year, the Committee, with the assistance of Deloitte & Touche LLP, undertook a comprehensive review of the total remuneration packages of the Executive team to ensure that they remain competitive.
As a result of this review, and following consultation with the Companys major institutional shareholders, the Committee has determined to increase the maximum level of bonus payable under the Executive Annual Bonus Plan for the year commencing 1 April 2005 from 80% to 110% of basic salary for the Chief Executive and from 80% to 100% of basic salary for the other Executive Directors.
Up to half of the award will be payable in shares with the deferral period for such shares increased from three to five years.
These changes will also apply to senior management within the Group.
To take account of shareholder feedback during the consultation exercise, the Committee is currently considering the best means of providing a longer-term incentive to the Executive team in the future.
23 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED The remuneration of the Executive Directors is made up of the following components: Basic salary and benets in kind The basic salary and benets in kind for each Executive Director are determined by the Committee for each financial year and when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In determining appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a whole and also the packages received by similar individuals at the Companys peers in the public transport sector and the FTSE 350.
Details of the salaries and benets in kind received by each of the Executive Directors in the year are shown on page 26.
Executive annual bonus plan The Group operates a discretionary performance-related bonus plan for its senior management under which payment of bonuses is linked to achievement of budgeted annual Group operating profit targets and personal objectives including safety targets.
Where an Executive Director is also directly responsible for one or more operating division s, payment of a proportion of the bonus is also linked to the profitability of those divisions.
The Committee considers and agrees the Group and divisional objectives for all Executive Directors and the personal objectives for the Chief Executive.
The Chief Executive, in consultation with the Committee, agrees the personal objectives for the other Executive Directors.
Bonus payments comprise a mixture of cash and deferred share awards.
Share awards for the years to 31 March 2005 were deferred for three years and will lapse if the relevant individual leaves the Group during the deferral period for any reason other than redundancy, retirement or illhealth.
The Committee considers it is appropriate for a proportion of the annual bonus to be taken in the form of deferred shares as this acts as a retention mechanism and also aligns that Executives longer-term interests with those of the Companys shareholders.
As the award of any bonus is already dependent on the achievement of stringent targets, the Committee considers that it is not appropriate to attach further performance conditions on vesting of the deferred share element of any bonus other than that the relevant Executive remains employed by the Group and has not tendered his resignation at the end of the deferral period.
Each year, the Board sets challenging budget targets for the Group as a whole and for each business unit within the Group.
The Committees policy continues to be that bonuses will be payable for Group performance against budget of between 90% and 110% although the level of bonus payable is heavily skewed towards performance in excess of 100% of budget.
As mentioned above, a separate portion of the bonus is dependent upon achievement of safety objectives up to 25% and a further portion is dependent on achievement of personal objectives up to 25%.
The maximum level of bonus payable to an Executive Director in the year to 31 March 2005 was 80% of basic salary, although actual awards for the year under review ranged from 58% to 75%.
If the maximum bonus were payable, the Chief Executive would receive half of his bonus in cash and the remaining half in the form of deferred shares.
For the other Executive Directors, the proportions would be 25% and 55%, respectively.
Going forward, as a result of the review carried out by Deloitte & Touche LLP, and following consultation with its major institutional shareholders, the Committee has determined that the maximum level of bonus payable under the plan for the year commencing 1 April 2005 will be 110% of basic salary for the Chief Executive and 100% of basic salary for the other Executive Directors.
Bonuses will continue to be based on a combination of Group and divisional financial performance up to 70% and safety and personal objectives up to 30%.
This is considered to be appropriate given the increase in the maximum award potential.
For all Executive Directors, up to 50% of the award will be payable in shares.
The deferral period for these shares will be increased from three to five years in order to provide long-term lock-in and to further align the Directors interests with those of shareholders.
The Company consulted its major institutional shareholders on these proposed changes.
The bonus arrangements will be kept under review by the Committee for future years to ensure that they remain appropriate.
Share Option Schemes Executive Share Option Scheme The Company operates an Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS for Executive Directors and other senior management.
Under this scheme, during the year, options to acquire shares in the Company were granted to Executive Directors and senior management.
The exercise price for such options was based on the average of the middle market quotations for shares in the Company for the three dealing days prior to the date of grant.
The Committee has discretion under this scheme to make awards of up to 200% of basic salary but awards were made during the year at 1.33x basic salary for the Chief Executive and 1x salary for the other Executive Directors.
The performance target applicable to the awards made in the three years to 31 March 2004 is that growth in the Companys annualised earnings per share EPS over the three-year performance period must exceed the increase in the retail prices index RPI over the same period by an average of at least 3% per annum.
The performance period can be extended for one year if this performance target has not been met over the initial three years but the EPS increase must still exceed the increase in RPI over the four-year period by an average of at least 3% per annum.
For the options awarded in respect of the year under review, this was reduced to an average of at least 2% per annum for the three-year performance period but an additional measure was introduced.
For the maximum award to vest, the Companys total shareholder return TSR over the performance period must place the Company in the top 25% of companies in a group of the Companys listed transport peers.
A proportion of the options between 0 and 100% determined on a sliding scale will vest if the Companys performance against that peer group is between the 25th and 50th percentile.
No options will vest if the Companys performance is below the 50th percentile.
Unlike the awards made in previous years, the performance period may not be extended if the targets have not been met at the end of the three-year performance period.
24 The companies in the original TSR comparator group for the options awarded in this year are Associated British Ports Holdings PLC, Arriva plc, BAA plc, The Go-Ahead Group plc, The Mersey Docks & Harbour Company, TBI plc, National Express Group plc, Exel plc, Tibbett & Britten now part of Exel plc, Avis Europe plc, Stagecoach Group plc, British Airways plc, Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Company and EasyJet plc.
If the performance targets are met, an option may be exercised without any further condition at any time during the rest of its ten-year life.
If the holder leaves the Group before the end of the performance period by reason of ill-health, injury, disability, redundancy or retirement, an option may be exercised within 12 months if the performance target has been satisfied at the date of leaving.
Early exercise of options may also be permitted within specic periods if there is a change of control of the Company as a result of a takeover, reconstruction, amalgamation or voluntary winding-up of the Company but only to the extent that the relevant performance targets have then been met on a pro rata basis.
Where the performance period includes the transition to the new International Accounting Standards, the denition of annualised EPS is under review.
The Committee, advised by the Audit Committee and the external auditors, will agree decisions regarding the management of the transition and will make any necessary adjustments to ensure that comparisons continue to be made on a fair, consistent and reasonable basis.
Taking into account institutional shareholder feedback in the consultation exercise described above, the Committee is currently considering the suitability of share option awards as a means of providing a longer-term incentive to the Executive team going forwards.
Save As You Earn SAYE Scheme The Company operates a SAYE Scheme for eligible employees under which options may be granted on an annual basis at a discount of up to 20% of market value.
The Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the SAYE Scheme.
Buy As You Earn BAYE Scheme The Company operates a Share Incentive Plan under the title Buy As You Earn.
The scheme, which is open to all UK employees of the Group including the Executive Directors, enables employees to purchase partnership shares from their gross income before income tax and National Insurance deductions.
The Company provides two matching shares for every three partnership shares, subject to a maximum Company contribution of shares to the value of 20 a month.
The shares are held in trust for up to five years, in which case, no income tax or National Insurance will be payable.
The matching shares will be forfeited if the corresponding partnership shares are removed from trust within three years from award.
Retirement benets Executive Directors are members of a number of dened benefit Group pension schemes.
Their dependants are eligible for dependants pensions and the payment of a lump sum in the event of death in service.
Further details are set out on page 27.
Service contracts It is the Companys policy to restrict notice periods for Executive Directors to a maximum of 12 months.
In line with this policy, all of the Executive Directors have service contracts with an undefined term but which provide for a notice period of 12 months.
The contracts contain a provision, exercisable at the discretion of the Company, to pay an amount in lieu of notice on early termination of the contract.
Such payments are limited to basic salary plus certain benets but would not include entitlement to bonus or share options.
There are no contractual provisions governing payment of compensation on early termination of the contracts.
If it becomes necessary to consider early termination of a service contract, the Company will have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including mitigation, when determining any compensation to be paid.
Details of the Executive Directors contracts are set out below: Date of service contract Moir Lockhead 5 March 2001 Dean Finch as of 26 February 2004 David Leeder 3 September 2001 1 Iain Lanaghan 29 November 2002 2 Mike Mitchell 2 July 1997 1 Retired as a Director on 31 May 2004.

Where Board approval is given for an Executive Director to accept an outside non-executive directorship, unless the appointment is in connection with Group business, the individual Director is entitled to retain any fees received.
Non-Executive Directors All Non-Executive Directors have a letter of appointment and their fees are determined by the Board based on surveys of fees paid to NonExecutive Directors of comparable companies.
These letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Companys registered ofce during normal business hours and will be made available at the Annual General Meeting.
Non-Executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Companys share option schemes and, other than the Group Employee Director, are not eligible to join a Company pension scheme.
Each of the Non-Executive Directors, other than the Group Employee Director, has elected to receive 40% of his fees in the form of shares in the Company in order to ensure that their interests are more closely aligned to those of the Companys shareholders.
The shares are purchased on a monthly basis in the market.
The appointment of each of the Non-Executive Directors is subject to early termination without compensation if he is not re-appointed at a meeting of shareholders where he is up for re-election.
