Goodwill 2005 2004 As disclosed in note 7, agreement has been reached towards the end of 2005 with Shell UK Limited with regard to the m m disposal of the majority of the Groups metal treatments business.
As a result, the property, plant and equipment of this Cost and carrying amount business has been reclassified as held for sale and the recoverable amount of the assets on the basis of fair value less costs At 1 January and 31 December 6.5 6.5 to sell has been assessed.
Based on this assessment the carrying value has remained unchanged.
The goodwill arose on the Groups acquisition of the trading assets of Westbrook Lanolin in 1998 and has been allocated in full to the Groups UK manufacturing operation and to the Consumer Care segment.
The goodwill is tested at each year end for impairment with reference to the above cash-generating units recoverable amount compared to the units carrying value including goodwill.
The recoverable amount is based on value in use calculations using discounted cash flow projections based on the Groups strategic plan for the first three years and a growth rate thereafter consistent with that shown by the three year plan.
The cash flows have been discounted using the Groups weighted average cost of capital, which for these purposes has been assumed to be approximately 8% after tax.
The key assumptions underpinning the strategic plan employed in the value in use calculation are that market share will not significantly change and that gross and operating margins will remain constant.
