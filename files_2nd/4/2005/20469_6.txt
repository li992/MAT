ADMIRAL GROUP plc 33 Remuneration report The following report has been approved by the Remuneration Committee the Committee and the Board for submission to shareholders.
Section 1: Information not subject to audit The Remuneration Committee The Committee is chaired by John Sussens, the Senior Independent Non-executive Director, with the other members being Martin Jackson and Gillian Wilmot.
Gillian Wilmot was appointed to the Board and Committee on 26 April 2005.
The Chairman and Chief Executive are invited to meetings where the Committee considers it appropriate to obtain their advice on the matters under review.
The Admiral Group Board Directors remuneration is determined by the Committee.
The Committee also reviews and recommends any changes proposed to the Groups share schemes, as well as having an overview of shares issued by the Groups Senior Executive Restricted Share Scheme.
During the year the Committee did not purchase any consultancy services.
Policy on Executive Directors remuneration The current Executive Directors are all founding Directors.
They and the Committee continue to hold the view that the significant shareholdings held by them provide a sufficient alignment of their interest in the performance of the Group with the interests of other shareholders.
In light of this, their remuneration packages consist of base salary benchmarked against market rates by the Committee and benefits such as private medical cover, permanent health insurance and death in service cover.
The Group does not contribute to any pension arrangements on behalf of the Executive Directors, and it is not intended that they will participate in any Group share schemes.
Executive Directors remuneration is reviewed annually by the Committee, taking into account salary levels of comparable companies.
Salaries were last reviewed in May 2005, when it was decided to give increases to Executive Directors which averaged 6.3%.
It is the Committees general strategy, with agreement from the Executive Directors, to pay salaries at below median levels, their participation in the success of the Group coming from increases in the value of the shares held by each Executive Director.
Directors service contracts The Company entered into new service contracts with the three Executive Directors just prior to the Companys listing on the London Stock Exchange in September 2004.
The notice from the Company required to terminate the Chief Executives contract was reduced with effect from 23 November 2005 from 18 months to 12 months - no compensation was requested or paid for this change.
