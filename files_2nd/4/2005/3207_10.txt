Childrens pensions are also payable: members contributions payable at the rate of 6% of pensionable earnings: pension payable in the event of retirement due to ill health: pensions in payment and in deferment guaranteed to increase in line with the increase in the RPI a maximum of 6% applies to pension accrued after 6 April 2004 : and no discretionary practices are taken into account in calculating transfer values.
All benefits are subject to HMRC limits and the Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme CUPS provides benefits on the salary in excess of the earnings cap to the level that would otherwise have been paid by the approved scheme.
The benefits that arise under this are treated as being subject to the same rules as apply in respect of the approved portion of members benefits.
No individual will receive benefits from Centrica which, when added to their retained benefits elsewhere, exceed two-thirds of their final pensionable earnings.
CUPS is unfunded but the benefits are secured by a charge over certain Centrica assets.
An appropriate provision in respect of their accrued value has been made in the Companys balance sheet.
Finance Act 2004 As a result of the changes brought about by the Finance Act 2004, Centrica intends to maximise the scope within the new Life Time Allowance LTA of 1.5 million, by delivering some of the benefits currently provided via CUPS through the approved arrangement, the Centrica Management Pension Scheme.
Centrica will not however transfer any CUPS liabilities in excess of this Allowance which would result in a higher tax rate being paid on the benefits.
With effect from 6 April 2006, the contributions made by members of CUPS will not be restricted to the maximum rate of 15% of the earnings cap and from that date their contributions will be based at the rate of 6% of their total pensionable earnings.
