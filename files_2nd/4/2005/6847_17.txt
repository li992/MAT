The Inland Revenue earnings cap restricts the pension that the scheme can provide for Michael Shallow.
The scheme pension is, therefore, supplemented through a funded unapproved pension arrangement, operating on a targeted defined contribution basis.
Following an actuarial review, some deficit funding is now being undertaken.
As a result, the companys contribution to the fund for the period in respect of Michael Shallow is 88,300 2004 - 85,500.
Similar restrictions apply to the pensions for Rooney Anand and David Elliott who participate in funded unapproved arrangements operating on a defined contribution basis.
The company makes a contribution towards the tax liabilities incurred from payments to funded unapproved arrangements and these contributions are disclosed as other cash benefits in the emoluments data shown above.
In respect of Mark Angela, a decision regarding his pension arrangements for future earnings in excess of the Inland Revenue earnings cap has been deferred pending the introduction of new pensions legislation and an amount of 30,438, representing the amount which would have been contributed by the company towards a funded unapproved arrangement and a contribution towards the tax liabilities in respect thereof, together with interest at a rate of 4% per annum, is contained within the balance sheet as a current liability.
Payments from the company made in the financial year in respect of defined contribution pension arrangements are shown in the table below.
