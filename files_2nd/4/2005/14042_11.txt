The TSR level shown at 31 December each year is the average of the closing daily TSR levels for the 30-day period up to and including that date.
As detailed earlier, TSR is defined as the return shareholders would receive if they held a notional number of shares, and received dividends on those shares over a period of time.
It measures the percentage growth in the relevant company's share price together with the value of any dividends paid, assuming that the dividends are reinvested into the company's shares.
Pensions and life assurance This section has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP.
The Directors receive pension and life assurance benefits consistent with those provided by other leading companies.
The details of the defined benefit schemes operated by the Group are set out in note 28.
In the event of death in service, each scheme provides for a lump sum payment as well as a dependants' pension.

The increase in accrued pension during the year is shown both as a gross increase and excluding any increase in respect of inflation.
b Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with version 9.2 of the Guidance Note GN11 issued by the actuarial profession.
The difference between the transfer values at the beginning and end of the year, shown in 4, includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and the Directors, such as stockmarket movements.
It is calculated after deducting Directors' contributions.
d The value of the net increase in accrual represents the incremental value to the Director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption that his service terminated at the year end.
It is based on the increase in the accrued pension net of inflation after deducting the Director's contributions.
e Members have the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions: neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.
f Transfer values disclosed do not represent the sum paid or payable to the individual Director.
Instead, they represent a potential liability of the pension scheme.
g C R Hyman also benefits from a defined contribution arrangement to which the Company contributed prior to April 2005.
The Company contributions to this arrangement were 15 per cent of remuneration in excess of the Permitted Maximum under the approved Scheme.
C R Hyman has received non-pensionable cash payments totalling 98,406 during 2005 in place of Company contributions to the defined contribution arrangement.
In September 2004 he received a non-pensionable cash payment of 95,400 in recognition of the higher contribution due from his time of appointment as Chief Executive.
