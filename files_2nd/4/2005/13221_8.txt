To provide greater clarity and incentive to management EPS will be calculated based upon the cash tax rate up to a maximum of 30%.
The LTIP CIP awards are valued using the Monte Carlo method.
 The Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that the EPS and free cash ow performance targets are a transparent and accurate measure of the Companys performance at this time and are the key corporate metrics for driving long term shareholder value.
In addition, the TSR condition will ensure that executives are encouraged to focus on ensuring that the Companys return to shareholders is competitive compared to comparable companies.
As mentioned above, awards under the CIP in respect of the bonus paid for the year ended 31 December 2005 will be made subsequent to the publication of this report.
However, the maximum number of awards granted will be based on the price of an ordinary share at the time of grant and the monetary value will not exceed 50% of basic salary.
Full details of the levels of award and performance conditions will be disclosed in the Committees Remuneration Report for the year ending 31 December 2006.
