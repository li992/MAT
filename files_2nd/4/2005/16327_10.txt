Remuneration report UNAUDITED INFORMATION Composition and role of the Remuneration Committee the Committee The Company complies with the relevant conditions of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance relating to Directors remuneration as published by the London Stock Exchange and the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
Andrew Walker is the Chairman of the Committee and the other members are Christopher Bailey and Ian Griffiths.
All three members are non-executive Directors.
Julian Blogh and Douglas Caster also normally attend Remuneration Committee meetings, although they are not formally members of the Remuneration Committee.
The task of the Committee is to make recommendations to the Board on the framework of executive remuneration and to determine annually the individual salaries, annual bonuses payable if any and other terms and conditions of employment of the executive Directors and other senior executives.
The Committee also approves the terms of any discretionary share schemes in which executive Directors and senior executives may be invited to participate, and the terms of the Companys Savings Related Share Option Scheme and All-Employee Share Ownership Plan.
The Committee consulted Douglas Caster, Chief Executive, with regard to the remuneration and benefits packages offered to executive Directors and senior executives during the year, except in relation to his own remuneration and benefits package which is determined by the Committee in his absence.
In addition, wholly independent advice on executive remuneration and share schemes was received from New Bridge Street Consultants who were appointed by the Company and who provided no other services to the Company during the year, save for ongoing advice in connection with the operation of the Companys share schemes.
Remuneration policy The policy of the Committee is to reward senior management competitively, enabling the Company to recruit, motivate and retain executives of high calibre, whilst avoiding paying excessive remuneration.
Further details of the remuneration policy followed by the Committee are set out below.
The remuneration practices adopted by a group of like companies that, in the opinion of the Committee, face similar remuneration issues to the Company, are considered with guidance from the remuneration consultants who advise the Committee.
The size and nature of each key element of the remuneration package of the executive Directors has been determined following this analysis.
It is the aim of the Committee to encourage and reward high performance.
It is the opinion of the Committee that shareholders interests are best served by setting a moderate level of fixed pay, while providing competitive potential levels of total remuneration through short and longer term incentive arrangements which require the satisfaction of challenging performance conditions.
Therefore, a significant proportion of the executive Directors remuneration is performance-linked.
Salaries Salaries of executive Directors are reviewed by the Committee annually.
In addition to an analysis presented by New Bridge Street Consultants, the Committee uses published salary surveys and information available in the annual reports of similar companies as sources of market information.
The Committee takes account of pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group when determining annual salary increases.
Specific factors taken into account by the Committee when determining each executive Directors base salary are: the median level of base salary for a similar position within a like group of companies: the individual Directors performance: and the responsibilities of the respective Director.
The Chairmans remuneration is set by the Committee, which meets without him for this purpose.
The remaining non-executive Directors fees are set by a Committee comprising the executive Directors.
In all cases the remuneration awards are based upon published salary surveys, taking account of individual responsibilities.
Andrew Walker is Chairman of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and receives additional remuneration as a result.
Annual bonus scheme Bonus payments are based upon the achievement of operating profit and cash flow targets.
The maximum bonus for 2005 was 50% of base salary, of which 10% related to the achievement of a 45,900,000 profit before tax and loss on fair value movements on derivatives and amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition and 40% to achieving an operating cash flow of 34,000,000 after capital expenditure and purchase of long-term incentive plan shares.
The actual results for the year led to a bonus pay-out of 44.9%.
The pay-out was below the maximum despite the above target full year results because of higher working capital levels during the year.
The performance measures for bonus payments are reviewed annually by the Committee to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and position of the Group and, therefore, that they continue to remain challenging.
It is the opinion of the Committee that the use of operating profit and cash flow targets remains appropriate for the 2006 bonus scheme.
Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 39 Remuneration report continued Long-Term Incentive Plan In April 2002, shareholders approved the establishment of the Ultra Electronics Long-Term Incentive Plan 2002-2007 the New LTIP to replace the previous Ultra Electronics Long-Term Incentive Plan the Old LTIP that had expired.
The Committees current policy is for the New LTIP to be the sole vehicle through which long-term incentives are provided to executive Directors and that executive Directors who participate in the New LTIP will not be granted options under either the Company Share Option Plan or the Executive Share Option Scheme which are share schemes operated by the Company for the benefit of less senior executives and certain key employees.
Under the New LTIP, a participant may be granted an award over ordinary shares worth up to 100% of gross base salary each year.
The vesting of awards is dependent on the extent to which genuinely stretching earnings per share EPS based performance conditions are met over the three-year period following grant.
The Committee believes that the most appropriate approach to determine the extent to which these performance targets are achieved is for the relevant calculations to be undertaken by an independent third party.
For the purposes of the performance targets for 2005 onwards, the Companys EPS will be calculated before amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisition and gain or loss on derivative financial instruments.
For earlier periods the Companys EPS has been calculated before goodwill amortisation but after exceptional items.
More particularly, the Committees current policy is for vesting of awards to be dependent upon the Companys EPS growth over this three-year period relative to the EPS growth of a group of comparative companies.
For the 2005 vesting these companies were: Alba plc Henlys Group plc Alvis plc Meggitt plc AIM Group plc Rolls-Royce plc Amstrad plc Rotork plc BAE Systems plc Senior plc Charter plc Smiths Group plc Chemring Group plc Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Chloride Group plc Telemetrix plc Cobham plc TT Electronics plc Delta plc Vitec Group plc Domino Printing Sciences plc Volex Group plc Halma plc VT Group plc Hampson Industries plc Whatman plc Vesting commences at 20% for median performance, rising on a straight-line basis so that the award vests in full for upper-quartile performance.
To the extent that the targets are not met at the end of the three-year period, the award lapses.
Ultra achieved third quartile EPS growth performance during the period 2003-2005 and therefore the 2002 award vested at 84%.
The Committee believes that the appropriate performance measure for New LTIP awards is comparative EPS, because this measure ensures that the Companys earnings growth must be at the upper-quartile of a group of similar companies before awards vest in full.
Such earnings growth performance, sustained over the medium to long-term, should ensure above average share price growth, and hence out-performance against market benchmarks in creating shareholder value.
The executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the Companys Inland Revenue approved All-Employee Share Ownership Plan AESOP.
Under the AESOP, employees in the UK are offered the opportunity to buy shares up to the value of 1,500 per year from pre-tax salary.
Shares are then held in trust on behalf of employees until the maturity date or until they leave the Company.
Total Shareholder Return performance graph The graph opposite shows the Total Shareholder Return TSR performance of the Company in comparison to the FTSE Mid 250 over the past five years.
The graph shows the value at the end of 2005 of 100 invested at the end of 2000, in the Company and in the Index.
The Committee considers the FTSE Mid 250 index a relevant index for TSR comparison as the index members represent a broad range of UK quoted companies.

In the event of early termination, it is the Committees policy that the amount of compensation paid to executive Directors will be considered in the light of all the relevant circumstances, subject to the overriding conditions that: the Committees aim will be to avoid rewarding poor performance: the duty of the relevant executive Director to mitigate his loss will be taken into account: and no compensation payment can exceed one years salary.
