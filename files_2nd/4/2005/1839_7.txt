Remuneration Report Introduction This years remuneration report is presented to shareholders in accordance with the requirements of the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations.
In preparing the report the Remuneration Committee has reviewed remuneration policy for executive directors and in so doing has reaffirmed its commitment to ensure that overall remuneration continues to be linked to organisational and individual performance and has a clear alignment with the interests of shareholders.
Remuneration Committee The Committee operates within terms of reference and governance policies approved by the Board and is responsible on behalf of the Board for: executive remuneration policy determining the service conditions and remuneration of all executive directors: the evaluation of executive director performance with regard to the award of share options, annual bonus and other performance based remuneration: obtaining independent professional advice in relation to executive director remuneration.
During the year under review the Remuneration Committee has met on eight occasions, with all members present.
Membership and Proceedings of the Remuneration Committee The members of the Remuneration Committee are all non-executive directors and during the year have comprised Mr A E Kilburn Chairman, Mr C G Toner, Mr M Pescod and Mr R J Davies.
All Committee members are considered to be wholly independent with no financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the Committees decisions.
The Group Chief Executive attends meetings of the Committee as required but he is not present when matters affecting his own remuneration are considered.
Other than as expressly identified in this report the Remuneration Committee has complied with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
The Committee recognises its accountability on executive remuneration to shareholders through this report and in determining future remuneration policy it will consider both the shareholders vote on the report and views expressed by shareholders on the detail of the report.
Advice Advice is provided to the Remuneration Committee by the Company Secretary, Mr L Dent, a practising solicitor.
Mr Dent also acts as secretary to the Committee.
In addition, Watson Wyatt LLP were appointed by the Committee to advise on a range of issues, including the current market positioning of the Groups executive remuneration having regard to a comparator group of other housebuilding companies, including Persimmon, Wimpey, Taylor Woodrow and Bellway.
Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited have advised the Company in relation to various pensions issues and, with effect from 10th July 2004, were appointed to provide actuarial services to the Barratt Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
Remuneration Policy During the year the Committee has undertaken a full review of executive remuneration.
To address structural concerns raised by major shareholders changes have been made to certain elements of the package, and these are detailed in this report.
The fundamental aims of this review were to ensure that executive remuneration: is fully aligned with the performance of the Company and the returns received by shareholders: rewards the sustained growth and profitability of the business: conforms with market-leading best practice.
Throughout the process the Committee has consulted with major shareholders to ensure their support for the approach taken.
This report details the Companys remuneration policy for 2005 06 and, so far as practicable, for subsequent years.
Any changes made to the policy will be identified in subsequent Remuneration Reports to shareholders.
Central to the Group remuneration policy is recognition that the sustained growth and profitability of our business is determined in no short measure by the skill and commitment of the executive team.
The reward policy for executive directors seeks to provide remuneration and other service conditions which will attract, retain, motivate and reward executive directors of the highest calibre within the industrys highly competitive employment market.
Within these broad objectives the executive remuneration package is based on the following principles: 34 Remuneration Report the greater part of remuneration paid to executives should be linked to the achievement of demanding performance targets: currently over 50% of the total executive remuneration package is performance based: performance related remuneration should align the interests of executives with those of shareholders by setting performance targets based on measures of shareholder return: total remuneration for outstanding performance should be competitive with that available elsewhere in the sector.
The Remuneration Package for Executive Directors The remuneration package for executive directors comprises: basic salary: annual performance related bonus: long-term share incentives: pension and other benefits.
Typically the performance related element of executive remuneration makes up more than 50% of the total package excluding pension benefits.
The performance conditions which apply to the performance related element of executive remuneration are the same for all executive directors and are set out in the following sections of this report.
Basic Salary Basic salaries for executive directors are a fixed annual sum payable monthly in cash.
Salaries are set having regard to individual responsibilities, skills and experience and are currently based on the market rate for similar positions in large national housebuilding companies.
Salaries were included in the review of executive remuneration carried out during the year by the Remuneration Committee and a repositioning will take effect from 1st July 2005.
The increases reflect a move to a more competitive market positioning with reference to the peer group, and also the adjustments to other parts of the package.
Although the increases to basic salary are significant when looked at in isolation compared with the previous year, the value of the total reward package, for the same level of performance, has not increased from last year because of adjustments made to other elements.
These other changes are detailed in the report below.
D A Pretty 507,500 2004 : 416,500 H Walker 348,000 2004 : 300,000 S J Boyes 290,600 2004 : 250,000 C A Dearlove 272,600 2004 : 235,000 C Fenton 290,600 2004 : 250,000 P R Gieron 290,600 2004 : 250,000 G K Hester 290,600 2004 : 250,000 Annual Profit Related Bonus Until the financial year ended 30th June 2005 each executive director participated in an annual profit related bonus scheme based on the annual level of the Groups pre-tax profit with awards made at 0.1333% of the Group pre-tax profit for the Group Chief Executive, 0.1165% for the Group Deputy Chief Executive and 0.1% for all other executive directors.
A similar annual bonus scheme is operated for senior management in all divisions based on a percentage of pre-tax profit for each division.
A new discretionary bonus scheme will replace the above contractual bonus arrangement with effect from 1st July 2005.
Annual bonus payments will be dependent upon the achievement of demanding financial objectives and key strategic measures for the business, set annually by the Group Board.
For the financial year 2005 06 90% of the bonus payment will be based on pre-tax profits and 10% will be based on the achievement of customer satisfaction targets.
For the attainment of 100% of target the amount of bonus will be 130% of basic salary.
The maximum amount of bonus which can be received by any executive is 180% of basic salary, for the attainment of 125% of profit target.
Previously there was no cap to the bonus payment.
If actual performance falls below 80% of target then no bonus will be payable.
Payment of the bonus is on a progressive scale with proportionately more being attainable for performance over and above target.
35 Remuneration Report As part of the changes to the annual bonus the Committee is proposing that a proportion of the bonus is deferred on a compulsory basis, with an opportunity for additional voluntary deferral.
The deferred amounts will be converted into shares, with an opportunity for additional matching shares to be received if further performance targets are met.
For this purpose, a new plan will, with shareholders approval, be established: full details of the new plan are set out in the Shareholders Circular accompanying this Annual Report.
Share Option Plan In November 1997 the Company adopted the current Executive Share Option Plan the Plan.
The grant of share options under the Plan is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance of the Group.
Options must be held for a minimum of three years from the date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years.
The exercise of options granted under the Plan is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee namely that the growth in the earnings per share of the Company over a period of three consecutive financial years should exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index by at least 6% for options granted in 1997 and 1998 and by at least 9% for those options granted in and since 1999.
In accordance with best practice the Remuneration Committee reviewed the performance condition and for options granted after 1st July 2004 the three consecutive financial years over which the earnings per share growth target must be met will commence with the financial year during which the options are granted.
If the target is not met over this fixed three-year period, then options will lapse.
There will be no retesting of performance.
As part of the review the Committee has determined that in future no further options will be granted under the Plan.
All longterm share awards will be made under the Long-Term Performance Plan which has more demanding performance targets than those attaching to share options, thereby increasing the alignment between executive and shareholder reward.
The Committee also believe that this provides a more focused approach to incentives.
Options which have been granted in previous years remain unchanged and details of the terms of these outstanding awards are set out below.
Long-Term Performance Plan The Long-Term Performance Plan the LTPP was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held in November 2003 to take effect from 1st July 2003.
As a consequence of the changes being made to the total remuneration package of executives, as described above, and in particular the cessation of use of the Executive Share Option Plan, the Committee is proposing that the LTPP be amended to allow awards of up to a maximum of 200% of basic salary.
Details are set out in the Shareholders Circular.
Awards under the LTPP are based on an annual allocation of notional ordinary shares equivalent in value to a maximum of 100% of basic salary with vesting taking place at the expiry of the three year performance period of the plan, subject to attainment of the agreed performance targets.
50% of the award will vest on attainment of a performance target based on Basic Earnings Per Share EPS growth and 50% based on Total Shareholder Return TSR.
A vesting schedule has been established so that, in terms of EPS growth, the full 50% will vest if EPS growth exceeds the Retail Price Index RPI plus 45% and 10% will vest if EPS growth exceeds RPI plus 30%, with straight line vesting between these two points.
The remaining 50% will vest subject to TSR performance measured against the constituents of the FTSE Construction and Building Materials Sector Index.
Again a vesting schedule has been established so that the full 50% will vest if TSR growth is in the upper quartile of the comparative index and 10% vesting if TSR growth is at the median of the index, with straight line vesting between the two points.
Details of notional share awards made under the LTPP during the last year are set out below.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the performance targets for the awards to be granted under the LTPP in 2005.
The Remuneration Committee has concluded that, in the current market in which the Company is operating, new performance targets are required in order to ensure that the LTPP remains an effective incentive to participants.
As with existing awards, 50% of the award will be based on EPS growth and 50% on TSR performance.
For the EPS element of the target, the full 50% will vest if EPS growth exceeds the RPI Index plus 18% and 10% will vest if EPS growth exceeds the RPI plus 9%: for performance in between the award will vest on a straightline basis.
For the TSR element, the Company currently measures performance against the companies which make up the FTSE Construction and Buildings Materials Sector Index.
It is understood that, from next year, housebuilding companies will be moved into a new sector of Household Goods.
That sector will include companies that are not comparable to the Company.
Accordingly, it is proposed that, for future awards, the comparator companies will be made up of listed housebuilders.
A vesting schedule will be drawn up by taking an average of the two highest and two lowest TSR figures for such companies over the performance period and creating a mid-point and an upper quartile from those two figures.
The full 50% will vest if the Companys TSR is within the upper quartile and 10% will vest at the mid-point mark: for performance in between, the award will vest on a straightline basis.
The Remuneration Committee considers that, in the current economic and business climate, these targets are as stringent as the existing targets were when the LTPP was first established.
The Remuneration Committee will review the targets for future awards annually in the light of the then existing circumstances and, if appropriate, impose more stringent targets.
Shareholders approval for the new targets will be sought at the Annual General Meeting.
The scheme entitles the executive directors with the exceptions of Mr D A Pretty, Mr G K Hester and Mr C Fenton to a pension on retirement at age 65 of two thirds of final pensionable salary after 40 years membership of the scheme.
The executive directors are also eligible for dependants pension and an insured lump sum of four times pensionable salary on death in service.
The final pension is calculated from the highest yearly average pensionable salary over three consecutive years during the last ten years of service.
The entitlements of Mr D A Pretty, Mr G K Hester and Mr C Fenton are restricted by the earnings cap imposed under the Finance Act 1989.
Under a contractual arrangement entered into in 1992 Mr D A Prettys pension accrues at the rate of 1 30th but it remains restricted to the earnings cap.
As disclosed last year special arrangements have been put in place for Mr D A Pretty in order to secure his services until retirement.
Based on calculations carried out by the actuary to the Group scheme Mr D A Pretty receives, with effect from 1st July 2003, a supplement equal to 50% of basic salary, as disclosed in the emoluments table below.
In respect of the remaining executive directors, and following the review of executive remuneration, changes will be made to their pension provision with effect from 1st July 2005.
The annual profit related bonus will not be included in the calculation of final pensionable salary, for executive directors, for service after 1st July 2005.
This complies with best practice as set out in the Combined Code for Corporate Governance.
In recognition of the fact that the inclusion of profit related bonus in the calculation of pensionable salary is a contractual arrangement of some 25 years standing, which clearly pre-dates the introduction of the Combined Code, supplemental payments will be made to each executive director in respect of the period up to 6th April 2006 being the date of the introduction of the Lifetime Allowance Pension Rules.
From this date new provisions will apply which take account of the new Revenue and Customs regulations.
The Committee believes that these payments, which are set out below, address shareholder concerns regarding the inclusion of bonus in the pensionable salary definition, while recognising the fact that this is a contractual arrangement and one which applies equally to all Group management and staff as well as to executive directors.

The following tables and accompanying notes constitute the auditable part of the Remuneration Report as defined in Part 3, Schedule 7a of the Companies Act 1985.
The fee in respect of Mr R J Davies was paid directly to Arriva plc.
The executive directors receive taxable benefits in kind covering the provision of a motor vehicle, private medical insurance and some telephone costs.
The Listing Rules require this to be disclosed excluding inflation.
The increase in the accrued entitlement is the difference between the accrued benefit at the end of the year and that at the previous year end.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of the directors pension benefits.
They do not represent sums payable to individual directors and, therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The mid-market high and low share prices of the Company during the year were 716.5p and 499.5p respectively.
No options of directors in office at 30th June 2005 lapsed unexercised during the year.
There were no changes in the interests of the directors shown above between 1st July 2005 and 28th September 2005.
