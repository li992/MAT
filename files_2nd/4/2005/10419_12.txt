remuneration approach to support the changing needs of the business.
Any changes in policy for subsequent years will be described in future reports on Directors remuneration.
The Committee has adopted the following principles: the Committee sets base salaries which reect contribution, criticality to the business and general wage levels elsewhere in the Group.
Decisions are made with reference to a range around the median of the relevant market for the individual although the Company may pay more to recruit a high-calibre executive: emphasis is placed on rewarding business performance, and therefore we seek to position the total compensation packages at upper quartile for superior performance: and performance-related incentives with stretching business performance targets to drive and reward superior performance from our executives whilst at the same time aligning the interests of the leadership team with those of our shareholders.
These principles are applied to all employees to recruit, retain and motivate the highest calibre of employee throughout the business.
On an annual basis the Committee reviews the relationship between the base pay of the executive Directors with the base pay of reporting levels below executive Directors level.

2 Restricted share awards were granted on terms that they will only vest on the third anniversary of grant, if a significant personal shareholding in the Company equal to the number of shares under award is built within 18 months of grant and retained until the vesting date as well as remaining in employment with the Group.
The awards vest on a pro-rata basis if the participant builds up a lower personal investment.

Vesting is subject to the satisfaction of corporate performance criteria as detailed on page 55.
23 November 2001, the first performance test took place in November 2004.
TSR performance from 19 November 2001 the start of the performance period to 18 November 2004 placed the Company at 31st position within the comparator group and resulted in 74 per cent of share options becoming exercisable.
Performance will be tested in respect of the unexercisable portion of the option on 18 November 2005.
Should the remaining portion of the option not be exercisable at that time, a final retest will occur on 18 November 2006.
In the case of David McGlade who resigned from the Board on 31 March 2005, the balance of his option outstanding lapsed in full.
2 For options granted in the year ended 31 March 2003 i. e. 25 July 2002, the first performance test is expected to be July 2005.
TSR performance from 18 July 2002 the start of the performance period to 31 March 2005 placed the Company at first position within the comparator group.
3 The options granted to David McGlade on 23 November 2001 were in the form of ADSs one mmO2 ADS equalled 10 ordinary shares.
The value realisable from shares acquired on exercise is the difference between the price on the date of exercise and the option price.

The sterling-dollar exchange rate on 7 March 2005 was 1 $1.9114.

Legacy long-term incentives Peter Erskine had the following O2 shares under award from BT Legacy Share Awards.
Following demerger, these awards were adjusted to relate solely to O2 shares, and any performance measure has been translated into a measure of O2 performance from demerger to the end of the performance period.

The TSR performance condition was not met and as a result the award over 144,198 shares lapsed in May 2004.
2 The vesting of shares awarded under the BT Deferred Bonus Plan was subject only to continued employment with the Company.
qxd 6 1 05 8:00 PM Page 63 Legacy Option Plan Subsisting options over BT shares granted under BT executive share option plans have been replaced with options over O2 shares, granted under the O2 Legacy Option Plan, for those participants now employed by O2.
The replacement options were granted on the same terms and are exercisable between the same dates as the options for which they were exchanged.
There are no performance conditions relating to the vesting of these options other than continued employment with the O2 Group.
This reects the terms of the underlying BT Option plan.
The legacy options will be satisfied using new issue shares, and options granted under this plan do not count towards the dilution limits established for O2 share option plans.
No further options will be granted under this plan.
The table below shows options over BT shares held by David Varney and David McGlade prior to demerger.

80 60 Performance graph 40 The performance graph illustrates the Companys TSR performance for the period from 19 November 2001 when the Company was first listed following its demerger from BT to 31 March 2005, compared to the 20 FTSE 100 Index and the FTSEurorst 300 Telecommunications Index.
The FTSE 100 Index was selected by the 0 19 Nov 31 Mar 31 Mar 31 Mar 31 Mar Committee because it is recognised as an externally valid and robust comparator group of UK-based companies 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 of similar size to the Company in terms of market capitalisation.
The FTSEurorst 300 Telecommunications mmO2 O2 FTSE 100 Index FTSEurofirst 300 Telecommunications Index Index was chosen because it more closely compares the Company within its sector.
The graph relates to mmO2 plcs performance prior to 14 March 2005, and O2 plcs performance thereafter.
The graph shows the growth in value of 100 invested on 19 November 2001 including the reinvestment of dividends.
It does not relate to the Companys TSR performance as reected in O2 long-term incentives.
qxd 6 1 05 8:00 PM Page 64 Report on directors remuneration continued All-employee share schemes The Committee believes that it is in the interests of all employees across the business to be given the opportunity to own O2 shares, and wishes to encourage this by taking advantage of favourable tax treatment where available for employees.
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Groups all-employee share schemes on the same terms as other employees.
Details of their interests can be found on page 62.
There are no performance conditions attached to the schemes and both operate within specic tax legislation: the O2 Sharesave Plan, under which the Directors can grant options to all employees across the business to acquire shares at an exercise price set at a discount of up to 20 per cent to the market value of a share at the time of invitation: and the O2 Share Ownership Plan, under which UK employees can acquire O2 shares on tax-favoured terms.
Policy on outside appointments It is the Groups policy to support executive Directors and senior managers taking external directorships or similar roles where it is beneficial for both the individual concerned and the Group and does not detract from their responsibilities to the Group.
The number of such appointments must not exceed two, only one of which may be with a FTSE 100 company.
Appointments relating to executive Directors and Executive Committee members require the prior approval of the Board.
Appointments relating to other senior executives require the prior approval of the Chairman.
The Company permits the executive Director or senior executive concerned to retain any fees earned from such a position provided they are at a reasonable level.
Peter Erskine is a member of the University of Reading Business School Advisory Board.
David McGlade, who left the Board on 31 March 2005, is a non-executive Director of a US-based company called PureMatrix.
None of the executive Directors received fees in respect of these external directorships.
