SHARE OPTIONS AND LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN The executive Directors hold options granted under Misys current share plans and under the share plans which were operated previously.
I Martin, J P McMahon and T K Skelton each also hold options granted before their appointment to the Board.
The performance criteria that applied to options granted and Long-term Incentive Plan awards made in 2004 05 are the same as those proposed for grants in 2005 06, described on page 36 above.
The options held by each executive Director over shares in the Company is summarised below.
The exercise price per share is above market price at year end in cases marked a and below in cases marked b. ii Options marked TI are classed by Misys as Type I.
The Committee has set performance conditions for Type I options, based on adjusted earnings per share growth above growth in RPI over a fixed three year period, with targets ranging from 3% to 12% per annum.
iii Nil cost options under the Misys Annual Award Plan are not subject to any performance criteria, only employment conditions.
iv Nil cost options under the LTIP vested in 2001 at 31.22% of their maximum potential and became exercisable in 3 equal annual tranches three, four and five years after grant.
Until 2002 nil cost options under the LTIP were subject to performance targets based on compound growth in adjusted earnings per share.
LTIP awards granted in 2003 were subject to targets based on comparative total shareholder return against a comparator group.
LTIP awards in 2004 are subject to performance conditions as described on page 36. v Options marked TII are classed by Misys as Type II.
The performance condition for Type II options is 15% growth in adjusted earnings per share over a fixed three year period ending 31 May 2005.
The performance target was not met at 31 May 2005, and so the options have lapsed on 1 June 2005. vi On 23 November 2001, prior to their appointment to the Board, market value options were granted which vested on 23 November 2004.
Under arrangements existing prior to the adoption of the current plans, executive Directors participated in a number of market value approved and unapproved share option schemes, and in the Misys Share Incentive Programme.
All options granted under these prior arrangements have now vested in full.
Executive directors have also participated in the Companys savings-related share option schemes or US stock purchase plan on the same basis as other employees.
The options set out above were granted under the Misys share plans current at the time of grant.
The options shown with a zero exercise price were granted as nil-cost options under the Misys 1998 Long-term Share Incentive Plan, Misys Annual Award Plan and Misys Share Incentive Plan.
All other options were granted at market value.
com Movements in the executive Directors share options during the year are summarised below.
In accordance with the Rules of the plan, because this price was below the original strike price, an additional number of shares could be purchased iii The following information provides the dates on which options were exercised and the market price of the Companys shares on those dates a 04 08 2004 182.75p b 06 08 2004 174.25p c 19 08 2004 180.00p d 02 09 2004 181.75p e 13 10 2004 201.25p iv Market price options granted to executive Directors in 2001 failed to satisfy the minimum performance criteria required of compound annual growth in adjusted EPS exceeding RPI by a rate of 7% and hence lapsed on 1 June 2004.
1998 LTIP awards granted in 2001 also failed to satisfy the minimum performance criteria required of compound annual growth rate in adjusted EPS of 10% and hence lapsed on 1 June 2004.
Savingsrelated options lapsed as the executive withdrew from these invitations in order to enter into a new savings contract at a lower price.
The aggregate gain on options exercised by executive Directors during the year was 191,773 2004: 2,077,100 There have been no changes in executive Directors share options between 31 May 2005 and 21 July 2005, other than in relation to the 2001 grant of options and LTIP awards.
The performance period in relation to these grants ended on 31 May 2005.
The minimum performance target for this period was not met and therefore none of the 2001 grants vested and all the options lapsed.
