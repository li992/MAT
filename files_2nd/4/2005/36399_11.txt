Directors Remuneration Report Remuneration Committee and Advisors The Remuneration Committee comprises three independent non-executive directors, Charles Irby Chairman, John Edgcumbe and Kathleen ODonovan, who have responsibility for determining the remuneration, contract terms and other benefits of the executive directors and the Chairman of the Company.
It reviews the remuneration framework for all other employees including the annual bonus plan where all employees are eligible to participate in performance-related bonus plans based on Company and individual performance targets and long-term incentive arrangements for certain senior personnel.
The Committee is advised by New Bridge Street Consultants, a firm of independent remuneration consultants, which was appointed in October 2003, and Investment Property Databank IPD, a property market index and benchmarking service.
During the year, New Bridge Street Consultants also advised the executive directors on non-executive director fee levels.
Nabarro Nathanson assisted the Committee on procedural matters relating to the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
Nabarro Nathanson, the Companys advisers, were not appointed by the Remuneration Committee.
Toby Courtauld, the Chief Executive, provided advice in relation to discretionary bonuses for other senior executives.
Remuneration Policy The Remuneration Committee establishes policy on the remuneration of executive directors.
In determining the policy for 2005 it considered and is likely to continue to consider for subsequent financial years a number of factors, including: the importance of attracting, retaining and motivating executives of appropriate calibre and experience: and the size and long-term nature of the Groups business.
The remuneration policy for executive directors has been designed to address the interests of both directors and shareholders: a potentially significant proportion of remuneration is based on performance and is dependant upon the achievement of demanding targets.
Remuneration currently comprises: basic salary and benefits, performance-related bonuses, LTIP and pension.
The Companys policy on termination payments is to consider the circumstances on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the relevant contractual terms, the circumstances of the termination and any applicable duty to mitigate.
It is the Committees policy not to reward for poor performance.
Basic Salary and Benefits Basic salaries and the level and nature of benefits provided to executive directors are reviewed by the Committee annually or on promotion, and are assessed having regard to Company and individual performance and salary levels in comparable organisations, particularly within the listed property sector.
Basic salary is the only element of executive directors remuneration which attracts pension contributions.
Benefits principally comprise life insurance, private health care, car and travel concessions and membership subscriptions.
The taxable value of these benefits is included in the table on page 43.
Bonus Plan Each year the Committee considers the appropriateness of short-term and long-term incentive plans in assessing the overall remuneration of executive directors.
Under the Directors Annual Bonus Plan, executive directors can receive a maximum award of 100% of salary based on one-third being earned on the out-performance of earnings per share against the retail price index, one-third being earned on the out-performance of the capital growth of the Companys property portfolio against IPDs relevant Capital Growth Index, and one-third based on the individuals performance.
The Remuneration Committee also has the discretion to recommend the payment of an additional bonus to a director or other employee for exceptional performance over and above the high standard required.
Based on his performance during the year, the Remuneration Committee awarded Robert Noel an additional bonus of 135,238.
Under the terms of his contract, agreed in 2002, Toby Courtauld was paid a loyalty bonus of 350,000 on 31 March 2005: there are no further loyalty bonus payments payable under his contract.
GREAT PORTLAND ESTATES Annual Report 2005 39 Directors Remuneration Report Long-Term Incentive Plan Following shareholder approval at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 11 December 2002, the Company introduced the LTIP for executive directors and other senior employees.
In designing the LTIP, the Remuneration Committee followed the provisions in Schedule A of the Combined Code operative at that time.
The number of shares made the subject of awards under the LTIP is subject to an annual limit of 125% of a participants basic salary.
In the case of executive directors, as notified in the circular to shareholders proposing the establishment of the LTIP, it is the intention of the Remuneration Committee to make an award annually of 125% of the relevant executive directors basic salary.
Each year, contingent awards of shares are made which vest after three years provided performance conditions are met.
The conditions are based on: the growth in the Groups net assets per share exceeding the rate of inflation over the same period by an average of at least two percentage points per annum: and if this hurdle is met total shareholder return measured using share price and the reinvestment of dividends over the three years relative to a bespoke comparator group of 20 companies including the Company selected from the FTSE Real Estate Index.
Net assets per share is calculated as the fully diluted net asset value of the Great Portland Estates group as published in the Companys Annual Report, adjusted, as appropriate: to exclude the effect of deferred tax relating to capital allowances exceeding depreciation: to include the effect of marking debt to market: to include the effect of contingent corporation tax on chargeable gains: to ensure a consistent basis of calculation following any changes in accounting standards: and to take account of certain variations in share capital.
They were selected by the Remuneration Committee on the advice of the Companys remuneration consultants, and following discussion with the Association of British Insurers and institutional investors.
In order to ensure that the assessment of performance is independent, New Bridge Street Consultants and the Companys auditors will report to the Remuneration Committee as to whether the performance criteria have been met.
Total Shareholder Return The following graph shows the total shareholder returns for the Company for each of the last five financial years compared to the FTSE All-Share Real Estate Index.
