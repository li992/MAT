Annual Report & Accounts 2005 54 Kazakhmys PLC Directors Remuneration Report Introduction The Directors remuneration report sets out certain information on remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2005 concerning the Directors of Kazakhmys PLC.
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985.
As required by legislation, the information in Part II of this report has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP as it contains the information upon which the auditors are required to report to the Companys shareholders.
PART I Remuneration Committee The Board established the Remuneration Committee on 23 September 2005 and it has met twice since that date.
Lord Renwick has been the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee since his appointment to the Board on 1 December 2005 and its other members are Mr David Munro and Mr James Rutland.
Mr Munro replaced Mr Vladimir Ni as a member of the Remuneration Committee following the appointment of Mr Ni as Chairman of Kazakhmys LLC, which was announced on 28 February 2006.
All of the members of the Remuneration Committee are therefore independent non-executive Directors.
Under its terms of reference, the duties of the Remuneration Committee are to determine and agree with the Board the broad policy for the remuneration of the executive Directors, as well as their specific remuneration packages, including pension rights and, where applicable, any compensation payments.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee comply with the provisions of the Combined Code and are available on the Companys website.
Remuneration policy The Remuneration Committee held its first meeting on 16 December 2005.
It recommended to the Board, and the Board agreed, that as the three executive Directors Messrs Kim, Cha and Novachuk are all major shareholders in the Company and will thereby benefit from any uplift in the value of the business, they should not be eligible for share-based incentive schemes.
It was further decided that the three executive Directors would be responsible for their own pension arrangements so that no part of their pension costs will be borne by the Company.
Their remuneration would consist entirely of base salary and performance-related bonus.
In respect of benefits, they would be entitled to the use of a car and driver for business purposes and private medical insurance cover.
The non-executive Directors fees have been set at a level to reflect the time commitment and level of involvement that they are required to make in the activities of the Board and its committees, including the travel commitments that are required to fulfil their duties.
Salaries, bonuses and performance criteria Against this background the Remuneration Committee reviewed the base salaries in December 2005 and confirmed the base salaries for Messrs Cha and Novachuk as set out in the Listing Prospectus.
In respect of Mr Kim, the Remuneration Committee and the Board were strongly of the view that, at the present stage of the Groups development, it is essential that he should remain a full-time executive, with overall responsibility for the strategic direction of the Company.
It was decided, accordingly, to align his salary with that of the Chief Executive, Mr Cha, as set out in the table below.
The Remuneration Committee further decided, with the agreement of the executive Directors, that the bonus maxima should be reduced from 150% to 120%, in order to bring the total remuneration packages of the executive Directors in line with those of executives performing similar roles in comparable mining and minerals companies quoted in the London market.
The allocation of future bonus awards has been agreed as follows: Up to 30% of annual base salary will be awarded based on the financial performance of the Group Up to 30% of annual base salary will be awarded based on the operational performance of the Group, including safety Up to 30% of annual base salary will be awarded based on strategic development, including execution of new projects Up to 30% of annual base salary will be awarded based on shareholder return.
The Remuneration Committee further recommended, and the Board agreed, that the executive management in Kazakhstan should be further incentivised to help improve the safety performance of the Group.
The Group provides pensions arrangements for employees in Kazakhstan through the Accumulating Pension Funds of Kazakhmys Corporation LLC the Fund, a fund established under Kazakh legislation to enable employees to invest deductions from salary required by law to be invested in a pension fund.
The Group does not itself make any contributions to the Fund for its employees.
The Fund invested in Kazakhmys LLC shares in 2001 along with other securities in accordance with Kazakhstan laws and regulations.
The Kazakhmys LLC shares were disposed of in November 2004 when Kazakhmys PLC was established as the holding company for Kazakhmys LLC in anticipation of the London listing.
Share schemes The Company does not operate any share schemes or long-term incentive plans for the executive Directors.
The executive Directors are employed under contracts of employment with the Company dated 26 September 2005.
The contracts may not be terminated by either party for 12 months following the Listing and thereafter the contracts may be terminated by not less than three months notice.
In setting the notice period for termination at three months, the Remuneration Committee has reduced the likelihood of having to pay excessive compensation in the event of poor performance.
With the exception of Lord Renwick, the non-executive Directors signed Letters of Appointment with the Company on 26 September 2005.
Lord Renwick signed a Letter of Appointment with effect from 1 December 2005.
The non-executive Directors were re-elected to the Board at the annual general meeting held on 16 December 2005 and each non-executive Director will stand for re-election at least once every three years.
The current salaries fees for the Directors are as set out in the table below: Director Current salary fee 1 Vladimir Kim 980,000 per annum Yong Keu Cha 960,000 per annum Oleg Novachuk 600,000 per annum David Munro 120,000 per annum 2 Vladimir Ni 120,000 per annum and $500,000 per annum James Rutland 120,000 per annum Lord Renwick 120,000 per annum 1 With effect from 1 January 2006, Mr Kim receives an aggregate salary of 980,000 per annum.
Of this salary, $1,004,400 is paid by Kazakhmys LLC and the balance is paid by the Company.
