10549 R&A 2005 Mid 20 3 06 11:58 Page 36 REMUNERATION REPORT The Board of Directors presents its Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2005.
A resolution to approve this report will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 20 April 2006.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The Board has established a Remuneration Committee the Committee which is responsible for setting each executive Directors remuneration, plus the Chairmans remuneration.
The Committees current terms of reference were adopted on 25 February 2004 and are available from the Company Secretary.
The members of the Committee during the year ended 31 December 2005 were Hamish Leslie Melville Chairman, David Thompson and Neil Davidson, all of whom the Board considers to be independent non-executive Directors, and all of whom have served throughout the year.
Hamish Leslie Melville will retire from the Committee on 21 April 2006 and Adam Applegarth will be appointed to the Committee as Chairman on the same date.
The Committee consults with the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive although neither participates in any discussion relating to their own remuneration.
Details of the Directors attendance at Committee meetings are set out in the Corporate Governance Report on page 44.
REMUNERATION POLICY The executive Directors have been responsible for delivering significant value to investors and this proven track record makes this team attractive to quoted competitors and private equity-backed businesses.
The remuneration package is viewed by the Committee as having been instrumental to delivering this performance and is not considered excessive when taking account of the exceptional value created for shareholders.
It is important that these executives are appropriately rewarded for continuing to deliver exceptional value to shareholders and to retain this expertise.
The current remuneration policy, which has been operated since the acquisition of Beazer in 2001, is relatively unusual by comparison to other FTSE 100 companies.
In particular: Base salary levels for executive Directors are in the bottom quartile by reference to salary levels paid in other FTSE 100 businesses.
The annual bonus has been a key driver of performance, rewarding executive Directors for sustained year-on-year performance in terms of Group or divisional profit and Group earnings per share EPS.
Bonus payments in recent years have been significant, reecting the exceptional performance of the Company.
A significant proportion of annual bonuses are deferred in the form of shares, which vest in full after a two-year holding period subject to continued employment.
This share-based deferral element stretches the time horizon of the bonus and helps ensure that executive Directors are fully aligned with shareholders over the deferral period.
Whilst the value of long-term incentive awards is relatively modest by FTSE 100 standards, they provide a stretching incentive rewarding three-year total shareholder return and return on capital employed performance.
The share-based element of the annual bonus and the share-based LTIP provide significant alignment with the interests of shareholders.
Furthermore, the executive Directors have retained a significant proportion of vested awards and the level of shareholding of the executive Directors is extremely high, equating to very high multiples of base salary in the case of all executive Directors.
Notwithstanding the policy as outlined above, which has complemented the excellent performance of the business, the Committee is aware that the Company has grown signicantly since this policy was introduced in 2001 and also that the corporate governance environment has changed substantially.
At the time of the introduction of the Synergy Incentive Plan at the EGM to approve the Westbury acquisition, several of the Companys leading institutional shareholders encouraged the Company to review the current remuneration package and it was indicated that the package would be reviewed during 2007 with a view to introducing new arrangements to take effect from the 2008 financial year.
In light of this feedback, the Committee has determined that it will bring forward the review of the remuneration packages to 2006 with a view to putting forward new arrangements for shareholder approval at the 2007 Annual General Meeting.
It is anticipated that the structure of remuneration will be changed to bring it more into line with market norms whilst still providing an appropriate reward mechanism for continuing to deliver exceptional performance and providing a continued strong alignment with shareholders.
As part of the process for this review, there will be a full consultation with major institutional shareholders and representative bodies.
BASE SALARY Current base salaries were set by the Committee as at 1 January 2005 and except for Mike Farleys salary, which will increase when he takes up his new role as Group Chief Executive in April 2006, are xed for two years.
Mike Farleys salary will be increased to 400,000 from 1 May 2006.
36 Persimmon Plc Annual Report 2005 10549 R&A 2005 Mid 20 3 06 11:58 Page 37 It is recognised by the Remuneration Committee that these salary levels are in the bottom quartile by reference to other FTSE 100 companies.
A full review of base salaries will be included as part of the review of remuneration in 2006.
2006 John White 430,000 Mike Farley 320,000 John Millar 320,000 Mike Killoran 320,000 David Bryant 235,000 ANNUAL BONUS Annual bonuses are performance related and non pensionable.
The performance conditions which determine the executive Directors bonuses are set annually by the Committee and are based on demanding targets related to the Companys EPS, and on Group and or divisional pre-tax profits.
In 2006, profits and EPS must achieve predetermined threshold targets for any bonuses to be payable and maximum bonus levels represent a very significant increase in performance.
The sliding scale for the EPS element and the pre-tax profit targets have been recalibrated to take account of the additional profits likely to materialise as a result of the Westbury acquisition and to ensure that there will be no element of rewarding executives twice for achieving the same cost savings targets as have been used for the Synergy Incentive Plan.
The performance criteria for each executive Director for 2006 are set out below: Performance criteria John White Group profits and EPS growth Mike Farley Group profits and EPS growth John Millar profits and profit growth of the North Division and EPS growth Mike Killoran Group profits and EPS growth David Bryant Eastern Region profits and EPS growth The Committee has determined that the total level of potential annual bonus payable to the executive Directors will be capped at a predetermined gure, which varies by Director.
The maximum annual bonus that may be earned by each executive Director is set out below.
The levels have been arrived at following recalibration of performance criteria and recognising that these are referenced to base salaries which are signicantly below comparable FTSE 100 levels.
Maximum bonus potential as a multiple of salary John White 4.31 Mike Farley 4.02 John Millar 2.91 Mike Killoran 2.92 David Bryant 2.20 The balance of any bonus earned in excess of 200% of base salary is required to be invested in the Companys shares Bonus Shares, which vest in two equal tranches over a two year period.
These Bonus Shares are awarded at the same time as the cash bonus, with the first tranche vesting on the date of announcement of the Groups preliminary results in the following year and the second tranche on the date of announcement of the Groups preliminary results the year after.
Any unvested Bonus Shares would be forfeited on termination of employment if the executive Director resigns or is dismissed summarily.
The number of Bonus Shares awarded is calculated by dividing the balance of any bonus earned in excess of 200% of base salary by the average share price in the period 1 January to 14 February prior to the announcement of the Groups preliminary results.
While total cash salary and target level of cash bonus is higher than would be typical for a FTSE 100 company, cash remuneration is weighted towards bonus, which makes the package more variable.
The share-based element of the bonus provides a strong alignment with shareholders.
SYNERGY INCENTIVE PLAN The Synergy Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders at the Extraordinary General Meeting on 6 January 2006 and the following one-off awards are proposed to be made during March 2006: Shares John White 375,000 Mike Farley 200,000 Mike Killoran 162,500 David Bryant 37,500 37 Persimmon Plc Annual Report 2005 Remuneration Report 10549 R&A 2005 Mid 20 3 06 11:58 Page 38 All awards will be subject to a performance condition and will vest in two tranches.
Up to 25% of an award the First Tranche will vest and become exercisable in 3 years time in March 2009 following the announcement of results for the year ending 31 December 2008, subject to the Group delivering at least 25 million of synergy savings in relation to the integration of Westbury into the Persimmon Group for the year ending 31 December 2006.
Up to 75% of an award the Second Tranche will vest and become exercisable in 4 years time in March 2010 following the announcement of results for the year ending 31 December 2009, subject to the Group delivering at least 40 million of synergy savings in relation to the integration of Westbury into the Persimmon Group for the year ending 31 December 2007.
Both of these target levels of vesting represent a significant level of challenge.
Furthermore, awards will only vest in full if the synergy savings for the financial years ending 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2007, are 20% above 25m and 40m respectively, the Target Savings.
If the savings made are less than the Target Savings then no shares will vest: if the savings equal the Target Savings then 60% of the award will vest.
Performance between the Target Savings and the maximum target will result in awards vesting on a straight line basis between each threshold.
The synergy savings will be signed off by the Audit and Remuneration Committees, advised by external auditors and will be disclosed in the Remuneration Report for the relevant financial year.
For the avoidance of doubt, the vesting of the Second Tranche is not conditional on the First Tranche vesting.
Any part of an award that does not vest as a consequence of the performance conditions not being satisfied in full will lapse.
The Committee requires John White to retain all of the shares acquired under the Synergy Incentive Plan except for sales of shares to pay income tax and National Insurance on exercise of the award for the duration of his term as Chairman.
LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN LTIP During 2005, executive Directors received awards of shares under the LTIP equal to 100% of base salary and will receive a similar award in 2006.
The Committee has discretion under the rules of the LTIP to set the vesting and performance criteria for any awards of shares.
In order to align executive Directors remuneration with those of shareholder returns, the Committee has based half the vesting of LTIP shares on Return on Capital Employed ROCE and half on Total Shareholder Return TSR over a three-year performance period.
The ROCE condition is a sliding scale with no vesting of ROCE shares unless the Groups ROCE is greater than 13% rising to all ROCE shares vesting if it is greater than 20%.
During and following the transition to International Financial Reporting Standards, the Committee will ensure that the ROCE calculation continues to be measured on a consistent basis.
TSR is the return to shareholders comprising the rise or fall in the share price plus the value of dividends received, assuming dividends are reinvested.
The TSR performance is then measured against a comparator group comprised of the following companies.
Barratt Developments Crest Nicholson Taylor Woodrow Bellway Kier Group Wilson Bowden Berkeley Group Redrow Wimpey George Bovis Homes Group Under the TSR measure, there will be no allocation of TSR shares for sub-median performance, 40% of the TSR shares will be allocated for median performance whilst all of the TSR shares will be allocated for upper quartile performance.
PENSION The executive Directors are members of the Groups dened benefit pension scheme.
Pensions for executive Directors accrue at 145th of base salary and the normal retirement age for executive Directors is 60 62 in the case of John Millar.
The HMRC Earnings Cap limits the pension payable to Mike Killoran under the dened benefit scheme and as a result the Company contributes a further percentage of his base salary into a complementary pension plan.
The Committee has considered whether alternative remuneration should be provided to executive Directors in the event that they wish to stop accruing pension in the dened benefit pension scheme as a result of the changes to pension legislation which will take place on 6 April 2006.
When considering alternatives, the Committee agreed that any alternative arrangements should be cost neutral to the Company.
After consultation with their advisors New Bridge Street Consultants LLP and the Companys actuary, the Committee has agreed that if an executive Director has reached the pension Lifetime Allowance and wishes to stop accruing pension in the Groups dened benefit scheme, then he will receive a salary supplement of 20% of basic salary.
The Companys actuary has confirmed that this is broadly equivalent to the cost to the Company of providing the executive Directors current pension benets.
A Director who stops accruing pension in the scheme and receives a salary supplement will remain a member of the scheme for life insurance purposes.
In addition, the Company contributes 10% of base salary to a complementary pension plan for each executive Director.
The Committee has confirmed that since these payments may not be tax efficient from 6 April 2006 an executive Director may elect to take the complementary pension payment as cash subject to a reduction for employers National Insurance contributions so as to ensure there is no additional cost to the Company.
38 Persimmon Plc Annual Report 2005 Remuneration Report 10549 R&A 2005 Mid 20 3 06 11:58 Page 39 BENEFITS IN KIND In addition to the above, the executive Directors remuneration also includes fully nanced motor vehicles, membership of both the Group private medical scheme and the Group long term disability scheme, subscriptions and some telephone costs.
These benets are not pensionable.
ALL EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEME The executive Directors may also participate in the Companys Save as You Earn Scheme, which is open to all permanent employees who have more than six months service.
SERVICE CONTRACTS All executive Directors have service contracts and in line with the recommendations of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance dated July 2003 the notice period for each executive Director does not exceed 12 months.
The contracts expire on the Directors 60th birthday or at age 62 in the case of John Millar.
In circumstances following a change of control, or where dismissed in breach of contract, an executive Director is entitled to payments for termination of employment, but in no circumstances will such payments exceed 12 months salary and benets.
The executive Directors contracts are all dated 24 April 2002 but are effective from 1 January 2002.
None of the non-executive Directors have service contracts.
David Thompson and Adam Applegarth retire in accordance with the Articles of Association at the Annual General Meeting and are offering themselves for reelection.
Hamish Leslie Melville, having served in excess of nine years on the Board will also retire at the Annual General Meeting and being eligible also offers himself for re-election.
The Directors reasons for supporting Mr Leslie Melvilles re-election to the Board are set out in the Corporate Governance report on page 44.
In addition, following the Companys announcement that John White will replace Duncan Davidson as Chairman, Mr White will also retire at the AGM and being eligible offers himself for re-election.
SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES The Committee has for some time encouraged significant long term share ownership of the Companys shares by the executive Directors.
In order to comply with best practice, formal share ownership guidelines were established in 2002.
As a result, the Committee now requires each executive Director to hold Persimmon shares.
For example, John White has to hold a minimum value of shares equivalent to three times his base salary.
The Committee recognises that executive Directors may be required to sell sufficient shares in the Company to satisfy any tax liability arising on the vesting of Bonus Shares or the exercise of options and vesting of awards granted under the Companys share option and long term incentive plans from time to time.
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS None of the executive Directors currently has an external appointment.
Should an executive wish to take up an external appointment, he must first seek approval from the Chairman and Group Chief Executive.

They do not qualify for performance related bonuses.
The Board as a whole determines the fees of the non-executive Directors, excluding the Chairman.
Hamish Leslie Melville and David Thompson receive additional fees as Chairmen of the Remuneration and Audit Committees respectively.
Duncan Davidson, in his position as Chairman, also has a fully nanced motor vehicle and membership of the Group private medical scheme.
THE AUDITORS ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT ON THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE FOLLOWING PART OF THIS REPORT.
Once again, year-on-year profit has improved signicantly at a time when many of our major competitors saw their profits reduce.
Notwithstanding this excellent performance, maximum bonus levels have not been payable.
As set out in the policy section, annual bonus earned in excess of 200% of base salary is deferred in shares for up to two years.
The Groups dened benefit pension scheme became non contributory on 1 August 2006.
As a result the salaries paid to members of this scheme were reduced by 9% which would have been the members rate of contribution to the scheme.
