The Report will be put to shareholders for approval at the forthcoming AGM.
It also contains additional information required by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and by the Combined Code referred to in the Corporate Governance Report on page 27.
The sections marked with an asterisk have been audited by KPMG Audit Plc.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee, on behalf of the Board, determines the remuneration packages of the Chairman and executive Directors of the Company.
The Committee also monitors the remuneration of the senior management team and supervises the operation of the executive long term incentive schemes.
At the beginning of the financial year, the Committee comprised The Viscount Weir as Chairman, Derek Netherton, Charles Bailey and Michael Sorkin, all of whom were independent non-executive Directors.
During 2005, Viscount Weir and Charles Bailey retired from the Board.
Simon Gulliford joined the Committee following his appointment to the Board as an independent non-executive Director and Michael Sorkin became Chairman of the Committee.
Charles Bailey resigned as a member of the Committee in September 2005.
The membership and terms of reference of the Committee are reviewed at least annually and the terms of reference are available on request and on the Companys website.
Details of the number of meetings of the Committee during the year can be found in the Corporate Governance Report on page 31.
The Company Secretary, Hugh Gladman, acts as Secretary to the Committee, providing advice on corporate governance, legal and regulatory issues and the design and operation of the long term incentive schemes.
At the Committees request, Committee meetings are also attended by other executives, in particular Mark Lund, the Chief Executive and Mike Wilson, the Chairman, who make recommendations to the Committee regarding changes to the remuneration packages of individual Directors or policy generally.
Such recommendations are discussed by the Committee and adopted or amended as the Committee sees fit.
No Director is present at any part of a meeting of the Committee when his own remuneration or contractual terms are being discussed.
The Committee also has access, as required, to professional advice and market data and this was provided by New Bridge Street Consultants LLP NBSC in 2005.
NBSC was appointed by the Committee to provide advice on executive remuneration, long term incentives and other remuneration issues and has not provided any other services to the Company.
37 206697 Report & Accounts Front 20 3 06 7:40 pm Page 38 REMUNERATION REPORT continued Remuneration Policy The Committee applies the principles set out in the Combined Code when setting remuneration policy.
The remuneration policy for 2005 and future years, as approved by the Committee, is designed to ensure that remuneration is sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate executive Directors of sufficient calibre to enable the Group to achieve its business objectives.
When looking at total remuneration salary, pension, fringe benefits, annual bonus and long term incentives, the Committee aims to set salary, pension and fringe benefits at around the median position for companies of similar size in both the UK financial services market although a cross check is also made against companies of a similar size in other sectors, with significant annual bonus and long term incentive awards enhancing an executives potential total remuneration, but only if stretching short term and long term performance targets are achieved.
In this way, the Committee aims to incentivise the Directors to achieve above average results compared with competitor organisations.
The incentive schemes are designed to be retentive in nature as well as linking the value of an award to movements in the share price, in line with shareholder interests.
Based on data provided by NBSC, the Committee considers that approximately 50% of executive Director total remuneration is performance related.
The Chairman, Mike Wilson, is not entitled to participate in the annual bonus scheme.
He does however, participate in the long term incentive schemes, but on the basis that any shares in the Company which vest to Mike Wilson will be retained by him until he ceases to be a Director of the Company, less any shares required to meet a tax liability on vesting.
The Committee has followed the provisions of Schedule A to the Combined Code in designing schemes of performance-related remuneration.
Further details of all of the above elements of remuneration are set out below.
Salaries Salaries are reviewed annually in January, using data on the salaries and benefits for executives of other financial services groups and companies in other sectors of a comparable size to the Company.
The Committee carried out a full review of the salaries of all the executive Directors in February 2006, with the help of data provided by NBSC.
As stated above, the Committee aimed to set salary levels at around the median position for companies of a similar size in both the UK financial services market with a cross check with other sectors with adjustments then being made to take into account the responsibility and accountabilities of each role, the experience of the relevant individual and any other relevant factors.
On this basis, the Committee approved the following salary increases for the executive Directors with effect from 1 January 2006, with a view to the executive Directors fixed benefits salary, pension and fringe benefits when taken together representing around 90-95% of the median, based on the comparator data provided by NBSC.
New Salary Previous Salary Mark Lund 425,000 380,000 David Bellamy 280,000 250,000 Ian Gascoigne 280,000 250,000 Andrew Croft 258,000 230,000 No change was made to Mike Wilsons salary of 500,000 per annum.
38 206697 Report & Accounts Front 20 3 06 7:40 pm Page 39 REMUNERATION REPORT continued The salary increases have been determined after recognising the need to increase salary levels so as to provide broadly competitive fixed benefits.
The increases also recognise the development of the executive Directors and their performance over the years.
Annual Bonus For 2006, as in previous years, the Committee has determined that the maximum annual bonus will be 120% of salary, with half of any bonus earned payable in cash, the remainder being invested in SJPC shares and deferred for 3 years.
The performance targets set by the Committee are based on a sliding scale, to progressively reward incremental performance.
The range of operating profit before tax for the 2006 bonus represents a significant increase from the actual level of operating profit before tax in 2005 and the maximum bonus has been calibrated to ensure that it will only be payable if the Committee considers that outstanding performance has been achieved by the Group and also by the individual Director concerned.
Taking the cash and shares element of the bonus together, up to 80% of salary will be awarded by reference to the performance of the Group, largely based on growth in European Embedded Value operating profit before tax and net growth in the sales force, although the Committee retains the discretion to amend the bonus, up or down, to take into account other relevant factors such as the Groups performance compared with competitor organisations, regulatory issues and completion of other business plan objectives.
Up to a further 40% of salary will be awarded by reference to individual performance and the achievement of personal objectives set at the start of the year.
No executive Director has a contractual right to receive an annual bonus award.
The satisfaction of the targets is assessed by reference to the Companys internal management information systems verified by the Committee, which the Committee believes is the most appropriate method, given the internal nature of the performance targets.
Mike Wilson does not participate in the annual bonus scheme.
The Committee believes that the annual bonus scheme is an effective incentive for the executive Directors, whilst at the same time offering strong retentive characteristics through the deferred element, as well as being aligned with shareholder interests due to the value of the deferred element of the award on vesting being dependent on share price performance.
Long Term Incentive Schemes All UK employees of the Group, including the executive Directors, are eligible to enter into a Save As You Earn SAYE contract, under which they are able to save up to 250 per month, and at the end of the 3 or 5 year savings period acquire shares in the Company at a price not less than 80 per cent of the market price at the date of the invitation to participate.
Since 1997 the Company operated a discretionary share option scheme for executive Directors and senior employees under which options were granted at market value.
At the Annual General Meeting in 2005, shareholders approved a new Performance Share Plan PSP.
This enabled the Committee to make awards of performance shares to the executive Directors for the first time in 2005, rather than grants of share options.
The Committee also adopted shareholding guidelines for the executive Directors in 2005 whereby as and when awards vest under the PSP or other long term incentive schemes, the Directors are required to retain shares to the value of 100% of their salary, less any shares required to pay any tax liability which arises on vesting.
39 206697 Report & Accounts Front 20 3 06 7:40 pm Page 40 REMUNERATION REPORT continued The Committee believes that PSP awards act as a better incentive mechanism for the executive Directors and senior management and are also more retentive, whilst at the same time reducing the accounting costs which would otherwise have been incurred by continuing with share option grants.
The Committee reviewed the grant levels and the performance condition in January 2006 and decided to continue with the existing policy of making annual PSP awards to the executive Directors with a value of 150% of base salary subject to the same mix of EPS and TSR performance conditions as in 2005.
Awards vest after three years subject to the achievement of a performance condition.
For the PSP awards made in 2006, two-thirds of the shares are subject to an earnings growth condition and one-third of the shares are subject to a comparative Total Shareholder Return TSR condition, both measured over a single three-year period.
The Committee believes that this provides an appropriate balance of targets that both incentivise the executives whilst also keeping their interests aligned with those of shareholders.
Earnings per share is calculated by reference to adjusted consolidated profit after tax on the European Embedded Value EEV basis of accounting for both the life and unit trust businesses on a fully diluted per share basis.
The adjustment to the consolidated after tax figures will be to strip out any earnings from Life Assurance Holding Corporation an investment that has been sold, the EEV investment variance and any economic assumption change.
Shareholders will appreciate that these factors are not within the control of management, with the latter two factors combined producing wide variations in reported earnings due to stock market fluctuations.
For the awards made in 2006, the two-thirds of the shares based on earnings will vest if the following growth targets are achieved: Average annual earnings growth Proportion exercisable Below RPI 8% Zero RPI 8% 25% RPI 18% or more 100% Between the above points Pro rata between 25% and 100% A consistent approach will be taken to measuring earnings over any transition period to international accounting standards.
Shareholders will note that the above scale from RPI 8% to 18% represents a lower range of numbers than the earnings condition for awards made in 2005.
However, in the last Remuneration Report the Committee stated as follows: The Committee has set out the initial earnings targets, taking into account the relatively low base point from where the growth targets will be measured.
The Committee will ensure that appropriately demanding targets are set for each award but recognises that this level of growth is unlikely to be appropriate for subsequent awards if profitability recovers strongly and earnings are measured from a much higher base point.
Shareholders will be aware that profitability did recover strongly in 2005 and therefore it was appropriate to lower the earnings scale in 2005, although the Committee believes the revised earnings condition is equally demanding.
40 206697 Report & Accounts Front 20 3 06 7:40 pm Page 41 REMUNERATION REPORT continued For the awards made in 2006, the one third of shares based on TSR will vest as for awards made in 2005 as follows: Companys ranking compared Proportion exercisable to comparator group # at end of performance period Below median Zero Median 25% Upper quartile 100% Between the above points Pro rata Details of the awards made under the PSP are set out on page 45.
# The comparator group comprises: Aberdeen Asset Management, AMVESCAP, Aviva, Bradford & Bingley, Close Brothers, F&C Asset Management, Friends Provident, Henderson Group, Investec, Legal & General, New Star Asset Management, Old Mutual, Prudential, Rathbone Brothers, Resolution, Royal & SunAlliance, Schroders.
These companies were selected by the Committee as a result of having business interests comparable to those of the St. Jamess Place Group.
Pension and Death in Service Benefits In 2005 employer contributions of 17.5% of base salary were made to the money purchase section of the Groups occupational pension scheme for the executive Directors, with the exception of Mark Lund who received a contribution of 15% of base salary due to his shorter period of service with the Group.
The Committee reviewed its policy on pensions in the light of A Day and decided to make no changes to the structure of the pension arrangements for the executive Directors no current executive Directors are affected by the Lifetime Allowance.
However, the comparative data from NBSC showed that the executive Directors were well behind the median position compared to the comparator group and therefore with effect from 1 January 2006 it was decided to increase the employer pension contribution for the executive Directors to 20% of base salary.
As noted in the policy section, this level of pension benefits, taken together with benefits and base salary levels for 2006, provides for fixed elements of pay to be positioned at around 90% of the median of the data provided by NBSC.
The costs of the pension and death in service arrangements for the executive Directors during the year ended 31 December 2005 are shown on pages 44 and 45.
Service Agreements It is the Committees policy that service agreements should generally terminate on the executives 60th birthday and should not contain notice periods in excess of one year.
The terms and conditions of the Directors service agreements are reviewed regularly and all service agreements contain an express obligation on the executive to mitigate his loss in the event the agreement is terminated.
In addition, the Company reserves the right to pay an amount representing the value of salary and benefits in lieu of any outstanding period of notice on a monthly basis so that, should the executive obtain alternative employment during the notice period, the monthly payments can be reduced to take into account any earnings received under the new employment.
41 206697 Report & Accounts Front 20 3 06 7:40 pm Page 42 REMUNERATION REPORT continued When considering the size of any proposed termination payment, the Committee would take into account a number of factors including the health, length of service, age and the performance of the relevant executive, including the duty to mitigate his own loss, with a broad aim to avoid rewarding poor performance while dealing fairly with cases where the departure is due to other reasons, for example illness.
All of the executive Directors have entered into a service agreement with the Company.
Each service agreement can be terminated, inter alia, by either party giving the other not less than twelve months written notice.
The agreements automatically terminate on the 60th birthday of the executive, except that for Mike Wilson his contract terminates on 5 December 2008 or such later date as the parties shall agree.
All the service agreements provide for benefits in kind, including life assurance, pension provision, private health insurance and a company car.
Mike Wilson is also entitled to a chauffeur.
Further details of the service agreements of the executive Directors are provided below: Executive Date of contract Base salary Date contract automatically terminates Mike Wilson 15 May 2002 500,000 5 December 2008 Mark Lund 16 July 2003 425,000 1 July 2017 David Bellamy 15 April 2002 280,000 15 April 2013 Ian Gascoigne 19 March 2003 280,000 7 July 2016 Andrew Croft 1 April 2005 258,000 11 June 2024 Currently, no executive Director acts as a non-executive Director on the Board of another company.
Non-Executive Directors The remuneration of the non-executive Directors is determined by the Board as a whole, within the limits set by the provisions of the Articles of Association.
A basic annual fee of 20,000 per annum is paid to the non-executive Directors, with additional fees being paid in respect of Board Committee and other responsibilities.
The Board reviewed the fees paid to the non-executive Directors in January 2006, in light of the increase in the number of Board and Committee meetings and increased responsibilities due to the new Combined Code and other corporate governance changes.

The term of the appointment of each non-executive Director other than those appointed by HBOS plc pursuant to the Relationship Agreement described more fully on pages 32 and 33 is for 3 years, terminating on the date on which the non-executive Director is required to retire by rotation at the AGM, at which time the appointment will be reviewed by the Board.
Any period of service longer than six years is subject to particularly rigorous review by the Nominations Committee of the Board.
Performance Graph The graph below, prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985, shows a comparison of the Companys TSR performance against the FTSE All-Share index over the last five financial years.
The Company considers this to be the most appropriate comparative index, given the broad nature of the index and the companies within it.

iv For the annual discretionary bonus in 2005, executive Directors could earn up to 80% of salary by reference to Group performance based on growth in operating profit and other business plan targets set at the start of the year.
A further payment of up to 40% of salary could be earned by reference to individual performance, based on personal objectives set at the start of the year and the executives performance generally in 2005.
On this basis, the Committee awarded a bonus of 110% of salary to each of the executive Directors, 50% of which was payable in cash and the remaining 50% used to purchase deferred shares which vest in 3 years.
