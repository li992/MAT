remuneration report Remuneration Committee The members of the Remuneration Committee during the year were Mr K S Beeston joined 8 March 2005 and became Chairman from 5 April 2005, Mr J W Leng Chairman of the committee until 5 April 2005 and member until 13 May 2005, Mr T M Gateley and Mr L Browne.
All of the foregoing were regarded by the Board as independent non-executive directors.
The committee consulted the Companys Chairman on remuneration matters generally and the Chief Executive, Mr M J Lamb, regarding the remuneration of the other executive directors and senior managers.
It also received the advice and services of the Finance Director, Mr T J Slack, the Group Pensions Manager, Mr P Flanagan, and the Company Secretary, Mr J OShea, who acted as secretary to the committee.
Deloitte & Touche LLP was engaged by the committee to provide advice on directors remuneration to the committee and played a central advisory role in relation to a review of incentive arrangements and pensions carried out by the committee.
Deloitte & Touche LLP also attended certain meetings at the request of the committee.
During the year Deloitte & Touche LLP also provided financial and tax consulting services to the Company.
Watson Wyatt LLP was engaged by the committee to report on the impact of the governments proposed changes to the tax regime for occupational pensions.
Watson Wyatt LLP are the actuaries and administrators to the Companys main UK pension fund and also provide pensions advice to the Company.
Non-executive directors remuneration and terms of appointment The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined, after reference to external benchmarks, by the Chairman and the executive directors.
The policy on non-executive remuneration is to pay an appropriate level on a comparative basis for their time and work on the Board and its committees.
They do not participate in any bonus or employee share schemes of the Company and no part of their remuneration is conditional upon the performance of the Company.
The Board has established a shareholding guideline for non-executive directors, each of whom is encouraged to build up a holding of at least 7,500 shares, or 10,000 shares in the case of the Chairman, within twelve months of appointment.
The Chairman and Mr T M Gateley already hold the relevant number of shares and all of the other persons who were non-executive directors at the year end held at least 3,000 shares.
Mr K S Beeston and Mr L Browne held 3,000 and just over 5,000 shares, respectively, at the year end and intend to achieve the target holding during 2006.
The normal period for initial appointment and first renewal is three years.
The appointment of the Chairman runs for an initial three year term.
Appointments are made under a letter of agreement subject to retirement by rotation and removal under the Companys articles of association.
There are no provisions for the Company to give notice or pay compensation in relation to the early termination of the appointment of the Chairman or any non-executive director.
There is a provision in non-executive appointment letters to the effect that a non-executive director is normally expected to give one months prior notice of termination to the Company.
The dates and unexpired terms of the letters of appointment for the non-executive directors, which are available for inspection at the annual general meeting and at the Companys registered office, are as follows: Date of letter of appointment Unexpired term as at 31 December 2005 Mr N B M Askew 28.04.05 2 years 4 months Mr K S Beeston 07.03.05 2 years 2 months Mr L Browne 16.12.04 2 years Mr T M Gateley 16.12.04 10 months Executive directors remuneration and terms of appointment Statement of policy The Company aims to ensure that remuneration generally and incentives in particular provide strong links between individual performance and shareholder interests.
The remuneration policy also recognises that the Company operates in global and highly competitive markets with over three-quarters of its continuing activities outside the UK.
The policy is to provide competitive remuneration packages to attract, motivate, reward and retain executives of the calibre required, and to align their interests with those of shareholders by relating a significant element of the remuneration package to specific performance measures.
The Remuneration Committee considers it to be important to maintain the flexibility to respond to individual circumstances.
However, its normal approach has been to pay salaries within appropriate market competitive ranges, combined with realistic potentials for above market total compensation if performance is outstanding.
Remuneration comprises basic salaries, annual performance bonuses and benefits in kind, pension arrangements and participation in a deferred bonus plan and a performance share plan.
38 Remuneration report remuneration report In setting the remuneration of each executive director, the Remuneration Committee takes into account their role and responsibilities, skills and individual performance and makes reference to market rates as evidenced by published studies and comparisons with international UK-based groups of a similar size and complexity.
In this connection the committee considered market trend data prepared by Deloitte & Touche LLP.
The committee uses such data with caution in view of the risk of an upward ratchet of remuneration levels.
It also has regard to pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group.
During 2005 the committee completed a review of remuneration policy and proposals for new long term incentive arrangements were approved by shareholders at the 2005 annual general meeting.
The new arrangements include a performance share plan and a deferred bonus plan.
The committee believes that these incentive arrangements provide strong alignment with the long term business strategy and shareholders interests as the Company enters a significant new phase in its development and growth.
The aggregate performance based remuneration under the annual bonus arrangements and the long-term incentive arrangements mentioned above represents as a percentage of salary, at the maximum level, 287% for the Chief Executive and 275% for the other executive directors assuming full reinvestment of annual bonuses in the deferred bonus plan, these percentages would increase to 325% and 300% respectively.
The policy of the committee is to set performance conditions which are both stretching and challenging but also reasonably attainable in the environment in which the Company is then operating.
Consistent with the policy on service contracts, the executive directors, Mr M J Lamb, Mr T J Slack, Mr D C Nicholas and Mr W R Whitney, have rolling service contracts subject to termination on one years notice by the Company or the executive.
All such contracts allow the Company to elect to make payment in lieu of notice but do not include any other specific provision for compensation payable upon early termination.
It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee to limit any compensation which might be paid in the event of early termination of an executive directors contract to the legal minima, taking into account mitigation and other relevant factors.
The dates of the contracts and period to normal retirement age for those serving as executive directors during the year are as follows: Date Date of Date of service Notice period Period to normal joined appointment contract retirement age as Group to Board at 31 December 2005 Mr M J Lamb 31.10.86 18.07.96 01.02.99 12 months 15 years Mr T J Slack 05.01.76 01.08.97 01.02.99 12 months 7 months Mr D C Nicholas 08.03.04 08.03.04 08.03.04 12 months 4 years Mr W R Whitney 03.08.87 01.03.04 01.03.04 12 months 3 years 10 months Annual bonus Executive directors are eligible to receive annual performance bonuses.
Maximum bonus is only payable if the challenging targets set by the Remuneration Committee are met.
As disclosed last year, the bonus maximum for 2005 was increased from 60% to 100% of salary in conjunction with the introduction of the new incentive arrangements, which were approved by shareholders at the 2005 AGM.
For 2005 the annual bonus targets related to profit and cash generation.
For 2006, bonus targets will relate to profit, working capital and sales growth.
The executive directors achieved the stretching profit and cash generation targets in full for 2005 and they will therefore each receive bonuses in respect of 2005 of 100% 2004: 57.5%, of which half must be deferred into the Deferred Bonus Plan.
Annual bonuses are non-pensionable in the case of all executive directors.
The auditor reviewed the computation of the annual bonus payments and confirmed to the committee that it was calculated correctly.
"Long term incentive arrangements The Deferred Bonus Plan ""DBP"" runs in conjunction with the annual bonus plan for executive directors and was approved by shareholders at the 2005 annual general meeting following consultation with major shareholders and institutional investor representative bodies."
"Under the DBP, one half of each executive director's earned annual bonus more if they wish will be mandatorily deferred for three years and delivered in shares in the Company ""Deferred Shares""."
The executive may also elect to voluntarily defer all or part of the remaining 50%, and again receive Deferred Shares.
Additional shares, in the form of a matching award, may be earned to a maximum of 100% of the number of Deferred Shares or 125% for the Chief Executive if stretching performance conditions are met by the Company over the three year deferral period.
It is intended that the first awards, to be made in 2006, will be subject to economic profit based performance conditions.
Economic profit was chosen as the performance measure because it combines profitability with return on capital in a single measure and is being used across the Group as a management decision-making tool.
The economic profit performance conditions for any awards made in 2006 will be disclosed in next year's remuneration report.
"39 IMI plc Annual Report 2005 remuneration report continued The first awards under the Performance Share Plan ""PSP"" were made in 2005 and provide share based awards worth up to the normal policy maximum of 100% of annual salary."
The closing mid-market share price on the date of award was 388.67p.
Details of the awards are contained in the table of Directors Awards on page 45.
The vesting of awards is subject to the satisfaction of stretching performance conditions over a three year period.
"For awards granted in 2005, one half is subject to earnings per share ""EPS"" performance conditions and the other to comparative total shareholder return ""TSR"" with a financial underpin as further explained below."
For PSP awards granted in 2005, TSR performance is measured against a comparator group over a three-year period.
TSR is well understood and accepted as a performance measure for long term incentives and links rewards to shareholder value.
The comparator group for the relative TSR was chosen by reference to the companies' size, internationality and industry sector relative to IMI and comprises: Aga Foodservice BBA Group Bodycote Cobham Cookson Group Enodis FKI Halma Hanson Johnson Matthey Meggitt Morgan Crucible Pilkington Rexam Rotork Spirax-Sarco Tomkins Weir Group Wolseley If, at the end of the three-year period, the Company is ranked median in the comparator group, then 30% of the TSR-dependant awards will vest.
If the Company is ranked at the point between median and upper quartile i. e. at the 62.5th percentile, 55% of the TSR-dependant awards will vest.
If the Company is ranked in the upper quartile top 25% of the comparator group, then the TSR-dependant awards will vest in full.
Awards will vest on a straight line basis if the Company's TSR performance is between these points.
If the Company's TSR performance is below the median, the TSR dependant awards will lapse without retesting.
To ensure that TSR improvement reflects improvement in the underlying performance of the Company the Remuneration Committee also imposed a financial underpin.
"No PSP awards will vest unless the compound annual earnings per share growth exceeds inflation measured against the Retail Price Index, or ""RPI"" by at least 3% per annum during the three-year performance period."
The performance condition for the second 50% of the 2005 PSP awards was based on the Company's compound annual earnings per share growth above RPI over a three-year period.
EPS was chosen as an appropriate measure which rewards absolute growth in underlying earnings and because the committee believed it works well in combination with TSR which is a comparative measure.
The Remuneration Committee sets the EPS targets in respect of each annual award at the level it considers appropriately stretching given the conditions in which the Company is operating.
In respect of the EPS-dependent element of the 2005 PSP award, 30% will vest if compound annual earnings per share growth exceeds RPI by 3%.
If the Company's compound annual earnings per share growth is 15% higher than RPI, then the EPS-dependant awards will vest in full.
Awards will vest on a straight line basis if the Company's EPS growth is between these points.
Awards lapse without retesting as to this element and also the TSR-dependant portion if EPS growth is below RPI plus 3%.
The EPS targets for the 2005 PSP awards were set to exclude the impact of the Polypipe Group which was sold during 2005.
During the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS, to the extent that any material adjustments are considered appropriate to ensure a like for like comparison, these will be reviewed and agreed by the auditor.
Executive directors who are eligible to participate in the DBP and the PSP, will be encouraged to acquire and maintain a shareholding in the Company with a value equal to 100% of their annual salary, by June 2008.
The Chief Executive and Finance Director both attained the required holdings during the year.
Legacy incentive arrangements Expired share option schemes Executive share options were last awarded to executive directors in 2004 under the Executive Share Option 1995 Scheme which expired in May 2005.
Inland Revenue Approved and Unapproved Options granted under the Executive Share Option 1995 Scheme before September 2001 became exercisable during the year for the first time due to growth in EPS for the previous three years being greater than RPI plus 6%.
Options granted under this scheme after September 2001 were subject to stretching tiered performance conditions related to growth in earnings per share above inflation over a fixed period of three financial years as further described below.
For options granted over shares representing one times salary, vesting required growth in earnings per share of at least 6% above the rate of increase in the RPI over a three year performance period.
This hurdle doubled to 12% growth above RPI for awards representing between one and two times salary, and the hurdle was 24% for awards of between two and three times salary.
The Remuneration Committee had a policy of awarding annual share option grants to executive directors of up to two times salary to executive directors and up to three times salary for the Chief Executive.
Details of directors' share options are set out on page 45.
40 Remuneration report remuneration report Options were priced at full market value without discount.
There is no retesting of performance conditions and options will therefore lapse if applicable performance conditions are not met in the relevant three year performance period.
All options granted in 2003 will become exercisable in 2006 as, when measured on a like for like basis, EPS growth over the three year performance period ending 31 December 2005 was in excess of RPI plus 24%.
The method adopted to assess whether performance conditions attached to options under the Executive Share Option 1995 Scheme were satisfied by reference to earnings per share for the three years ended 31 December 2005, was based on IFRS reported adjusted earnings per share for 2005 including discontinued businesses.
The auditor reviewed the earnings per share computation and confirmed to the committee that the adjustments made were fair and reasonable.
Legacy long term incentive plan LTIP The last LTIP awards were made to executive directors in 2005 as part of the transition to the new long term incentive arrangements.
The LTIP allowed cash awards to senior executives, including executive directors, up to a maximum potential value of 50% of salary for each year of participation.
The policy was to make an annual LTIP award to each executive director subject to performance conditions related to the economic profit of the Group as a whole over a period of three years.
As with executive share options, awards lapse without retesting if targets are not met in the relevant three year period.
Economic profit is based on the net operating profit after tax of the Group derived from the audited financial statements and adjusted for acquisition goodwill.
The published results based on UK GAAP were used as the reference point each year except that IFRS was adopted for 2005.
At the end of the performance period, the net of tax value of any LTIP payments earned by eligible executive directors is to be invested in market purchases of the Companys ordinary shares pursuant to a deferred share plan.
Such share purchases are made through an employee trust and, if held for a further three year period, an executive director will receive a matching award of one additional share for every four.
The first LTIP awards to executive directors lapsed in 2003 because economic profit in the performance period was 13m below the level required for any vesting to occur.
Executive director LTIP awards maturing in 2004 also lapsed because economic profit during the three year performance period was 4m below the minimum required for any vesting to occur however Mr W R Whitney held an LTIP award granted prior to his appointment as an executive director in respect of which pro-rata vesting was achieved by reference to local targets for Retail Dispense.
The LTIP awards maturing in 2005 will result in vesting worth 36% of 2005 salary against a target maximum economic profit of 82m save that vesting will be 24% of salary for Mr W R Whitney, whose service in 2003 was targeted in respect of his Retail Dispense responsibilities prior to appointment as an executive director and no 2003 awards were made to Mr D C Nicholas, whose service commenced in 2004.
SAYE plan The Company operates an Inland Revenue approved savings-related share option scheme which is open to the majority of the Groups UK employees, including the UK-based executive directors, and allows the grant of options to all participants at a discount of up to 20 per cent below the market price.
Such schemes are not subject to performance conditions and offer tax incentives to encourage employees to use their own money to purchase shares in their employers business or group.
All Employee Share Ownership Plan The UK-based executive directors also participate in an All Employee Share Ownership Plan which is open to the majority of the Groups UK employees.
In May 2006 shares to a value equal to the lesser of 3,000 and 1.2% of each participants basic salary will be acquired at market value by the trustee of the plan in respect of their participation during 2005.
The plan is not operated subject to specific performance conditions but the level of shares awarded to participating employees is set taking into account performance, in particular that of the UK operations of the Group.
Each of the UK-based executive directors also participates in the plan by making the maximum contribution from their salary towards partnership shares under the plan.
Up to two matching shares may be awarded for every one partnership share acquired under the plan although the policy to date has been not to award any matching shares.
Save as indicated below, the remainder of this report has been audited.
Pension entitlement UK-based executive directors participate in the IMI Pension Fund.
Their normal retirement age under the Fund is 60, although they may elect to retire and receive a pension at any time after age 57 without a discount.
On death a dependants pension is provided equal to two-thirds of the members pension.
If death occurs in the first five years of retirement a lump sum is also paid equal to the balance of five years pension payments.
Pensions in payment, in excess of any guaranteed minimum pension, are increased each year in line with price inflation up to a maximum of 5%, in respect of pension built up before 1 January 2006, and 2.5% in respect of pension built up after 1 January 2006.
Mr D C Nicholas was also a member of an unfunded unapproved defined contribution arrangement during the year.
Notional contributions of 47,513 were credited to Mr D C Nicholas in the period 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2005 2004 : 37,147 and the notional value of the accumulated contributions as at 31 December 2005 was 88,152 2004: 37,819.
With effect from April 2006 the taxation arrangements for occupational pension schemes in the UK is changing.
As a result of this the Remuneration Committee has decided to provide UK-based executive directors with the choice of remaining in the UK scheme for future service or opting out and either building up benefits in a new employer-financed defined benefits retirement scheme or receiving a cash allowance instead of pension benefits.
41 IMI plc Annual Report 2005 remuneration report continued Pension entitlement continued These alternative arrangements have been devised on the basis that they are broadly cost neutral to the Company, whilst also recognising the need to honour the Companys previous commitment to defined benefit arrangements for serving executives.
The policy regarding new appointments will be flexible to take account of the individual position, the cost of pension arrangements to the Company, including in particular the cost of defined benefits, and the alternative forms of pension provision.
Mr Whitney is a USA-based executive director and during the year was a member of two arrangements in the USA.
The first was a defined contribution arrangement, the Savings Investment Plan.
In the period from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2005 employer contributions of 4,621 were made to this plan 2004: 4,030.
The second was a defined benefit arrangement, the IMI Americas Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.
His pension payable from age 60 will be 60% of basic salary less any pension from the employers contributions to the defined contribution plan and an amount representing the Social Security Primary Insurance payable.
There are no post retirement increases provided under the plan.
No dependants pension is payable on death after retirement unless Mr Whitney opts for a reduced members pension with such an attaching dependants pension at least one year prior to retirement.
On death prior to retirement a dependant's pension, equal to the member's pension, is payable.
Details of the pension benefits earned in the IMI Pension Fund or the IMI Americas Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan are summarised in the following table: Name Age at Pensionable Accrued Increase Increase Transfer Transfer Difference Value of 31.12.05 service pension in accrued in pension value of value of between increase to 31.12.05 at pension over the accrued accrued transfer in accrued 31.12.05 over the year pension pension values at pension at year net of at at 31.12.04 31.12.05 inflation 31.12.05 31.12.04 and net of 31.12.05 inflation 000 pa 000 pa 000 pa 000 000 000 000 M J Lamb 45 19 219 25 19 2,295 1,919 376 199 T J Slack 59 30 231 19 12 5,053 4,508 545 263 D C Nicholas 56 2 6 3 3 139 55 84 65 W R Whitney 56 18 103 49 47 1,006 470 536 459 The accrued pension benefits at the end of the year represent the annual deferred pension to which each executive director would have been entitled had he left service at the end of the year.
This is based on completed pensionable service and pensionable earnings at the relevant date.
The increase in the accrued pension during the year reflects the completion of a further years pensionable service and the increase in pensionable earnings, both before and after inflation.
During 2005 there have been no changes to pension benefit arrangements in place at the start of the year.
The above figures exclude any benefits from the executive directors' voluntary contributions.
Transfer values calculated in accordance with the guidance note GN11 published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries are also shown in the table.
A transfer value is the estimated capital value of the future pension payments in retirement.
Under the method and assumptions used by the Company to account for the costs associated with its defined benefit pension schemes see note 20, the aggregate value of the accrued benefits as at 31 December 2005 for the executive directors was 13.11 million 2004: 9.77 million.

Remuneration shown above as salaries for non-executive directors includes fees of 134,166 2004: 72,000.
No compensation for loss of office was paid to or receivable by any director in 2005.
Benefits in kind provided to executive directors consist of the provision of a fully expensed motor car for all except Mr M J Lamb and Mr D C Nicholas, who elected for a cash alternative scheme, and private health care arrangements.
External appointments Executive directors may accept one external appointment with the consent of the Board, and are normally allowed to retain fees from external non-executive directorships.
Currently, Mr M J Lamb is a non-executive director of Spectris plc, which paid him remuneration of 35,000 in 2005.

Awards potentially vest in March of the year following the performance period end date shown above.
References in the above table to salary are to annual salary for the final year of the relevant performance period.
If and when any award vests in future years, the net amount payable to eligible executive directors will be used to purchase shares at the market prices that then apply pursuant to the linked deferred share plan.
Directors share awards Options were granted during 2005 under the Performance Share Plan although for Mr W R Whitney, a US-based executive director the award was structured as a deferred share award rather than a nil cost option.
Since 2004 no executive share options have been granted to executive directors under the IMI Executive Share Option 1995 Scheme.
Relevant details are shown below in the table of share options and share awards.
e 50% of award based on comparative TSR with an EPS underpin with vesting at median 30% vests to upper quartile full vesting and 50% based on EPS growth of between 3% 30% vests to 15% full vesting above RPI.
Notional gains on share options exercised shown in the table above are based on the mid-market price at the date of exercise.
The closing price of the Companys ordinary shares at 30 December 2005 was 503p per share and the price range during the year was 386p to 503p.
45 IMI plc Annual Report 2005 remuneration report continued Directors' interests and shareholding guidelines All of the executive directors hold interests in the ordinary shares of the Company as detailed below and, in line with a policy adopted in 2005, all are expected to build holdings equivalent in value to one years salary by June 2008.
All of the persons who were non-executive directors at the year end held shares in the Company and during 2005 the Board set a shareholding guideline as set out on page 38 which it encourages non-executive directors to meet within twelve months of appointment.
