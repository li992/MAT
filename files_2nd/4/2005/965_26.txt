Remuneration Committee 1.1 Role of the Remuneration Committee and terms of reference The Remuneration Committee the Committee is responsible for considering and making recommendations to the Board on: the Companys general policy on executive and senior management remuneration: the specific remuneration packages for executive directors of the Company, including basic salary, performance-based short and long term incentives, pensions and other benefits: and the design and operation of the Companys share incentive schemes.
The full Terms of Reference of the Committee can be found on the Anglo American website www.
co. uk and copies are available on request.
The Committee met three times during 2005.
1.2 Membership of the Committee The Committee comprised the following independent non-executive directors during the year ended 31 December 2005: Rob Margetts chairman : David Challen: Chris Fay: and Fred Phaswana.
The Companys chairman and the chief executive attend the Committee meetings by invitation and assist the Committee in its considerations, except when issues relating to their own compensation are discussed.
No directors are involved in deciding their own remuneration.
In 2005, the Committee was advised by Russell King and Chris Corrin Group Human Resources and the Companys Finance function.
It also took external advice from: Advisers Services provided to the Committee Other services provided to the Company Monks Partnership Appointed by the Company, with the a subsidiary of agreement of the Committee, to provide  LLP market remuneration data  LLP Appointed by the Company, with the Investment advisers, actuaries and auditors for agreement of the Committee, to provide various pension schemes: advisors on internal specialist valuation services audit projects and the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards: taxation and payroll advice Linklaters Appointed by the Company, with the Legal advice on certain corporate matters agreement of the Committee, to provide legal advice on long term incentives and directors service contracts Hewitt Bacon and Woodrow LLP Appointed by the Company, with the Investment advisers and actuaries for various agreement of the Committee, to advise pension schemes on the pension arrangements of executive directors Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited Engaged by the Committee to review Investment advisers and actuaries for various the Committees processes on an annual pension schemes basis, in order to provide shareholders with assurance that the remuneration processes the Committee has followed are in line with the stated policy as set out below and that the Committee has operated within its Terms of Reference Deloitte & Touche LLP In their capacity as Group auditors, Deloitte undertakes an audit of sections 10 and 11 of the remuneration report annually.

Anglo American plc Annual Report 2005 | 25 Remuneration report continued 2.
Remuneration policy on executive directors remuneration The Companys remuneration policy is formulated to attract and retain high-calibre executives and motivate them to develop and implement the Companys business strategy in order to optimise long term shareholder value creation.
It is the intention that this policy should conform to best practice standards and that it will continue to apply for 2006 and subsequent years, subject to ongoing review as appropriate.
The policy is framed around the following key principles: total rewards will be set at levels that are sufficiently competitive to enable the recruitment and retention of high-calibre executives: total incentive-based rewards will be earned through the achievement of demanding performance conditions consistent with shareholder interests: incentive plans, performance measures and targets will be structured to operate soundly throughout the business cycle: the design of long term incentives will be prudent and will not expose shareholders to unreasonable financial risk: in considering the market positioning of reward elements, account will be taken of the performance of the Company and of the individual executive director: and reward practice will conform to best practice standards as far as reasonably practicable.
Representatives of the Companys principal investors are consulted on changes to remuneration policy.
Elements of executive director remuneration 3.1 Remuneration mix Each executive directors total remuneration consists of salary, annual bonus, long term incentives and benefits.
An appropriate balance is maintained between fixed and performance-related remuneration and between elements linked to short term financial performance and those linked to longer term shareholder value creation.
Assuming on-target performance, the Committees policy is that at least 50% 60% for the chief executive or more of total executive director remuneration is performance-related.
In 2005, 69% of the chief executives remuneration on an expected-value basis was performance-related: 1 for the other executive directors, on average, the figure was 60% see illustrative charts below.
31% n Fixed n Fixed 33% 33% n Performance-related n Performance-related 40% annual bonus annual bonus n Performance-related n Performance-related long term incentives long term incentives 27% 36% CEO expected values Average other executive directors expected values The Bonus Share Plan BSP and the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP are designed to align the longer term interests of shareholders and executives and to underpin the Companys performance culture.
The Committee monitors the relevance and appropriateness of the performance measures and targets applicable to both plans.
Following a review of these measures, the Committee has decided to make an adjustment to the LTIP performance condition for awards made from 2005 onwards.
The proposed changes are described in detail in the section of this report describing the LTIP on pages 28 and 29.
As in previous years, LTIP awards are divided, so that 50% of the award is based on Return on Capital Employed ROCE targets and 50% is based on Total Shareholder Return TSR against selected peer groups of companies.
The changes to the LTIP apply only to the portion of the award that depends on TSR.
The ROCE element of the award has remained unchanged for 2005, although the Committee intends to review the effectiveness of this element of the LTIP next year following a wider review of operational performance metrics across the business.
In summary, the changes are as follows: to reflect the Companys diverse shareholder base, which includes both sector and balanced fund investors, one half of the TSR condition will now measure performance against the FTSE 100, with the remaining half measuring performance against a sector group, as now: and the definition of above-target performance levels for the sector comparator group will be adjusted to avoid problems arising from the distorting effect of single-commodity companies.
In combination, these changes will better ensure that the TSR measure reflects the Companys status as a diversified resources company, that the measure will operate soundly throughout the business cycle and that the LTIP remains relevant and motivational for participants and rewards the creation of long term shareholder value.
1 Based on expected value of share-based awards.
26 | Anglo American plc Annual Report 2005 3.2 Basic salary The basic salary of the executive directors is reviewed annually and is targeted at the median of companies of comparable size, market sector, business complexity and international scope.
Company performance, individual performance and changes in responsibilities are also taken into consideration in setting salary levels each year.
3.3 Bonus Share Plan The BSP was first operated in 2004 and all executive directors except for those within one year of their anticipated retirement date are normally eligible to participate in it.
Barry Davison, however, did receive awards under the BSP and under the LTIP during 2005 because, at the time of the awards, it was anticipated that he would be requested to continue in employment after his contractual retirement date.
The BSP requires executive directors to invest a significant proportion of their remuneration in shares, thereby more closely aligning their interests with those of shareholders, and encourages management at all levels to build up a meaningful personal stake in the Company.
Awards under the BSP are made annually and consist of three elements: a performance-related cash element, Bonus Shares as a conditional award to a value equal to the cash element and an additional performance-related element in the form of Enhancement Shares.
These bonus awards are not pensionable.
The BSP operates as follows: the value of the bonus is calculated by reference to achievement against annual performance targets which include measures of corporate and, where applicable, business unit performance as well as the achievement of specific individual objectives.
For executive directors, the corporate element is based on stretching Earnings Per Share EPS targets which are calculated using underlying earnings reconciled in note 11 of the financial statements.
The key individual objectives are designed to support the Companys strategic priorities and in 2005 included safety improvement, strategy implementation, production growth, people management, cost reduction and operational performance: the Committee reviews these measures annually to ensure they remain appropriate and sufficiently stretching in the context of the economic and performance expectations for the Company and its operating businesses: it has been the Committees usual policy to base 70% of each annual bonus award on the corporate or business measure and the remaining 30% on key personal performance measures.
However, given the importance of recent strategy announcements to the overall objectives of members of the executive team, the Committee has decided that a greater weighting be given to key personal performance measures during 2006.
The level of bonuses payable will be reduced if certain overall safety improvement targets are not met.
Bonus parameters are set on an individual basis: in the case of the directors and top tier of management, half of the bonus is payable in cash.
From 2006, the cash element has been adjusted to a maximum of 90% from 75% of basic salary in the case of the chief executive and to 75% from 60% of basic salary for the other executive directors to sustain a competitive market position with companies of a similar size and complexity.
The maximum bonus would only be paid for meeting targets which, in the opinion of the Committee, represent and exceptional performance for the Group and take account of the increased bonus potential.
The other half of the bonus is in the form of a conditional award of Bonus Shares equal in value to the cash element.
These Bonus Shares vest only if the participant remains in employment with the Group until the end of a three-year holding period or is regarded by the Committee as a good leaver: and in order to provide continuing focus on medium term performance, executive directors also receive a conditional award of Enhancement Shares at the same time as the award of Bonus Shares.
The maximum potential, at face value, of the Enhancement Shares is 75% of the face value of the Bonus Shares i. e. in the case of the CEO a maximum of 68% of basic salary.
Awards of Enhancement Shares made in 2005 will vest after three years only to the extent that a challenging performance condition real EPS growth, based on earnings per share growth against growth in the UK Retail Price Index RPI is met, as shown below: 75% 33% 0% RPI RPI RPI RPI RPI RPI RPI 0% 3% 6% 9% 12% 15% 18% Real EPS growth over three years Vesting of Enhancement Shares Real EPS growth is viewed as the most appropriate performance measure for this element of the plan because it is a fundamental financial performance indicator, both internally and externally, and links directly to the Companys long term objective of improving earnings.
The targets have been approved by the Committee after reviewing industry performance over a number of years and have been set at a level which provides stretching performance levels for management.
At the end of each performance period, the level of performance achieved and the proportion of awards vesting will be published in the subsequent remuneration report.
As presaged in the 2004 report, during 2005 the participation in the BSP was extended to other senior management globally below the top tier of management totalling some 1,400 individuals who were formerly eligible to participate in the Companys Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2005 | 27 Additional percentage of Bonus Shares acquired Remuneration report continued 3.4 Share option and all employee schemes No share options were granted to executive directors under the Companys Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS in 2005 and there is no intention to make future grants under the ESOS to executive directors.
However, the ESOS is being retained as noted upon the introduction of the BSP in 2004 for use in special circumstances relating to the recruitment or retention of key executives.
Executive directors remain eligible to participate in the Companys Save As You Earn SAYE and Share Incentive Plan SIP schemes.
As these schemes are offered to all UK employees, performance conditions do not apply to them.
3.5 Long Term Incentive Plan Grant levels Conditional LTIP awards continue to be made annually to executive directors.
The maximum grant level under the LTIP is 200% of basic salary.
It is anticipated that in 2006, grants under the LTIP will be made at 200% of basic salary for the chief executive and 175% for the other directors.
The Committee is content that the performance conditions that need to be satisfied for these awards to vest in full are sufficiently stretching in the context of the award levels.
In determining annual award levels, the Committee also gives consideration to market competitiveness and has set the levels taking account of median expected value of long term incentives relative to other companies of a similar size.
These awards are discretionary and considered on a case-by-case basis.
Performance measures As in previous years, vesting of the LTIP awards made during 2005 is subject to the achievement of stretching performance targets, relating to TSR and to an operating measure, currently return on capital employed ROCE, over a fixed three year period.
Half of each award is subject to a Group TSR measure while the other half is subject to a Group ROCE measure.
These performance measures were selected on the basis that they clearly foster the creation of shareholder value and their appropriateness is kept under review by the Committee.
At the end of each performance period, the level of ROCE performance achieved and the level of award earned will be published in the subsequent remuneration report.
There is no retesting of performance.
The LTIP closely aligns the interests of shareholders and executive directors by rewarding superior shareholder return and financial performance and by encouraging executives to build up a shareholding in the Company.
Total shareholder return The Committee considers comparative TSR to be a suitable long term performance measure for the Companys LTIP awards.
Executives benefit only if shareholders have enjoyed returns on their investment which are superior to those that could have been obtained in other comparable companies.
For awards made prior to and including 2004, vesting of the TSR part of the LTIP varies according to the Companys TSR over the performance period relative to a weighted basket of international resources companies the Sector Index.
For reasons described under Remuneration Policy above, for awards made from 2005 onwards, the TSR performance condition has been modified.
The portion of each award that is based on TSR will now be measured 50% against the Sector Index and 50% against the constituents of the FTSE 100.
As a result of these changes, maximum vesting on the TSR element of an award will only be possible if Anglo American outperforms by a substantial margin both the sector benchmark and the largest UK companies across all sectors.
To achieve maximum vesting for the whole LTIP award the Company would in addition have to exceed demanding ROCE targets.
This represents an extremely challenging set of performance hurdles.
Sector Index comparison One half of the TSR element of an LTIP award vests according to the Companys TSR over the performance period, relative to a weighted basket of international natural resource companies the Sector Index.
The Sector Index comprises three categories: the first consists of five international diversified mining companies, the second of four international paper and packaging companies, and the third of four international industrial minerals companies.
The Committee may amend the list of comparator companies in the Sector Index, and relative weightings, if circumstances make this necessary for example, as a result of takeovers or mergers of comparator companies.
In calculating TSR it is assumed that all dividends are reinvested.
For awards made in 2005, the companies constituting the Sector Index were as follows: Mining Paper and Packaging Industrial Minerals Category weighting 80% 12% 8% Comparator companies BHP Billiton plc Sappi Limited CRH plc Falconbridge Limited SCA Hanson plc Rio Tinto plc Stora Enso Oyj Holcim Limited Vedanta Resources plc UPM-Kymmene Group Lafarge Xstrata plc Target performance for the Sector Index is assessed by calculating the median TSR performance within each sub-sector category, and then weighting these medians by the category weightings shown above.
28 | Anglo American plc Annual Report 2005 Shares contingent on the Sector Index element of the TSR performance will vest as follows: The Companys relative TSR compared to the Sector Index % Proportion of TSR element vesting Below target 0 Target matching the weighted median of the Sector Index 20 Target plus 5% per annum 50 Target plus 7.5% per annum or above 75 Shares will vest on a straight-line basis for performance between the levels shown in the table above.
FTSE 100 Comparison The vesting of the other half of the TSR element of an LTIP award will depend on the Companys TSR performance over the performance period compared with the constituents of the FTSE 100 Index, as follows: The Companys relative TSR compared to the FTSE 100 % Proportion of TSR element vesting Below the median TSR of the FTSE 100 0 Equal to the median TSR of the FTSE 100 20 Equal to the 90th percentile TSR of the FTSE 100 50 Above the 90th percentile TSR of the FTSE 100 75 Shares will vest on a straight-line basis for performance between the levels shown in the table above.
The targets above were calibrated so that for the TSR element of the award in its totality there is approximately a 10% chance of achieving full vesting and a 25% chance of two-thirds vesting.
These probabilities were assessed by  LLP using the same Monte Carlo model used for calculating fair values of the LTIP under IFRS 2 Share-based payments.
The estimated average fair value of an award under the TSR element is 48% of the value of shares awarded.
Graphs showing the Companys TSR performance against the weighted average of the Sector Index and against the FTSE 100 for the five years from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2005 can be found on page 32.
Return on capital employed Group ROCE is the second performance measure for LTIP grants.
The Board considers this to be among the most important factors which drive sustainable improvements in shareholder value in a natural resources business, as well as one of the most important measures of differentiation in performance in this sector.
The proportion of shares vesting based on Group ROCE will vary according to the degree of improvement in the Groups average annualised ROCE over the performance period.
The Committee sets minimum targets for improvement in returns on both capital employed for the financial year preceding the start of the performance period existing capital employed and on the additional capital employed during the performance period incremental capital employed.
The maximum ROCE targets are based on stretching levels of return on the existing capital employed.
The targets for each element of the LTIP conditionally awarded in 2005 are shown below.
These are adjusted for movements in commodity prices, certain foreign exchange rate effects, capital in progress and for relevant changes in the composition of the Group.
Existing capital employed Incremental capital employed Minimum ROCE Target 17.65% 11% Maximum ROCE Target 19.65% 11% The ROCE elements of the award vest as shown in the table below: Proportion of ROCE element vesting Below or equal to the Minimum Target 0% Equal to or greater than the Maximum Target 100% Shares will vest on a straight-line basis for performance between the Minimum Target and the Maximum Target.
3.6 Vesting of share incentives in the event of change of control or termination of employment In the event of a change of control of the Company, the following provisions apply under the Companys incentive plans: share options granted under the former ESOS may be exercised irrespective of whether the applicable performance conditions have been met: the number of shares that vest under the LTIP will be calculated by reference to the extent to which the applicable performance conditions have been met at the time of the change of control: Bonus Shares awarded under the Bonus Share Plan will be released, but Enhancement Shares awarded under that plan will vest at the end of the performance period, to the extent that the applicable performance conditions have been satisfied: SAYE options may be exercised to the extent of savings at the date of exercise : and participants may direct the SIP trustee as to how to deal with their SIP shares although Matching Shares may be forfeited in some circumstances.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2005 | 29 Remuneration report continued In the event that a directors employment is terminated, vesting of outstanding share options is dependent upon the reasons the contract is terminated.
Performance conditions fall away in the event of redundancy.
However, if the executive resigns voluntarily, then all options lapse unless the Committee determines otherwise.
In the case of LTIP interests, if a director resigns voluntarily, then his interests lapse.
If he is made redundant, vesting at the end of the performance period is based on the normal performance criteria and then pro rated for the proportion of the performance period for which the director served.
In the case of the Bonus Share Plan, if a director ceases to be employed before the end of the year in respect of which the annual performance targets apply, then no award will be made unless the Committee determines otherwise taking into account the proportion of the year for which the director was an employee of the Group and of performance to date against the annual performance targets at the date of cessation.
If a director resigns before the end of the three-year vesting period, the Bonus Share awards lapse and the Enhancement Shares are forfeited.
If a director is made redundant, Bonus Share awards will be transferred as soon as practicable after the date of leaving and the Enhancement Shares will vest at the end of the performance period, to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
3.7 Employee Share Ownership Trust The Group established an Employee Share Ownership Trust in 1999 to acquire and hold shares to facilitate the operation of the Companys share schemes.
As at 31 December 2005, the trust held 37,700,131 ordinary shares in the Company, registered in the name of Greenwood Nominees Limited.
Shares held by the trust are not voted at the Companys general meetings.
3.8 Pensions Pension and life insurance benefits for executive directors reflect practice in the countries in which they perform their principal duties.
Pension arrangements are tailored to take account of historical obligations and, insofar as agreed by the Committee, the personal circumstances of each executive.
Details of individual pension arrangements are set out on pages 37 and 38.
The Committee has considered the impact on UK pension arrangements of the new UK pensions regime which will apply from 6 April 2006.
The Committee has decided that should an executive director request that his contract be altered for service after 6 April 2006 so that further pension benefits are reduced or cease to accrue, a pension allowance would be paid to him at the same value as his defined contribution benefits forgone.
Similarly, the Committee has decided that it will consider requests from executive directors that their contracts be altered for future service, so that supplementary pension contributions are made into their defined contribution pension arrangements, in return for the executive directors giving up their right to part of their future basic salary and or cash element of the BSP.
3.9 Other benefits Executive directors are entitled to the provision of either a car allowance or a fully expensed car, medical insurance, death and disability insurance, social club membership in accordance with local market practice, limited personal taxation financial advice and reimbursement of reasonable business expenses.
Directors based in South Africa are eligible to receive housing loan subsidies at a preferential interest rate in accordance with local market practice.
The provision of these benefits is considered to be market-competitive in the appropriate locality for executive director positions.
Executive shareholding targets Within five years of their appointment, executive directors are expected to acquire a holding of shares with a value of two times basic salary in the case of the chief executive and one times basic salary in the case of other executive directors.
The Committee takes into consideration achievement against these targets when making grants under the various long term incentive plans.
At 31 December 2005, all directors with more than one years service on the Board had met or exceeded their shareholding targets.
External appointments Executive directors are not permitted to hold external directorships or offices without the approval of the Board: if approved, they may each retain the fees payable from one such appointment.
During the year ended 31 December 2005, Barry Davison and Ren Mdori retained fees from one such appointment each, amounting to 16,000 and 26,000 respectively.
Policy on non-executive directors remuneration Non-executive directors remuneration is approved by the Board as a whole on the recommendation of the chairman and executive directors.
The Companys policy on non-executive directors remuneration is based on the following key principles: Remuneration should be: sufficient to attract and retain world-class non-executive talent: consistent with recognised best practice standards for non-executive directors remuneration: in the form of cash fees, but with the flexibility to forgo all or part of such fees to acquire shares in the Company if the non-executive director so wishes after deduction of applicable income tax and social security contributions : and set by reference to the responsibilities taken on by the non-executives in chairing the Board and its committees.
Non-executive directors may not participate in the Companys BSP, share option schemes, LTIP or pension arrangements.
The Board reviews non-executive directors fees periodically to ensure they remain market-competitive.
Additional fees are paid to the chairmen of Board committees and to the senior independent director.
Where non-executive directors have Executive Board roles within subsidiaries of the Company, then they may also receive additional remuneration on account of these increased responsibilities.
With the exception of Bobby Godsell, who is remunerated by AngloGold Ashanti Limited in his capacity as its chief executive, none of the non-executive directors has any such role.
30 | Anglo American plc Annual Report 2005 7.
Chairmans fees The chairmans fees are reviewed periodically on a different cycle from the review of non-executive directors fees.
A recommendation is then made to the Board in the absence of the chairman by the Committee and chief executive, who take external advice on market comparators.
Directors service contracts It is the Companys policy that the period of notice for executive directors will not exceed 12 months.
In order to properly reflect their spread of responsibilities, Tony Trahar and David Hathorn have contracts with Anglo American International IOM Limited and with Anglo Operations Limited.
The salaries under these contracts are payable in sterling and or South African rand as appropriate.
Ren Mdori is employed by Anglo American International IOM Limited and Simon Thompson is employed by Anglo American Services UK Limited.
The employment contracts of all executive directors are terminable at 12 months notice by either party.

Details of those retiring by rotation this year are contained in the notice of AGM.
In addition, a director may at any AGM retire from office and stand for re-election.
2 Tony Lea resigned as finance director with effect from 01 September 2005.
In addition, he resigned from the Board with effect from 30 December 2005, although he remains an employee, and has indicated his intention to retire from the Company at the end of March 2006.
The contract of Tony Trahar contains a provision that sets out the compensation payable in lieu of notice if the Company terminates the contract other than for cause or if the executive director resigns in circumstances where there has been a material adverse change in role, responsibilities or remuneration.
Compensation is based on the value of 12 months basic salary, target annual bonus for 12 months and the annual value of benefits.
The Company may choose whether to continue to provide other benefits during any notice period or to pay an amount equal to the gross value of these benefits over the period.
As the policy of liquidated damages is no longer in complete compliance with the latest ABI guidelines and as market practice has now moved away from the inclusion of this provision in service contracts, the contracts of executive directors appointed since 2004 do not include this provision.
The contracts of executive directors do not provide for any enhanced payments in the event of a change of control of the Company.
All non-executive directors have letters of appointment with the Company for an initial period of three years from their date of appointment, subject to reappointment at the annual general meeting.
In addition to his letter of appointment with the Company, Bobby Godsell has a service contract with AngloGold Ashanti Limited, an independently managed subsidiary of the Company, in his capacity as its chief executive.
Under this contract, his employment may be terminated by either party giving to the other 12 months notice.

This graph has been produced in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.
The second graph shows the Companys performance against the weighted comparator group used to measure company performance for the purposes of the vesting of LTIP interests conditionally awarded in 2003.
This graph gives an indication of how Anglo American is performing against the targets in place for LTIP interests already granted, although the specifics of the comparator companies for each years interests may vary to reflect changes such as mergers and acquisitions amongst the Companys competitors or changes to the Companys business mix.
The TSR level shown at 31 December each year is calculated in accordance with the LTIP rules.
In particular, TSR is calculated in US dollars, and the TSR level shown at 31 December each year is the average of the closing daily TSR levels for the six-month period up to and including that date.
Remuneration outcomes during 2005 The information set out in this section and section 11 has been subject to audit.
10.1 Directors emoluments The following tables set out an analysis of the pre-tax remuneration during the years ended 31 December 2005 and 2004, including bonuses but excluding pensions, for individual directors who held office in the Company during the year ended 31 December 2005.
He received 130,000 for the provision of these services during the year.
2 Subsequent to their retirement from the Board in 2001, Leslie Boyd and Mike King continue to hold non-executive directorships with certain listed subsidiaries of the Group.
They received fees of 26,000 2004: 29,000 and 17,000 2004: 21,000 respectively, for the provision of these services during the year.
3 As Tony Trahar and Barry Davison have no provision for past service in respect of their sterling-denominated pension fund, their employing company has contractually agreed that supplementary pension contributions should be made to the Anglo American plc International Approved Pension Scheme in return for these executives having given up their right to part of their future basic salary.
4 The performance bonus represents the cash element of the BSP.
The share interests under this plan are disclosed in section 10.2.
5 The employing companies have contractually agreed with Tony Trahar, Ren Mdori and Simon Thompson that supplementary pension contributions should be made into their pension arrangements in 2006 in return for these executives having given up their right to all or part of the cash element in the BSP for performance in 2005.
6 Each director receives a car allowance or a fully expensed car and a limited amount of personal taxation financial advice.
All directors receive death and disability insurance and also receive medical insurance.
Tony Trahar, Tony Lea and Simon Thompson receive club membership: in addition, Tony Trahar receives a South African housing loan subsidy.
7 Upon retirement as at 30 December 2005, Barry Davison received an award of 1,000 to mark his completion of service.
The basic salary equates to an annualised figure of 480,000.

No BSP interests vested during 2005.
2 The value of the bonus under the BSP is calculated by reference to measures of both corporate performance based on stretching EPS targets as well as the achievement of specific individual objectives.
Details of the performance conditions applying to bonuses in 2005 are described in further detail on page 27.
In 2005, the EPS bonus targets were met in full.
Half of the bonus is paid in cash which would not normally exceed 90% of basic salary for the chief executive and 75% of basic salary for the other directors and the other half takes the form of a conditional award of Bonus Shares equal in value to the cash element.
The Bonus Shares vest if the director remains in employment with the Group until the end of a three year holding period.
3 A conditional award of Enhancement Shares was made at the same time as the award of Bonus Shares to a maximum of 75% of the face value of the Bonus Shares.
Enhancement Shares awarded in 2005 will only vest to the extent that a challenging performance condition based on EPS growth against growth in the UK Retail Price Index is met.
Further details of this performance condition are provided on page 27.

Further details on the structure of the LTIP, the required level of performance for the 2005 award and how performance against targets is measured can be found on pages 28 and 29.
The market price of the shares at the date of award was 12.54.
2 The performance period applicable to each award is three years.
The performance period relating to the 2002 LTIP awards which were granted on 22 April 2002 ended on 31 December 2004.
Vesting was subject to two performance conditions: the first based on the Companys TSR relative to a weighted group of international natural resource companies and the second based on an underlying operating measure which focused on improvements in the Companys ROCE in the medium term.
Part of each award was based on the TSR measure and part on the operating measure.

In the case of Barry Davison, to reflect his responsibility for Anglo Platinum in 2002, the targets were 50% relative TSR, 30% Group ROCE targets and 20% on Anglo Platinum specific ROCE targets.
The ROCE targets are a function of targeted improvement in returns on existing capital employed at the start of the performance period and targeted returns in excess of the cost of capital on new capital investment over that period.
The entry level target for any LTIP has been the actual return achieved on the capital employed, excluding capital work in progress, in the year immediately preceding the commencement of the performance period.
In order to maintain the effectiveness of the plan in driving long term performance, the actual returns in the final performance year are adjusted for movements in commodity prices, certain foreign exchange rate effects e. g. translation windfalls, capital in progress to reflect the fact that mines under construction absorb large amounts of capital before producing a return, for relevant changes in the composition of the Group e. g. significant acquisitions and disposals and other one-off factors which would otherwise result in a misleading outcome.
The Committee has amended the basis of the vesting calculation for the part of the award contingent upon TSR for the 2002, 2003 and 2004 LTIP awards in order to produce a more robust measure of performance.
Target performance required to achieve 50% vesting is now calculated by measuring median TSR performance within each sector subgroup rather than average TSR performance as was previously the case.
This removes the distorting effect that extremely low or high performing companies can have on the average within small sector sub-groups, and thus results in a TSR ranking.
Target performance will still be defined as the weighted average of the TSR so calculated for each sector sub-group.
The threshold blended target i. e. the target on existing and new capital for the period was 16% and the upper blended target 18%.
The ROCE achieved was 21% and the outcome on this element of the LTIP was thus 100%.
On the TSR measure, Anglo American achieved a TSR over the three year performance period of 82% which generated a 52% vesting in terms of the 2002 Comparator Group.
The overall vesting level for those directors with a 50% Group ROCE, 50% TSR split was therefore 76%.
In the case of Barry Davison, the ROCE element attributable to Anglo Platinums ROCE 20% of the total 2002 LTIP achieved 35%.
The overall outcome in his case therefore was 63%.
3 In addition to the LTIP award disclosed above, Ren Mdori was granted 50,600 forfeitable shares, of which 30,360 will be released to him on 1 May 2006 and 20,240 on 1 May 2007.
These awards are conditional on his continued employment in the Group and are in partial compensation for long term incentives forgone at his previous employer.

No LTIP interests vested during 2005.
2 The LTIP awards made in 2005 are conditional on the extent to which the following performance conditions are met: 40% of the awards will vest if AngloGold Ashantis TSR is superior to the TSR achieved by a group of five gold-producing companies: Barrick, Newmont, Placer Dome, Gold Fields and Harmony.
AngloGold Ashantis TSR must be greater than the TSR of the median performer from this group for any vesting to occur and be equal to or better than the second-placed company for full vesting to occur.
40% of awards will vest dependent on real growth above US inflation in AngloGold Ashantis EPS of 6% per year over the performance period: and 20% of awards will vest dependent on the successful integration of Ashanti as measured by targeted production of 4.01 million ounces over the three-year period, cost reductions of at least $15 per ounce at Obuasi and an improvement of at least 5% in EPS in respect of the Ashanti assets over the period.

Approval This directors remuneration report has been approved by the Board of directors of Anglo American plc.
Signed on behalf of the Board of directors Rob Margetts 21 February 2006 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2005 | 41 Remuneration report continued Independent remuneration report review This letter reports on the results of the review carried out by Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited of the processes followed by the Anglo American Remuneration Committee the Committee that support the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2005.
Mercer undertook the review at the request of the Chairman of the Committee in order to provide shareholders with assurance that the remuneration processes followed are appropriate and that the Committee has complied with the policies set out in the Remuneration Report.
In order to reach our opinion, we reviewed the Committees Terms of Reference and the minutes of its meetings held during the year as well as material presented to the Committee for its review.
We also interviewed the Chairman and Secretary of the Committee.
Our review was not intended to audit the compensation data set forth in the Remuneration Report or to evaluate the merits of the Anglo Americans remuneration programme.
Based on our review, Mercer is of the opinion that the processes followed by the Committee during 2005 were fully consistent with its Terms of Reference and that the decisions taken by the Committee were in line with the principles set out in the Remuneration Report.
It continues to be our view that the Committee takes a suitably robust and pro-active approach to its work.
We note that the Committee has refined its modus operandi each year taking into account any comments we have made in our reviews.
In addition, the Committee has taken steps to improve its processes reflecting areas of improvement highlighted in the Evaluation of the Committee undertaken with input from external advisers.
As a result we believe that the Anglo American Remuneration Committee is exemplary in its conduct, decision making and reporting.
The members of the Remuneration Committee are regularly updated on executive compensation and corporate governance matters.
Further detail regarding the Mercer review is included in a letter of this date addressed to the Committee Chairman which we understand will be made available on the Companys website.
