Policy on Remuneration of Executive Directors The remuneration policy for executive directors is to offer a remuneration package which will attract and retain the highest calibre of executive and to ensure that individual rewards and incentives are properly aligned with personal performance, the performance of the group, and the interests of shareholders.
A significant proportion of total remuneration is expected each year to be performance related.
This policy is expected to continue in future years.
The remuneration arrangements include basic salary and benets, performance related bonus, long term incentives and pension rights.
The main elements are: i Basic salary and benets The level of basic salary and benets is determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account the performance of the individual and advice and information from independent sources on the rates of salary for similar positions.
Individual salaries of executive directors are reviewed annually by the committee.
Adjustments were made during the course of the year following the appointment of a new group finance director to maintain appropriate relativities within the executive director population and within a general policy that base salary levels are set at no higher than market median level in relation to similar sized UK listed businesses and considering other elements of the package.
Benets normally include the provision of a car, fuel, private medical insurance and permanent health insurance.
ii Performance related bonus Executive directors each receive an annual performance related bonus of up to 60% of basic salary and these payments are largely dependent on achievement of profit targets.
The targets are set at levels which are challenging in relation to budgets which would produce significant growth.
iii Long term incentives Executive directors have a continuing interest in long term incentives.
While awards were made during the year to two newly appointed executive directors following the announcement of results but before the publication of the Directors Remuneration Report no long term incentives are proposed to be granted in the forthcoming year.
Should any awards be made in the future the Remuneration Committee will ensure that appropriately demanding performance targets will be set which may not necessarily be the same as targets set in relation to previous awards.
iv Pension rights Dr I J Bolton and Mr P B Maudsley participate and Mr D A Johnson participated until December 2003 when he approached his normal retirement age of 60 on a non-contributory basis, and Mr D B Dutton participates on a contributory basis, in the Findel Group Pension Fund the Scheme which provides them at their normal retirement age of 65 with a pension of up to two-thirds of their final pensionable earnings at retirement.
In the event of retirement before the normal retirement age, their pension would normally be reduced.
Life assurance cover is four times salary for Dr Bolton and Mr Dutton, and three times salary for Mr Maudsley.
Pensions are payable in certain circumstances in the event of ill health and a spouses pension is payable on death.
Pensionable earnings for Dr Boltons service after 1 April 2003 are dened as one third of the aggregate of his basic salary paid in the three years prior to retirement plus one ninth of the aggregate of performance related bonuses paid in the same three year period.
Previously, Dr Boltons terms of service provided that elements of his emoluments as well as basic salary were taken into account in calculating his pension entitlement.
Pensionable earning for Mr Dutton and Mr Maudsley are dened as one third of the aggregate of the members basic salary paid in the three years prior to retirement.
For Mr K Chapman and Mr D A Johnson, in order to ensure that the value of their total remuneration is not reduced by the fact that www.
co. uk 19 on reaching normal retirement age they took a transfer from the Scheme and are no longer members of the Scheme, the company contributes an amount equal to not more than the percentage of pensionable salary the company would have contributed to the Scheme if they were members of the Scheme into their own personal pension arrangements, which amounts were 40,800 and 34,453 respectively in the year ended 31 March 2005.
The Remuneration Committee considers that inclusion of a small proportion of annual bonus paid in the denition of pensionable pay is justied after considering overall levels of base salary and bonus potential, and considering the smoothing effect of averaging the bonuses paid over three years.
Performance Graph The following graph contrasts the total shareholder return of the company calculated in accordance with The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 with the FTSE 350 General Retailers Index.
This index was selected as being, in the opinion of the Committee, the most appropriate for comparison.
