Remuneration Report This report contains the information required by the Companies Act 1985 and the relevant parts of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
The Board of Directors reports that the Company has complied with these regulations throughout the year under review, other than certain aspects of directors notice periods which were brought into compliance with the Combined Code during the year.
Information not subject to audit The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration of the Groups Chairman and executive directors, and reviews that of senior executives.
The members of the Committee who served during the year are listed in this Annual Report.
They are independent nonexecutive directors of the Company and have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in the matters addressed by the Committee and have no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships.
Remuneration policy The remuneration packages of directors are reviewed by the Committee at least annually on the same basis as any other employee of the Group.
The review takes into account market practice and performance of the individual and of the business.
Other factors taken into account include the experience and responsibility of the individuals concerned.
The Committee receives information from various independent sources on directors remuneration.
The components of the Groups remuneration packages are detailed below.
Policy is structured to provide a mix of remuneration to ensure that no one component or measure dominates and that interests are aligned over different time periods with other employees and shareholders.
Packages include basic salary, annual bonus based on earnings per share and a long term incentive plan based on total shareholder return.
No changes to policy have been made as a consequence of impending changes to pensions taxation.
Salary Salaries of directors are set by reference to those prevailing in the market, particularly within other major retail companies, and according to individual performance, experience and responsibility.
Annual performance related bonus The executive directors participate in an annual performance related bonus scheme which is based on a formula determined by the Committee measuring the performance of the business.
The performance measure is earnings per share before tax, which must increase by 5% prior to any bonus becoming payable.
The formula includes an upper limit of 75% of salary and other constraints which may reduce the bonus percentage below that determined by the formula.
Earnings per share growth must reach a demanding level of at least 25% for the maximum bonus to be earned.
Long term incentive plan The long term incentive plan was approved by shareholders in 1997 and is due for renewal in 2007.
Invitations to participate are generally issued annually to executive directors and senior executives.
Performance is measured over periods of three years, which commence annually, by comparing Total Shareholder Return against approximately 20 other UK listed retail companies.
The comparator group of companies for the three year performance period to January 2005 was as follows: Arcadia Findel Laura Ashley N. Brown Body Shop G. U. S. Marks & Spencer New Look Boots JJB Sports Matalan Selfridges Debenhams J Sainsbury MFI Furniture Tesco DFS Furniture Kingfisher Mothercare W H Smith Dixons The Committee determines which companies are included, added or removed from the comparator group.
Arcadia, Debenhams and Selfridges have been removed for periods ending January 2006 onwards following their delisting and have been replaced with Burberry, Signet and Woolworths.
Laura Ashley, DFS and New Look have been removed for periods ending January 2007 onwards and have been replaced with Carpetright, Kesa and Morrisons.
18 Remuneration Report The Committee considers that the comparator group consists of companies which are most comparable to NEXT in size or nature of their business.
The Committee believes that comparison against a group of retail companies is more likely to reflect the Companys relative performance against its peers, thereby resulting in appropriate awards being made.
The graph below shows relative Total Shareholder Return of the Company over five years when compared to the FTSE All Share index and FTSE General Retailers index.
This illustrates the Companys performance against a wide all-share UK index and against other companies in the same sector.

However, the Committee has generally restricted the maximum share award possible to the equivalent of 70% of basic salary.
An incremental award has been made to Mr Angelides and three senior executives, bringing their maximum share award to an equivalent of 100% of salary for the performance period commencing January 2004.
This additional 30% award is contingent on their remaining with the Group for a five year period to January 2009.
If Total Shareholder Return is below the median ranking company there will be no entitlement to any of the award.
For median performance the entitlement will be 30% of the maximum award.
For performance above the median the entitlement will rise, with the maximum award being earned for performance which places the Company in the upper quartile of the comparator group.
Irrespective of where Company performance ranks, no award will be made unless the earnings per share of the Company has increased by at least the increase in the Retail Price Index over the period.
Awards are granted provisionally at the start of a performance period and remain subject to performance conditions over the life of the plan before any entitlement is earned.
If no entitlement has been earned at the end of a three year performance period then the award for that period will lapse.
The Company has discretion as to whether entitlements earned are payable in NEXT shares or cash and to date it has allowed participants the choice.
Entitlements earned are not pensionable and are based on salary and share price at the start of the performance period.
Individuals included in the plan have not received grants under the management share option scheme in the same year.
Special bonuses In July 2004, a special bonus was paid to certain directors and senior executives in recognition of their importance to the Groups continuing success.
The bonus was paid on the understanding that the recipient would invest the net amount along with a sum of their own money in a financial contract, the success of which is based on the market price of NEXT shares in four years time.
The payments were made with the approval of the Remuneration Committee and all the recipients invested the amount received in the contract.
Mr Wolfson Chief Executive elected not to receive any special bonus as he was consulted by the Remuneration Committee about these bonuses and therefore considered it inappropriate to benefit from them.
Details of the amounts invested in the financial contracts by the executive directors and of the special bonuses paid are given below.

The return on the financial contracts will vary between a minimum of zero if the final share price is then 20 or less and a maximum of approximately five times the initial investment.
The maximum value will only be achieved if the final share price is at or above 24.50.
The final price will be determined by an averaging mechanism over the final three months to July 2008.
Based on an average share price of 14.26 over the three months to July 2004, the Companys share price must increase at the equivalent of an annual compound growth rate of 8.8% prior to dividends payable in order for there to be any return on the initial investment.
In order to achieve maximum value, the annual compound growth rate would be 14.5%.
The financial contracts were entered into with an independent third party regulated by the Financial Services Authority and are not subsidised, supported or underwritten by NEXT.
There is no present or future liability for NEXT in respect of these contracts and no interest in the Companys securities is being acquired by the directors.
Certain major shareholders were consulted in respect of both the investments being made in the financial contracts and the special bonuses paid.
The Chairman and non-executive directors of the Company did not receive any special bonuses nor have they invested in the financial contracts.
Management share options The management share option scheme was approved by shareholders in 1995.
A new ten year plan will be put to shareholders at the 2005 AGM.
The current scheme provides for options over shares, exercisable between three and ten years following their grant, to be allocated to Group employees at the discretion of the Board.
The total number of options which can be granted is subject to shareholder approved limits.
Options are set at the prevailing market price at the time of grant.
The maximum value of Inland Revenue approved share options which may be granted to any employee is restricted to 30,000.
Unapproved options can also be granted under the scheme, the maximum number being determined by a formula which restricts the aggregate option exercise price to four times total remuneration of the employee less the value of any outstanding approved share options.
It is not the practice to grant the maximum number of options allowable to any employee in one year.
Grants are generally made annually.
The exercise of options is subject to a performance condition where the percentage growth in earnings per share of the Group over a three year period must exceed RPI and a further 3% per annum.
No options were granted to directors or changes made to existing entitlements in the year under review.
No employee has received option grants under the scheme and been included in the long term incentive plan in the same year.
Sharesave options The sharesave option scheme was approved by shareholders in 2000 and is due for renewal in 2010.
Invitations to participate are generally issued annually to all employees.
The scheme operates on a save-as-you-earn principle and is subject to a maximum contribution limit of 250 per month per employee.
Options are exercisable three, five or seven years from the date of grant.
Options are granted at the prevailing market rate less a discount of 20%.
A similar scheme is operated by the Company for its employees in the Republic of Ireland.
No sharesave options were granted to directors in the year under review.
20 Remuneration Report Group pension scheme Executive directors are eligible for membership of the NEXT Group Pension Plan which has been approved by the Inland Revenue and consists of defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The trustee of the scheme is a limited company, NEXT Pension Trustees Limited the Trustee.
All the directors of the Trustee are appointed and can be removed by NEXT.
The Board of the Trustee includes members of the scheme, a pensioner member, a former nonexecutive director of NEXT and an independent director who is also the current Chairman of the Trustee.
All directors of the Trustee receive a fee for their services, including those directors who are also employees of NEXT.
The schemes investments are kept entirely separate from the business affairs of the NEXT Group and the Trustee holds them in trust.
Responsibility for investment of the schemes funds has been delegated by the Trustee to professional investment managers.
Defined contribution section Employees of the Group can join the defined contribution section of the scheme.
Members elect to pay either 3% or 5% of their pensionable earnings which is matched by the Company.
For death prior to retirement, a lump sum of three times the members basic salary at the previous April is payable along with the current value of the members fund, subject to Inland Revenue limits.
Defined benefit section The defined benefit section of the scheme was closed to new members in 2000 but is being continued for the benefit of existing members.
This section provides members with a retirement benefit of one sixtieth or one eightieth depending on chosen member contribution rate of final pensionable earnings for each year of pensionable service, payable from a normal retirement age of 60.
This section also provides a lump sum death in service benefit and dependents pensions on death in service or following retirement.
For death prior to retirement a spouses pension of 60% of the members prospective pension is payable.
A lump sum of up to three times the members final pensionable earnings plus a return of the members contributions with interest is also payable.
For death after retirement a spouses pension of 60% of the members pre-commutation pension is payable.
A lump sum equivalent to the balance of five years pension is payable if death occurs within five years of retirement.
If death occurs after leaving service but before the pension becomes payable i. e. as a deferred pensioner, a spouses pension of 60% of the accrued deferred pension is payable along with a lump sum equal to the members own contributions with interest.
Childrens pensions are only payable on death in service.
In the case of illhealth retirement only the accrued pension is payable.
All benefits are subject to Inland Revenue limits.
Increases to pensions in payment are at the discretion of the Trustee although pensionable service post 1997 is subject to limited price indexation.
For all current scheme members basic pay, overtime and annual performance bonus are included in calculating pensionable earnings but no other items of remuneration are taken into account.
The inclusion of annual performance bonus in pensionable earnings is limited to a maximum of 35% of an employees annual salary in any year.
The inclusion of bonus in pensionable earnings has been the practice for many years and is appropriate for NEXT where a significant element of employee earnings is dependent on productivity or profit performance.
The Trustee has considered a request from the Company that bonus is excluded from future defined benefit pensionable earnings and is replaced with an optional AVC alternative, however it has not yet been possible to introduce such a change.
Members contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings, whilst the Company made contributions at the rate of 13.4% up to April 2004 and 15.5% thereafter.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit sections financial position was undertaken as at 31 March 2004 and concluded that the scheme had a 20% deficit of assets compared to actuarial liabilities.
Members who joined the scheme after May 1989 and before October 2000 are subject to the Inland Revenue salary cap for approved pension schemes which is set at 102,000 per annum for 2004 2005.
Members subject to the cap may be provided with appropriate benefits through an unfunded, unapproved arrangement in relation to that part of their earnings which exceeds the cap, where they so elect.
The relevant members contribute towards the additional cost of providing these benefits by paying 5% of pensionable earnings in excess of the cap.
Specific information in respect of executive directors pension entitlements is detailed below.
21 Remuneration Report Notice periods Each of the executive directors has a rolling service contract which is terminable by the Company on giving one years notice.
The executive directors service contracts were renewed on 8 October 2004.
The only significant change was the reduction in notice period from two years to one year in the event of termination by the Company following a takeover of the Group.
No compensation was paid to any director in respect of this reduction.
The Committee will ensure that in the event of any termination payment being made to a director full account will be taken of that directors duty to mitigate any loss and where appropriate the Committee may seek independent professional advice prior to authorising such payment.
Apart from service contracts no director has had any material interest in any contract with the Company or its subsidiaries.
Other benefits Executive directors receive benefits which may include the provision of a fully expensed company car or cash alternative, private medical insurance, annual subscriptions to appropriate professional bodies and staff discount when purchasing the Groups merchandise.
Other employees are also eligible for certain of these benefits.
Non-executive directors Remuneration of the non-executive directors of the Company is determined by the Chairman and the executive directors.
Remuneration consists of fees for their services in connection with Board and Board Committee meetings.
Letters of appointment do not contain notice periods.
Non-executive directors do not participate in any of the Groups pension, bonus, share option or other incentive schemes.

Mr Mitchell-Innes and Ms Burdus both retired on 13 May 2004.
Mr Angelides was the highest paid director in the current year 2004: Mr Wolfson after taking account of the special bonus, gains on exercise of share options of 286,250 and the long term incentive plan.
Mr Keens benefits include an allowance chargeable to UK tax of nil 2004: 3,892.
Mr Varleys 2004 bonus included 30,000 in respect of property transactions.
Details of the special bonuses are as noted previously.
In addition to the above, Mr Mitchell-Innes received advisory fees of 13,125 subsequent to his resignation as a director of the Company, and remains a director of NEXT Pension Trustees Limited for which he received a fee of 26,041 2004: 17,500.
The Company paid a pension under the unfunded, unapproved arrangement to a former director of the Company of 31,155 2004: 30,015.
Long term incentive plan Estimated monetary values were included in the January 2004 Remuneration Report for the three year performance plan which matured at that date based on a share price of 1362p on 22 March 2004.
Performance conditions of the plan are detailed above.
Awards were made subsequent to the Report on 31 March 2004 when the share price was 1403p.
Adjustments to the estimated monetary value together with the final award have therefore been included in the table below.
A further three year performance period of the plan matured in January 2005.
The Total Shareholder Return of the Company over this period ranked between second and third when compared to the group of 21 other listed retail companies.
Accordingly an award of 100% of the maximum equivalent to 70% of basic salary is expected to be made to the participants in the plan, which is payable in NEXT shares or cash at the Companys discretion.
The awards will be made during 2005 and, based on the share price of 1563p on 21 March 2005, awards to directors would be as follows: January 2005 January 2004 Actual Estimated Adjustment Final no.

There have been no other changes to awards under the long term incentive plan during the year.
Directors pension entitlements All executive directors are members of the defined benefit section of the NEXT Group Pension Plan.
Directors and some senior managers receive an enhancement from the Plan, increasing the accrual of their retirement benefit up to two thirds of their final pensionable earnings on completion of 20 years pensionable service at age 60 for members who joined before October 2000.
The lump sum payable on death in service for directors and some senior managers is enhanced to four times pensionable salary.
In the case of earnings over 100,000 per annum, final pensionable earnings are based on an average of the best consecutive 36 or more months earnings in the ten years prior to retirement.
Pension entitlements of the executive directors who held office during the year are as follows: Increase in Transfer value Increase in Age at Years of Accrued accrued of accrued transfer value January pensionable annual annual annual pension less directors 2005 service pension pension 2005 2004 contributions 000 000 000 000 000 S A Wolfson 37 10 135 30 851 546 290 C E Angelides 41 12 124 27 889 615 259 D W Keens 51 18 210 30 2,119 1,666 428 A J Varley 54 21 185 20 2,138 1,841 278 Years of pensionable service shown above may include bought in service from the transfer of other pension entitlements into the Plan.
Due to movements in bond yields, which underly the basis of calculation of transfer values, the increase in transfer values over the year can be significantly higher for members nearer to retirement than for younger members.
Mr Wolfson and Mr Angelides are both subject to the Inland Revenue salary cap and have elected to join the unfunded, unapproved pension arrangement.
The accrued annual pension set out above includes their membership of that arrangement.
