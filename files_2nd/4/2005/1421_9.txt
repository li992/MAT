Directors service contracts 44 It is the companys policy that all executive directors have rolling contracts with 12 month notice periods.
The Articles of Association of Associated British Foods plc require that all directors retire from office at every third annual general meeting.
The details of the directors contracts of service as at 17 September 2005 are set out below: Effective Notice Notice date of period period Date of current from from appointment contract company director Martin Adamson 11.10.99 11.12.02 6 months 6 months George Weston 19.04.99 01.06.05 12 months 12 months John Bason 04.05.99 16.03.99 12 months 12 months Peter Jackson 01.08.94 24.04.99 12 months 12 months Mike Alexander 16.01.02 16.01.02 6 months 6 months Lord MacGregor 09.12.94 16.11.99 6 months 6 months Jeff Harris 21.05.03 21.05.03 6 months 6 months Tim Clarke 03.11.04 03.11.04 6 months 6 months Peter Jackson retired from the board on 31 March 2005.
The board has not considered it appropriate to enter into a formal letter of appointment with Galen Weston in view of his relationship with the ultimate holding company of Associated British Foods plc, Wittington Investments Limited.
He receives no fees for performing his role as a non-executive director and Associated British Foods plc does not reimburse him for any expenses incurred by him in that role.
The committee takes a view that the entitlement of the executive directors to the security of 12 months notice of termination of employment is in line with practice of many comparable companies.
The Remuneration committees aim is always to deal fairly with cases of termination whilst taking a robust line in minimising any compensation.
The Remuneration committee has given due consideration to the recommendations contained in the Combined Code regarding inclusion of explicit provisions in directors service contracts for compensation commitments in the event of early termination.
The committee will continue to keep under review its current practice, which is not to include such provisions in order to enable it to respond appropriately to particular circumstances.
