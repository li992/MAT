For Stewart Cline, the awards were calculated by reference to a formula based on one and half times his salary as at 1 January 2003 and 1 January 2004.
The 2003 George Wimpey LTIP awarded to Stewart Cline was made on 9 May when the market value on award was 250.5p and the 2004 award was based on a share price of 403.9p.
