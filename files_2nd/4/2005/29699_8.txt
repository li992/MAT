Share options So as to link a significant proportion of their remuneration to the long term stock market performance of the Company and to the achievement of predetermined financial targets, it is the policy of the Committee that the interests of the executive Directors and other executives of the Group are aligned with shareholders through the operation of the Companys Executive Share Option Plan, which was introduced at the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 3 May 2001.
Options will be granted regularly to qualifying employees and secondees of the Group and the Committee will determine grant levels, taking into account the development of the business and individual performance in the preceding financial year.
The Chairman and non-executive directors are not eligible to be granted options.
Options granted to Nicholas Ferguson relate to his previous role as an executive director of the Company.
All options are granted at the prevailing market price around the time of grant.
Options are exercisable subject to appropriate performance targets being met.
Performance conditions have been met.
The Committee intends to continue to set appropriately demanding performance targets on the exercise of options.
For options granted in 2005, the target is for growth in the Companys net asset value per ordinary share to exceed the growth in the Retail Prices Index RPI plus 4% per annum over the three years from the date of grant.
If the performance target is not satisfied on the third anniversary of the date of grant it will lapse i. e. there will be no retesting of this performance condition.
This change was introduced from 2005 to reflect best practice.
For the options that were granted in March 2004, the target is for growth in the Companys net asset value per ordinary share to exceed the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 4% per annum over the three years from the date of grant.
If the performance target is not satisfied on the third anniversary of the date of grant, they may be re-tested every six months up to six years from grant.
For all options granted up to the end of March 2003, performance targets have been met.
The mid-market price of shares at 31 December 2005 was 716.5p and the range during the year was 554.0p to 720.5p.
All of the above options were granted for nil consideration.
The number of options in issue at 31 December 2005 in respect of current and former executive directors represented 3.1% 2004: 2.9% of issued share capital.
It is not anticipated that the value of shares under options granted in any financial year will, other than in exceptional circumstances, exceed two times an individuals remuneration, including bonuses.
The performance of the net asset value of the Company has been chosen as the target in order to align the interests of executive Directors and other executives of the Group with shareholders interests.
External advisers will confirm the performance criteria calculations for the Committee, which will be measured on a consistent basis.
The Company has established an employee benefit trust to enable it to purchase shares in the market to satisfy options exercised by employees of the Group.
New shares will be issued in respect of options exercised by seconded individuals.
The Board will regularly review the benefit of using the trust to make market purchases.
