Report on Directors remuneration This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Companys members on the audited information within the Directors remuneration report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
As a result, the report has been divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information.
This report sets out the Companys policy on Directors remuneration for the forthcoming year, and, so far as is practicable for subsequent years, as well as information on remuneration paid to Directors in the financial year.
Unaudited information Membership and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee Membership and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are disclosed in the corporate governance report above.
The Remuneration Committee continues to use New Bridge Street Consultants LLP as remuneration advisers.
Apart from advice regarding the design, establishment and operation of remuneration arrangements, New Bridge Street Consultants provides no other services to the Company.
Policy The objective of the Remuneration Committees remuneration policy is to reward the Companys executives competitively having regard to the comparative marketplace in order to ensure that they are properly motivated to perform in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
The Company aims to provide competitive total pay for on target performance, with superior awards for exceptional performance.
The remuneration packages of the Executive Directors comprise a combination of basic salary, annual bonus, participation in share-based long term incentive plans and lean benefits provision.
easyJet has a no frills approach and does not include, for example, company cars or final salary pensions as part of the package.
Therefore, performance-related elements form a significant proportion of the packages of the Executive Directors.
The Board as a whole determines the remuneration of the Companys Non-Executive Directors, with NonExecutive Directors exempting themselves from discussions and voting as appropriate.
When determining the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors, account is taken of practice adopted in other similar organisations and the time commitment of each Non-Executive Director.
Basic salary The basic salaries of Directors are reviewed annually and are set taking account of a number of factors including: i practice adopted in companies of a broadly similar size, ii a formal appraisal of their contribution to the business and iii the competitive environment, as senior easyJet executives are potential targets for other low-cost start-ups and other companies in the airline sector.
During the year Ray Websters salary increased 2.8% from 390,000 to 401,090.
Annual report and accounts 05 47 plc 95 05 95 05 Report on Directors remuneration continued Pension contributions Pension contributions for Executive Directors are set at 7% of their basic salaries.
The Remuneration Committee does not expect any senior executive to be materially affected by the forthcoming changes in pension legislation.
Annual bonus scheme All Executive Directors participate in an annual bonus scheme.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity of the Chief Executive during the year was 200% of salary, with a 100% of salary maximum for other senior executives.
This policy will remain unchanged for the forthcoming year.
80% of the annual bonus opportunity is subject to achieving very demanding financial targets, with the remaining 20% subject to the achievement of demanding personal performance targets.
Last year the financial targets were based on profit before tax performance targets.
For the forthcoming year, the financial targets will relate to return on equity.
Ray Webster was paid a bonus of 117,000 during the year 30% of salary to reflect performance in the year ended 30 September 2004.
Chris Walton was paid a bonus of 9,675 4.5% of salary.
Ray Webster will be paid a bonus of 232,811 58.0% of salary in the year ending 30 September 2006 to reflect performance in the year ended 30 September 2005.
Jeff Carr will be paid a bonus of 53,562 37.7% of salary in the year ending 30 September 2006 to reflect performance in the year ended 30 September 2005.
Long term incentive plans Share-based long term incentives have previously been provided to Executive Directors and other staff under Inland Revenue approved and unapproved Executive Share Option Schemes.
However, last year the Remuneration Committee completed its review of long term incentive provision that was commenced in 2004.
The main conclusion of this review was that the Executive Share Option Scheme should be replaced by a new Long Term Incentive Plan the LTIP.
Accordingly, shareholder approval was obtained to establish the LTIP at an Extraordinary General Meeting EGM that was held on 15 September 2005.
The Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS has been retained for flexibility.
Options will be granted to Andrew Harrison under this scheme as described below, but there is no current intention to make regular grants of options under this scheme.
Full details of the new LTIP were provided to all shareholders in the Notice of EGM.
However, in summary, the LTIP has been structured to tie in directly with the Companys current circumstances and forward-looking strategy.
It provides for regular annual awards of i performance shares worth up to 100% of salary each year and ii matching shares linked to the investment of up to 50% of annual bonus in easyJet shares, which are then matched on a 1:1 gross basis.
In addition, the Long Term Incentive Plan provides for the one-off grant of FTSE 100 awards.
Regular annual awards It is currently intended that the vesting of all regular annual LTIP awards will be subject to the satisfaction of return on equity ROE targets.
These are defined as post-tax profit pre-goodwill amortisation divided by average shareholders funds.
The ROE targets will be measured by reference to a threeyear performance period.
Awards granted in the forthcoming year will be divided into three equal tranches that will vest according to the achievement of the following ROE targets that are specific to each financial year of the performance period.
48 Annual report and accounts 05 Return on equity Tranche and financial year Threshold Target Maximum ending 30 September 25% of tranche vests 50% of tranche vests 100% of tranche vests Tranche 1: 2006 8.4% 8.8% 10% Tranche 2: 2007 11.8% 12.4% 13% Tranche 3: 2008 12.5% 13.2% 15% To the extent that a tranche satisfies its annual ROE target it will vest three years after grant, subject to continued employment.
In addition, if ROE in 2007 2008 is between threshold and maximum ROE the relevant portion of the entire award vests to that extent rather than merely the relevant portion of tranche 3, unless the potential level of vesting of a previous tranche was higher in which case that tranche will vest at that higher level.
This approach of performance in the final year of a vesting period determining levels of vesting is very much in accordance with how similar plans are operated by other companies.
The ability for annual tranches of awards to conditionally vest for annual performance over the vesting period encourages the steady, sustained delivery of outstanding ROE performance.
ROE has been chosen as the performance measure for a number of reasons, such as: l It is a fundamental measure of easyJets underlying performance and is directly linked to the generation of returns to shareholders: and l It is directly connected to the self-sustaining growth rate of the business and incentivises management to achieve the appropriate balance between growth and returns, to deliver the best shareholder value.
The Remuneration Committee will review the ROE targets prior to each grant date in order to ensure that they remain sufficiently challenging.
For example, if easyJets ROE year-on-year growth is not so pronounced the Remuneration Committee may consider setting a challenging range of average ROE targets for the three years.
When determining the extent to which the ROE targets and, indeed, the EPS targets that apply to awards made under other long term incentive schemes operated by the Company are met, the Remuneration Committee will seek guidance from external advisers on the affect of the move to International Financial Reporting Standards and will endeavour to ensure consistency of measurement over the relevant performance period.
The one-off FTSE 100 award In addition to the proposed regular annual LTIP grants, a one-off FTSE 100 award will be granted in the forthcoming year to provide senior executives with a simple, transparent incentive to increase materially easyJets market capitalisation.
This FTSE 100 award will be structured so that, if easyJet becomes a member of the FTSE 100 index for a period of at least six months before the end of the financial year ending 30 September 2008, participants will become entitled to receive an award over easyJet shares worth 100% of salary subject to the Remuneration Committee being satisfied that the Companys issued share capital has remained reasonably constant over the relevant period or any major acquisition has created shareholder value.
These shares will vest three-and-a-half years after entry into the FTSE 100 index subject to continued employment.
Annual report and accounts 05 49 plc 95 05 95 05 Report on Directors remuneration continued Although these FTSE 100 awards will form a smaller part of the overall incentive arrangements compared to the annual bonus opportunity and the regular annual LTIP awards, they will be an important element of the incentive arrangements at easyJet for a number of reasons: l They support the corporate goal of easyJet: l They provide an important growth underpin to the ROE targets: and l They are indicative of easyJets growth potential.
Shareholding guideline Linked to the establishment of the new LTIP, the Remuneration Committee has introduced a share ownership guideline which will apply to all members of the Airline Management Board being those senior executives who report to the Chief Executive Officer which requires them to retain all the shares they receive on the vesting of LTIP awards on an after-tax basis until they have built up a shareholding equal to 100% of salary with pre-existing shareholdings taken into account.
For senior executives who report to the Airline Management Board and receive LTIP awards, a 50% share ownership guideline will apply.
All-employee share participation During the year share ownership was also extended throughout the Company by the commencement of a Share Incentive Plan and the introduction of a Sharesave Plan.
Total shareholder return The following graphs show the Companys performance, measured by total shareholder return, compared with the 1 performance of the FTSE Mid 250 and that of a group of European Airlines.
The FTSE Mid 250 has been chosen as it consists of companies of similar size to easyJet.
The group of European Airlines comprises companies operating in a comparable sector.
200 180 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 1 easyJet FTSE 250 Comparative European Airlines 1 British Airways, Lufthansa, Ryanair, Air France KLM and Iberia have been included in the Comparative European Airlines group.
Any fees received in respect of these appointments are retained directly by the relevant Executive Director.
Ray Webster has an agreement with Air New Zealand that he will perform two weeks consultancy services each year in return for employer and employee contributions to a pension scheme, and free flights to New Zealand for himself and his family.
The Board has approved this arrangement.
Service contracts The service contracts of the Executive Directors that served during the year were of no fixed term, contained notice periods of not more than six months, but no other provision for compensation for loss of office.
Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts but are appointed for a period not exceeding three years.
Their appointment may be terminated without compensation.
Details of contracts currently in place for Directors who have served during the year are as follows: Provision for Date of contract Unexpired term Notice period compensation Non-Executive: Sir Colin Chandler 26 February 2004 1 year 3 months 3-year fixed term None Amir Eilon 22 October 2003 1 year 3-year fixed term None Dawn Airey 5 April 2004 1 year 5 months 3-year fixed term None Diederik Karsten 11 May 2004 1 year 6 months 3-year fixed term None Stelios Haji-Ioannou reappointed 16 May 2005 n a n a n a n a Tony Illsley resigned 30 September 2005 22 October 2003 10 months 3-year fixed term None Colin Day resigned 30 September 2005 22 October 2003 10 months 3-year fixed term None Executive Ray Webster 18 June 2002 n a 6 months 6 months Chris Walton resigned 18 March 2005 18 June 2002 n a 6 months 6 months Jeff Carr appointed 7 March 2005 24 November 2004 n a 6 months 6 months Copies of all the service contracts for both Executive and Non-Executive Directors are available on request from the Company Secretary.
Chief Executive Officer On 1 September 2005 it was announced that Andrew Harrison was to join the Board as Chief Executive Officer, with his employment due to commence on 1 December 2005.
Andrews base salary will be 540,000 and will remain at that level until October 2007.
His annual bonus opportunity and pension provision will reflect current easyJet policy.
Annual report and accounts 05 51 plc 95 05 95 05 Report on Directors remuneration continued To facilitate Andrews recruitment as CEO and to ensure that his interests are directly and immediately aligned with those of easyJet shareholders, he will be granted an option under the existing ESOS over shares worth a multiple of four times his salary.
These options will vest three years after grant subject to a sliding scale of challenging performance conditions based on the Companys growth in diluted earnings per share before goodwill amortisation normalised EPS over this three-year period.
30% of the option will vest if the Companys normalised EPS grows by RPI plus 5% p. a. over the three years, with the financial year ended 30 September 2005 as the base year, with the option vesting in full for EPS growth of RPI plus 20% p. a. Straight-line vesting will apply between these points.
In addition, Andrew will acquire and retain between 500,000 and 1,500,000 worth of easyJet shares using his own funds.
In recognition of this, Andrew will be granted a further share-based incentive award.
The shares he acquires will be matched by the conditional award of an equal number of shares.
This matching share award will vest three years after grant subject to the satisfaction of challenging performance conditions.
Half of the matching share award will vest subject to a sliding scale of normalised EPS growth target over this three-year period.
25% of this portion of the award will vest if the Companys normalised EPS grows by RPI plus 5% p. a. over the three years, with the 2004 2005 financial year as the base year, with this portion of the award vesting in full for EPS growth of RPI plus 20% p. a. Straight-line vesting will apply between these points.
The other half of the award will be subject to the same ROE targets as will apply to the first grant of regular annual awards under the new LTIP as described above.
Andrew will also receive a one-off FTSE 100 award under the new LTIP, as will all other senior executives, but will not receive a normal LTIP award in the forthcoming year.
Andrews matching award will normally lapse if he leaves employment prior to vesting and will lapse to the extent that he withdraws his invested shares from the arrangement.
However, in certain compassionate leaver circumstances, the matching award can vest subject to the performance conditions and a pro-rata reduction in size, unless the Remuneration Committee believes that applying the pro-rata reduction will be inappropriate.
The same basic principles apply in the event of a change in control of the Company.
No alteration to Andrews advantage to certain material terms of the arrangement can be made without prior shareholder approval.
Awards under the arrangement are not pensionable.
This arrangement was considered necessary to facilitate his recruitment and was therefore established under the exemption in paragraph 9.4.
2 2 of the UK Listing Authoritys Listing Rules which permits bespoke awards to be made following a recruitment without seeking formal shareholder approval.
Andrews service contract will be of no fixed term and will be terminable by the Company giving 12 months notice or by Andrew giving six months notice.
On termination of Andrews employment he will receive a pro-rated bonus for the year of his termination based on performance up to the date of his termination.
In addition, the Company has the right to pay Andrew, in lieu of notice and on a monthly basis until he secures commensurate employment, an amount equal to base salary, pension and bonus earned in the previous year.
As described when the Company announced that Ray Webster would be stepping down as Chief Executive, Ray will resign from the Board on Andrews appointment.
Ray will remain at the Company until 30 November 2006, carrying out specific tasks for the Chairman, drawing on his skills and experience.

He was asked by the Board to stay on as an employee for two months subsequent to his resignation to provide certain advice to the Company and received 37,000 in respect of these services.
These payments are not included in the table above as Chris was not a Director of the Company when he provided these services.
The Executive Directors bonus calculation for the year ended 30 September 2004 contained targets that were subjective, and which were only able to be determined after the publication of the 2004 annual report and accounts.
However, in 2005, the equivalent targets were directly based on information published in this report.
As such, the Remuneration Committee has met and approved the Executive Directors bonuses for the year.
Therefore the amount of bonus disclosed for 2005 for Ray Webster includes 117,000 in respect of the 2004 financial year and 232,811 in respect of the 2005 financial year.
The disclosed comparatives for both Ray Webster and Chris Walton relate to bonuses for the 2003 financial year.
Jeff Carrs bonus relates solely to the 2005 financial year, and the amount of bonus disclosed in 2005 for Chris Walton relates solely to the 2004 financial year.

E Granted under the Management Combination Incentive Plan and subject to meeting certain combination milestones as set out below.
Performance criteria for C & D December 2001: based on diluted earnings per share pre-goodwill achieved in the year ending 30 September 2004.
If diluted earnings per share pre-goodwill exceeds 37.3 pence, then all options will vest on 7 December 2004.
If diluted earnings per share pre-goodwill exceeds 20.6 pence but is less than 37.3 pence, then between 50% and 100% of the options vest, on a pro-rata basis.
If diluted earnings per share pre-goodwill is exactly 20.6 pence, then 50% of the options vest.
If diluted earnings per share pre-goodwill is below 20.6 pence then no options vest.
Given actual diluted earnings per share for the year ended 30 September 2004 fell below 20.6 pence, the options lapsed on 8 December 2004.
March 2003: based on diluted earnings per share pre-goodwill achieved in the year ending 30 September 2005.
If diluted earnings per share pre-goodwill exceeds 37.87 pence, then all options vest.
If diluted earnings per share pre-goodwill exceeds 20.97 pence but is less than 37.87 pence, then between 50% and 100% of the options vest, on a pro-rata basis.
If diluted earnings per share pre-goodwill are exactly 20.97 pence, then 50% of the options vest.
If diluted earnings per share pre-goodwill are below 20.97 pence then no options vest.
Given actual diluted earnings per share for the year ended 30 September 2004 have fallen below 20.97 pence, it is not expected that any of these options will vest.
January 2004: based on diluted earnings per share pre-goodwill achieved in the year ending 30 September 2006.
If diluted earnings per share pre-goodwill exceed 36.96 pence, then all options vest.
If diluted earnings per share pre-goodwill exceeds 20.47 pence but are less than 36.96 pence, then between 50% and 100% of the options vest, on a pro-rata basis.
If diluted earnings per share pre-goodwill are exactly 20.47 pence, then 50% of the options vest.
If diluted earnings per share pre-goodwill are below 20.47 pence then no options vest.
December 2004 and June 2005: based on the average annual growth in earnings per share EPS, where no shares vest if EPS is less than RPI plus 5%, 30% vest where EPS is RPI plus 5% and 100% vest where EPS is RPI plus 20%.
Straight-line vesting will occur between these points.
