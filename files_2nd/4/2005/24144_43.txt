Annual bonus 2005 accrued : These are payments under the ABS that have been paid in March 2006, except for Brian Sweetland who received an ABS amount of 60,821 before he retired.
The Board regards each years pre-determined targeted range of Achieved Operating Profit AOP as price sensitive information.
The AOP-related bonus becomes payable when the minimum amount of the AOP range is achieved, with the amount payable increasing to reflect individual and corporate performance.
The Annual Bonus 2005 accrued figure of 173,056 for Brian Sweetland includes an amount of 112,235 paid in June 2005.
This amount reflects the decision taken by the Committee in 2004 to compensate Brian Sweetland for his exclusion from the ESOS grant made on 12 August 2004 to other executive directors, who together with Brian Sweetland, were excluded from the grants made to other staff in March 2004 due to their possession of inside information at the time.
It was considered that the grant date was too close to Brian Sweetlands normal retirement date for an award to be made.
The amount paid to him was calculated by strict application of the relevant ESOS TSR performance to the number of share options that would have been granted and took account of the exercise price for the August 2004 grant.
The assumed gain was based on the share price level at the time of retirement adjusted by application of an independent valuation using Black Scholes methodology and a period of twelve months for the exercise of options.
The actual amount paid was subject to income tax and National Insurance and further reduced to recognise that Brian Sweetland would have been liable to pay his employers National Insurance liability had he been in a position to exercise his options.
Compensation for loss of office: The compensation for loss of office to be paid to Howard Carter includes a cash contribution of 121,000 that will be made in lieu of an intended award under F&Cs Long Term Remuneration Plan that could not be made during the year due to F&C being in a restricted period.

The IR Cap on approved pension benefits affects Howard Carter, Ben Gunn and Philip Moore as below: a Ben Gunn has an unfunded unapproved pension arrangement under which, on his retirement from the service of the Company at age 60, he will receive pension benefits that, when added to any pension benefits he receives from the Pension Scheme on that date, equate to the pension benefits he would have received if he were a member of the Pension Scheme and not subject to the IR Cap.
The figures in the table above include the value of the arrangement.
It has been agreed that if he retires on or after 30 June 2007, he will receive his scheme and unfunded benefits based on service to his date of early retirement and with no actuarial reduction save for the element of his pension purchased by funds from former employment which would be reduced for early payment.
