REMUNERATION REPORT For ease of reference the Remuneration Report is broken down into a number of different sections, of which Directors Emoluments and Pensions, Senior Management Remuneration and Directors Interests were subject to audit, and are as follows:  RemunerationPolicy  Remuneration Total Reward Composition Long-TermIncentive Plans pre 2004 2005  Initiatives ShareSave Schemes Pensions UK Pensions US Service Contracts External   DirectorsEmoluments and Pensions SeniorManagement Remuneration DirectorsInterests Total Shareholder Return The Remuneration Committee The Committee, which comprises Dr. Rolf Stomberg Chairman, Dr. Pam Kirby, Warren Knowlton and Richard fide Schutter, determines the compensation of executive directors and members of the GEC and the broad policy for executive remuneration.
The Committee is assisted by Sir Christopher ODonnell, Chief Executive, and Paul Williams, Group Human Resources Director, both of whom have advised on all aspects of the Groups reward structures and policiesbut neitheris present at any  ownremuneration.
TheCommittee reviews: on an annual basis the remuneration, includingpension entitlements, of executive directors and members of the GEC: the relationshipbetween the remunerationof executive directors and that of other employees: the competitiveness of executive remuneration using data from independent consultants on companies of similarsize, technologiesand : the performance targets for the bonus plans and long term incentive plans and the performance against the targets: and determines the operation of and the participants in the long-term incentive plans, share option schemes and the performancerelated bonusplan: the operation of all of the Companys share incentive schemes in respect of grant levels, performance criteriaand vesting schedules: and plans for management succession.
The terms of reference, which are available on the companys website at www.
com, enable the Committee to obtain its own external advice on any matter, at the Companys expense.
During the year, the Committee received information from a number of independent consultants appointed by the Company: Watson Wyatt on a broad range of remuneration issues: Towers Perrin and Hay Group on salary data, when considering base salaries of executive directors and members of GEC: and  LLP on long-term incentive plan comparative performance.
Watson Wyatt also acts as one of the retirement benefit consultants to the Group and  LLP provides consultancy services to the Group including project and taxation advice.
Remuneration Policy The remuneration policy, as approved by the Remuneration Committee, for 2005 and future years, is designed to ensure that remuneration is sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate executive directors and GEC members of a calibre that meets the Groups needs to achieve its business objectives.
Remuneration includes base pay and benefits which are targeted at median competitive levels for acceptable performance and bonus 58 schemes which are designed to motivate and reward for outperformance.
Individual remuneration levels are based on measurable performance against fair and open objectives and there are no automatic pay adjustments unless required by law or local protocol.
Major changes to the remuneration policy are discussed with the .
A share based incentive plan operates for executive directors, members of the GEC and the next level of senior executives.
The plan comprises a performance share plan,  the proportion of executives variable reward that is wholly dependent on the Groups performance.
Variable rewards will continue to be provided through a mix of performance related elements.
The bonus plan relates to achievement of operational objectives for the financial year, the performance share plan will reward superior total shareholder return TSR relative to the Groups competitors and FTSE100 companies, and share optionswillreward earningsper share EPSA and share pricegrowth.
The Principal Components of Remuneration The principal components of remuneration of executive directors and GEC members are: basic salary and benefits: performance related bonus: long-term incentives consisting of a performance share plan, co-investment plan and share options:and pensions.
a Basic Salary and Benefits Basic salary reflects the responsibility of the position and individual performance.
The Group also provides certain benefits suchas private healthcare coverage and a companycar  practice.
b Performance Related Bonus For executive directors, the Group operates an annual bonus scheme.
In 2005, 75% of the annual bonus was based on annual growth in EPSA and 25% was based on improvement in return on operating capital employed ROCE.
The scheme is designed to encourageoutstanding performance.
Achievement of 14% EPSA growthand the budgeted improvement in ROCE would produce a bonus of 30% of annual salary.
Achievement of 20% EPSA growth and ROCE 5% over budget would produce a maximum bonus of 100% of annual salary.
Theactual bonusearned in2005 represented 27.6% of annualsalary as 14% EPSA growthwas achieved, but the budgeted ROCE was not achieved.
Under the Co-investment Plan, part of the annual bonus may be taken in shares.
For members of the GEC with corporate responsibilities, excluding executive directors, the 2005 annual bonus plan was linked to EPSA, ROCE and personal objectives.
For those members with specific business unit responsibilities, targets are linked to EPSA and revenues, trading profit and ROCE of their respective business unit.
As withexecutive directors, part of the annualbonusmay be taken inshares.
c Long-TermIncentives i Performance Share Plan Annual awards over shares made under the 2004 Performance Share Plan only vest if defined levels of total shareholder returnare attained over three years beginninginthe year of award.
The award shares are divided equally into two tranches, so as to measure TSR relative to the FTSE100, and to the major companies in the medical devices industry respectively.
TSR performance of the Sterling priced ordinary shares against the FTSE100 companies and the US Dollar priced ADR TSR performance against major companies in the medical devices industry the majority of whichare US listed were identified as the most suitable measures to encourage high levels of business performance and align the interests of the Group, its shareholders and seniorexecutives.
59 The medical devices companies for comparison for the 2005 award which the Committee considered appropriate to the Companyare: Arthrocare Guidant Bard Johnson& Johnson Baxter Medtronic BectonDickinson Nobel Biocare Biomet Orthofix BostonScientific Stryker Coloplast Group St Jude Medical Conmed Synthes-Stratec D J Ortho WrightMedical Edwards Life Sciences Corp Zimmer The shares of each tranche will vest if the Groups TSR is ranked at the median level in that tranche.
If, in relation to either tranche, the Group ranks at median, 25% of the award of that tranche will vest and if the Group is at the th th 75 centile, then all of the shares of that tranche will vest.
Between the median and 75 centiles, the shares will th vest on a straight-line basis.
If the Group is above the 75 centile, then the number of shares increases above the award on a straight-line basis up to a maximum of 150% of the award if the Group is ranked at or above the th 90 centile.
In relation to awards made to executive directors, the initial market value of the award shares is equivalent to their basic annual salary and in relation to awards made to other GEC members, the initial market value of the awards is equivalent to 75% of their basic annualsalary.
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to reduce the number or percentage of shares which vest if, notwithstanding the Group is ranked at or above the median level in respect of either tranche of award shares, the Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that the growth in the Groups TSR achieved for either tranche is not a genuine reflection of the Groups underlying financial performance.
The Groups TSR performance and its performance relative to the comparator group is independently monitored and reported to the Remuneration Committee by .
ii ExecutiveShare Options In 2005, share options were granted under the 2004 Executive Share Option Plan and 2001 UK Approved Plan for UK resident executive directors and executives.
Under the 2004 Plan, the maximum market value of options which may be granted each year is equivalent to the basic annual salary of the director or executive.
Options are exercisable up to ten years from the date of grant and are only exercisable if graduated target levels of growth in EPSA over the three-year performance period are achieved, beginning with that in which the option is granted.
Options were granted under the 2001 UK Approved Plan up to the value of 30,000 and formed part of the overall grant.
 these awards were exactly the same as for the 2004 Plan.
The target levels of performance are set by the Remuneration Committee for each grant.
For 2005 they were: 25% of the option shares will vest if growth in EPSA over the three-year period ending 31 December 2007 is 26% i. e. 8% compounded annually with 50% vesting if such growth is 48% i. e. 14% compounded annually.
Only if growth in EPSA over that period exceeds 73% i. e. 20% compounded annually will all of the option shares vest.
Option shares will vest pro rata on a straight-line basis if growth in EPSA is between these levels.
There is no retesting of .
iii Co-investmentPlan The 2004 Co-investment Plan enables selected executives to take part of their annual bonus in the form of shares.
The participant elects the level of bonus to be used for this purpose up to a maximum of one half of the annual gross bonus capped at 20% of basic annual salary for executive directors and members of GEC.
The net amountof the gross amountelected willthen be used to purchase shares.
For the 2005 award, and provided such shares are held for three years, and the participant remains employed within Smith & Nephew, the participant will be entitled to matching shares if the Company achieves a target level of growth in EPSA over that three-year period of 48% i. e. 14% compounded annually.
At this level, the participant is entitled to one matching share for every share acquired out of the gross equivalent amount of the net bonus used to acquire shares.
If growth in EPSA is 60% or more i. e. 17% compounded annually the 60 participant is entitled to two matching shares for each share acquired out of the gross equivalent amount of the net bonus applied to shares.
There is no sliding scale nor pro-rata vesting of matching awards between these performancelevels, noris there any retesting.
In the event of a change of control of the Company, the Remuneration Committee will determine what proportion of the awards or options will vest and what proportionof the matchingshares willbe transferred to the executives taking into account both the proportion of the performance period and the performance of the Company over that period.
In the event that an executive resigns or if employment is terminated for cause, all the options lapse.
If an executive retires or leaves for other reasons, the award is pro-rated for the proportion of the performance period then elapsed.
Theprorated award is still subject to the attainment of the  vesting.
The following table provides a comparison of variable remuneration of executive directors and GEC members and the next level down i. e. business unit management shown as a percentage of salary.
Except for the annual bonus, the componentsare measured over a three year period.

Senior executives are expected to build and maintaina personal equity stake inthe Company.
Executive directors are required to accumulate a personal holding equivalent to 100% of basic salary within five years and members of GEC are required to accumulatea personal holdingequivalent to 75% of basic salary withinfive years.
Long-Term Incentive Plans Pre 2004 The Performance Share Plan adopted in 2004 and described above replaced the long-term incentive plan LTIP established in 1997 for executive directors and members of the GEC and no further awards will be made under this LTIP.
a 1997 LTIP The last award under the 1997 LTIP was made in2003 and vested at the end of 2005.
Under the plan, shares are transferred to participants depending on the Groups performance relative to a group of 39 UK listed manufacturing companies with substantial international activities using TSR over a three-year period as the prime measure.
The maximum value of shares awarded for executive directors has not exceeded the participants annual rate of basic salary at the date the award was granted, and for members of the GEC it has not exceeded 75% of their annual basic salary.
Shares will only be transferred to the participants if the Groups TSR performance is at or above the median performance of the comparator companies, and growth in the Groups EPSA exceeds growth in the United Kingdom Retail Price Index RPI in the same three-year period.
At the median level, 25% of the award shares will vest.
If the Groups performance is in the top quartile, all the shares will vest.
For performancebetween the median and the top quartile, the proportionof shares vesting willvary ona straight-line basis.
TSR subject to real EPSA growth was identified and selected as the performance conditionthat represented a fair measure of the Groups performanceand wouldreflect increases inshareholder value.
th For the three-year plan period commencing 2003, the Groups TSR of 41.06% was ranked 17 in the comparator group and the earnings per share performance criterion was met, enabling the plan participants to be eligible for 49% of the shares awarded conditionallyin2003.
Theremainderof the awards therefore lapse.
61 In line with market practice in 1997 every encouragement was given to executive directors and senior managers to build up a significant shareholding in the Group.
Accordingly, participants in the LTIP who have not left the Group, at the fifth and seventh anniversaries of the date of the award, are given one additional share for every five so retained.
This provision was not continued in the 2004 Plans when a threshold stock requirement was incorporated.
 the LTIP comprised the followingcompanies: Aga Foodservice Group Croda International Invensys Smiths Group AstraZeneca Group fide La Rue JohnsonMatthey Spirax-Sarco Engineering BAE Systems Delta LairdGroup Spirent BalfourBeatty Elementis Low& Bonar Tate & Lyle BBA Group FKI MorganCrucible Tomkins BOC Group GKN Pilkington TTElectronics Bunzl GlaxoSmithKline Reckitt Benckiser Unilever UK Cadbury Schweppes Halma REXAM WeirGroup Charter ICI Rolls-Royce CooksonGroup IMI Scapa Group The Groups TSR performance and its performance relative to the comparator group was independently monitoredand reported to the  by .
b 2001 Share Option Plans The 2001 UK Approved Share Option Plan, the 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan and the 2001 US Share Plan are now, in the main, for the benefit of those executives not eligible for the 2004 share incentive plans.
Each year the Remuneration Committee determines the maximum value of options to be granted to executives by reference to multiples of salary.
With the exception of the 2001 US Share Plan, the exercise of options is subject to EPSA growth of not less than RPI plus 3% per annum, on average, in a period of three consecutive years.
From 2005, the retesting of the performance conditions no longer applies.
Performance conditions were selected to be in line with market practice at the time.
The awards made in 2003 will vest in 2006 as EPSA growth over the three year performance period exceeded the RPI 3% target.
Options granted under the 2001 US Share Plan, in line with US market practice, are not subject to performance targets but are exercisable cumulatively up to a maximum of 10% after oneyear, 30% after two years, 60% after three years and the remainingbalance after fouryears.
Executive share options under all 2001 schemes are not offered at a discount to the market value at the time of grant and wouldvest ona changeincontrol.
2005 Remuneration Committee Initiatives During 2005, the Committee reviewed the current share incentive plans in respect of grant levels, performance criteriaand vesting schedules and determined that they remained appropriate.
With the transition to IFRS at the beginning of 2005 the Committee was satisfied that the performance measures remained consistent with those under UK GAAP as the impact of IFRS on EPSA and other measures was minor.
Likewise the Committee considered that the redenomination of the share capital of the Company into US Dollars, effected on 23 January 2006, will not warrant any changes to the performance criteria of the share incentive plans as the overall effect on the performance measures would be minor.
The annual bonus plans would be unaffected in the longer term but the Remuneration Committee will review the transition to reporting in US Dollars in2006.
The Remuneration Committee has determined that there was a need to increase the maximum multiples of annual remuneration applied to awards under the 2001 Share Option Plans to keep in line with competitive practice and to minimise the increasing risk of executive attrition.
These option plans are seen as an essential part of the remuneration package for executives not eligible for the 2004 share incentive plans.
Accordingly the maximum multiples applied were increased from one times to one and a half times annual remuneration in the UK and from oneand a half times to two and a quarter times  US.
The Remuneration Committee has also agreed, for the same attrition risk reasons in the US, to change the original 2004 guidance that participants in the 2004 Share Plan would no longer receive awards under existing 62 discretionary share plans.
For 2006 and future years US participants of the 2004 share incentive plans will also be eligible for awards under the 2001 US Share Plan subject to the explicit approval of the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee has also considered the implications of the impending changes to UK pensions taxation and has agreed that: a an earnings cap on final pensionable salary calculated in the same way as the UK Inland Revenue earnings cap will be retained in the defined benefit plans to limit the defined benefit obligations: b there will be no future service accruals under the supplementary unfunded arrangement and an equivalent non-pensionable non-bonusable salary supplement will be paid instead and: c a non-pensionable, non-bonusable salary supplement of 30% of basic salary will be offered as an alternative where an executive does not wishto take further pensionprovision either defined benefit ordefined contribution.
ShareSaveSchemes UK executive directors and members of GEC are eligible to contribute to the Smith & Nephew Employee Share Option Scheme ShareSave and US members of the GEC are eligible to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
Pensions UK UK based executive directors and members of GEC have a normal retirement age of 62.
Those in service pre-2003 participate in the defined benefit Smith & Nephew UK Pension Fund and UK Executive Pension Scheme, under which pension has been accrued in the year at an annual rate of one-thirtieth of final pensionable salary up to a limit based on service of two-thirds of final pensionable salary, subject to Inland Revenue constraints.
Pensions in payment are guaranteed to increase by 5% per annum or the rate of inflation in the UK, if lower.
Death in service cover of four times salary and spouses pension at the rate of two thirds of the members pensionare provided ondeath.
Those commencing employment post 2002 participate in the defined contribution plan to which a company contribution of 30% of pensionable salary is made.
Death in service cover of seven times salary of which four times is provided as a lump sum is provided on death.
A supplementary unfunded defined contribution arrangement partially compensates for the UK Inland Revenue earningscap onfinal pensionable salary.
Pensions US US based executive directors and members of GEC participate in either the defined benefit Smith & Nephew US Pension Plan or the defined contribution US Savings Plan 401 k Plus.
Any new executives would enter the US Savings Plan 401 k Plus.
Under the US Pension Plan, pensions accrue at an annual rate of approximately one-sixty second of final pensionable salary up to a limit based on service of 60% of final pensionable salary.
The plan also provides for a spouses pension at the rate of one half of the members pension on death.
Normal retirement age under the plan is 65.
A supplementary defined benefit plan is used to enable defined benefits to be payable from age 62 without reduction for early retirement.
A supplementary defined contribution plan is used to compensate for the earnings cap imposed by the US Internal Revenue Code and to provide additional retirement benefits.
The Remuneration Committee considers pension consequences and costs to the Company when determining basic salary increases for executive directors and members of GEC.
ServiceContracts All appointments of executive directors are intended to have twelve month notice periods, but it is recognised that for some new appointments a longer period may initially be necessary for competitive reasons, reducing to twelve monthsthereafter.
Sir Christopher ODonnell, appointed to the Board of Directors in September 1992, has a service agreement with nd the Company dated January 1992 which expires on his 62 birthday in October 2008.
Peter Hooley, appointed to the Board of Directors in April 1991 has a service contract with the Company dated January 1992 which nd expires on his 62 birthday in June 2008 although he has informed the Board that he wishes to take early retirement during 2006.
Both service agreements are terminable by the Company on not more than twelve months notice and by the executive director on six months notice.
There is no enhancement of termination rights on a change of control of the Group.
During 2005 termination of the contract by the Group, except for cause, would entitle the executive directors to twelve months basic salary, bonus at target of 30%, a contribution of 30% 63 of salary to reflect the loss of pension benefits, an amount to cover other benefits and a time apportionment of the performance share plan entitlement.
The Committee has determined not to amend the contracts of the current executive directors for mitigation, but it does have discretion to require mitigation for newly appointed directors.
David Illingworth, appointed to the Board of Directors in February 2006, has a letter of appointment with the Company with a normal retirement age of 62.
Upon appointment to the Board, his services are terminable by the Company on 24 months notice as is common competitive practice with very senior appointments, such period reducing to 12 months within 24 months from the date of appointment to the Board, and by him on six months notice.
Termination of the contract by the Group, except for cause, would entitle him to 24 months reducing to 12 months within 24 months from date of appointment to the Board basic salary, bonus at target of 50%, a contribution to reflect the loss of pension benefits, an amount to cover other benefits and a time apportionment of the performance share plan entitlement.
External  Non-executive directorships provide executive directors with valuable experience beneficial to the Company.
Such appointments are subject to the approval of the Nominations Committee and are restricted to one appointment for each executive director.
All fees receivable by a directorare paid to the Company.
 Non-executive directors do not have service contracts but instead have letters of appointment.
Non-executive directors are normally appointed for three terms of three years terminable at will, without notice by either the Group or the director and without compensation.
The Chairman has a three month notice period.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Nominations Committee who aim to set fees that are competitive with other companies of equivalent size and complexity.
Non-executive directors are expected to accumulate a personal holding in the Company equivalent to once times the annual basic fee, within three years.
The Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and the Senior Independent Director receive an extra 7,500 for their additional responsibilities.
In 2005, Dr. Rolf Stomberg waived his extra fee entitlement due to him as SeniorIndependent Director.

The increase in the transfer value is as a result of a change in the underlying factor to reflect current market conditions, the unwinding of the previous years salary increase within the definition of final pensionable salary, the accrual of an additional one year of service and the increase in pension as a result of the salary increase granted duringthe year.
No amounts have been paid to third parties in respect of directors services and no excess retirement benefits or compensationhave been paid to past directors.
