The Company operates an annual performance-related bonus scheme for Executive Directors and senior executives.
The maximum bonus payment under the scheme is 100 per cent of base salary for Mr Hirst and 70 per cent of base salary for Mr Fisher and Mr Bain.
To reach this maximum requires that the Company exceeds its budgeted profit as well as achievement of clearly defined individual objectives.
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the performance conditions for the annual bonus are relevant and stretching and designed to enhance shareholder value Long-term incentives The Company operates a long-term incentive plan and the share option schemes described below.

Benefits under the long-term incentive plan are not pensionable.
The Companys executive shareholding policy requires Executive Directors and other senior executives to retain a number of the shares The Company currently operates an executive share option scheme, acquired as a result of the exercise of executive share options or awards under which both Inland Revenue approved and unapproved options under the long-term incentive plan until a shareholding with a value equal may be granted, and an SAYE option scheme.
Benefits under these to the executives annual base salary is reached.

The Remuneration Committee is currently reviewing pension policy in the light of the proposed changes to pension legislation from April 2006.
Further details will be included in the next annual Remuneration Report.
Relative importance of remuneration elements The Committees view is that the performance related elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors should be a significant element of the total.
This serves to align the interests of such Directors with shareholders.
Assuming full payment of all elements, more than two-thirds of the total remuneration of Executive Directors ignoring pension contributions would be performance related.
Service contracts In accordance with the Companys policy, Mr Hirst, Mr Fisher and Mr Bain have service agreements which are terminable by the Company on twelve months notice.
Mr Hirsts and Mr Bains service agreements, dated 13th November 1998 and 23rd April 2004 respectively, allow the Company to make a payment of salary in lieu of the whole or part of their notice periods and Mr Fishers agreement, dated 24th November 1994, contains provisions entitling him to a payment equal to 12 months salary and benefits in the event of early termination.
The Companys policy is generally not to include a provision providing for payment of a fixed sum on termination and to endeavour to minimise any payment on early termination by insisting on mitigation of any loss.
The provisions in Mr Fishers agreement were included as part of the reduction in his notice period from 24 months during 2001.

The following table sets out the final salary pension benefits accruing to relevant Executive Directors.
Mr Bain does not receive any final salary benefits and therefore does not appear in this table.
Final salary Additional final salary Transfer value of final Transfer value of final B-A pension accrued as at pension earned during the salary benefits as at salary benefits as at 30th January 2005 year including inflation 1st February 2004 30th January 2005 excluding inflation A B p. a. p. a.

The accrued final salary pension shown at 30th January 2005 is the combined figure for the UK Scheme and US Plan defined benefit accruals and is the amount that the Director would be entitled to from normal retirement age if he left service at the end of the year.
The increase in final salary pension during the year is the increase over the figure disclosed in last years accounts both including and excluding an allowance for inflation during the year.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice.
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of the Directors final salary pension benefits.
They do not represent sums payable to individual Directors and therefore they cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The table above shows transfer values at the beginning and the end of the year.
As the transfer values are linked to investment market conditions, a slight fall in investment yields over the year has been a factor in the increase in transfer values which is shown.
Members contributions paid during the year were paid into the money purchase arrangement within the UK Scheme and as such are not included in the transfer value.

The other options listed above are executive options which are subject to the performance conditions described under the heading Long-term incentives on page 38.

Performance graph The graph below shows the total shareholder return for a holding of the Companys ordinary shares for the five financial years of the Company of which the year to 30th January 2005 is the last.
This is compared to the total shareholder return for a hypothetical holding in the FTSE mid-250 Index excluding investment trusts.
This was chosen as it is the index of which the Company is a constituent and the index used for the purposes of the long-term incentive plan.
Total shareholder return is the growth in value of a share plus the value of dividends paid, assuming that the dividends are reinvested in the Companys shares on the day on which they are paid.
