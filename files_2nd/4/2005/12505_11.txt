Directors remuneration report For the year ended 31 December 2005 This report, prepared by the Remuneration Committee the Committee on behalf of the Board, has been prepared pursuant to Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 and the Listing Rules issued by the Financial Services Authority.
Remuneration Committee Role The Remuneration Committee is responsible, pursuant to a policy framework on executive remuneration agreed by the Board, for determining the pay and benets and contractual arrangements for the Chairman, executive directors and the Company Secretary, and for overseeing the Groups share schemes.
The Committee also recommends and monitors the structure and levels of remuneration for senior managers throughout the Group.
It operates under the delegated authority of the Board, and its terms of reference are available to view on the Groups website www.
It is committed to principles of accountability and transparency to ensure that remuneration arrangements demonstrate a clear link between reward and performance.
In its work, the Committee considers fully the principles and provisions of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
Membership The Committee comprised the following independent non-executive directors during the financial year to 31 December 2005: Mr D L Felwick CBE Committee Chairman.
Meetings The directors attendance at Committee meetings held during their period of membership and the number of meetings held during 2005 is set out on page 31.
The Chairman, Mr D J Kappler, and the Group Chief Executive, Mr R J Schoeld, are invited to attend the Committee meetings, except when the Committee discusses matters relating to their remuneration.
Advisers Deloitte & Touche LLP Deloitte were appointed by the Committee as their retained advisers in 2005, and continue to provide advice to the Committee on matters relating to remuneration, including market comparison data and best practice.
During the year, Deloitte also provided advice on software implementation and valuation services and also provided finance staff secondment to the Group.
The Committee consults with the Chairman and the Chief Executive as appropriate, and is also supported by the Director of Human Resources.
Remuneration policy The broad policy of the Board and the Committee is to continue to set remuneration so as to attract and retain high-calibre executives and to encourage and reward superior business performance.
Remuneration for executive directors is intended to reward against performance criteria that are relevant and realistic but also challenging, so that superior performance is encouraged.
Therefore, remuneration arrangements will continue to focus on performance-related incentives, rather than annual salary, to encourage the alignment of operating objectives as well as delivering shareholder value.
Remuneration policy is reviewed annually.
For 2006, annual salary will continue to be set at levels not normally exceeding median.
In relation to bonuses and long-term incentive plans, the policy will continue to be to provide an opportunity for executives to earn total remuneration packages in the upper quartile range, provided that stretching and demanding performance conditions are met.
The Committee have reviewed all aspects of the remuneration policy, including pay benchmarking for the most senior roles and a consideration of performance measures used, and have not made any changes to the remuneration policy adopted in 2005.
The remuneration policy in place for senior executives is designed to place emphasis on key performance objectives and strengthening executive shareholding.
While committed to the use of equity-based performance-related remuneration as a means of aligning directors interests with those of shareholders, the Committee is aware of shareholders concerns on dilution through the issue of new shares to satisfy such awards.
Therefore, when reviewing remuneration arrangements, the Committee takes into account the effects such arrangements may have on dilution.
In determining the remuneration arrangements for executive directors, the Committee is sensitive to the pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group, especially when determining base salary increases.
38 Premier Foods plc Share ownership A minimum shareholding requirement has been introduced in 2006 whereby executive directors are required after three years to hold shares with a market value at least equal to their annual basic salary.
At 31 December 2005, Mr Schoeld held shares with a total market value equivalent to 5.72 times his annual basic salary and Mr Thomas held shares with a total market value equivalent to 4.29 times his annual basic salary.
Remuneration for executive directors The Committee considers that the remuneration package of an executive director should be aligned closely with the interests of shareholders and, therefore, that a significant proportion of the remuneration package should be performance related.
In arriving at the balance between xed and variable remuneration it is agreed that the xed portion will relate only to annual salary, whilst the variable portion includes both annual bonuses and awards made under the long-term incentive plan.
It is the Committees policy that, for 2006, the balance between xed and variable remuneration for the executive directors shall be as follows: Fixed vs. variable for Chief Executive Officer Fixed vs. variable for Finance Director Target Max Target Max n Fixed n Fixed 36% 39% 44% 43% 56% n Variable n Variable 57% 61% 64% Basic salary Basic salary for executive directors takes into account the responsibilities and performance of the individual.
This is normally reviewed annually unless responsibilities change.
Salary levels are targeted at the median of companies of a comparable size, complexity and market sector.
Annual bonus At the discretion of the Committee, executive directors are eligible to receive an annual bonus subject to the achievement of performance targets which are set each year by the Committee.
Bonus potentials are set on an individual basis.
For 2006, the annual bonus potentials are set at 75% of salary for executive directors, with a target level of 50% of salary.
The performance targets will be based on profit before tax and growth in branded sales.
In addition, until the executive directors have built up a significant personal shareholding in the Company see page 42, they are required to defer 50% of any bonus earned into shares in the Company.
The deferred bonus shares will normally vest three years after their award.
Generally, the deferred bonus shares will not be forfeitable.
However, in the event that the executives employment is terminated by reason of his gross misconduct or by reason of a material breach of his employment contract, his deferred bonus shares may, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, be forfeited.
Long-Term Incentive Plan Following adoption of the Premier Foods Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the first awards were made on 26 May 2005 see page 44.
The closing mid-market share price on that date was 302.5p.
It is the Committees intention that awards under the LTIP will be granted annually.
The value of shares awarded to executive directors, under the LTIP, in any financial year will be subject to individual limits that will be determined by the Committee from time to time.
The current policy is that the maximum value of shares that may be awarded to executive directors, in any financial year, will be limited to 100% of salary.
For 2006, it is intended that the awards will have a value of 100% of salary for Mr Schoeld and 80% of salary for Mr Thomas.
The Committee has reviewed the performance conditions which applied to awards made under the scheme in 2005, and considers that they remain appropriate for the awards to be made in 2006.
Vesting of awards is subject to the fullment of stretching performance conditions based on total shareholder return TSR, as measured over a three-year period against appropriate comparators.
TSR measures the growth in share price, as adjusted for reinvested dividends over the performance period.
The Committee considers TSR to be the most appropriate measure to align executives interests with those of shareholders.
Relative TSR performance will be measured against two appropriate comparator groups: 50% based on performance measured against the FTSE 250 excluding investment companies and 50% based on performance measured against a group of relevant companies from the food sector.
The Committee considers that splitting the vesting of the award in this way ensures that performance is correctly targeted against the Groups key comparators.
For both parts of awards, 30% will vest for median performance, rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting for upper quartile performance.
The TSR calculations will be conducted on an independent basis by Deloitte.
39 Premier Foods plc Directors remuneration report The constituents of the food sector comparator group for the 2005 awards were: Food sector comparator group Arla Foods plc Devro PLC Robert Wiseman Dairies PLC Associated British Foods PLC Kerry Group plc Tate & Lyle PLC Cadbury Schweppes plc Greencore plc Uniq plc Cranswick plc Northern Foods plc Dairy Crest Group plc Richmond Foods plc With the exception of Kerry Group plc all other constituents were selected at the date of the Companys listing on 22 June 2004.
The original group included Geest plc who were taken over on 16 May 2005.
As permitted under the rules of the scheme, Kerry Group plc was substituted for Geest plc from the start of the performance period.
In addition, the vesting of awards will be subject to a secondary financial measure, to ensure that underlying financial performance is also achieved.
The Committee will have the power to scale back awards if it is felt that underlying financial performance has not been adequate.
The vesting of awards granted in 2005 were, and any intended for 2006 are, subject to the minimum requirement that earnings per share EPS must have exceeded the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index by an average of at least 2% per annum, over the three-year performance period.
EPS is dened as earnings per ordinary share as reported in the Companys financial statements adjusted to remove the effect of exceptional items and amortisation, provided that the Remuneration Committee shall have discretion to make further adjustments as they determine are fair and reasonable including to take account of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, subject to the consent of the Audit Committee.
The Committee may determine that an alternative secondary financial measure will apply for future grants of awards under the LTIP.
During the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS to the extent that any material adjustments are considered appropriate to ensure a like-for-like comparison these will be reviewed and agreed by the auditors.
Share options The Premier Foods plc Executive Share Option Scheme the ESOS The ESOS was adopted by the Company at the time of Admission.
Options granted under the ESOS may be exercised between three and 10 years after grant provided that the applicable performance criteria have been met.
Options were granted to executive directors under the ESOS at the time of Admission in 2004.
The grants were split into three portions, each subject to a stretching performance condition.
Two of the portions representing 50% of the total award are subject to a performance condition based on total shareholder return TSR, and the third portion representing the other 50% of the total award is subject to a performance condition based on adjusted earnings per share EPS.
The performance conditions which are summarised in the table below were chosen because they align the interests of executive directors with those of shareholders.
TSR: against FTSE 250 TSR: against select comparator group:- EPS Associated British Foods PLC Dairy Crest Group plc Greencore plc 1 Kerry Group plc Northern Foods plc Uniq plc 25% of option 25% of option 50% of option 50% of the above portion vests for 50% of the above portion if the Company Increase in adjusted earnings per share median performance, rising on a is in fourth position must be equal or exceed the cumulative straight-line basis to full vesting for increase in the retail price index plus upper quartile performance 75% of the above portion if the Company 3% per annum, over the three-year is in third position performance period Full vesting of the above portion if the Company is in first or second position of the comparator group None of the above portion if the Company is below fourth position No retesting No retesting One retest at end of fourth year from same base year 1 Kerry Group plc replaced Geest plc which was taken over on 16 May 2005.
With the exception of Kerry Group plc all other constituents were selected at the date of the Companys listing on 22 June 2004.
The current intention is that no further options will be granted under the ESOS, other than in exceptional circumstances e. g. in relation to recruitment.
40 Premier Foods plc Directors remuneration report Performance graph The following graph shows the TSR performance of the Company since listing in July 2004, against the FTSE 250 which was chosen because it represents a broad equity market index of which the Company is a constituent and the FTSE Food Producers and Processors Index which was chosen because it contains the Companys key comparators.
TSR was calculated by reference to the growth in share price, as adjusted for reinvested dividends.

41 Premier Foods plc Directors remuneration report TSR rebased to 100 at July 2004 Service contracts The Committee periodically reviews the Companys policy on the duration of directors service contracts, and the notice periods and termination provisions contained in those contracts.

The increase in accrued benefit earned during the year represents the increase in this expected pension including the effect of ination when compared with the position at 31 December 2004.
The increase in accrued pension excluding the effect of ination over the year is also shown.

The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of the directors pension benets.
They do not represent sums payable to individual directors and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
For each director, the value of the increase in accrued benefit under the requirements of Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 is the amount obtained by subtracting from the transfer value of the total accrued benefit at 31 December 2005 the corresponding transfer value at 31 December 2004.
The value of the increase in accrued benefit under the Listing Rules is the transfer value at 31 December 2005 of the increase in accrued benefit during the period, excluding ination.
The transfer values disclosed above are net of directors contributions and do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual director.
Instead, they represent a potential liability of the pension scheme.
