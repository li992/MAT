1 Directors Remuneration Report The Directors of Capital Radio plc have pleasure in submitting their Remuneration Report for the period 1 October 2004 to 31 March 2005.
This Report, which complies with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, sets out how the principles of the Combined Code relating to Directors remuneration are applied.
A revised version of the Combined Code was published in July 2003 and applies to Capital Radio plc to be renamed GCap Media plc on completion of the merger of Capital Radio plc with GWR Group plc the Merger as at 9 May 2005 the Company for the six month financial period commencing 1 October 2004.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the Group was compliant with the provisions of the revised Combined Code relating to Directors remuneration throughout the period.
The information that has been audited in this report comprises the Directors emoluments table on page 26, the share options table on page 27, the long term incentive plan table on page 28 and the pensions disclosure on page 30.
A resolution will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting on 20 October 2005 inviting them to consider and approve this Report.
1 Remuneration Committee The Board has overall responsibility for determining the framework of executive remuneration and is required to take account of any recommendations made by the Remuneration Committee.
The Board has delegated to the Remuneration Committee, through formal terms of reference, oversight of the specific remuneration packages for the Executive Directors, Chairman and Company Secretary and consideration of executive remuneration issues generally, including the use of share incentive plans.
For the period up to the completion of the Merger on 9 May 2005, the Remuneration Committee was chaired by Peter Mitchell and consists exclusively of independent Non-executive Directors.
Members throughout this period were Peter Mitchell, Tim Mason, Tony Illsley and Peter W Williams.
The Committee, which met once during the period, reviews and advises the Board on the Companys general policy on executive remuneration and applies it when considering the terms of service, remuneration, share options and other benefits of the Executive Directors, including where appropriate severance payments.
The Chairman and the Chief Executive normally attend meetings of the Remuneration Committee, but are not present at any discussions concerning their own remuneration.
The terms of reference permit the Remuneration Committee to obtain its own external advice on any matter at the Companys expense.
For the period under review, the Committee was assisted internally by the Companys Director of Human Resources.
2 Remuneration policy for Executive Directors The Merger will be completed on 9 May 2005.
As a result of the Merger, the composition of the Companys executive management and of the Remuneration Committee will change with immediate effect, as detailed on page 7 and 8.
Details of executive incentive plans approved by the new Committee and the related Resolutions for which shareholder approval is being sought at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting on 20 October 2005 are set out in the explanatory note on pages 65 and 66.
The Committee aims to provide a competitive remuneration package to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and senior executives of the highest calibre and with the experience needed to shape and execute the Companys strategy and deliver shareholder value.
The Committee takes account of external market data supplied by independent professional advisers and is sensitive to the wider scene, including pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group, especially when determining annual salary increases.
The Committee also takes account of the remuneration paid by the Companys comparator group in the market.
During the period under review the Committee took advice from Monks Partnership and New Bridge Street Consultants.
They did not provide any other services to the Company during this period.
1 Being the Directors of the Company listed on page 6 of this document.
19 Directors Remuneration Report continued The Committees policy is for a significant proportion of executive reward to be variable and dependent upon the Groups performance, and for target performance-related incentives for Executive Directors to equate to well over half of the total potential remuneration.
Variable reward components provide an opportunity for higher levels of remuneration where this is supported by exceptional performance whether at an individual level or in relation to the Groups short-term and longer-term business priorities.
Variable rewards will continue to be provided through a balanced mix of performance-related elements.
The Annual Bonus Scheme supports operational objectives over the financial year, whilst the Companys Long Term Incentive Plan will reward superior performance over a longer period and the 1998 Share Option Scheme will support the Companys growth objectives and reward share price improvement.
The remuneration of the Executive Directors consists of: Basic salary which is based on comparable positions in leading businesses of similar size and complexity.
Annual bonus scheme which is based on achievement of stretching revenue and financial targets and individual performance-related targets.
The bonus is normally paid partly in cash and partly in shares with a deferred share element if the individual remains in service for three years.
Details of performance criteria are set out on page 21.
In exceptional circumstances, the Committee has power to award bonuses outside this scheme.
Share option scheme under which an annual grant of up to 110% of basic salary is made during the financial year at the market price on the date of grant.
Details of performance criteria are set out on page 23.
Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP under which an annual conditional share award of up to 110% of basic salary measured in terms of share price on the date of grant is made during the financial year entitling a Director, at the end of a three-year period, to a number of shares in the Company determined by reference to the achievement of demanding performance criteria.
Details of performance criteria are set out on page 22.
Pension a part of the package is to provide appropriate pension arrangements, having regard to individual circumstances.
These are either final salary or money purchase arrangements.
There are no elements of remuneration, other than basic salary, which are pensionable.
Profit related bonus under which all employees may receive a bonus up to a maximum of 10% of salary, dependent on the Group meeting its profit targets.
Further details of each element of the Executive Directors remuneration package, together with details of interests in shares and share options, are set out below in this Report.
The following graphs show Capital Radios Cumulative Total Shareholder Return TSR for the five years to 31 March 2005.
This is compared against the Companys specific peers in the FTSE Media and Entertainment Index, as well as for general purposes monitored against the FTSE 250 Index in which the Company is also listed and is therefore of interest to our shareholders.
Both of these indices are used as performance criteria for determining the exercisability of share options granted to Executive Directors under the 1998 Share Option Scheme.

The Committees policy has been to maintain a salary structure based upon the mid-market of its comparator group of companies.
The Company structures remuneration packages which are appropriate to the particular function and level of responsibility of each individual executive and which are designed to attract, retain and motivate the individuals.
It takes into account the remuneration structures and levels at other companies, in particular in the media sector.
The Remuneration Committee is made aware of pay conditions in the Group when it is considering annual salary increases.
All Executive Directors receive company car and private healthcare benefits.
Life and disability insurance is provided as part of the pension arrangements for each Executive Director.
b Annual Bonus Scheme The Company operates an annual bonus scheme which is reviewed each year by the Remuneration Committee and under which each Executive Director is able to earn a bonus of a maximum of 100% of basic salary, dependent upon performance conditions being met.
The bonus is normally payable 65% in cash and 35% in shares.
The cash element and half of the share allocation is payable immediately after announcement of results for the financial year.
The remaining balance of the shares will be awarded after three years, provided the Executive Director is still in employment and has retained his or her original share allocation.
The value of the deferred element is derived from annual bonus criteria and the release of shares under this element is not dependent on satisfaction of a further performance condition.
For the financial period ended 31 March 2005, challenging performance targets were set on a sliding scale and included a mix of financial, personal and strategic measures whereby a maximum of 80% of basic salary was payable for achievement of targets for the Group underlying profit before tax and a maximum of 20% of basic salary was payable for achievement of personal targets.
For this period, the Committee has determined that the threshold for payment of the corporate element was not reached, but that the personal targets were met in full by each of the Executive Directors.
This has resulted in payment of the bonuses described on page 26.
Immediately prior to completion of the Merger, the Committee considered whether special bonuses should be payable for additional services in respect of the period up to completion of the Merger.
The bonuses approved by the Committee will be disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report for the financial year ending 31 March 2006.
21 Directors Remuneration Report continued c Share Incentive Plans It is the Remuneration Committees policy that Executive Directors should participate in the Companys Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP and the 1998 Share Option Scheme because these schemes align the Executive Directors interests with those of our shareholders by linking the reward available to participants to total shareholder return and share price performance respectively.
Executive Directors may also participate in the Capital Radio Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE.
This is open to all full time members of the Group who have been employed for more than twelve months at the date of grant of the options.
Details of all share incentive awards outstanding for each Executive Director are set out on page 13.
All Executive Directors future entitlements are subject to the performance conditions applicable to the relevant scheme as set out below: Long-Term Incentive Plan Under the LTIP, the Executive Directors may be granted each year up to 110% of basic salary measured in terms of share price on date of grant in conditional performance-related awards entitling them, at the end of a three year period, to a number of shares in the Company determined by reference to growth in Total Shareholder Return TSR over that period.
TSR is defined as the aggregate of a the increase or decrease in the market value of a share over the three year period, b the aggregate of gross dividends paid in respect of a share over the three year period and c the value arising from the re-investment of those dividends in further shares.
The figure is then expressed as an inflation-adjusted compound annual rate of growth over the market value of a share at the start of that period.
Awards generally lapse if a participant leaves the employment of the Group before the end of the three year period.
There is no performance retest for these awards.
The Remuneration Committee selected this performance condition for the LTIP because it aligns the Executive Directors interests with those of our shareholders by linking the reward available to participants to total shareholder return growth achieved by the Company.
The extent to which a participants conditional award vests at the end of the three-year period is set out in the following table: Percentage Total annual of conditional shareholder return award realisable Up to 7.5% 0% Above 7.5% and up to 8.5% 25% Above 8.5% and up to 9.5% 30% Above 9.5% and up to 10.5% 35% Above 10.5% and up to 11.5% 40% Above 11.5% and up to 12.5% 45% Above 12.5% and up to 13.0% 50% Above 13.0% and up to 14.0% 60% Above 14.0% and up to 15.0% 70% Above 15.0% and up to 17.5% 80% Above 17.5% and up to 20.0% 90% Above 20.0% 100% Awards under the LTIP can be satisfied by the issue of new Ordinary Shares, as well as the purchase of existing Ordinary Shares.
Any new Ordinary Shares issued under the Plan would count towards the overall limits on the percentage of the Companys equity which may be issued for employee share scheme purposes.
The LTIP is operated in conjunction with a discretionary trust operated by an independent trustee.
Cash amounts may be lent by the Company to the trustee in order to acquire shares on the London Stock Exchange for the purpose of fulfilling the awards.
The cost of funding projected awards under the Plan is amortised over the performance period of three years in accordance with guidance given by the Accounting Standards Board.
22 1998 Share Option Scheme It is the Remuneration Committees policy that the value of options granted to Executive Directors each year measured in terms of the exercise prices of those options under the 1998 Share Option Scheme should not exceed 110% of the individuals base salary, other than in exceptional circumstances.
Share option awards granted to the Executive Directors are subject to stringent performance conditions.
First, in common with other participants in the scheme, options will only normally be exercisable if the growth in the Companys earnings per share in any three-year period between the grant and exercise exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index over the same period by an average of at least 3% per annum.
Secondly, options granted to Executive Directors are split into two separate option pools: each pool will have its own separate hurdle, performance against which will be measured at the third anniversary of grant the Test Date.
For options granted before 16 December 2004, if options are not exercisable in full after the third anniversary of grant when measured against the performance condition of each option pool, the performance period may be extended for a maximum further two years, with a retest on the fourth and fifth anniversary of grant the Retest Dates.
For these options, in relation to each type of target the level of exercisability will increase if the Companys performance has improved as at any Retest Date, provided that the relevant option has not been exercised.
Once a particular level of exercisability has been attained, an option holder who delays exercise will not be prejudiced if performance subsequently falls.
Options granted after 16 December 2004 will only be exercisable to the extent that the performance condition of each option pool has been satisfied at the end of a single three-year performance period.
There is no performance retest for these options.
In the case of one half of the shares under option, the performance target will relate to the Companys percentage share price growth compared to the percentage growth in the FTSE 250 Index.
If at the Test Date or, if applicable, the Retest Dates, the Companys percentage share price growth equals or exceeds the percentage growth in the FTSE 250 Index over the same period share price growth being computed on the same basis as Index growth, then 50% of the option would be exercisable.
If the Companys percentage share price growth exceeds the percentage growth in the FTSE 250 Index by at least 25%, then 75% of that half of the option would be exercisable.
If the Companys percentage share price growth exceeds the percentage growth in the FTSE 250 Index by at least 50%, then that half of the option would be exercisable in full.
In the case of the other half of the shares under option, the performance target will relate to the TSR ranking against a comparator group.
The comparator group is the Media and Entertainment Index on the date of grant of each award a copy of the full list of comparator companies is available from the Company on request.
If at the Test Date or, if applicable, the Retest Dates, the Company ranks at the median point, 50% of the shares under the option would be exercisable: if the Company ranks at the 65th percentile, 75% of the shares under the options would be exercisable: at the 75th percentile, all of the shares under the option would be exercisable.
The Remuneration Committee selected these performance conditions for the 1998 Share Option Scheme because they align Executive Directors interests with those of our shareholders by linking the reward available to participants to the share price performance of the Company relative to two key indices used by shareholders the FTSE 250 Index and the FTSE Media and Entertainment Index.
23 Directors Remuneration Report continued d Service Contracts The Remuneration Committee regularly reviews all aspects of executive service contracts in the light of current practice and the specific circumstances of the Group.
All Executive Directors hold contracts terminable on 12 months notice.
The Committee recognises the advantage of service contracts including an explicit calculation of compensation payable on early termination, other than for misconduct or in other circumstances justifying summary termination.
The Committee believes that it is in the best interests of shareholders to retain key Executive Directors whilst providing certainty, and facilitating a speedy and clean break on early termination by agreeing liquidated damages which reflect a discount to take account of an agreed level of mitigation.

It can be terminated by the Company on 12 months notice, or by Mr Mansfield on 12 months notice.
The Company may at its discretion terminate the service contract without notice and make a payment in lieu of notice to Mr Mansfield equal to 95% of the sum of 12 months salary and the value of other benefits including annual bonus.
In the event of a constructive dismissal, Mr Mansfield is entitled to receive liquidated damages equal to the amount calculated on the basis of a termination by the Company.

24 Nathalie Schwarz was appointed a Director of the Company in December 2003 and resigned from the Board in January 2005.
Her service contract, which was dated 1 December 2003, provided for a rolling notice period of 12 months, and was terminable by the Company on 12 months notice, or by Ms Schwarz on 12 months notice.

Following termination, settlement arrangements were concluded in March 2005 as described on page 26 of this Report.
e External Appointments Capital Radio recognises that its Directors may be invited to become Non-executive Directors of other companies or to become involved in charitable or public service organisations.
As the Board believes that this can broaden the knowledge and experience of the Companys Directors to the benefit of the Company, it is the Companys policy to approve such appointments provided there is no conflict of interest and the commitment required is not excessive.
The Director concerned can retain the fees relating to any such appointment.
None of the Executive Directors holds any significant business directorships which are not directly related to the business of the Group.
Fees payable in relation to the services of Directors representing the Group on the boards of other companies are received and retained by the Group.
