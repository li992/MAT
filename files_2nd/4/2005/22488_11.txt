REPORT OF THE BOARD ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION Introduction The Directors Remuneration Report, having been approved by the board, is presented to shareholders in accordance with the reporting requirements of the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
The group has complied with the provisions of the Combined Code relating to directors remuneration throughout the year.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee determines the remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment of the executive directors and senior executives of the group.
The Committee consists entirely of non-executive directors, namely Messrs. M. G. A. McLintock chairman, P. N. Buckley and P. S. S. Macpherson.
The group chairman, Sir David Scholey, and the group chief executive, Mr. C. D. Keogh, attend meetings by invitation.
The board regards all members of the Committee as independent as explained in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 15 to 17.
Details of the number of meetings and each members attendance are set out in the table on page 16.
When considered appropriate, advice is taken from external consultants on a range of matters, including comparative data and other matters relevant to the remuneration of senior executives.
The terms of reference of the Committee comply with the Combined Code and are available on the companys website.
Mr. R. D. Sellers, the company secretary, is the secretary of the Committee.
Remuneration Policy The Committee aims to ensure that the senior executive remuneration arrangements are fair, competitive and motivating within the context of the financial sector.
With this objective in mind, the remuneration policy which is essentially unchanged from the policy in 2004 is based on a remuneration structure which: motivates executives in the short term whilst also linking remuneration to the long term performance of the group: aligns the interests of executive directors with those of shareholders through performance related awards reflecting the results of the group and, depending on amount, a proportion of such awards being deferred and satisfied in shares: is appropriate in comparison with remuneration arrangements of competitors and in relation to that of senior group employees who are not directors: and reflects group profit levels and rewards profit growth, with performance related awards forming a significant element of total compensation.
In determining directors remuneration, consideration is given to matters specific to the company such as returns to shareholders, profit and earnings performance, both in absolute terms and measured against budget.
The quality of profit and earnings performance is also considered ie.
in the context of market conditions and whether broadly based across all divisions or derived more narrowly as well as the application of risk controls across the business.
Other considerations are the experience and performance of individual directors, their areas of responsibility and remuneration levels throughout the group and comparable market remuneration data.
Finally, consideration is taken of the proportion of profits accounted for by total executive directors remuneration.
The Committee considers that an effective remuneration policy needs to be sufficiently flexible and kept under review in order to take account of future changes in the companys business environment and in remuneration practice.
Accordingly, the policy may be amended in future years.
19 Close Brothers REPORT OF THE BOARD ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION Components of Remuneration Basic salary and benefits The policy is to provide basic salaries which, when taken with potential performance related awards and pension provision payments, are competitive relative to comparable companies.
The majority of executive directors remuneration is performance related and basic salaries will, as a general principle, only normally be reviewed every several years other than as circumstances require, for example in the case of a promotion or change in responsibility.
The company also provides senior executives with healthcare, prolonged disability and life assurance cover, and a company car or payment in lieu.
Annual discretionary performance related awards Annual performance related awards are at the discretion of the Committee, are not pensionable and are determined in the light of the factors set out above.
The Committee does not consider it appropriate to set an upper limit on these awards because of the cultures and remuneration practices within the group and in similar financial services businesses.
The majority of any such award is set with regard to the overall financial performance of the group.
In line with the Committees general principles, a proportion of a directors performance related award may be deferred and satisfied in ordinary shares of the company shares.
Performance related awards up to 100 per cent.
of salary will be paid in cash without deferral.
Awards in excess of 100 per cent.
of salary will be paid half in cash without deferral and half in shares which vest after two years the Deferred Element.
The Deferred Element will be forfeited if the executive leaves employment in certain circumstances or is dismissed for cause before the relevant vesting date.
The number of shares comprised in the Deferred Element will be determined by reference to the market value of a share shortly following the announcement of the companys results for the relevant financial year.
Following vesting, these shares may be called for at any time up to the seventh anniversary of grant.
When the shares are called for, the executive is entitled to the value of dividends in respect of the shares under the Deferred Element accumulated over the period of deferral.
In the case of Mr. M. A. Hines, chief executive of Winterflood Securities Limited WINS, his performance related award is paid from a formula-based profit sharing pool for WINS and is thus directly linked to the performance of that business.
Any deferred element is decided on a discretionary basis from year to year, is payable in cash and is deferred until September 2008.
Details of the performance related awards in respect of the year ended 31st July, 2005 are set out on page 23.
Long-term incentives The group has for many years operated long-term performance related incentive arrangements.
These include the 2004 Long Term Incentive Plan the 2004 LTIP, approved by shareholders in 2004, the 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme, approved by shareholders in 1995 the 1995 Scheme and the Inland Revenue approved Savings Related Share Option Scheme the SAYE Scheme.
The first grant under the 2004 LTIP was made in October 2004 and further grants are expected to be made annually.
No further grants will be made under the 1995 Scheme and the last grant to directors was made in September 2003.
Grants under the SAYE Scheme are made annually and are expected to continue for the foreseeable future.
The 2004 LTIP is based on a conditional award of free shares subject to demanding performance conditions.
Grants are restricted to a maximum of twice an individuals salary in any one year.
Performance conditions for each award are determined by the Committee at the time of each grant.
Performance is measured over a single period of three years with no re-testing.
The performance conditions under the 2004 LTIP grant are a range of earnings per share EPS growth targets for two thirds of an award and relative Total Shareholder Return TSR targets for the remaining one third.
The Committee considers that this mix of targets provides an appropriate balance between rewarding improvements in the companys financial performance, while also recognising relative stock market performance.
Performance criteria will be calculated by the Committee and independently verified by the auditors.
The EPS element of the award will only vest if EPS growth is at or above an average of retail price index RPI 5 per cent.
per annum over the period.
of this part of the award vests at the RPI 5 per cent.
threshold, increasing on a straight-line basis up to 100 per cent.
vesting when the average EPS growth is RPI 10 per cent.
The EPS figure used will be earnings per share before exceptional items and write off of goodwill.
20 REPORT OF THE BOARD ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION For the TSR element, performance is measured against a group of 25 companies drawn from the FTSE-350 Speciality and Other Financial Index and the FTSE-350 Banks Index.
This part of the award will only vest if the companys TSR performance is at or above the median of the comparator group.
of this part of the award vests for median TSR performance, increasing on a straight line basis up to 100 per cent.
vesting when the companys TSR performance is at the 20th percentile ie.
top fifth of the comparator group.
Under the 1995 Scheme 50 per cent.
of each grant of options has been subject to a performance condition requiring average EPS growth of RPI 4 per cent.
per annum over any three-year period during the ten-year life of the option.
has been subject to the achievement of a performance condition requiring the companys EPS growth over any five-year period during the life of the option to be in the top 25 per cent.
Executive directors are also entitled to participate in the SAYE Scheme on the same terms as other employees, under the terms of which options are granted for a fixed contract period of three or five years, usually at a discount of 20 per cent.
Pensions Messrs. S. R. Hodges, C. D. Keogh and D. C. Pusinelli participate in the groups defined benefits scheme and in a group defined contribution scheme.
Under the defined benefits scheme, which was closed to new entrants in August 1996, the normal pensionable age is 65, the pension at normal pensionable age is two-thirds of final pensionable salary subject to completion of 30 years service and there is a 50 per cent.
Pensionable salary has been set at their salary at 1st August, 2001 plus increases to reflect RPI to a maximum of 2 per cent.
Messrs. M. A. Hines and P. L. Winkworth participate in defined contribution pension schemes.
Details of company contributions for these directors are set out in the table of directors remuneration for the year ended 31st July, 2005 on page 23.
The following table summarises pension benefits for the directors who participated in the groups defined benefits scheme.
The accrued pension is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year.
The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
Participants in the defined benefits scheme have the option of paying additional voluntary contributions: neither such contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the table below: Transfer value of accrued pension Accrued pension Change Increase At 31st July, Directors during At 31st July, during At 31st July, 2004 contributions the year 2005 the year 2005 000 000 000 000 000 000 S.

Pusinelli 650 13 176 839 5 86 The transfer values disclosed above represent potential liabilities of the pension scheme and do not necessarily represent a sum paid or payable to the individual director.
External Appointments Any external appointments require board approval.
No fees were earned from such appointments by any executive director.
If they were, they would be taken into account in determining their remuneration.
Directors Service Contracts Executive directors service contracts are terminable on twelve months notice and do not contain a liquidated damages clause on termination.
In the event of termination of a contract it is current policy to seek appropriate mitigation of loss by the director concerned and to ensure that any payment made is commensurate with legal obligations.
The employer may at its discretion terminate the contract by making a payment in lieu of notice equal to the salary and benefits which the director would have received during his notice period.
