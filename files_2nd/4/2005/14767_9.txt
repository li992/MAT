S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2005 D IRECTORS R EMUNERATION R EPORT This report, approved by the board, has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee of St Ives plc the Committee in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 the Act as amended by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Information relating to remuneration of the directors on pages 25 and 26, directors pension entitlements on pages 26 and 27 and directors share options on pages 27 and 28 has been audited.
Policy on directors remuneration The board is responsible for setting the Companys policy on directors remuneration in respect of the 2004 2005 financial year and future years and the role of the Committee, inter alia, is to apply the Companys policy and decide on the remuneration of each executive director.
No director is involved in determining his or her own remuneration.
The primary objectives of the Companys policy on executive directors remuneration are rstly, that it should be structured so as to attract and retain executives of a high calibre with the skills and experience necessary to develop the Company successfully and, secondly, to reward them in a way which encourages the creation of value for the shareholders.
The setting of appropriate targets for executive directors, which have to be achieved for them to earn a performance-related bonus, and the determination of their overall remuneration package is undertaken annually by the Committee.
Targets may be adjusted, where appropriate, to take account of any change in the issued share capital of the Company.
It is the Companys policy that a bonus shall not exceed 75 per cent of the executives basic pay for the year in question and shall not qualify for pension benets.
The Committee periodically considers available remuneration and benets data relevant to UK public companies and others in the same business sector as the Company.
Following the restructuring referred to in the Chairmans Statement, appropriate changes will be made to the executive directors remuneration packages which will be disclosed in next years Report & Accounts.
The Companys policy on setting non-executive directors remuneration is to offer a directors fee sufficient to attract and retain individuals of appropriate calibre such that they are able to apply an independent view based on their experience and skills.
Non-executive directors may not participate in the Groups share option schemes, nor in any long term incentive plan.
It is the Companys policy that executive directors should serve under rolling service contracts of twelve months duration or less and that there should be no special provisions for compensation in the event of termination.
Payment in lieu of any unworked notice on termination of service shall therefore be a matter of negotiation between the parties.
The policy on non-executive directors letters of appointment are that they shall be for an initial three-year term, but subject to notice at any time and retirement by rotation at Annual General Meetings of shareholders.
Executive directors may accept appointments outside the Company provided that the permission of the board has been obtained.
Fees from all such appointments held by full time executive directors shall be accounted for to the Company.
Details of the executive directors service contracts and non-executive directors letters of appointment are shown on page 25.
During the year the Committee, having satisfied itself that New Bridge Street Consultants LLP NBSC had no other connections with the Company which would prejudice their independence, retained and drew on advice and assistance from NBSC.
The Committee also sought and obtained, when appropriate, advice and assistance from the Chairman of the Company and the Company Secretary in connection with carrying out its business.
Components of directors remuneration The executive directors remuneration consists of five components: basic salary: performance-related bonus: benets in kind and pensions arrangements: share options: and participation in the Groups Equity Partnership Plan EPP.
22 S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2005 Basic salary Each director is paid an annual basic salary, which is reviewed annually by the Committee to ensure that it suitably reects the executives experience, responsibility and market value.
Performance-related bonus The Committee sets objectives annually relative to the performance of the Group, operating unit or individual as appropriate, as an incentive to the executive directors to achieve relevant and demanding targets for the forthcoming financial year.
To the extent that he achieved his performance target for the year set by the Committee in July 2004 in relation to the performance of the Book division and the Group as a whole, Patrick Martell earned a bonus in respect of 2004 2005, which represented 75 per cent of his annual basic salary.
No other director earned a bonus during the year because their minimum performance targets were not met.
For 2005 2006 the Committee has set an incentive for the executive directors to achieve a targeted profit for the Group before taxation, goodwill amortisation and exceptional items calculated by reference to the results of each quarter and the year as a whole.
In the event that the bonus earned exceeds 20 per cent of basic salary, one third of the whole of the bonus shall be satisfied in the form of shares, which will vest in October 2009.
The bonus which may be earned by Wayne Angstrom is also partly dependent on the US division meeting or exceeding its profit before interest target for 2005 2006.
In appropriate circumstances the Committee may award a discretionary performance-related bonus to a director.
Benets in kind and pension arrangements Executive directors receive benets in kind, which may include the provision of a car, fuel and medical insurance or the cash equivalent.
Brian Edwards, Patrick Martell and Raymond Morley each participate in the Groups dened benets pension scheme, which has a normal retirement age of 65.
Wayne Angstrom participates in a Section 401 k Plan set up in the USA for the benefit of employees of St Ives Inc.
Miles Emley joined the Company after the imposition of the Inland Revenue earnings cap introduced by the Finance Act 1989.
In his case, the Company contributes to a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benets Scheme, a Self Invested Personal Pension and life assurance cover.
These arrangements are made for the purpose of providing pension and death in service benets for Miles Emley and his dependants, as nearly as is practicable, comparable to those of his colleagues who are contributory members of the Groups dened benets pension scheme.
Share options Executive directors and certain members of senior management have been granted share options under the Groups discretionary share option schemes.
These share options were not granted at a discount and, therefore, over time will reward management when shareholders are rewarded, but not otherwise, as is proper.
As a result of the adoption of the Executive Share Option Scheme 2001 Scheme no options have been granted under any of its predecessor schemes since 28 October 1999.
The Companys policy is to grant options to executive directors at the discretion of the Committee up to an annual maximum of 150 per cent of basic salary 400 per cent in exceptional circumstances.
It is also the Companys policy normally to phase the granting of share options, rather than to award them in a single large block to any individual.
The Committee decides on an appropriate performance condition which has to be satisfied before options can normally be exercised.
The Company decided in 2004 that no further options subject to re-testing would be granted.
Details of options granted to directors under the Groups discretionary share option schemes are given in the table of directors share options on pages 27 and 28 and the Committees view on what it has decided to be an appropriate basis for setting performance conditions is set out below.
Options granted under the 2001 Scheme prior to 2004 can only be exercised if, after a period of between three and five years commencing from a base year which is the financial year ending immediately prior to the date of grant, some or all of the following are satisfied: 25 per cent of any option may be exercised in 23 S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2005 D IRECTORS R EMUNERATION R EPORT continued Components of directors remuneration continued the event that the Companys Earnings Per Share before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation EPS growth has exceeded the UKs Retail Prices Index RPI, plus at least 3 per cent per annum compound since the base year: RPI plus at least 4 per cent over the same period must be achieved to exercise the next 25 per cent of the grant: RPI plus at least 5 per cent for the third 25 per cent and RPI plus 6 per cent for the final 25 per cent of the grant to be exercisable.
To the extent that the foregoing performance conditions are not satisfied by the fifth anniversary of grants made in 2002 and 2003, and by the third anniversary in the case of grants made in 2004 which are not subject to re-testing, the options lapse.
No options granted under the 2001 Scheme have vested to date.
Options granted to the executive directors and outstanding under the discontinued 1995 and 1992 Schemes will not vest unless a performance condition is satisfied, which is an increase in EPS on average of not less than 2 per cent per annum above RPI over a period of at least three years.
Options granted under the 1995 Scheme on 17 November 1998 have vested and unless exercised by 16 November 2005 they will lapse: those granted on 28 October 1999 have not yet vested as the performance condition in relation to this grant has not been met.
Those options granted under the 1992 Scheme on 21 December 1995 will lapse on 20 December 2005 as the appropriate performance condition has not been met and the options granted on 17 October 1996 have not vested as the appropriate performance condition has yet to be met.
Under the 1995 Scheme, options can only be exercised between the third and seventh anniversary of grant and between the third and tenth anniversary of grant in the case of the Groups other discretionary schemes.
Executive directors may participate in the Companys savings-related share option schemes.
Long term incentive plan Executive directors and certain members of senior management participate in the EPP.
Under the terms of the invitations made to date and having purchased St Ives plc shares on the open market and deposited them with an Employees benefit Trust, the participants potentially qualify for an award of free matching shares, in the ratio of between 0.5:1 if three years EPS growth from the base year is RPI plus 1 per cent per annum, compound and 3:1 if EPS growth from the base year is RPI plus 8 per cent per annum, compound.
No participant may invest in excess of the equivalent of 50% of his basic salary in shares deposited with the Employees Benets Trust.
The level of match will be determined on a straight-line basis if the Companys EPS growth over the three-year period falls between the two points.
There will be no re-testing of performance following the end of the three-year period.
The executives who participated in the EPP 2001 Plan on 26 November 2002 will not qualify for an award of free matching shares based on the Groups growth in EPS between 2002 and 2005 and so these awards will lapse on 26 November 2005.
The performance conditions On page 29 of this Report, a graph is included illustrating the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR over the past five years, compared with that of the FTSE 350.
Shareholders will, however, note that this performance measurement has not been adopted by the Committee for determining the extent to which options may be exercised or matching share awards taken up under the Companys share option schemes and the EPP.
The Committee considers that, so far as the shareholders are concerned, the directors primary objective should be the delivery of sustained, long-term real growth in earnings per share and that it is appropriate therefore that this is the measure which should be applied to the exercise of options and award of matching shares.
The Committee continues to favour real EPS growth rather than TSR for the following reasons: a TSR is an unreliable measure because it is highly dependent on the Companys share price performance and is outside the control of the participants: 24 S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2005 b the interests of shareholders, who look for sustained financial performance and strong cash ow, may not be best served if the directors actively seek ways of affecting the share price: and c the Committee does not favour a criterion whether EPSor TSR-based that is dependent on performance relative to a group of comparators because i there are no listed companies of comparable size trading in the Companys markets: ii while it would in theory be possible to treat the FTSE 350 as a single comparator group, the Committee believes that to do so would dilute the incentive inherent in the Companys real EPS increase if it were referenced to the performance of a remote group of non-competing companies with no direct relevance to the Companys business.
The board seeks to deliver long-term sustainable growth in earnings, employing consistently applied and appropriately prudent accounting policies.
Directors contracts Details of the directors contracts are disclosed below and brief biographical details are set out on page 13.

The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Professional Guidance Note GN11.
The transfer values disclosed above do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual director.
Instead they represent a potential liability of the dened benets pension scheme.
The increase in the accrued pension during the year shown above excludes any increase arising from the statutory revaluation in deferment up to normal retirement age.
The inclusion of the statutory revaluation in deferment up to normal retirement age would have the effect of increasing the accrued pension during the year to 9,502 per annum for Brian Edwards, 5,874 per annum for Patrick Martell and 6,807 per annum for Raymond Morley.
The accumulated total accrued pension entitlements shown are annual amounts at retirement calculated on service completed to the relevant year end.
