Aegis R&A 2005 Board & reports 30-48 12 4 06 7:06 am Page 12 Aegis Annual Report 2005 Remuneration report The Remuneration Report is presented to shareholders by the Board and sets out the remuneration policies operated by the Company and details the remuneration of each director.
The Remuneration Report will be put to the Annual General Meeting for approval by the shareholders.
This vote is advisory only.
The Board has an established Remuneration Committee, the members of which are disclosed on page 37.
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP NBSC has been appointed by the Remuneration Committee to provide advice on directors remuneration and the Companys share incentive schemes.
NBSC provides no other services to, and has no other connection with, the Company.
Remuneration policy In determining the remuneration packages of the executive directors, the Committee has regard to two fundamental principles: the importance of attracting, motivating and retaining management of the highest calibre: linking reward to the Groups performance.
The Committee has applied, and continues to apply, these principles to develop remuneration packages which: provide a competitive base salary designed to attract and retain executive directors of the highest calibre and to reflect their role and experience: provide incentive arrangements which are subject to challenging performance targets, reflect the Companys objectives and recognise the importance of providing sustained motivation of management to focus on annual, as well as longer-term, performance: align the interests of the executive directors with those of shareholders.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Committees approach is that a substantial proportion of the overall remuneration package should be linked to performance, through participation in short-term and long-term incentive schemes.
The Committee determines remuneration packages with regard to the prevailing pay and benefits conditions across the Groups markets.
Remuneration package of executive directors The main components are: Base salary and benefits Base salary and benefits are determined on an annual basis by the Committee after a review taking into account the individuals performance, market trends and the performance of the Group as a whole and, where relevant, the performance of the business for which the executive is responsible.
For guidance, the Committee has regard to available research and published remuneration information on companies within the same industry and markets in the countries in which the executives are based.
Base salaries prevailing at the date of this report are: Robert Lerwill 630,000, Jeremy Hicks 339,900, Adrian Chedore 333,785 and David Verklin 464,416.
A summary of the benefits payable to executive directors is given on page 44.
Year on year increases for executive directors are between 3% and 5%, other than for David Verklin whose base salary has increased by 8%.
The higher increase was considered appropriate as a result of Davids increased responsibilities now also including the Aegis Media Asia Pacific region.
Bonus schemes All of the executive directors participate in the Groups Annual Cash Bonus Scheme based upon a mix of group financial targets profit before tax and management charges and achievement of personal objectives and, in the case of directors with operational responsibilities, regional performance.
This may result in the payment of cash bonuses of up to 75% of base salary 100% for the Chief Executive Officer and, for 2006 only, 100% for David Verklin, recognising his increased responsibility for the Asia Pacific region.
For on-target financial performance, one half of the maximum bonus opportunity is payable in the case of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and one third is payable in the case of Adrian Chedore and David Verklin.
In addition, Adrian Chedore and David Verklin participate in a separate deferred annual cash bonus scheme based on achievement of a demanding year on year excess profit above target financial performance of the businesses for which they are responsible.
This additional plan has been in operation in order to provide competitive total cash remuneration using, as a benchmark, other media businesses and to reflect their critical contribution to the business.
This additional bonus is potentially worth up to 200% of base salary.
It should be noted that the cap is set in relation to extremely stretching levels of performance as it is based on profit in excess of the existing plan for these individuals.
Each year end any bonus earned under the plan is accrued to a personal bonus pool.
Only half of the bonus pool is then paid out in any one year with the remaining 50% being carried forward to the following year end.
This deferred bonus pool will normally be forfeited in the event that the director leaves the Group.

These schemes replaced all of the previous share-based incentive schemes and were designed to reflect changes in the guidelines issued by institutional shareholders and developments in market practice.
i 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme In any financial year, an executive can receive share options worth at market value no more than three times basic salary in normal circumstances.
The exercise of options is based upon the Companys earnings per share EPS growth relative to inflation RPI, and the following performance conditions will apply to options granted in 2006: - Average annual EPS growth in excess of RPI Proportion of option grants exercisable 3% Up to 0.5x salary 3% to 7% 0.5 to 1x salary pro rata on a straight line basis 7% to 12% 1 to 2x salary pro rata on a straight line basis 12% to 17% 2 to 3x salary pro rata on a straight line basis Following a review by the Remuneration Committee in 2005, the EPS growth targets were increased as detailed above for grants made in 2005 in recognition of the outlook for the business, to ensure that performance conditions remain appropriately stretching.
The Committee has reviewed the EPS condition again in March 2006 and believes that the targets as detailed above continue to be appropriately challenging.
EPS growth targets for awards made in 2003 and 2004 are detailed on page 47.
These EPS performance conditions are tested after three financial years beginning with the year in which options are granted.
For grants made after 31 December 2004 there is no provision for retesting.
To the extent that the performance conditions are not satisfied, the options lapse.
ii 2003 Performance Share Plan In any financial year, an executive can receive a conditional award of shares worth at market value no more than two times basic salary in normal circumstances.
The extent to which awards vest is determined partly by reference to the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR performance relative to a group of similar businesses and partly by reference to the Companys EPS growth relative to RPI.
The following TSR targets apply: - TSR performance relative to peer group Proportion of award vesting Median or below Nil 1st or 2nd 50% For intermediate performance Nil to 50% pro rata on a straight line basis The following companies will be included in the peer group for calculation of TSR performance: - Dentsu Inc. Publicis Groupe S. A. Havas SA Reed Elsevier plc The Interpublic Group of Companies Inc Taylor Nelson Sofres plc IPSOS S. A. Viacom Inc.
The News Corporation Limited VNU N. V. Omnicom Group Inc WPP Group plc Pearson plc The Committee has reviewed the constituent members of the TSR comparator group and the vesting schedule in March 2006 and believes that the current mix of companies remains appropriate and that the stretching vesting schedule will reward strong relative performance.
41 Aegis R&A 2005 Board & reports 30-48 12 4 06 7:06 am Page 14 Aegis Annual Report 2005 Remuneration report The following EPS performance conditions apply: - Average annual EPS growth in excess of RPI Proportion of award vesting 3% or less Nil 15% 50% 3% to 15% Nil to 50% pro rata on a straight line basis The Committee has reviewed the EPS condition in March 2006 and believes that the targets as detailed above continue to be challenging.
These TSR and EPS performance conditions are tested after three financial years beginning with the year in which awards are made.
There is no provision for retesting.
To the extent that the performance conditions are not satisfied, the awards lapse.
The assessment of these performance conditions will be carried out by NBSC, in its capacity as adviser to the Committee.
In relation to EPS measurement, the Remuneration Committee will ensure that a consistent basis of measurement is used during the transition to international financial accounting standards.
The Committee believes that using both EPS growth and TSR for awards under the Performance Share Plan provides a balanced incentive between assessing the Companys relative returns to shareholders and its underlying financial performance.
For share options, the sole use of EPS as a performance condition is considered an appropriate underpinning performance condition to the requirement inherent in an option to grow the share price.
The use of EPS for both options and part of the performance share award is considered appropriate after recognising the difference between the two incentives and the different level at which the EPS ranges are targeted.
The blend between EPS and TSR performance conditions and the two different types of plan are considered to provide a wellrounded incentive for the Companys executives.
Overall, the value of long-term incentives is considered to be in line with arrangements at peer companies and provide an appropriate balance to other elements of the directors remuneration package.
No further awards will be made under the previous closed schemes, although awards granted in the past will continue to be exercisable in accordance with the rules of each respective scheme.
The closed schemes are the 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme and the 1998 Management Incentive Scheme.
Details of the performance conditions of these are given on pages 46 and 47.
Details of all share incentive awards outstanding for each executive director serving during 2005 are set out on pages 46 to 48.
Pensions All UK executive directors participate in Inland Revenue approved defined contribution pension schemes.
Pensionable salary is limited to base salary excluding all bonuses and other benefits.
Non-UK executive directors have arrangements in line with market conditions and statutory obligations operating in their own countries.
Annual employer contributions in respect of Robert Lerwill prevailing at the date of the report are 256,000.
42 Aegis R&A 2005 Board & reports 30-48 12 4 06 7:06 am Page 15 Our business and strategy Our board and reports Our accounts Remuneration report Service contracts Details of the service contracts of those who served as executive directors during the year are set out below.
All directors have rolling service contracts which expire at normal retirement age unless terminated beforehand in accordance with the terms of the individual contract.
Name Contract date Notice period from Company Notice period from director Robert Lerwill 22.02.05 12 months 6 months Adrian Chedore 21.02.03 12 months 6 months Jeremy Hicks 09.02.01 12 months 6 months David Verklin 01.07.98 6 months 6 months NOTES: David Verklin retains a contractual entitlement on termination of an amount equal to 12 months salary and benefits in addition to any payments in respect of his normal six months notice period.
The Remuneration Committee believes that this provision is appropriate in this instance given the need to retain a key senior operational executive in the context of highly competitive market conditions in the USA.
Unless there are exceptional circumstances, it is the Companys policy that under any new service contracts, notice periods to be given by the Company will not exceed 12 months.
In addition, new contracts will not normally include liquidated damages clauses and any termination payments will be calculated on normal contractual principles taking into account a directors duty to mitigate loss.
Former director as disclosed previously in last years accounts Name Contract date Notice period from Company Notice period from director Doug Flynn 22.10.99 24 months 6 months resigned 31.03.05 In addition to payments in respect of notice periods, Doug Flynn had a contractual entitlement on termination to an amount equal to two times any bonus received in the previous 12 months.

Following his resignation Doug Flynn received no contractual compensation.
Non-executive directors Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial term of three years with a one month notice period.
