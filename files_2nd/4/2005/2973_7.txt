Remuneration policy Executive Directors The Companys policy for the current and subsequent financial years is to provide remuneration packages for the Executive Directors which are appropriate to the size and nature of the business and which will attract and retain high calibre executives.
It is the Companys policy that a substantial proportion of the Executive Directors remuneration should be performance related to encourage and reward superior business performance and shareholder return and that remuneration should be linked to both individual and Company performance as measured against corporate objectives.
Accordingly, Executive Directors may earn up to an additional 90% of their basic salaries as a performance bonus and may be granted awards worth, subject to shareholder approval of a proposed amendment to its rules, up to 60% of salary at the award date under the 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan the 2004 LTIP as set out below.
In total, the maximum variable element of the Executive Directors remuneration is 114% of salary, assuming payment of a maximum performance bonus and valuing the 2005 award proposed under the 2004 LTIP on a binomial basis.
The Executive Directors may also participate in the all-employee Savings Related Share Option Scheme the SAYE Scheme and the All Employee Share Ownership Plan the AESOP on the same basis as other employees.
Non-Executive Directors The fees of the Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board.
It is the Boards policy to set these fees according to the recommendations made by the Chairman and Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director who make such recommendations with reference to fee levels in similar businesses.
The Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for any of the Companys variable pay arrangements.
It is the Companys policy to appoint Non-Executive Directors for a term of three years.
The appointment of Non-Executive Directors is subject to re-election in accordance with the Articles of Association and Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts with the Company.
Mr Guy Weston was appointed from 2 February 2005 and will retire and offer himself for re-election at the Annual General Meeting.
Senior management As part of the same exercise as the annual review of the Executive Directors salary, bonus and benefits, the Committee also reviews the total remuneration of senior management.
The Companys policy is to remunerate senior management in line with the median after benchmarking each role against suitable comparators in the same way as Board members remuneration is evaluated.
Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2005 26 Executive Directors remuneration package It is the Companys policy to employ Executive Directors under contracts with an indefinite term subject to termination by notice given by either party, normally of 12 months.
These employment contracts do not provide for termination payments other than, in the case of early termination by the Company, payment in lieu of notice.
An exercise to revise and update the Executive Directors contracts of employment is being undertaken to ensure that suitable mitigation terms are included and bring the contracts in line with current best practice.
Details of individual Directors remuneration and share options are set out on page 29 of this report.
The main components of the remuneration package for Executive Directors are: Basic salary The Companys policy is that basic salaries for Executive Directors should take into account the role and responsibilities, performance and experience of the individual.
Basic salary is targeted at the retail market median for comparable roles.
Annual bonus Executive Directors are eligible to receive an annual performance bonus up to a maximum of 90% of their annual basic salaries at the time the bonus scheme is announced.
The amount of bonus is based on the achievement of profit targets specified and agreed at the beginning of the year.
For 2005 06 the bonus is earned on a sliding scale depending on performance, from 0% at the trigger point, set below budget to reflect that the budget includes a degree of stretch, rising on a straight line basis to 22.5% for achieving budget, rising again on a straight line basis to 90% for achieving a target significantly above budget.
The range is set wider than previous years to allow staff to earn a modest bonus at an earlier stage while ensuring the maximum is only paid if exceptional performance is achieved.
The performance conditions were chosen to allow this element of variable pay to reflect the Groups performance.
Bonus payments do not form part of the Directors pensionable earnings.
Share option scheme No further grants can be made under the scheme although some options remain outstanding these are shown on page 29.
In order to align the interests of Executive Directors and selected senior managers with those of the shareholders, the Company introduced an Executive Share Option Scheme in 1993.
Under this scheme the Committee approved the granting of options as an incentive to achieve long-term success for the Company.
Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP In order to align the interests of Executive Directors and selected senior managers with those of the shareholders, at the 2004 Annual General Meeting shareholders were asked to approve the introduction of a new LTIP the 2004 LTIP, details of which are set out on page 30.
The first conditional award of shares was made in September 2004.
The extent to which the shares awarded will be released will depend upon the Companys performance over a three year period following the award date.
The release of half of the awards will be determined by the Companys relative total shareholder return TSR performance and the release of the other half by the Companys relative earnings per share EPS performance.
The Companys TSR and EPS performance is measured against those of a peer group.
No retesting will be permitted.
Further details, including membership of the peer group, are given on page 30.

Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2005 29 Directors remuneration report continued 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan The 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan 2004 LTIP was adopted at the Annual General Meeting in 2004.
No payments became due under the Plan during the year.
Under the 2004 LTIP the Executive Directors may receive annual awards in the form of contingent entitlements to Carpetright shares.
These awards will be satisfied by the purchase of shares: no new shares will be issued.
The following awards under the LTIP were made on 15 September 2004 and the scheme interests of the relevant Directors remained the same as at 30 April 2005: Shares Lord Harris 16,731 Mr M Harris 7,003 Mr J Kitching 8,365 Mr D Shapland 9,533 Mr C Sollesse 7,976 Mr Shaplands award will not vest as he is set to leave the Company in July 2005.
It is proposed subject to receiving shareholder approval to increase the maximum award that can be made in any year under the 2004 LTIP from 40% of salary to 60% and for 2005 the conditional awards for Executive Directors are expected to be at the maximum.
The Committee recommends the increase in the maximum award under the 2004 LTIP from 40% of base salary to 60%.
This is to reflect market practice and to allow an increase in the proportion of Directors remuneration that relates to the delivery of enhanced shareholder value over the long-term.
To date 17 senior executives have joined the 2004 LTIP with a maximum award of 20% of salary.
It is proposed to consider up to 20 senior executives for awards during 2005.
Based on current basic salaries the annual cost of a maximum award under the 2004 LTIP would be 845,340 for the Directors and 315,000 for the senior executives, giving a total of 1,160,340.
The awards are not pensionable.
The proportion of shares vesting after three years will depend on Carpetrights performance against a defined peer group with respect to two measures: Total Shareholder Return TSR and earnings per share EPS growth.
Half of each award will be governed by each measure.
Using TSR peer group ranking as a performance indicator directly links Directors rewards to the investment returns enjoyed by shareholders.
The EPS growth measure encourages a focus on profitable growth.
The initial peer group, compiled for the September 2004 award in accordance with advice from Hay Group, is detailed below: The Boots Company Plc Marks & Spencer Plc Courts Plc Matalan Plc DFS Furniture Company Plc MFI Furniture Group Plc Dixons Group Plc Next Plc GUS plc SCS Upholstery Plc HMV Group Plc Topps Tiles Plc Homestyle Group Plc Woolworths Group Plc JJB Sports Plc WH Smith Plc Membership of the peer group for the 2005 and future awards will be reviewed and amended as appropriate to maintain a similar performance criterion.
The shares to satisfy the awards will be purchased over the three year vesting period.
An Employee Benefit Trust has been established to hold these shares and this is based in Guernsey.
A Liaison Committee, chaired by Mr Metcalf and including the Group Finance Director and the Company Secretary, has been established to co-ordinate the purchase of shares with the Trust.
13,575 shares were purchased in the period to 27 June 2005, providing one-third of half the award vesting, assuming a 20% leaving rate.
For the 2005 conditional award, EPS and TSR performance against the peer group each determine vesting for one half of each award in accordance with the following table: Vested award TSR or EPS peer group ranking % of salary 50th percentile and below 0% 51st percentile 9% 75th percentile or greater 30% These percentages are subject to the approval of shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting see below.
Vesting will be determined by straight-line interpolation for performance between the 51st and 75th percentiles.
Following the initial test, there will be no opportunity to re-test performance for the determination of awards.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Company, the participant generally forfeits all of his awards.
In cases of death or retirement due to ill health a pro rata payment may be made at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
In the event of a change of control of the Company all awards will vest on a pro rata time and performance basis.
The above is a summary of the 2004 LTIP.
No amendments to the advantage of participants may be made to the provisions of the 2004 LTIP described above without the prior consent of shareholders except in the event of a minor amendment to benefit the administration or tax treatment of the LTIP.
Accordingly the Company will seek approval of the shareholders to increase the maximum award for Executive Directors that may be made under the LTIP from 40% to 60% of salary at the forthcoming AGM.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in either the Executive Share Option Scheme or the 2004 LTIP.
