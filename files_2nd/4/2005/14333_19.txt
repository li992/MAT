However, it was decided by the Remuneration Committee and the Board that during the strategic review and subsequent to the disposal of SkyePharma Inc. it was premature to change the Comparator Group until the future shape of the Company crystallised at which point a more appropriate group of companies could be selected.
Therefore during 2005 the Remuneration Committee adopted the following approach: Element Benchmark Reason Salary FTSE Mid 250 & The relative lack of UK members in the Comparator Group Comparator Group and the different salary policies adopted by the US members.

Pension FTSE Mid 250 US company pension practice is not comparable to UK practice and therefore the relative lack of UK companies in the Comparator Group meant that it was not viable as a benchmark.
