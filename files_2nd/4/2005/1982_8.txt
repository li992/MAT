The tables and accompanying notes on pages 19 to 21 have been subject to audit, with the exception of the Share Price graph.
Remuneration Committee The remuneration committee the Committee comprises three independent non-executive directors and no director plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
The Committee members consist of: Per Utnegaard Chairman of the Committee since 1st May 2005, John Burns and Philip Rogerson.
Christopher Kemball was Chairman of the Committee until 30th April 2005 and remained a member of the Committee in order to provide support and continuity during the executive incentive review and resigned after its completion on 16th December 2005.
Neil Benson was a member of the Committee until 30th April 2005.
The Chief Executive is invited to attend meetings but may not take part in any discussion on matters concerning himself.
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP NBSC is the appointed remuneration adviser to the Committee and provides no other services to the company.
The terms of reference of the Committee were reviewed and approved by the board in May 2005.
The Committees role includes determining the companys policy on senior executive remuneration, considering and approving the individual salaries and other terms of the remuneration packages for the executive directors and the Chairman, monitoring remuneration of other senior executives and setting an overall framework for share schemes throughout the company.
The terms of reference are available on the companys website or upon request from the Company Secretary.
Remuneration policy The Committees policy is: to provide appropriate levels of remuneration to its senior executives, taking into account their experience, the size and complexity of their jobs, relevant market comparative data and any material special factors which may arise from time to time: and to ensure that a significant proportion of executives remuneration is determined by performance.
During the past year the Committee, with the assistance of NBSC, has completed a review of the level and structure of executive remuneration which included benchmarking remuneration against a group of similarly-sized companies in the Support Services sector and also against a more general group of FTSE 250 companies of broadly similar turnover, market capitalisation and internationality.
The main nding of the review was that the level of performance-related pay for company executives was below market levels.
Accordingly, in order to align more closely executive interests with shareholders and to ensure that the executives are suitably incentivised, the companys remuneration structure is to be amended for 2006 as follows: the maximum potential annual bonus will be set at 60% of base salary with a requirement that a quarter of any bonus is deferred into company shares for a minimum holding period of two years: subject to shareholder approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, executives will receive awards of performance shares under a new Performance Share Plan PSP.
Awards granted under the PSP will be made in place of any further awards under existing long-term incentive including option schemes.
The Committee believes that performance share awards will offer a clearer link between company performance and executive reward.
The remuneration package for executive directors and other senior executives for 2006 will therefore comprise a more appropriate mix between xed remuneration annual salary, provision of a company car, life assurance, medical expenses insurance and retirement benets and variable remuneration annual bonus and, subject to shareholder approval, performance share awards, whereby at a target level of performance, approximately a third of the total package would comprise variable remuneration.
Salaries Salaries for executive directors were reviewed and the following annual salaries are effective from 1st January 2006: Roger Dye 410,000 and Kevin Quinn 226,600.
Retirement benets Roger Dye has a personal pension arrangement to which the company makes payments equivalent to 30% of salary.
Kevin Quinn has a personal pension arrangement to which the company makes payments equivalent to 20% of salary.
Life assurance cover of four times salary and permanent health insurance of up to 75% of salary are also provided.
Short-term performance bonuses The maximum annual bonus for 2006 will be 60% of base salary for senior executives, including the executive directors.
A quarter of any bonus earned must be invested in company shares for two years and will normally be forfeited if the executive leaves during that period.
80% of the bonus will be determined by demanding targets relating to group headline profits or divisional profit performance as appropriate to the individual role.
The balance of the bonus will be based on the achievement of specic financial and developmental targets relevant to the individual.
Normally no bonus will be payable under either part of the plan unless targeted profit is achieved for the year.
Long-term incentives Subject to shareholder approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, senior executives, including the executive directors, will receive in 2006 awards of performance shares under the PSP.
The Committee will have the ability under the PSP to make performance share awards worth up to 100% of base salary each year with a 200% limit in exceptional circumstances such as in the case of recruitment or where there are acute retention needs.
However, the Committee intends to limit individual awards in 2006 to no more than 50% of salary.
The Davis Service Group Plc Report and Accounts 2005 19 Awards granted under the PSP will be subject to satisfaction of a performance condition whereby the companys Total Shareholder Return TSR is compared with the TSR of the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding Investment Trusts over a single three-year period.
Awards will fully vest for upper quartile performance reducing on a sliding scale to 25% vesting for median performance.
No awards will vest for below median performance.
This condition was chosen to align the interests of executives and shareholders by requiring superior TSR performance compared with similar sized companies.
Additionally, to ensure that the underlying financial performance of the company is also sound, awards will only vest if the growth in the companys adjusted earnings per share as identied in our Annual Report and Accounts matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index over a single three-year period.
Full details of the PSP are contained in the Chairmans letter to shareholders enclosed with the notice of 2006 Annual General Meeting.
The existing Long-Term Incentive Plan and Share Option Scheme, under which senior executives have previously received awards, will no longer be used by the company.
All UK employees, including executive directors, will continue to be eligible to participate in the companys new sharesave plan.
Directors service agreements Both executive directors have service agreements dated 21st April 2005 and 16th May 2005 for Roger Dye and Kevin Quinn respectively which are terminable on one years notice by either party.
Upon termination, the director would receive salary, target bonus, benets and pension contribution in respect of the outstanding notice period.
Other than following a change of control, this amount is subject to mitigation if the director has obtained alternative employment which he is under obligation to seek.
Under their service agreements, executive directors are allowed subject to board approval to hold up to one non-executive post and retain the fee received from any such post.
Currently Roger Dye is a non-executive director of Nestor Healthcare plc and received an annual fee of 37,000 2004: 35,000 in respect of that role.
Chairman and non-executive directors The Chairmans annual fee is set by the Committee and is currently 95,000.
The non-executive directors receive annual fees at a level approved by the entire board, currently set at 30,000 together with an extra 2,500 for each of the audit and remuneration committee of which they are a member and a further 5,000 if they chair that committee.
They are able to claim reimbursement of actual expenditure incurred in carrying out their duties.
There is no entitlement to participate in the companys pension scheme, bonus scheme or share schemes and no compensation is payable for early termination of their contracts or terms of ofce.
The Chairman has been appointed for a xed term of three years to April 2008, terminable at three months notice by either party.
The terms of ofce of non-executive directors are for periods not exceeding three years which can be terminated by either party giving one months notice.
These terms of ofce are subject to shareholders approval when non-executive directors seek re-election at annual general meetings.
Total shareholder return The Committee believes that the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding Share Price graph Total Shareholder Return Investment Trusts is the most suitable index against which to Davis Service Group TSR vs. FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding Investment Trusts compare the historic TSR of the company, due to the size of the 300 Davis Service Group Total Return Index company and because the constituents of this index are to be used FTSE Mid 250 excluding Investment Trusts Total Return Index 250 as comparators in the PSP.
The adjacent chart shows the TSR of the company compared with that index over the five year period to 200 31st December 2005.
