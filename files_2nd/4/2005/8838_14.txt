80 John Wood Group PLC Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2005 18 Financial instruments The main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these are summarised below.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The Group borrows in the desired currencies at floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the Group's exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The Group's long-term policy is to maintain approximately 50% of its borrowings at fixed rates of interest.
At 31 December 2005, approximately 45% 2004 : 31% of the Group's borrowings were at fixed rates after taking account of interest rate swaps.
Liquidity risk As regards liquidity, the Group's policy has throughout the year been that, to ensure continuity of funding, at least 90% of the Group borrowing facilities excluding joint ventures should mature in more than one year.
At 31 December 2005, 96% 2004 : 95% of the Group borrowing facilities were due to mature in more than one year.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currencies.
The Group also has significant overseas subsidiaries whose revenues and expenses are denominated in other currencies.
In order to protect the Group's balance sheet from movements in exchange rates, the Group finances its net investment in non US dollar subsidiaries primarily by means of borrowings denominated in the appropriate currency.
Some of the sales of the Group's businesses are to customers in overseas locations.
Where possible, the Group's policy is to eliminate all significant currency exposures on sales at the time of the transaction through forward currency contracts.
The Group does not tend to hedge account for these forward contracts and thus changes in the forward contract fair values are booked through the income statement.
The Group carefully monitors the economic and political situation in the countries in which it operates to ensure appropriate action is taken to minimise any foreign currency exposure.
Credit risk The Group's credit risk primarily relates to its trade receivables.
The Group's major customers are typically large companies which have strong credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has a broad customer base and management believe that no further credit risk provision is required in excess of the provision for impairment of receivables.
Price risk The Group is not exposed to any significant price risk in relation to its financial instruments.
