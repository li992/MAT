4 There are no itemised disclosures included in the Total figures in connection with expense allowances paid in respect of services chargeable to UK income tax as no such payments were made to any Directors in 2005 or 2004.
5 Mr A J Brown was appointed an Executive Director on 14 November 2005.
Baroness Noakes was appointed a Non-Executive Director on 1 March 2004 and Mr C F Knott was appointed as an Executive Director on 1 September 2004.

7 Mr C F Knott has service agreements with Quest in both the Netherlands and in the UK.
Mr Knotts annual base salary as at 31 December 2005 under these agreements comprised 392,000 and 112,500 respectively.
The base salary disclosed is the total sterling equivalent.
The Euro denominated salary is translated at the average exchange rate 2005 1 1.462: 2004 1 1.435.
The US dollar denominated salary is translated at the average exchange rate 2005 1 US$1.820: 2004 1 US$1.832.

An additional 10,000 per annum 2004 10,000 was paid to the Chairmen of Board Committees and to Lord Butler in respect of his position as Senior Independent Director.
10 The compensation for loss of office figure for Directors in prior years comprises payments in 2004 to Dr B R ONeill 310,000 and Mr P J Drechsler 108,000.
These are as previously disclosed in the 2004 Remuneration Report.
No payments were made in 2005 and no further payments are due to either former Director.
11 The aggregate emoluments paid or payable to Directors in respect of qualifying services, which comprises base salary and fees, annual incentive payments, benefits and other emoluments totalled 4,285,000 2004 4,108,000.
Prior to 2004 it was determined by the average share price for the month of December prior to the commencement of the performance period.
In accordance with the disclosure legislation the Company is required to state the market price of its shares on the date of the award and these were as follows: 24 February 2003 1.57, 11 August 2003 1.63, 12 February 2004 2.22, 18 February 2005 2.77 and 14 November 2005 3.15.
2 The award to Mr A J Brown was made on appointment, at a level of two thirds of the standard annual grant to reflect his prospective service in the performance period relating to this award.
3 Mr W H Powells awards are in the form of ADRs, but for the purpose of this table have been disclosed in terms of Ordinary Share equivalents.
4 Vesting of the PGP awards to the estate of Mr T A Scott, following his death on 12 August 2005, has been determined by the PGP Rules.
For the award made to Mr Scott in 2003, in respect of the 2003 to 2005 performance period, the number of shares released to his estate is the 59,916 shares that would have vested at Median TSR performance.
These shares were transferred to Mr Scotts estate on 19 October 2005 on which date the share price was 2.81.
The award made in 2004, in respect of the 2004 to 2007 performance period, was subject to revised rules and any shares vesting from that award will be released to the estate in 2007 to the extent that the performance condition is met, with any release being pro-rated to the period of Mr Scotts employment in the three-year performance cycle.
In accordance with Plan Rules, no shares will be released from the award made in 2005 because, as at the date of death, less than 12 months of the plan cycle had elapsed.
5 No variations to awards were made during 2005.
Shares vested under the Performance Growth Plan audited The following shares in respect of the performance period 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2005 vested on 13 February 2006.

2 Mr C F Knott also received a PGP related payment in respect of a one-off incentive arrangement linked to the trading profit of Quest over the three-year period ending 31 December 2005.
This arrangement pre-dated Mr Knotts appointment as an Executive Director and was agreed in 2003 under the terms of his appointment as Chairman and Chief Executive of Quest.
This was to adjust for the difference in expected remuneration from his long-term incentive awards as a result of his transfer from National Starch to Quest.
Mr Knott will receive a sterling equivalent cash payment under this arrangement of 35,555 relating to his service during this period as an Executive Director.
3 The award vesting to Mr W H Powell from the Economic Profit element of his 2003 to 2005 PGP award reflects the Economic Profit performance of National Starch.
This was between the target and threshold level for vesting that was set at the start of the 2003 to 2005 performance cycle, on a consistent accounting basis.
The PGP award to Mr Powell was made in the form of ADRs but for the purposes of this table have been disclosed in the form of Ordinary Share equivalents at the price of ICI shares on the date of vesting.

The condition is set out on page 48.
There were no options exercised by Executive Directors during 2005 or 2004.
No performance conditions are attached to options granted under this scheme as it is an all-employee share option scheme.
1 Share options outstanding at the year end for Mr T A Scott are stated as at his date of death on 12 August 2005.
2 No variations were made to Directors options or the terms and conditions of any Directors options during the year 2005 or the period ended 13 February 2006.

4 Grants under the Executive Share Option Plan in 2004 and 2005 were made subject to the following sliding scale performance conditions: Percentage of shares Earnings per share in 2006 Earnings per share in 2007 vesting for grants made in 2004 for grants made in 2005 nil less than 25.0p less than 27.1p 33.3% 25.0p 27.1p 100% 30.7p 31.1p There is no retesting of the condition after the three-year performance period.
The percentage of shares vesting will be pro-rated, on a straight-line basis, between points on the above scales.
The EPS figures in the table above are shown under UK GAAP.
The testing of the conditions will need to take account of the differences between UK GAAP, at the time the grants were made and the new International Accounting Standards under which EPS will be reported in the Groups accounts at that time.
The Remuneration Committee will ensure this testing is on an equitable basis.
5 Grants made under the share option scheme prior to 2004 were made subject to an EPS performance condition which require that over a three-year period in the life of the option the growth in ICIs EPS excluding amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items must be equal to, or greater than, the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index plus 3% per annum.
Options granted in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 have failed to meet their performance condition to date.
The performance conditions relating to these options will be retested in 2007.
The grant to Mr W H Powell in 1997 is an exception as it was made before he was appointed a Director and is not subject to a performance condition, in accordance with ICIs practice in the USA at that time.
The plan under which options were granted prior to 2004 has passed its 10-year approval period.
The last grant under this plan was made in December 2003 and no further grants can be made.
The shares to fulfil options granted under this plan do not dilute ICIs issued share capital as they are bought in the market.
6 The earliest date from which an option is exercisable is subject to any outstanding performance condition being met.
7 In accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, the annual grant of share options made on 29 April 1999 to Executive Directors involved with the then proposed disposal of businesses to Huntsman ICI Holdings LLC was delayed.
As a result of this delay, those participants were granted fewer options at a higher exercise price than would have been the case had the grants been made to them at the same time as they were made to all other participants at an exercise price of 4.33.
The Remuneration Committee decided that those individuals so affected should receive the same gross gain at the time they exercise their options as if the grant had not been delayed.
8 Awards made under the US Stock Appreciation Rights plan and denominated in ADRs have been disclosed in terms of Ordinary Share option equivalents at the price of the ICI shares at the date of grant.
Any gain on exercise of these awards is delivered in the form of ADRs.
9 Under the Plan Rules for death in service that govern awards made to Mr T A Scott prior to 2004, the performance condition is waived and the options become exercisable in full by his estate.
For the option grant made in 2004 there is no automatic vesting of the full award.
The Remuneration Committee took due account of the Groups progress towards the performance condition for that award and determined that 50% of the 2004 award should become exercisable by his estate.
In accordance with the Plan Rules the 2005 option grant lapsed because as at the date of death less than 12 months of the plan cycle had been completed.
During 2005 Mr Scotts estate has subsequently exercised options over a total of 826,989 shares at a weighted average option price of 1.89 with a weighted average share price on exercise of 2.86.
10 The market price of the shares at 31 December 2005 was 3.32 and the range during 2005 was 2.31 to 3.36.
The Register of Directors Interests which is open to inspection by shareholders contains full details of Directors shareholdings and options to subscribe for shares.
11 There are limits on the number of newly issued shares that can be used to satisfy awards under the Groups employee share schemes in any 10-year period.
The limits which are in accordance with investor guidelines and the Groups current position against those limits are set out below.
Limit Current Position 5% of Groups share capital can be 0.6% used used for discretionary share schemes 10% of Groups share capital can be 1.2% used used for all share schemes The total number of shares committed under all ICI share option schemes during the two years to 31 December 2005 is set out in note 7 relating to the Group accounts on page 75.
Between 1994 and 2003 all discretionary share schemes have operated using shares purchased in the market by an employee benefit trust.
Details of shares held in this trust are in note 26 relating to the Group accounts on page 99.

A transfer value is the present value lump sum equivalent of the accrued pension and is calculated in accordance with the Guidance Note published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries GN 11.

2 The accrued annual pension at the end of the year, payable at normal retirement age.
3 The transfer value calculations take into account the combined effect of notional interest and the individuals age which will typically increase transfer values by 8%-9% year on year.
Additional factors that impact the transfer values which are net of contributions by Directors over the year are changes in pensionable pay and the service of each Director, as well as changes in actuarial assumptions, particularly for equity and bond returns.
The increases in transfer values are in accordance with the rules of the relevant pension fund.
4 Dr J D G McAdam, and Mr C F Knott participate in the ICI Specialty Chemicals Pension Fund.
Pensionable salary under this plan includes annual bonus, subject to a maximum of 20% of base salary for Dr McAdam and 15% of base salary for Mr Knott.
The pensionable element of bonus is particular to these two Executive Directors and reflects their terms of employment and continuous pensionable service prior to their transfer from Unilever to ICI in 1997, on the acquisition of certain specialty chemicals businesses.
This pensionable bonus element entitlement has been frozen since the time of transfer and has not been increased in line with promotion or increases in ICIs bonus levels.
5 Mr D C M Hamill participates in the ICI UK Retirement Plan, a defined contribution plan, in respect of base salary up to the Inland Revenue earnings cap currently 105,600 for 2005 6.
He also receives a retirement benefit allowance, payable in cash and subject to income tax, in respect of base salary above this cap.
This allowance is reported in the Directors emoluments table on page 45 and for the 2005 period totalled 90,240 2004 86,625.
6 Mr W H Powell participates in the National Starch and Chemical Company Pension Plan for Salaried Employees and the Supplementary Retirement and Savings Plan of National Starch and Chemical Company.
Under these Plans, pension is based on average pay, including annual bonus, during the previous five years, during which time Mr Powell was promoted to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of National Starch and Chemical Company.
He also participates in two defined contribution plans, for which the employers contributions are set out above.
Mr Powells figures reflect not only the change in value of benefits but also movements in exchange rates used for the translation to sterling.
The actual additional pension accrued in the year was US$20,636 and the actual transfer value increased over the year by US$447,868.
When translated into sterling, the resulting additional pension accrued was 46,941, comprising 11,338 translating the US Dollar additional pension into sterling and a 35,603 exchange gain translating the closing accrual at a spot rate of 1 US$1.7234 2004 1 US$1.92975.
Similarly, the sterling increase in transfer value of accrued pension was 735,896, comprising 246,081 translating the US Dollar movement into sterling and 489,815 exchange gain translating the accrual at the differing spot rates at end 2004 and 2005.
7 Prior to his death on 12 August 2005, Mr T A Scott participated in the ICI Specialty Chemicals Pension Fund.
His pensionable salary included annual bonus subject to a maximum of 15% of base salary.
Further detail of the pensionable element of bonus payments are set out in note 4 above.
The ICI Specialty Chemicals Pension Fund has made the standard benefit provision to his dependants in respect of his category of membership.
This comprises a lump sum death in service payment and ongoing payments in respect of a spouses and childrens pension.
The disclosures in the table of Directors pension benefits for Mr Scott are subject to the following further notes.
The additional pension in 2005 for Mr Scott is that accrued between 1 January 2005 and Mr Scotts date of death on 12 August 2005.
The accrued annual pension is at Mr Scotts date of death.
The transfer value for Mr Scott is in respect of his accrued pension at 12 August 2005 but allows for current market conditions.
This amount has been updated at the year end to take account of market conditions at that time.
The increase in transfer value during the year reflects any changes in Mr Scotts pensionable pay and the service prior to his death.

Remuneration report ICI Annual Report and Accounts 2005 49 AR6868 ICI Report 35-55 13 3 06 8:31 pm Page 50 Directors pension benefits continued audited UK Inland Revenue pensions simplification tax regime The Remuneration Committee has agreed ICIs approach in response to the UK pensions simplification legislation, which will become effective on 6 April 2006, for those Executive Directors who are members of UK pension plans.
Such Executive Directors will be given the option of either: maintaining the existing pension arrangement, in which case the executive would take personal responsibility for any additional taxation arising, or ceasing to accrue pension benefits in respect of future service and instead receiving a cash retirement benefit allowance, subject to income taxation.
Past service benefits would remain linked to future salary increases.
This cash alternative is in line with ICIs defined contribution benefits policy and the level of retirement benefit allowance payable will be in line with existing Company contribution rates to the ICI UK defined contribution plan.
These arrangements will not increase the cost to the Group of pension provision.
