40 Directors remuneration report This report has been drawn up in accordance with the Code and with Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985, and has been approved by both the Remuneration Committee and the board.
Shareholders will be invited to approve this report at the AGM.
The Remuneration Committees terms of reference are available for inspection on the companys website.
The Companies Act requires certain parts of the Remuneration Report to be audited.
The audited sections are highlighted.
Composition and function of the remuneration committee The Remuneration Committee comprises all of the non-executive directors of the company, as explained in the corporate governance report.
Christopher Roshier is chairman of the committee but it is proposed that he will retire as chairman at the conclusion of the 2006 Annual General Meeting when Mary Francis will become chairman of the committee.
In order to provide continuity, Christopher Roshier will remain a member of the committee for a further 12 months.
The committee considers all aspects of the executive directors remuneration and administers the companys share option schemes.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is considered by the board following recommendations by the executive directors.
No director participates in setting his own remuneration.
The committee is also aware of the remuneration paid to executives below board level.
Compliance With the exceptions noted in the Corporate Governance Report, the company has complied throughout the period with the Code, and with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
Remuneration policy The objective of St. Modwens remuneration policy is to attract, retain and motivate high calibre senior executives through competitive pay arrangements which are also in the best interests of shareholders.
These include performance-related elements to align the interests of directors and shareholders and to motivate the highest performance.
The policy requires the highest level of performance from executives, based on individual performance assessments by the Chief Executive and the Chairman, and by reference to pay levels in similar companies.
Independent professional advice is sought by the Remuneration Committee from time to time to ensure that the policy remains appropriate and to benchmark the levels of remuneration.
Deloitte & Touche LLP was appointed in 2005 by the Remuneration Committee to provide advice on remuneration matters including a benchmarking exercise in relation to the company, its peers and relevant current market practice and advice on the structure of longterm incentives.
Following this review the Remuneration Committee is currently considering the best means of providing longer-term incentives in the future within a competitive and appropriate overall remuneration package.
During the year, Deloitte & Touche LLP also provided advice on current market practice in connection with non-executive director fees.
The Chairman also provides advice to the committee except in relation to his own remuneration.
Service contracts All of the executive directors have service contracts of no fixed term, with notice periods of twelve months.
Non-executive directors have notice periods of three months.
No director has any rights to compensation on loss of office apart from payment in lieu of notice, where appropriate.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts.
Unless specifically approved by the board, executive directors are not permitted to hold external non-executive directorships.
Anthony Glossop receives fees which he retains in respect of his service as a non-executive director of Robinson plc 16,000.
He receives no fees in respect of his service as a non-executive director of Northern Racing PLC.
The dates of the executive directors service contracts are as follows: C. C. A. Glossop 1st December 1998 W. A. Oliver 24th January 2000 R. L. Froggatt 1st December 1995 T. P. Haywood 14th April 2003 Base salaries Each executive director receives a salary which reflects his responsibilities, experience and performance.
Base salaries are reviewed annually and are established by reference to the median base salary for similar positions in comparable companies.
There were significant increases in base salaries awarded in respect of the year to 30th November 2005.
These were felt to be appropriate because of the rapidly growing size and increasing complexity of the company and its activities, the ambitious nature of the companys financial objectives, exceptionally strong recent performance, significant increases in base salary paid to employees below board level caused by market pressure, and the need to keep salaries in line with those in comparable companies.
St. MODWEN PROPERTIES PLC 41 Based on the benchmarking exercise undertaken by Deloitte & Touche LLP in relation to the company, its peers and relevant current market practice for the year commencing 1st December 2005, the Remuneration Committee considers that the 2005 base salaries paid to the executive directors were within the market competitive range.
Performance-related remuneration The Remuneration Committee has approved all performance-related remuneration in respect of the year to 30th November 2005, and the targets for achievement of such remuneration which were set at the beginning of the financial year.
Bonus scheme Executive directors participate in a performance-linked cash bonus scheme which is payable in two equal instalments, one on the publication of the Annual Report and the second three years later.
The levels of bonus are determined by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account both the level of profit and other personal targets.
In 2005 executive directors were eligible to receive an initial maximum bonus of 70% of salary, payable on the achievement by the company of a demanding budget for profit for the year to 30th November 2005, and on the achievement of a number of personal targets, set individually for each executive director.
These include the achievement of a target net asset value per share, creation of a development programme for future years, support for the regional offices, and replacement of land used.
The Chairman makes recommendations to the Remuneration Committee for the levels of bonus payable to executive directors other than himself for the achievement of these personal targets, and the levels of bonus payable are set by the Remuneration Committee.
Annual bonuses do not form part of pensionable pay.
For the year to 30th November 2005, the initial bonuses paid to directors as a percentage of annual salary were as follows: Anthony Glossop 70%: Bill Oliver 70%: Richard Froggatt 70%: Tim Haywood 70%.
These bonuses represented 30% out of the maximum of 30%, 20% in the case of Richard Froggatt for achievement of the profit budget with the balance representing the bonus paid for the achievement of the personal targets set for each executive director.
Given the strong growth in profits and net assets in 2005 and the achievement of almost all the personal targets set for each executive director the committee felt that bonuses at this level were justified.
The second instalment of the bonus is paid after three years.
This part of the bonus plan is designed to retain and motivate key executives including executive directors.
This second instalment of the bonus is equal to the initial instalment of the bonus earned in the year.
In order to align the directors interests with those of shareholders, payment of this second instalment is subject to the companys net asset value growth over the relevant three year period exceeding RPI plus 5% per annum and to the continued employment by the company of the director concerned except in certain circumstances, such as death during the deferral period.
Thus an executive director can earn a maximum bonus of 140% of base salary, half payable as an initial instalment and half payable three years later.
In the year ended 30th November 2005, the last year of his participation in the bonus scheme, the Chairman was only eligible for the initial instalment and so his maximum bonus was 70% of base salary.
The amounts payable to directors in future years in respect of the second instalments of the bonuses earned in 2004 and 2005 are as follows: 2008 2009 Total 000 000 000 W. A. Oliver 175 217 392 R. L. Froggatt 123 154 277 T. P. Haywood 77 123 200 Following the report from Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Remuneration Committee is considering what changes should be made to the bonus scheme in 2006 and beyond.
If such changes require shareholder consent, this will be sought.
Share options The Remuneration Committee is responsible for supervising the companys Executive Share Option and Savings Related Share Option schemes in accordance with rules previously approved by shareholders.
Executive directors as well as other senior employees are awarded regular grants of options over the companys shares.
Options granted to executive directors in 2005 were equal to 100% of salary in the case of Richard Froggatt and Tim Haywood.
This is the normal maximum annual award and the committee felt that awards at this level were justified by the companys strong performance.
There is, however, a provision in the scheme for a higher award up to a maximum of 300% of salary to be made in exceptional circumstances and, on the recommendation of the Chairman, the committee felt that a grant of options equal to 125% of salary should be made to Bill Oliver as Chief Executive.
This award was made in recognition of the very strong performance of the group since he became Managing Director and subsequently Chief Executive.
42 Directors remuneration report continued For options granted in 2005 under the companys Executive Share Option Scheme as in other recent awards, the performance target set was 5% per annum real growth in net asset value per share over the three year period from the date of grant.
This target was selected to incentivise executives to aim for the continued long-term growth of the company, whilst delivering the short and mediumterm results which are the principal focus of the bonus scheme.
Performance against these targets is objectively assessed from the audited accounts of the company.
For options granted in 2005 and earlier years, the performance condition was subject to one retesting whereby if the condition was not met in the initial period of 3 years the options could still be exercised if the real growth in the net asset value of the company was at least 5% per annum over the four year period from the date of grant.
Options granted in 2006 and thereafter will not allow retesting if the performance condition is not met in the initial 3 year period if this is the case the options will lapse.
All performance conditions not yet met will be adjusted for the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards to the company in 2006.
Executive directors may also participate in the companys savings-related share schemes on the same terms as all other employees.
The highest price during the year was 482p and the lowest price was 307p.
Non-executive directors fees The level of non-executive directors fees is recommended to the board by the Chairman and executive directors.
For 2005 the level of the basic fee paid was 30,000 per director with additional payments of 7,500 to the chairman of the Audit Committee and the chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
Advice on market practice in connection with the level of non-executive fees was sought from Deloitte & Touche LLP in 2005.
As a result, the level of the basic fee was increased with effect from 1st December 2005 to 33,000, the payments to the chairmen of the committees were left unchanged and an additional fee of 5,000 will be paid to Christopher Roshier when he steps down as chairman of the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
This additional fee recognises his role and the work involved as senior independent director.
