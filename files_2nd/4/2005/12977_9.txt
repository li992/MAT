Remuneration report This report sets out the Companys executive remuneration policy and structure and details the remuneration received by the Directors for the year ended 31 December 2005, in compliance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
Remuneration Committee The Board has overall responsibility for determining the framework of executive remuneration and its cost, and is required to take account of any recommendations made by the Remuneration Committee.
The Board has delegated to the Committee through formal terms of reference which are available on request in writing to the Company Secretary and on the Companys website determination of the specic remuneration, benets and employment packages for the Chairman, executive Directors and other senior executives.
The Remuneration Committee consists solely of independent non-executive Directors.
It is chaired by John Sunderland and its other members are Oliver Stocken and Richard Greenhalgh.
Peter Jarvis retired from the Committee and the Board after the Annual General Meeting in April 2005.
Details of attendances at Committee meetings are contained in the report on Corporate Governance on page 39.
Alun Cathcart and Mike Smith normally attend meetings of the Remuneration Committee, as do Christine Ray Group Human Resources Director, Roger Fairhead Director of Group Compensation & Benets, and Pamela Coles Company Secretary, although they are not present at any discussion concerning their own remuneration.
Towers Perrin has been appointed by the Committee to advise it, and the Board, on remuneration issues, and New Bridge Street Consultants provide advice on share-based incentive arrangements for executives and the wider employee population.
Neither adviser provided any other services to the Company during 2005.
Christine Ray and Roger Fairhead assisted the Committee by preparing reports on remuneration and employment conditions within the Group: internal support is provided by Pamela Coles.
Remuneration policy a Executive Directors David Boden was appointed an executive Director on 1 March 2005.
On 24 June 2005, Ian Dyson left the Company and on 11 July 2005 was replaced by Peter Gill as Group Finance Director.
Ian Burke joined as Group Chief Executive on 6 March 2006.
The Committee aims to ensure that the remuneration and incentive arrangements for executive Directors are market-competitive and support the interests of shareholders.
In practice, executive remuneration must reect the competitive practices of the Companys principal competitors and the other businesses with which it competes for talent.
The Committee believes that a significant emphasis on variable remuneration linked to the performance of the Company, together with shareholding guidelines for the executive Directors, is the best way to incentivise and reward executives for the achievement of immediate and longer term strategic objectives of the Company.
It is not the Companys intention to pay more than is necessary, and the reward structure and potential size of awards are regularly reviewed by the Committee to ensure that they meet these objectives.
Excluding pension entitlements, the target value for each executive Directors remuneration and the shareholding guidelines are: Fixed Performance-related Base Annual Long term 21% salary bonus incentives Total Shareholding %%%% guidelines Base salary 53% Long term incentives Group Chief Executive 53 21 26 100 1.5 x base salary 26% Annual bonus Other executive Directors 53 21 26 100 1 x base salary In the table above, the target value for annual bonus has been calculated as the annual cash bonus payable for achieving all targets as described on page 31 i. e. 40% of base salary.
The target value for long term incentives is calculated as the estimated fair value of grants made under the Companys Executive Share Option Scheme and Long Term Incentive Plan during 2005, as described in note 33 to the accounts, consistent with the basis under IFRS 2 Share Based Payments.
The calculated target values, expressed as a percentage of total remuneration, have not changed since 2004.
The reward structure for around 30 senior executives below Board level is generally the same although the level of remuneration may differ.
The shareholding guidelines for Executive Committee members other than executive Directors is 0.75 times base salary.
The Committee will continue to review the level and structure of remuneration to ensure that it remains appropriate.
b Non-executive Directors The Chairman and non-executive Directors receive fees only, and are not eligible to participate in any bonus plan, pension plan, share plan, or long term incentive plan of the Company.
The Chairman and executive Directors determine the fees paid to the non-executive Directors.
The Chairmans fee is determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The Chairman also receives an expense allowance towards his travel and communication expenses.
Fees paid to non-executive Directors are aligned to reect the time commitment and responsibility associated with each role.
30% of the net base fees after tax paid to non-executive Directors are used to purchase Ordinary shares in the Company on a quarterly basis.
These shares must be retained throughout service.
The fees paid to the Chairman and each non-executive Director during 2005 and their base fees with effect from 1 January 2006 including any part used to purchase shares are disclosed in the Directors remuneration summary on page 35.
The Rank Group Plc 30 Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Remuneration structure a Base salary and benets Base salaries are reviewed annually with effect from 1 January, taking into account individual performance, and paid at a market-competitive level.
The Committee receives comparator group information comprising the Companys principal competitors and other companies of similar size and complexity compiled by independent remuneration consultants, with a view to maintaining target total remuneration at the mid-market level.
The Committee is also guided by salary levels of other executives and across the organisation as a whole.
With effect from 1 January 2006, Peter Gill and David Boden received a 4% increase, and Mike Smith received no increase in base salary.
Benets are provided in line with normal market practice, including a car allowance, and health, disability and life insurance.
b Annual cash bonus The annual cash bonus for executive Directors and senior executives is aligned to the achievement of various business strategy objectives expressed as financial targets for the year.
For executive Directors and most senior executives below Board level, the annual cash bonus for achieving all of the targets is 40% of base salary, with a maximum bonus equal to 80% of base salary for signicantly exceeding all of the targets.
For 2005, operating profit targets accounting for three-quarters of any bonus plus a secondary performance measure accounting for one-quarter of any bonus were used.
The secondary performance measures are specic to each division and relate to quantiable targets for cashow, cost reduction and turnover.
The annual cash bonus for Mike Smith was 33.5% of base salary, and for David Boden was 6.5% of base salary, commensurate with only some of the financial targets being achieved.
In accordance with the terms of his service contract, Peter Gill received a bonus equivalent to 40% of his full annual base salary for 2005 the standard bonus arrangements shall apply for 2006 onwards.
The annual cash bonuses are disclosed in the Directors remuneration summary on page 35. c Long term incentives The Company operates a Save-As-You-Earn SAYE share option scheme in which all UK employees can participate.
Participants save a xed amount of up to 250 per month for either three or five years and are then able to use these savings to buy shares in the Company at a price xed at a 20% discount to the market value at the start of the savings period.
In line with market practice, the exercise of these options is not subject to any performance condition.
The executive Directors and selected senior executives also participate in an Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS and a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP designed to retain management and to reward longer term performance over three years or more.
In 2005, 123 2004 205 executives received grants under the ESOS and 25 2004 33 received conditional awards under the LTIP.
The ESOS and LTIP were reviewed during 2005 and a new LTIP was approved by shareholders in April 2005.
The rules of the ESOS were amended during 2005, to remove the provision for the retesting of performance conditions for all ESOS awards granted in or after 2005.
The level of awards granted to executive Directors and selected senior executives is determined by the Remuneration Committee each year, taking into account the market competitive situation, share dilution limits and Company performance.
Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The executive Directors and selected senior executives are granted options to purchase shares in the Company at a price xed at the market value at the date of grant.
For options to vest, there must be an average increase in normalised earnings per share EPS above the growth in the UK Retail Price Index RPI over a three year period, as follows: Total exercise price Performance condition up to 1 x base salary RPI 3% per annum up to 2 x base salary RPI 5% per annum up to 3 x base salary RPI 7% per annum The maximum grant permitted under the ESOS is three times base salary.
For options granted before 2005, if the EPS condition is not met at the end of three years, the performance period may be extended for one further year, measuring EPS growth from the original base year.
If this condition is not met at the end of the fourth year, the options will lapse.
For options granted in or after 2005, this retesting provision has been removed and EPS performance is measured only over the three year performance period.
EPS was determined by the Committee to be the appropriate criterion given its linkage with shareholder value.
With the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards from 2005, the Committee will satisfy itself that EPS is consistently measured over a performance period by calculating EPS for the base period and at the end of the performance period on a consistent basis.
Mike Smith and David Boden were granted ESOS awards in 2002 with a performance condition of real EPS growth of at least 5% per annum.
sufficient EPS growth was not achieved for the performance period ended 31 December 2005, and therefore these ESOS awards have lapsed.
Ian Dyson left the Company in June 2005 and therefore under the rules of the Scheme, all of his unvested ESOS awards have lapsed.
SAYE and ESOS options are satisfied through the issue of new shares.
In accordance with the Association of British Insurers Guidelines on Executive Remuneration, grants of options are carefully planned so as not to exceed 5% of the issued Ordinary share capital in any rolling 10 year period for the ESOS, and 10% of the issued Ordinary share capital in any rolling 10 year period overall.
The Committee has regard The Rank Group Plc 31 Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Remuneration report continued to appropriate annual ow-rates to ensure that these limits are not breached.
Vested options exercised in March 2005 at a market price of 273.10p.
The market value of one Ordinary share was 305.75p at 31 December 2005.
The highest market value during 2005 was 322.50p and the lowest was 250.00p.
No ESOS or SAYE options were exercised by executive Directors other than Ian Dyson during the year.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The executive Directors and selected senior executives are awarded shares in the Company subject to achieving a total shareholder return TSR target.
To ensure these awards do not vest at a time of overall unsatisfactory financial performance, there must also be an increase in normalised EPS of at least 2% per annum above the growth in RPI over a three year period.
The TSR target measures the Companys growth relative to 19 comparator companies.
100% of the shares vest if the Company achieves upper quartile performance, 30% of the shares vest at median performance, and awards vest on a straight line basis for performance in between.
No shares vest if performance is below median.
The TSR ranking for awards that vested for the year ended 31 December 2005 and for those not yet vested are: Performance TSR ranking at period ending 31 December 2005 Vesting 31 December 2005 12th out of 20 0% final vesting 31 December 2006 14th out of 20 0% provisional 31 December 2007 11th out of 20 0% provisional Accordingly, in 2006 Mike Smith and David Boden will not receive any of the shares conditionally awarded to them in 2003.
Ian Dyson left the Company in June 2005, and therefore under the rules of the Plan, all of his LTIP awards lapsed.
The Rank Group Plc 32 Annual Report & Accounts 2005 TSR is measured by independent consultants with reference to the change in the price of Ordinary shares over the performance period and the gross value of dividends assuming they are immediately reinvested in shares during that period.
In order to reduce the effects of short term volatility in TSR, the averages of the daily closing prices of shares for the previous three months are used.
A TSR criterion was selected by the Committee because of its link with shareholder value, and a secondary criterion of EPS growth was selected to ensure that awards would not vest at a time of overall unsatisfactory financial performance.
The comparator group of the companies against which TSR is measured currently comprises BAA, Boots, fide Vere, DSG International, EMI, GUS, Hilton, InterContinental Hotels, ITV, Kingsher, Luminar Leisure, Mothercare, MyTravel, Next, Pearson, Scottish & Newcastle, Stanley Leisure, WH Smith and Whitbread.
This comparator group of companies was selected by the Committee at commencement of the plan in 2000 because of similarities in market sector and or market capitalisation at that time.
The replacement LTIP approved by shareholders at the 2005 Annual General Meeting will permit the Committee to select comparator companies appropriate at the time of each grant.
The accrual rate does not exceed 1 30th for each year of service.
In addition, the Company pays into a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme FURBS, which is a dened contribution scheme, on behalf of Mike Smith.
The Company also paid a salary supplement in lieu of additional pension contributions to Ian Dyson.
Peter Gill does not participate in the Companys pension arrangements and instead receives a salary supplement in lieu of pension provision.
These amounts are disclosed in the Directors remuneration summary on page 35.
Pension entitlements and corresponding transfer values for the Rank Pension Plan during the year were: Value of Gross Increase in net increase Transfer Increase in increase accrued Total in accrued Value of value of Directors transfer in accrued pension net accrued pension net accrued accrued contributions value net pension of ination pension of Directors pension pension at during of Directors Age at during 2005 during 2005 at 31.12.05 contributions at 1.01.05 31.12.05 2005 contributions 31.12.05 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Mike Smith 58 2 2 12 27 166 226 8 52 Ian Dyson 43 2 2 20 15 149 203 4 50 David Boden 49 10 6 168 59 1,721 2,204 29 455 resigned 24 June 2005.
The Rank Group Plc 33 Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Remuneration report continued Accrued pension is the amount which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year.
The value of net increase in accrued pension represents the incremental value to the executive Director of his service during the year, assuming service is terminated at the year-end.
Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with paragraph 1.5 of guidance note GN11 issued by the actuarial profession.
The increase in transfer value net of Directors contributions includes the effect of uctuations due to factors beyond the control of the Company and Directors, such as stock market movements.
As a result of the changes to the taxation of pensions from April 2006, the Company will allow employees, including executive Directors, to opt-out of the Companys pension arrangements providing they have made adequate pension provision, and opt instead for a salary supplement.
The salary supplement rate has been set at the same level as the pension funding cost less employers National Insurance contributions, such that the total cost to the Company is no more than the cost of the Companys regular pension contributions.
Service contracts and external directorships It is the Companys policy that the Chairman and executive Directors have service contracts with notice periods not exceeding one year.
However, the Company recognises that for appointments from outside the Company, a longer initial notice period may be necessary, reducing to one year or less after an initial period.
There are no predetermined compensation provisions for early termination, and any compensation payable will be determined on an individual basis taking into account length of service, the circumstances surrounding termination and an individuals duty to mitigate losses.
Date of service Unexpired Notice contract term period Alun Cathcart 10 April 2001 12 months 12 months Mike Smith 25 February 1999 12 months 12 months David Boden 1 March 2005 12 months 12 months Peter Gill 11 July 2005 24 months 24 months reduces to 12 months from 11 July 2006.
Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts but serve the Company under letters of appointment.
These appointments may be terminated without liability for compensation.
The Company recognises that its Directors may be invited to become non-executive Directors of other companies, or become involved in charitable or public service organisations.
These appointments can broaden the knowledge and experience of the Directors to the benefit of the Company.
Providing there is no conict of interest and the commitment is not excessive, the executive Directors are permitted to accept one external appointment and to retain any fees received.
During the year, Mike Smith served as non-executive Chairman of communisis plc and retained fees of 100,000.
