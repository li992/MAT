For the period 1 April to 14 July 2004, I J Henderson served as Group Chief Executive and participated in the existing management bonus plan.
On 14 July 2004, I J Henderson stepped down as Chief Executive and accordingly revised performance measures were established to reflect his changed role within the Group for the period from 15 July to 31 December 2004.
The revised performance measures related to a number of initiatives concerned with promoting the Group and the Groups interests to central and local government, with particular reference to the Treasurys proposals to introduce REITS.
The bonus paid to I J Henderson in respect of the period 1 April to 31 December 2004 was as follows: Bonus for period 1 April to 14 July 2004 129,287 Bonus for period 15 July to 31 December 2004 201,666 330,953 Since his original expected retirement date was 14 July 2003, I J Henderson did not receive any awards of either executive share options or performance shares for three and a half years prior to 31 December 2004.

In addition I J Henderson did not draw a pension from the date of his normal retirement on 14 July 2003 until 31 December 2004.
I J Henderson received a payment in lieu of pension benefits for the period 15 July to 31 December 2004 of 170,947.
The previous Long Term Incentive Plan closed to new entrants on 31 March 2000 and performance periods expired on 31 March 2005.
I J Henderson was the sole remaining participating executive director during the year.
In summary, an award of shares, up to a maximum of 55% of salary, could be made if, over the previous five years, the Company was ranked by total shareholder returns in the first four of the eight companies in the peer group.
In respect of the period to 31 March 2005 the Company was ranked at position four and, accordingly an award of 25% of salary is payable amounting to 130,625.
Half of the award is payable in cash and half in deferred shares that will be released on the second anniversary of the award.
From 31 December 2004, until 31 March 2005, I J Henderson continued to work for the Group as a consultant at a fee of 5,000 per month.
Apart from private medical insurance cover, the provision of an office and secretarial support and a benefit of 20,000 on the purchase of his company car, no further expenses or benefits were paid to I J Henderson during this period.
