The above figures for 2003 and 2004 show the maximum award that would be released provided that the Company achieves first position within the comparator group at the end of the three-year performance period.
Shares to the value of 30 per cent of salary will be released at median performance.
Awards will be pro rated at every position between the median and first position in the comparator group.
The conditional award above for Stuart Mitchell shows the award following pro rating.
On joining the Company, Justin King received cash equivalent awards which will be pro rated on a time basis over the performance period, as if he had received conditional awards under the grants made on 30 May 2002 and 22 May 2003.
The award granted to him in respect of the conditional award made on 30 May 2002 has lapsed as the performance condition has not been met.

The Remuneration Committee agreed to compensate him for these lost entitlements, but rather than making a cash payment, an award of 261,950 restricted shares was made to him.
As the award compensated him for his lost entitlements there are no performance conditions.
191,204 shares will be released on 1 June 2005 and 70,746 shares will be released on 1 June 2006, in each case, if he remains an employee of the Company on the relevant date.
The awards will vest before the release dates if his service contract is terminated by the Company other than for cause, in the event of death or on a change of control, unless the awards are replaced by the acquiring company.
If he leaves employment for any other reason, the awards will be forfeited.
