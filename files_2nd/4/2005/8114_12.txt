the Remuneration committee determined that the awards for the executive directors would be equivalent to 100% of basic salary.
details of the awards are provided on page 37. the performance conditions applicable to the first award will be determined by reference to the companys relative total shareholder Return tsR performance against companies within the Ftse 350 index, excluding investment trusts, and the companys eBItdA performance.
For the performance conditions to be met in full and 100% of the award to vest at the end of the three-year period, the companys relative performance against the tsR must be in the upper quartile and there must also be eBItdA growth at or above 7% per annum.

30% of the award will vest for median tsR performance and eBItdA growth of 5% per annum target.
