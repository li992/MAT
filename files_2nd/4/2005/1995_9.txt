Remuneration Committee report Introduction On 25 June 2004 the Company announced that it had concluded a strategic review which led to the restructuring of the Company that was approved by shareholders at the EGM on 17 September 2004.
It was recognised at the time of the strategic review that if the restructuring went ahead it would have a significant impact on the Companys existing performance based compensation: in particular: the subsisting share awards and options under the Companys various share schemes: the annual bonus performance conditions for FY2005 and subsequent financial years: and the structure of the 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the proposed performance conditions for the first grant of awards under the Plan.
In light of the impact on a crucial part of the total remuneration package received by Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee felt that it was appropriate to revisit the remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the EGM on 24 February 2004.
Therefore, as part of the process leading up to the EGM on 17 September 2004, the Remuneration Committee Chairman and the Committees retained consultants, Halliwell Consulting, consulted with the Companys principal shareholders on a revised remuneration policy.
Following the extensive consultation, 77% of shareholders voting approved a new remuneration policy for the Companys Executive Directors at the EGM held on 17 September 2004.
The key features of the new remuneration policy are: the retention of the current salary freeze for the Executive Directors to 30 April 2006: a change to the performance conditions for the annual bonus plan: and the introduction of a new Long-Term Incentive Plan, The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004 b Long-Term Incentive Plan the 2004 b LTIP.
The Remuneration Committee believes that its revised policy and the new structure with an even stronger emphasis on performance based short and long-term compensation should encourage Executives to focus on delivering the business strategy thereby enhancing shareholder value as well as providing meaningful incentives to Executives.
This Report will be put to an advisory vote of the Companys shareholders at the 2005 AGM on 1 September 2005.
Background This report has been prepared in accordance with The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, the regulations.

co. uk 25 Remuneration Committee report continued Remuneration committee The Remuneration Committee of the Board comprises Mrs Victoria Mitchell Chairman, Mr David Howell and Mr Tony Palmer all of whom are Non-Executive Directors and independent.
The Remuneration Committee members have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Remuneration Committee has formal written terms of reference with the full remit of the Committee role described.
A copy of the terms of reference can be downloaded from the Companys website.
During the year in question the Remuneration Committee formally met three times, with the sub-committee dealing with the design and introduction of the 2004 b LTIP holding approximately 34 meetings with other members of the Board and the Companys major shareholders during the year.
The Remuneration Committee was advised during the year and continues to be advised by Halliwell Consulting, an independent executive compensation and share scheme consultancy.
No other services were provided to the Company by Halliwell Consulting during the year.
In determining the Executive Directors remuneration for the year, the Remuneration Committee consulted with the Group Chairman, Mr R St J H Lewis, the Group Managing Director, Mr A W Pidgley and the Group Finance Director, Mr R C Perrins.
No Director played a part in any discussion about his remuneration.
The Executive Directors hold no external appointments.
Remuneration policy overview The objective of the remuneration policy is to encourage, reward and retain the current Executives.
The Remuneration Committee believes that shareholders interests are best served by remuneration packages having a large emphasis on performance-related pay.
Emphasis on performance should encourage Executives to focus on delivering the new business strategy.
It is the opinion of the Remuneration Committee that the policy provides meaningful incentives to Executives and ensures that the appropriate balance between fixed and performance-related compensation is maintained.
The policy, which was agreed by shareholders at the EGM on 24 February 2004 and in its revised form on 17 September 2004, was to set the main elements of the Executive Directors remuneration package against the following quartiles in the Companys comparator group: Base salary Annual bonus potential Pension Benefits in kind Share incentives Upper decile Upper decile Lower quartile to median Market practice Upper quartile to upper decile For the purposes of benchmarking remuneration the Remuneration Committee uses the following comparator group of companies: Company name Amec plc Carillion Plc McCarthy & Stone Plc Travis Perkins Plc Balfour Beatty Plc Crest Nicholson Plc Novar Plc Ultraframe plc Barratt Developments Plc George Wimpey Plc Persimmon Plc Westbury Plc Bellway Plc Marshalls Plc Redrow Plc Wilson Bowden Plc Bovis Homes Group Plc McAlpine Alfred Plc Taylor Woodrow Plc 26 www.

Elements of Executive Directors remuneration Basic salary Policy: Upper decile Salary freeze 1 May 2003 to 30 April 2006 Year Ended 30 April 2005 In accordance with the salary freeze no rises were made during the year.
Policy It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee that the salaries of the Executive Directors should be set at the upper decile in line with the Committees view that the Company has one of the most experienced Executive teams within the sector.
The salary freeze will remain in place for the Executive team until 30 April 2006.
The next salary review date will in the normal course of events be 1 May 2006.
It should be noted that in line with the Companys policy on salary reviews, the reviews on 1 May 2006 will not result in automatic salary increases.
It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee to look to the bonus and share arrangements to reward Executives for their performance rather than to increases in base salary.
The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to increase salary levels if Executives are promoted or on the occurrence of any unforeseen event which materially affects the Company and or the market in which it operates.
In the event of such an unforeseen event the Remuneration Committee will consult shareholders before adjusting salary levels.
When determining the salaries of the Executive Directors the Remuneration Committee will take into consideration: the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity, in particular those companies within the comparator group: the performance of the individual Executive Director: the individual Executive Directors experience and responsibilities: and the pay and conditions throughout the Company.
Annual performance related bonus Policy: Upper decile bonus potential The policy of the Remuneration Committee is to set the maximum annual bonus potential at the upper decile in relation to the comparator group.
Over the first half of FY2005 the performance conditions for the Executives annual bonus plan were as set out in the 2004 Remuneration Committee Report.
The performance conditions for the second half of FY2005 were amended to take into account the approval of the corporate reconstruction and the associated change of strategy for the Company.
These amended performance conditions were discussed and agreed with shareholders during the consultation process.
co. uk 27 Remuneration Committee report continued General The theoretical maximum bonus available is 300% of salary.
However, the Remuneration Committee will only in very exceptional circumstances, outside the normal operation of the bonus plan for the year in question consider a bonus payment greater than 200% of salary.
On the occurrence of very exceptional circumstances and prior to any commitment to make a bonus payment, the Remuneration Committee would consult shareholders to obtain their agreement that the circumstances gave rise to the level of bonus payment proposed.
Therefore, the effective maximum annual bonus potential is 200% of salary.
Bonus targets are reviewed each year and agreed by the Remuneration Committee.
The performance measures for the Executive Directors bonus plan are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and position of the Company, so that they continue to remain challenging.
The structure of bonus payments is as follows: Position Percentage cash Percentage Units Executive Bonus will be paid in cash up to a Any bonus payment above 100% of salary 2 maximum of 100% of salary.
will be invested, net of tax, in Units.
These Units will be retained by the Executives for 18 months.
Participants in the annual bonus plan will only be eligible to receive a bonus if they meet the performance targets.
However, the Remuneration Committee will retain the discretion to adjust bonus payments either up or down if in their opinion the results would otherwise be inappropriate.
It should be noted that this discretion will be exercised sparingly to ensure certainty for participants and transparency for shareholders.
If the Remuneration Committee does exercise its discretion to adjust bonus payments it will only do so where there is an objective justification which can be explained to shareholders.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee will ensure that any changes to the basis of payment or financial performance targets are independently verified.
On an ongoing basis, the Remuneration Committee will continue to set robust and challenging performance targets at the beginning of each financial year taking into account the business plan for that year and general market conditions.
Bonus payments are not pensionable.
FY2005 The targets for the year ended 30 April 2005, their level of achievement and the corresponding bonus earned for the Executive Directors are set out in the following tables: Bonus targets for year ended 30 April 2005 The following table shows the element of the maximum bonus potential for each of the Executive Directors subject to each performance target: 1 May 2004 31 October 2004 1 November 2004 30 April 2005 Executive Group ROCE Divisional PBT targets 2004 cash redemption Divisional PBT targets payment made R St J H Lewis 50% 50% A W Pidgley 50% 50% R C Perrins 50% 50% A Carey 12.5% 37.5% 12.5% 37.5% G J Fry 12.5% 37.5% 12.5% 37.5% 2 Following the restructuring of the Company in October 2004, the Companys share capital can only be held and transferred in the form of Units each Unit comprising one ordinary share of 5p, one 2004 B share of 5p, one 2006 B share of 5p, one 2008 B share of 5p and one 2010 share of 5p, hereafter referred to as Units.

Future policy Prior to the reconstruction, the Remuneration Committee felt that ROCE was an appropriate measure for the Group Executive Directors Annual Performance Related Bonus Plan as this measure ensures that Executives are focused on maintaining earnings whilst having the additional benefit of measuring the efficiency with which capital is being used to generate those earnings.
For Divisional Executive Directors 75% of the bonus potential was based on the satisfaction of Divisional profit targets as the Remuneration Committee felt that it was important that the Divisional Executive Directors had a strong focus on the performance of the Divisions which they run.
However, the redemption payments under the new strategy would have a distorting effect on Group ROCE and make it difficult for shareholders to compare the Companys performance with other companies.
Therefore, in line with the approach agreed with the Companys shareholders, going forward the Group ROCE element of the bonus will be replaced with targets linked to the return of capital to shareholders.
It is the current intention of the Remuneration Committee that the element of bonus targets based on the return of capital to shareholders for future bonus years will be as follows: For years ending 30 April 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2011, this element of the annual bonus will be subject to the returns of capital of 5, 2, 2 and 3 per unit respectively.
co. uk 29 Remuneration Committee report continued 3 For years ending 30 April 2006, 2008 and 2010, this element of bonus will be earned if the dividend lock up tests are satisfied at the end of the relevant financial year six months earlier than required.
If these tests are satisfied it means that the Company is on target to be able to make the redemption payments on the due dates.
If the dividend lock up tests are not achieved at the end of the relevant financial year but the Board is of the view that they will be satisfied in time to make the next redemption payment on the relevant date, this element of the bonus will be accrued and not declared until the redemption payment has been made.
In the highly unlikely event that a bonus is paid but the due redemption payment is not made the share element of the bonus paid shall be forfeited and the cash element paid shall be offset against future bonus entitlements.
The following table sets out the maximum bonus potential for the year ending 30 April 2006 and the performance targets which will apply: Name Maximum bonus potential Return of capital to Divisional PBT targets % of salary shareholders targets R St J H Lewis 200% 100% A W Pidgley 200% 100% R C Perrins 200% 100% A Carey 200% 25% 75% G J Fry 200% 25% 75% The maximum bonus potential for the year ended 30 April 2006 has not increased.
Share incentives Policy: Upper quartile to upper decile Overview At the EGM on the 17 September 2004 shareholders approved the Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004 b Long-Term Incentive Plan.

co. uk 31 Remuneration Committee report continued The tables in the audited section of this Report provide full details of the actual awards released, options vested and the conditional compensation payments and the terms applying to them.
The Berkeley Group plc 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan No awards were granted under this Plan during the year.
Individuals were granted awards annually, the vesting of which were subject to the attainment of pre-determined performance targets measured over a three year period.
Awards were structured to deliver a pre-determined cash value and a number of shares, each worth at the outset 50% of the value of the total annual award.
The shares element was fixed by reference to the market value of the Companys shares at the date of grant.
The maximum value that could be delivered under an award based on the share price at the date of grant was 200% of an individuals annual salary excluding bonuses and all other benefits as at the date of grant.
The cash element was payable following the third anniversary of the date of grant of the award provided the performance targets had been met.
The participant was only entitled to the share element following the fourth anniversary from the date of grant of the award, by which time the outstanding value of the underlying shares had increased or decreased in line with the Companys share price performance over the period since the date of grant.
Performance under the LTIP was measured according to the level of audited cumulative pre-tax profits of the division or Group company in which the participant was employed over the relevant period.
Achievement was determined on an all or nothing basis over a period of three years with no opportunity for re-testing.
For awards under the LTIP to vest, the audited net assets of each division or Group Company, after taking account of changes in share capital and dividend distributions, must also have increased by at least a cumulative rate of 10% per annum since the base year.
These performance conditions were selected because it was the Boards view that profit and asset growth would ensure the delivery of enhanced value to the Companys shareholders.
The Berkeley Group plc 2000 Approved & Unapproved Executive Share Option Plans the Option Plans No grants of options have been made to Executive Directors under the Option Plans during the year.
Two executive option plans were introduced in 2000.
Under the option plans individuals were eligible to be granted options annually over shares worth up to 100% of annual salary excluding bonuses and all other benefits.
The Remuneration Committee had the discretion to vary this amount in exceptional circumstances, in which case the limit was 200% of annual salary excluding bonuses and all other benefits.
Exercise of options granted was conditional upon meeting defined performance targets based on the increase in earnings per ordinary share over a three year period.
New long-term share incentive arrangements for the Executive Directors The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004 b Long-Term Incentive Plan the 2004 b LTIP The 2004 b LTIP is the Companys sole long-term share incentive arrangement for the Executive Directors and was approved by shareholders at the EGM on 17 September 2004 with 77% of shareholders voting supporting the Plan.
Prior to the EGM, the Company conducted a full consultation with major shareholders and institutional shareholder bodies.
The Plan provides the Executive Directors, excluding the Executive Chairman, with rights to receive, at no cost, such number of shares as results in them holding 15% of the equity of the Company following the issue of those rights.
The shares will only be released to the Executive Directors if the Company has returned to shareholders 12 per share by 31 January 2011.
50% of released shares are then subject to an additional one year retention period, with the balance subject to a two year period.
The following table sets out the Awards made under the 2004 b LTIP to the Executive Directors: Award A W Pidgley R C Perrins A Carey G J Fry Percentage of issued ordinary share capital taking into account the dilution resulting from the Award under the Plan 8% 3% 2.5% 1.5% The Remuneration Committees policy is designed to incentivise the Executive Directors to maximise the total return to shareholders.
In the Remuneration Committees opinion this will be achieved by incentivising the Executive Directors to not only ensure that 12 per share is returned to shareholders but also by providing them with a direct share in the residual value of the Company.
As a result the value of the awards is directly linked to the value of the residual Company following the return and as such there is a close alignment between the interests of the Executive Directors and shareholders, both of whom benefit from a maximum value for the residual part of the Company.
co. uk The Remuneration Committee will determine whether the performance condition has been satisfied by ensuring the redemption payments have been made in the allotted time frame.
Dilution Excluding The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004 b LTIP the Company has operated its executive and all employee arrangements within the ABI dilution limits.
The 2004 b LTIP will provide the long-term share incentive for Executive Directors during its life.
The Board has currently determined that no new equity based arrangements which will be satisfied by the issue of shares or the transfer of treasury shares will be introduced to replace the closed share arrangements set out above.
Pension Policy: Lower quartile to median The Executive Directors are all members of one or more of the following pensions schemes in operation within the Group, namely The Berkeley Group Staff Benefits Plan, The Berkeley Homes Executive Pension Plan and The St George PLC Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme.
No element of remuneration other than basic salary is pensionable.
Three Directors have benefits accruing to them under a defined contribution scheme and three have benefits accruing to them under a defined benefits scheme.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in these schemes.
Details of pension costs for Executive Directors are set out, in the audited section of the report on page 36.
Benefits in kind Policy: Market practice In line with market practice, the Companys policy is to provide Executive Directors with the following additional benefits: a fully expensed company car: and medical insurance.
Other remuneration matters All employee share schemes The Companys current all employee share schemes were closed to new awards on the Court approval of the reconstruction of the Company on 30 October 2004.
Traditional all employee plans such as Share Incentive Plans and SAYE Schemes cannot be operated by the Company after the reconstruction as its Units do not qualify under the relevant legislation.
Therefore, the Company is intending to operate an all employee long-term cash based bonus plan called The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2005 Share Appreciation Rights Plan.
This Plan provides all employees of the Company excluding Executive Directors with the opportunity of being granted rights on an annual basis to receive Share Appreciation Rights which will normally vest three years after the date of grant and subject to continued employment.
Share Appreciation Rights will consist of a number of phantom Units with an exercise price set at the market price of a unit on the date of grant.
On the exercise of Share Appreciation Rights an employee will be entitled to receive a cash payment equivalent to the difference between the adjusted market price of a Unit adding back redemption payments made since the date of grant less the exercise price multiplied by the number of phantom Units being exercised.
Non-Executive Directors fees Policy: Upper decile fees All Non-Executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set by the articles of association.
The 2005 fee levels are based on a specific survey of the fees paid to NonExecutive Directors in the comparator group by Halliwell Consulting.
The basic fee paid to each Non-Executive Director in the year was 36,400 per annum and 45,500 for the Senior Independent Director.
Further fees are payable for additional work performed in respect of the Chairmanship of the Remuneration and Audit Remuneration Committees 5,000 p. a.. Non-Executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Companys share incentive schemes or performance based plans and are not eligible to join the Companys pension scheme.
An additional 60,000 of fees was paid to Mrs Mitchell in shares during the year ending 30 April 2005.
This payment was made because the Board of Berkeley believed that it was appropriate to pay Mrs Mitchell this additional remuneration to recognise the very significant time she spent during 2004 discharging her duties as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
This was far in excess of that normally associated with the position and required Mrs Mitchell to forego other works and consulting opportunities during this period.
The Board of Berkeley consulted with major shareholders about this payment and thought it appropriate to make the payment in shares.
co. uk 33 Remuneration Committee report continued Executive Directors contracts The policy on termination is that the Company does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations.
The only event on the occurrence of which the Company is potentially liable to make a payment to any of the Executive Directors is on cessation of employment: with the maximum payment being 12 months salary.
No payment is due on either a Company takeover or in the event of liquidation.
In addition, Executive Directors will be expected to mitigate their loss.
Further, the Remuneration Committee ensures that there have been no unjustified payments for failure.
None of the Executive Directors contracts provides for liquidated damages.
There are no special provisions contained in any of the Executive Directors contracts which provide for longer periods of notice on a change of control of the Company.
Further, there are no special provisions providing for additional compensation on an Executive Directors cessation of employment with the Company.
Non-Executive Directors All non-executive appointments are subject to a notice period of one month and subject to successful re-election upon retirement by rotation as required by the Companys articles of association.
All letters of appointment for Non-Executive Directors are renewable annually on 1 May.
