Remuneration policy during an Offer Period Following approaches from Deutsche Brse AG and Euronext NV which may or may not result in either acquiring the Company, adjustments have been made to the remuneration policy to recognise these circumstances.
Specically, whilst the Company and its directors and employees have been subject to restrictions on dealings in the Companys shares due to the Takeover Code and the UKLAs Listing Rules it has not been considered appropriate for nonexecutive directors to receive a proportion of their fee in shares.
Since December 2004, non-executive fees have been paid entirely in cash and this will continue until such time as the Company is no longer subject to share dealing restrictions, whereupon the policy of investing 20 per cent of fees in London Stock Exchange shares will be re-established.
Similarly, it has not been considered appropriate to make awards of Performance and Matching Shares during this period or launch the Share Incentive Plan approved by shareholders in 2004.
It is intended that awards will be made at the earliest opportunity once the Company is no longer subject to sharedealing restrictions.
