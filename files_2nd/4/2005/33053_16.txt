Remuneration report Remuneration Committee membership and terms of reference The Remuneration Committee the Committee is comprised exclusively of Independent Non-executive Directors and its members are: W S H Laidlaw Chairman, W F Blount, The Baroness Noakes DBE and C J Brady.
WSH Laidlaw was appointed to the Committee as Chairman on May 11, 2005, replacing The Rt Hon.
Lord Baker of Dorking, and C J Brady was appointed as a member on November 16, 2005.
The role of the Committee is to consider and make recommendations on the framework of executive remuneration the policy for approval by the Board.
In accordance with the policy, the Committee will consider, recommend as appropriate and approve the conditions of service of the Chairman, the Executive Directors and the Company Secretary, including the duration of any service agreements, and the emoluments and other benefits payable under such agreements, including pension entitlements and participation in incentive arrangements.
The Committee also recommends and monitors the level and structure of remuneration for senior management and oversees the Companys and Old Hansons long-term incentive plans and option schemes.
During the year under review, other than from its independent advisor, the Committee also sought the assistance of the Chairman, the Chief Executive, the Company Secretary and the Head of Corporate Human Resources on matters relating to remuneration.
There were three formal meetings held by the Committee during the year and all the then members attended each meeting, other than C J Brady, who, having been appointed to the Committee on November 16, 2005 was unable to change his commitments to attend the Committee meeting on November 22, 2005.
The Committee also dealt with other matters under its terms of reference by written correspondence.
The Chairman, Chief Executive and the Company Secretary were present at all the meetings of the Committee but each were respectively excluded when their own performance and remuneration were being discussed.
The Committee also undertook a review of its terms of reference and its own work and effectiveness, and reported back to the Board.
Committee members receive fees as Non-executive Directors, including a fee for acting as a Committee member as outlined in the Corporate governance section on page 56, but do not receive any pension entitlements nor any shortor long-term performance related incentives.
No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest, other than as a shareholder in the Company, in the matters to be decided or for the day-to-day management of the business.
The fees payable to Non-executive Directors are determined by the Board as a whole within the limits set by the articles of association and for the year ending December 31, 2005 the basic fee was 36,000.
The Non-executive Directors do not participate in or vote on any discussion relating to their own remuneration.
The Committee has appointed Mercer Human Resource Consulting Mercer to act on behalf of the Committee in providing independent market information and remuneration advice on an ongoing basis.
Mercer also provides actuarial and consulting services to the Company.
Remuneration policy Hanson operates in competitive and international markets.
To secure the long-term performance of the business it is essential that the Company implements an integrated system of remuneration which rewards sustained high performance well enough to attract and retain high-performing executives and directors.
To ensure that its remuneration rates are competitive, whilst not being excessive, the Committee keeps remuneration under regular review in light of emerging best practice.
The remuneration policy is designed to provide packages, which take account of individual performance: i in the knowledge of what comparable, in terms of size and complexity, UK and international companies are paying: ii in the context of packages offered throughout the Hanson group: and iii to include shortand long-term performance related elements, potentially a significant portion of total rewards, to motivate the highest performance and to align the interests of the Executive Directors and shareholders.
As shareholder approval for conditional awards to be made under the Companys long-term incentive arrangements expires in 2006, the Company undertook a review in 2005 of its long-term incentive arrangements and proposals on these new arrangements will be submitted to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.
Details of the proposed new arrangements are outlined in a separate letter to shareholders.
Share incentives are considered to be an important part of the incentive policy for Executive Directors.
A shareholding requirement has been introduced for the Executive Directors.
For the Chief Executive this will be to hold shares to the value of two times salary and for the other Executive Directors to the value of one times salary.
For any new Chief Executive or Executive Director, the expectation would be that the shareholding requirement would be achieved within five years of the individual becoming a Director.
The current Chief Executive and other Executive Directors already satisfy these shareholding requirements.
Remuneration report 61 Remuneration report continued Basic salary In setting the basic salary for each Executive Director, the Committee reviews relevant market data and considers the Directors experience, performance and responsibilities.
Basic salaries are generally reviewed on an annual basis or following a significant change in responsibilities.
Increases in basic salary of between 4-5% have been granted to the Executive Directors for the year commencing January 1, 2006.
The Committee also determines the fee for the Chairman and undertook a full review prior to the appointment of M W Welton as Chairman, whose fee as Chairman is 220,000 per annum.
Annual bonus scheme The annual bonus scheme for the Executive Directors and other senior executives is aligned with changes in shareholder value through the economic value added methodology.
The main principle of economic value added is to recognise that over time a company should generate returns in excess of its cost of capital the return that lenders and shareholders expect of the Company each year.
The annual bonus scheme is calibrated by reference to target levels of bonus and, for the Executive Directors and other senior executives, works on a bonus banking arrangement whereby each year the improvement in the groups overall economic value added for that year determines whether there is a bonus bank addition or deduction.
Following the addition or deduction, the participant receives one-third of the accumulated bonus bank.
There is neither a cap maximum addition into the bonus bank each year nor a floor maximum deduction from the bonus bank each year.
The bonus bank has two main functions: firstly it ensures that individuals do not make short-term decisions such as deferring essential expenditure from one year to the next and receive a bonus for doing so: and secondly, the bonus bank can act as a retention tool.
For 2005, the target level of bonus for A J Murray was 62.5% of basic salary, for J C Nicholls 50% of basic salary and for G Dransfield 37.5% of basic salary.
Improvement in the groups overall economic value added for the year to December 31, 2005 determined the bonus bank addition for the Executive Directors.
The strong operating and profit performance in 2005 led to significant improvement in the groups economic value added and resulted in additions to the bonus bank of 118% of basic salary for A J Murray, 95% of basic salary for J C Nicholls and 71% of basic salary for G Dransfield.
The bonuses paid in respect of the year to December 31, 2005 to the Executive Directors were 511,680 for A J Murray, 276,486 for J C Nicholls and 165,994 for G Dransfield.
Performance targets under the annual bonus scheme, based on improvements in economic value added, are set by the Committee, after taking advice from Mercer.
Bonuses payable to Executive Directors are not pensionable.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Executive Directors and certain senior executives and managers from the Companys worldwide operations participate in the LTIP.
Under this plan, participants are conditionally awarded shares in the Company at nil cost with the proportion of those shares which may vest subject to the achievement of performance targets over a performance period set by the Committee.
In 2005, a conditional award of shares was made to A J Murray of 150% of basic salary and to the other Executive Directors of 100% of basic salary.
The conditional awards made in 2005 are subject to performance criteria and the Committee determined that 50% of the conditional award should be subject to the attainment of an economic value added target and 50% to a total shareholder return TSR target.
TSR is the aggregate of share price growth and dividends paid, on the assumption that such dividends are reinvested in Hanson shares during the performance period.
The Committee selected these performance measurements as it believed they correlated clearly with the creation of shareholder value.
For the conditional award made in 2005, the economic value added target requires an improvement in economic value added over a period of three years based on the results for the year to December 31, 2004.
For this measurement, a linear vesting schedule applies in order that 25% of the award will vest at the minimum performance level with the maximum award vesting only on the achievement of substantial performance improvement.
A similar economic value added target is in place for the awards made in 2003 and 2004.
On attaining the minimum economic value added improvements of 13.4m for the 2003 award, 14.0m for the 2004 award and 14.5m for the 2005 award, 25% of the respective awards, subject to the economic value added measurement criteria, will vest.
100% of the awards subject to this measurement will vest on the attainment of economic value added improvements of 35.6m, 37.2m and 38.8m for the 2003, 2004 and 2005 awards, respectively.
Remuneration report 62 For the TSR measurement in 2005 and similarly for the awards made in 2003 and 2004, the conditional awards made will vest only if Hanson achieves a TSR over the three year performance period, from the date of the award in March 2005, which is greater than the TSR achieved by at least 50% of the members of a comparator group of international building materials companies at the date of the award the comparator group over the same period.
If so, 30% of the award will vest.
All of the award will vest if the Company achieves a TSR over the performance period which is greater than that achieved by 80% of the comparator group.
Between these two points the award will vest in the proportion of 2.33% of the award for each 1% improvement in the Companys ranking.
In 2003, the comparator group consisted of 21 companies, including Hanson.
These included nine UK building materials companies in the FTSE 350 Index Aggregate Industries, BPB, Hanson, Novar, Pilkington, RMC, Travis Perkins, Ultraframe and Wolseley, six European building materials companies in the Euro Top 300 Index CRH, Dyckerhoff, Heidelberger, Holcim, Lafarge and Wienerberger, four North American businesses Florida Rock, Martin Marietta, Texas Industries and Vulcan and two Australian building materials companies Boral and CSR.
Following the demerger of Rinker Group Limited from CSR in March 2003, the performance measurement of the comparator group for the 2003 award has been modified to substitute Rinker for CSR using the methodology of re-investing a notional holding of CSR shares in Rinker from April 1, 2003 onwards.
In addition, the Committee removed Novar, Aggregate Industries, RMC, BPB, Heidelberger and Dyckerhoff following changes of control or takeover of these companies.
For the 2004 award, the comparator group consists of 15 companies, including Hanson.
These include five UK building materials companies in the FTSE 350 Index Hanson, Pilkington, Travis Perkins, Ultraframe and Wolseley, four European building materials companies in the Euro Top 300 Index CRH, Holcim, Lafarge and Wienerberger, four North American businesses Florida Rock, Martin Marietta, Texas Industries and Vulcan and two Australian building materials companies Boral and Rinker.
For the 2005 award, the comparator group consists of 16 companies, including Hanson.
These include four UK building materials companies in the FTSE 350 Index Hanson, Pilkington, Travis Perkins and Wolseley, five European building materials companies in the Euro Top 300 Index Buzzi Unicem, CRH, Holcim, Lafarge and Wienerberger, four North American businesses Florida Rock, Martin Marietta, Vulcan and Cemex and three Australian building materials companies Boral, Rinker and James Hardie.
There is no retesting of performance under either the economic value added measurement or the TSR measurement.
The table below shows the conditional interests in shares of Executive Directors relating to awards made under the LTIP in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005.
For the conditional award made in 2002 to Executive Directors, none of the award subject to a TSR performance measurement criteria and 50% of the award subject to an economic value added performance measurement criteria vested following the end of the three year performance period.
This resulted in a total vesting of 25% of the maximum number of shares under the conditional awards.
For the conditional award made in 2003, it is anticipated that 47% of the award subject to a TSR performance measurement and 65% of the award subject to an economic value added performance measurement criteria will vest following the end of the three year performance period.
This would result in a total vesting of 56% of the maximum number of shares under the conditional awards.
A J Murray retained 28,733 shares, J C Nicholls retained 11,778 shares and G Dransfield retained 9,582 shares.
2 The figures in the table above for J C Nicholls include those of his wife, an employee, who also participates in the LTIP.
3 A J H Dougal and S N Vivian, former Executive Directors of the Company, left on May 14, 2002 and June 30, 2003, respectively.
They retained certain entitlements to the conditional shares awarded to them under the LTIP.
Under the 2002 Award, which vested on March 1, 2005 as detailed above, 24,364 shares and 13,059 shares vested to A J H Dougal and S N Vivian, respectively.
4 The relevant market prices at the time of the conditional awards in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 were 461.75p, 290.4p, 439.6p and 514.3p, respectively.
5 During the period January 1, 2006 to February 23, 2006 there was no change in the interests of Executive Directors in the LTIP.
Conditional awards under the LTIP will usually be made annually.
The awards to be made in 2006 will be subject to shareholder approval of revised long-term incentive arrangements.
Remuneration report 63 Remuneration report continued Awards vesting under the LTIP are not pensionable.
Share Option Plan Executive Directors and a selected number of senior executives from the Companys worldwide operations participated in the Share Option Plan.
Under this Plan, participants are granted options over a number of shares but the proportion of those shares under option which may be exercised is subject to the achievement of performance targets over a three year performance period set by the Committee.
To the extent an option or part of an option becomes capable of being exercised at the end of the three year performance period it will ordinarily remain exercisable at any time up to 10 years from the date of grant.
The economic value added and TSR performance targets for the conditional options granted to Executive Directors in the years ending December 31, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 were the same as for the awards made in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 to the Executive Directors under the LTIP, as detailed above, with no retesting.
Consequently, for the grant made in 2003, it is anticipated that 56% of the number of shares under option will become exercisable following the end of the three-year performance period.
The table below shows the numbers of shares under option of Executive Directors relating to conditional grants made under the Share Option Plan.
2 A J H Dougal and S N Vivian, former Executive Directors of the Company, left Hanson on May 14, 2002 and June 30, 2003, respectively.
The option grants made to them and outstanding at the date of leaving remained subject to the performance criteria as outlined above.
Following the end of the three year performance period 25% of the shares under the conditional options granted on March 1, 2002 became capable of being exercised.
In respect of the grant on March 1, 2002, A J H Dougal and S N Vivian became entitled to options over 24,364 and 13,059 shares, respectively, at an exercise price of 461.75p per share.
They exercised their options on November 23 and 21, 2005, respectively.
3 During the period January 1, 2006 to February 23, 2006 there were no changes in the interests of Executive Directors in options under the Share Option Plan.
Under the Black-Scholes option valuation model, on the basis of the Companys three year share price performance, the value of an option over a share at the date of grant in 2005 was equal to approximately 30% of the shares current market value.
On this basis, with no discount to the Black-Scholes value because of the application of performance conditions on exercise, the conditional options granted during 2005 at 100% of basic salary had a value, at the date of grant, of about 30% of basic salary.
The market price at December 31, 2005 was 639p per share, which compares to the exercise prices of the conditional options granted in 2003, 2004 and 2005 at prices of 290.4p, 439.6p and 514.3p per share, respectively.
No further grants of option will be made under the Share Option Plan.
Any gains made under the Share Option Plan are not pensionable.
Executive Share Option Schemes Options to subscribe for Hanson ordinary shares granted to Executive Directors under the Executive Share Option Schemes are shown below.
No performance conditions apply to the right to exercise the options granted.
No grants have been made under these schemes since 1998 and no further grants will be made under these schemes.

2 The figures shown in the table above for J C Nicholls are those of his wife, an employee who participates in the Executive Share Option Schemes.
Any gains made under the Executive Share Option Schemes are not pensionable.
The term of options granted could be from three to seven years and any option is conditional on a commitment by the participant to make regular savings from pay.
The savings are held by an independent Sharesave provider to buy shares at the end of the option period.
The exercise of options under the Sharesave Scheme can be satisfied by the issue of new shares or the transfer of existing shares.
At December 31, 2005, there were approximately 2,600 participants in the Sharesave Scheme and the number of shares under options granted to Executive Directors under the Sharesave Scheme are shown in the table below: Market Gain on Balance at Granted Exercised price at date Balance at Exercise Range of exercise during Jan 1, 2005 during year during year of exercise p Dec 31, 2005 price p exercise dates the year A J Murray 2,971 2,971 604 318 12 05-05 06 8,497 G Dransfield 3,099 3,099 318 12 07-05 08 1,993 1,993 328 06 09-11 09 J C Nicholls 2,263 2,263 469.25 428 12 04-05 05 933 1,188 1,188 604 318 12 05-05 06 3,398 2,398 2,398 395 06 08-11 08 1,439 1,439 395 06 08-11 08 Notes 1 Options granted under the Sharesave Scheme during the year were at an exercise price of 395p per share, being a 20% discount to the market price on March 17, 2005.

Any gains made under the Sharesave Scheme are not pensionable.
The range of the market quotations for Hanson shares, as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List, during the period January 1 to December 31, 2005 was 451.5p to 640p.
Gains on exercise The total gains made by Directors on options exercised or exercised for cash under the Share Option Plan, the Executive Share Option Schemes, and the Sharesave Scheme were 253,908 94,063.
Performance review The following graph shows the TSR performance of the Company and that of the FTSE 100 Index and the FTSE 350 Construction & Materials Index over the five-year period to December 31, 2005.
The FTSE 100 Index was selected due to its broad range of constituents of a large capitalisation, of which Hanson is a constituent company, and the FTSE 350 Construction & Materials Index was selected as it contains the closest peer group to Hanson in terms of activity and size, and Hanson is also a constituent company of this index.

Termination payments are limited to the Directors normal compensation, including basic salary, annual incentives and benefits, for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
Pensionable service will also accrue for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
In the event that Hanson terminates a service contract without notice the unexpired portion of the notice period will count towards the calculation of entitlements under the Companys LTIP and Share Option Plan: these awards would still remain subject to their respective performance conditions.
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts with Hanson.
Each is appointed at the will of the Company and the Chairman and Non-executive Director concerned under the terms of an appointment letter.
The terms and conditions of employment of the Chairman and the Non-executive Directors are available on request from the Company Secretary.
External appointments The Company acknowledges that its Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-executive Directors of other leading companies and that such Non-executive duties can broaden experience and knowledge to the benefit of Hanson.
Executive Directors are limited to one such Non-executive position and the policy is that fees may be retained.
J C Nicholls is a Non-executive Director of Man Group plc, in respect of which he received fees of 75,000 in 2005.
No other such positions are held by any of the other Executive Directors.
Pensions The Executive Directors are members of a defined benefit plan the pension plan which, in accordance with HM Revenue & Customs limits, provides them with a maximum pension of two-thirds of basic salary on retirement.
The pension plan is contributory until such time as the Director has completed the maximum pensionable service allowed under the pension plan.
Along with other members of the pension plan, for service accruing after July 1, 2004, the Executive Directors had a choice to retain the same accrual rate in the pension plan by paying an increased contribution of 7.5%, previously 5%, of pensionable salary which does not include bonuses.
The Executive Directors have a normal retirement age of 60, with the right to receive early retirement pensions to be paid from age 55 in certain circumstances.
The following table gives details for each Executive Director of: the increase in the accrued pension attributable to service since December 31, 2004. the increase in the accrued pension net of inflation attributable to service since December 31, 2004. the annual accrued pension payable from normal retirement age, calculated as if he had left service at December 31, 2005. the transfer value of the increase of the accrued pension net of inflation and the Directors contributions calculated in accordance with actuarial guidance note GN11.
the transfer value of the accrued pension at December 31, 2004, calculated in accordance with actuarial guidance note GN11.
the transfer value of the accrued pension at December 31, 2005, calculated in accordance with actuarial guidance note GN11.
the change in the transfer value over the year net of the Directors contributions.
It includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of Hanson and the Directors, such as market movements.
A large part of the increase in the transfer value over the year has been as a result of a lower discount rate applied to the pension plans liabilities.
These amounts exclude any benefits attributable to additional voluntary contributions.

It is Hansons current policy to provide executives with appropriate benefits outside the pension plan in relation to that part of their salary which exceeds the cap.
The contributions made during the year were subject to income tax as a benefit in kind and the Executive Director concerned J C Nicholls was liable to settle the tax liability himself.
2 G Dransfield has completed the maximum pensionable service allowed under the pension plan and did not accrue any further pension over the year.
3 In anticipation of the implementation of the UK governments proposed simplification of the taxation of pensions, the Committee has reviewed the impact of the proposals on all employees, including the Executive Directors.
The approach to be adopted, following recommendations from the independent advisor to the Committee, is for solutions which are essentially cost neutral to the Company with no compensation for changes in tax legislation.
All affected individuals have been given the opportunity to receive independent financial advice at the Companys cost.
