Cattles ra2005 p16-36 29 3 06 4:01 pm Page 26 26 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration For the year ended 31 December 2005 Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations and also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
The report describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors remuneration and, in accordance with the Regulations, a resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the annual general meeting of the company in May 2006.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the companys members on the auditable part of the directors remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited Information Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee has comprised three independent non-executive directors, D A Haxby as chairman, N N Broadhurst and F Dee as the Committees other members throughout 2005.
A J McWalter was appointed as a member of the Committee on 10 November 2005.
All members of the Remuneration Committee attended each of the six meetings held in 2005 while they were members of the Committee, except for N N Broadhurst who was absent from one unscheduled meeting of the Committee which was held at short notice.
None of the Committee members has any personal financial interest in the company other than as a shareholder, nor have they any day to day involvement in the running of the business or conicts of interests arising from cross-directorships.
One of the main duties of the Committee is to determine the remuneration of the executive directors, the Chairman and the Company Secretary and to monitor the level and structure of remuneration for specified senior managers below Board level.
The Committees terms of reference, which can be found on the companys website and are available on application to the Company Secretary at the registered ofce, are reviewed annually by the Committee and any changes are approved by the Board.
The Committee has appointed New Bridge Street Consultants LLP NBSC as its remuneration consultants.
NBSC has no other connection with the company.
NBSC advises the Committee directly on matters within the Committees terms of reference on which the Committee chooses to consult NBSC.
NBSC may also advise the company generally on aspects of executive and employee remuneration, typically on the implementation and on-going operation of executive remuneration schemes.
NBSC advises a sub-committee of the Board from time to time on the remuneration of the non-executive directors, other than the Chairman.
The Chairman, the Chief Executive and the Treasury & Risk Director are consulted by the Committee but do not participate in any discussions relating to their own remuneration.
Remuneration Policy Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the high calibre necessary to maintain the groups strong growth and profit performance and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders.
The performance measurement of the executive directors and the determination of their annual remuneration packages are undertaken by the Committee.
There are four main elements of the remuneration packages of executive directors: Basic salary and benets: Annual bonus: Long-term incentives: and Pension and life assurance arrangements.
The companys policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors should be performance-related.
As described below, each of the executive directors may participate in both an annual bonus scheme and long-term incentive arrangements.
When determining remuneration levels for the executive directors, consideration is given to pay levels elsewhere in the group.
Fees paid to the Chairman of the Board are determined by the Remuneration Committee in consultation with the Chief Executive.
Fees paid to non-executive directors, other than the Chairman, are determined by a sub-committee of the Board comprising the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive and the Finance Director.
Cattles ra2005 p16-36 29 3 06 4:01 pm Page 27 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 27 Basic Salary and Benets The basic salaries of the executive directors are determined by the Remuneration Committee, prior to the beginning of each year, taking into account the responsibilities and performance of the individual director and having regard to relevant market comparisons from independent sources based on objective research conducted by NBSC.
The policy is to provide basic salaries at the median range identied by this research.
The median was determined by reference to basic salary levels in a group of approximately 50 companies which were drawn from all sectors and had a similar market capitalisation to that of the company but excluded any companies that operated remuneration arrangements which the Committee believed did not reect typical practice.
Following the Committees review in late 2005 applying this policy, the Board agreed the following changes to the annual salaries of the executive directors with effect from 1 January 2006: 1 January 2006 1 January 2005 000 000 S P Mahon 525 500 M W G Collins 290 265 J J Corr 290 265 I S Cummine 350 325 The increases to the basic salaries of M W G Collins and J J Corr were necessary to bring their salaries up to the median level for similar roles in the comparator group of companies and to take account of their specic financial expertise which is critical to the groups business.
The increase to the basic salary of I S Cummine reects the change to his responsibilities on 1 July 2005 when he became the Chief Operating officer for the group as a whole as opposed to the Consumer Credit Division.
The increase to the basic salary of S P Mahon reects typical executive director salary ination.
In making these recommendations to the Board, the Committee also took account of the outstanding performance of the group over a number of years, including 2005.
In addition to basic salary, the executive directors receive certain benets in kind, being a car, fuel provision, private medical insurance and permanent health insurance.
Annual Bonus The targets which trigger annual cash bonuses are set by the Remuneration Committee.
In 2005 these targets comprised the following three measures of performance: i the groups actual earnings per share EPS growth: ii funds utilisation efficiency as measured against budget: and iii the achievement of each directors personal objectives.
The maximum potential bonus payment to executive directors in respect of the year ended 31 December 2005 was restricted to 100% of basic salary, with a maximum of 75% being payable in respect of EPS growth, 15% in respect of funds utilisation efficiency and 10% in respect of the achievement of personal objectives.
Any bonus earned over 75% of basic salary must be deferred into shares which will not be received by the executive directors for a further three years.
Any such deferred shares would count for the purposes of the Matching Shares element of the Long-Term Incentive Plan described more fully below, but would not be subject to further performance conditions.
The Committee has retained this structure for the 2006 executive directors annual cash bonuses.
Bonuses do not form part of pensionable earnings.
Long-Term Incentives The Remuneration Committee believes that share ownership by executive directors and senior executives strengthens the link between their personal interests and those of shareholders, and provides the opportunity for longer term motivation and retention.
The companys policy is that the executive directors are required to build up and retain a shareholding in the company, primarily from their long-term incentive arrangements, equivalent to their annual salary.
The Committee reviewed the companys long-term incentive arrangements during 2005 and concluded that grant levels, performance criteria and vesting schedules pertaining to these schemes remained appropriate to the companys current circumstances and prospects.
Cattles ra2005 p16-36 29 3 06 4:01 pm Page 28 28 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP was adopted in May 2005 to replace the Restricted Share Scheme, which expired in 2004.
Participation is at the discretion of the Committee and participants include the executive directors and some other key senior executives who are best placed to inuence the performance of the group.
The LTIP has two elements, an award of Performance Shares and an award of Matching Shares linked to an investment in Cattles plc shares.
Awards will normally vest following the third anniversary of the date of grant provided that certain performance conditions have been satisfied and the participant remains in employment.
Awards of Performance Shares may not be granted to any participant in any financial year under the LTIP if it would cause the aggregate market value of those shares to exceed 100% of the participants basic salary other than in exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment, where the limit is 200% of basic salary.
Awards of Matching Shares will be granted to the extent that participants acquire Cattles plc shares using their annual bonus Investment Shares.
Under the companys annual bonus plan, any annual bonus in excess of 75% of basic salary payable to an executive director must be deferred into the companys shares.
These shares will be treated as Investment Shares that will qualify for the grant of Matching Shares.
Participants will also be allowed to invest their cash bonus but no other funds on a voluntary basis into Cattles plc shares and treat those shares as Investment Shares.
The maximum aggregate pre-tax value of bonus invested on both a compulsory and voluntary basis per annum is 37.5% of the individuals salary.
Matching Shares can be awarded up to a maximum award ratio of 2:1 free Matching Shares to Investment Shares, on a gross basis.
If a participant sells his Investment Shares at any time during the three year performance period, this will reduce on a pro-rata basis the number of Matching Shares that may be transferable to him on vesting.
The vesting of Awards will depend on the companys performance over a single xed three year performance period i. e. with no re-testing facility which will commence with the financial year in which the Awards are granted.
Awards will vest by reference to the companys EPS growth in excess of the Retail Price Index RPI over the three year performance period, comparing the companys EPS in the financial year prior to grant with its EPS in the third year following grant.
For these purposes, EPS is calculated on the same basis as stated in the companys annual report and accounts, subject to the Committee using its discretion to take account of any material short-term effect arising from an acquisition or any exceptional item of profit or loss in a particular year, or to take account of changes in accounting standards.
Subject to the adjuster referred to below, the performance conditions relating to Awards made in 2005 are: EPS growth of the company over the Percentage of Award 3 year performance period that vests Less than RPI 20% 0% RPI 20% 30% RPI 35% or more 100% Between RPI 20% and RPI 35% Between 30% and 100% on a straight line basis In order to provide a comparative element to the performance conditions, the performance conditions will be adjusted by reference to the companys EPS performance over the performance period relative to an average EPS growth of companies comprised in the FTSE 250 the Index, calculated by dividing the Index by the price earnings ratio of the Index.
If the companys EPS growth over the performance period is lower than the average EPS growth of the Index, the level of vesting of Awards will reduce by 1% for every 4% subject to a maximum reduction of 25% that the companys EPS growth is lower than the Index average.
To the extent that the companys EPS growth is higher, the level of vesting of Awards will increase by 1% for every 4% up to but not exceeding the maximum level of vesting.
The Committee considers that the use of EPS in the LTIP is appropriate as it encourages the companys senior management team to deliver sustained exceptional EPS growth, with EPS being a widely used statistic in gauging the companys performance and valuing its shares.
No participants acquired Investment Shares and so no award of Matching Shares was made in 2005.
The LTIP operates in conjunction with an employee benefit trust Trust, the trustee of which is Cattles Trustee Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cattles plc.
The directors of the trustee company are the members of the Remuneration Committee, all of whom are independent non-executive directors of the parent company, and none of whom is a beneciary under the scheme.
On the grant of Awards, the Trust purchases sufficient shares in the market to satisfy such awards, hence there is no issue of new shares.
On the vesting of Awards, the Trust transfers the appropriate number of shares to the participants.
The Trust will at no time hold more than 5% of the issued share capital of Cattles plc.
The LTIP is funded by loans from the company to the Trust, which then acquires Cattles plc shares for the purpose of the LTIP.
Cattles ra2005 p16-36 29 3 06 4:01 pm Page 29 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 29 Restricted Share Scheme This scheme was established in 1994 and expired in 2004.
The participants included the executive directors and some other key senior executives.
In relation to the awards made contingently under the scheme, each participant was notionally awarded shares up to one times basic annual salary each year.
The number of long-term incentive shares which a participant ultimately receives will depend upon continued employment and performance conditions.
More particularly, EPS must grow by a minimum pre-determined amount, set by the Remuneration Committee at the time of the award, over a three year performance period before participants will become entitled to any shares.
Target earnings growth is as follows: Notionally awarded Earliest vesting date Three year target earnings growth January 2003 April 2006 45% i January 2004 April 2007 45% i i In excess of the increase in the RPI to the extent that it exceeds 5%.
The provisional award of shares is established by comparing the actual earnings growth achieved by the company against the pre-determined target set for the relevant period.
The maximum award will be made where the target has been met or exceeded.
If the earnings growth achieved by the company is less than the target, then the provisional award will be reduced on a straight line basis, such that where the earnings growth is less than 66.67% of the target in respect of awards made in 2003 and 2004, no provisional award will be made.
When the provisional award has been calculated, the earnings growth achieved by the company is then compared with the average earnings growth achieved by the constituent companies included in the FTSE All Share Index and the Speciality and Other Financials Index.
If the earnings growth achieved by the company is less than that achieved by the constituent companies of either index, the provisional award is reduced by 1% for every 4% by which the earnings growth of the company falls below that of the constituent companies in either index.
The provisional award may be reduced by a maximum of 25% as a result of this comparison.
Equally, if the earnings growth achieved by the company exceeds that achieved by the constituent companies of either index, then the provisional award is increased by 1% for every 4% by which the earnings growth of the company exceeds that of either index, subject to the original notional award not being exceeded.
The Restricted Share Scheme operated in conjunction with the Trust in the same way as the LTIP.
Sharesave Scheme This scheme was approved in 2003 and enables all employees, including executive directors, with more than 18 months service at the date of invitation, to enter into a SAYE savings plan.
At the end of five years, participants can exercise an option to acquire shares in the company at a xed price determined at the start of the savings contract in accordance with the scheme rules.
The exercise of options under this scheme is not subject to any performance conditions, in accordance with HM Revenue & Customs HMRC rules.
The timing of invitations under this scheme is determined by the Board acting upon the recommendation of the Committee.
As at 31 December 2005 options to subscribe for 2,079,378 ordinary shares remained exercisable under the Sharesave Scheme.
Share Incentive Plan The Share Incentive Plan was introduced in 2003.
It is open to all eligible UK employees, including executive directors, and is an HMRC approved all-employee share plan.
Each year a sum of money is set aside as determined by the Board acting upon the recommendation of the Committee.
The amounts attributable to eligible employees are determined by a formula linked to their salaries.
The maximum award to any one employee during a year is 3,000.
Cattles ra2005 p16-36 29 3 06 4:01 pm Page 30 30 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration Executive Share Option Schemes Executive directors and senior executives have not participated in the Executive Share Option Schemes since being invited to participate in the LTIP and Restricted Share Scheme referred to above.
No executive director has options outstanding or unexercised under any of the Executive Share Option Schemes.
Grants of options to senior executives of the group have been made by the Committee under two schemes.
These are the Cattles Executive Share Option Scheme 1994 the 1994 Scheme, an Inland Revenue approved scheme, and the Cattles Executive Share Option Scheme 1996 the 1996 Scheme, which have both now expired.
The exercise of options under both schemes is dependent upon the achievement of EPS-based performance criteria.
As at 31 December 2005 options to subscribe for 232,050 and 142,350 ordinary shares remained exercisable under the 1994 Scheme and the 1996 Scheme respectively.
Shareholder approval was obtained at the annual general meeting in May 2005 for the establishment of the Cattles Executive Share Option Scheme 2005 the 2005 Scheme, to replace the 1994 Scheme and the 1996 Scheme.
The maximum award level under the 2005 Scheme will be 100% of salary, although it is likely that awards will be made at lower levels.
Options will be subject to EPS growth targets over a single three year period.
The executive directors and senior managers who participate in the LTIP will not be granted options under the 2005 Scheme, save where exceptional circumstances exist such as senior recruitment which result in the Committee considering it appropriate to grant both options under the 2005 Scheme and the LTIP, in which case the performance conditions set will take full account of market and best practice.
As at 31 December 2005 no options had been granted under the 2005 Scheme.
International Financial Reporting Standards The Committee was mindful of the effect of the transition to International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS on the EPS-based performance conditions used in the annual bonus, the LTIP, the Restricted Share Scheme and the Executive Share Option Schemes.
At the request of the Committee the companys auditors have reviewed the conversion of the EPS growth targets from UK GAAP to IFRS.
Pension and Life Assurance Arrangements S P Mahon, J J Corr and I S Cummine have individual personal pension plans into which the company contributed 20% of basic salary up to 31 December 2005.
Following a review of the executive directors pension arrangements in December 2005 based on research undertaken by NBSC relating to market practice in connection with pension provision, since 1 January 2006 the company contributes 25% of S P Mahons basic salary into his personal pension scheme, with contributions remaining at 20% of basic salary for J J Corr and I S Cummine.
M W G Collins is a member of the Cattles Staff Pension Fund and is subject to the statutory pension cap.
He therefore receives payments representing 20% of the difference between his basic salary and that cap for contribution to additional pension schemes.
No other payments to directors are pensionable.
Cattles Staff Pension Fund is a funded, HMRC approved, final salary occupational pension scheme with a contribution rate of 5% of pensionable salary from the employee.
Its main features, which apply to all members on the same terms, are: i pension is payable at normal pension age of 65 at 1 60th of final pensionable salary for each year of pensionable service up to a maximum of 40 60ths ii death in service life assurance cover is provided at four times pensionable salary iii pension is payable in the event of early retirement due to ill health and to spouse on death of member.
The directors are provided with death in service life assurance cover of four times basic salary.
The Committee is aware of the impending changes to pensions legislation and will keep under review the companys pension provision in light of this and market practice generally.
Cattles ra2005 p16-36 29 3 06 4:01 pm Page 31 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 31 Performance Graph of Total Shareholder Return Five Years to 31 December 2005 In the opinion of the directors, the FTSE 250 index is the most appropriate index against which the total shareholder return of Cattles plc should be measured because it is an index containing similar sized companies to Cattles plc.
The graph shows the value of 100 invested in Cattles plc on 31 December 2000 compared with the value of 100 invested in the FTSE 250 index.
The result is that Cattles plc has outperformed the FTSE 250 index, on that basis, over the following five years: 180 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 31 Dec 2000 31 Dec 2001 31 Dec 2002 31 Dec 2003 31 Dec 2004 31 Dec 2005 Cattles FTSE 250 Service Contracts It is the companys policy that executive directors service contracts should be rolling contracts requiring a notice period of one year to be given by the company and six months to be given by each director.
Each of the executive directors entered into service contracts, including these terms, on the date of their appointment to the Board.
In order to reect changes in other terms agreed since the original service contracts were entered into and to incorporate changes in employment legislation, the executive directors entered into new service contracts on 5 March 2003.
The company has the right to terminate a directors employment by paying to the director the remuneration which he would have been entitled to receive from the company in respect of the relevant period of notice.
If a director ceases to be employed, for any reason, by the company before the end of the financial year, any bonus payment will be at the sole discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
It is the Committees policy that, when determining the amount of any compensation paid to a departing director, the Committee will take into account the directors obligation to mitigate his loss, to the extent it is possible to do so under the terms of the relevant contract.
Total Shareholder Return 31 December 2000 Cattles ra2005 p16-36 29 3 06 4:01 pm Page 32 32 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration Non-executive Directors Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial period of three years, although either the company or the director may terminate the appointment by giving six months written notice.
They are subject to re-election at an annual general meeting at least every three years in common with all directors.
They do not have service contracts and may not participate in any bonus scheme, share scheme, pension scheme, car scheme or healthcare scheme operated by the company.
The dates of their current letters of appointment are: B Cottingham 30 June 1999: D A Haxby 22 June 1999: N N Broadhurst 23 March 2001: F Dee 30 June 2004: A J McWalter 6 September 2005: and M A Young 1 February 2006.
In 2005 the Chairman, B Cottingham, received a fee of 150,000 which was determined by the Committee on the same basis as applied to the determination of the basic salaries of the executive directors.
In 2005 the basic non-executive directors fee calculated by reference to practice adopted in the market generally and taking account of the time commitment and the responsibilities of the non-executive directors was 40,000, with D A Haxby receiving an extra 10,000 fee for his services as Senior Independent Director and chairman of the Remuneration Committee and N N Broadhurst receiving an extra 10,000 fee for his services as chairman of the Audit Committee.
Reasonable expenses that they may incur in the furtherance of their duties are repaid by the company.
Audited Information Aggregate Directors Remuneration The following table sets out the basic salary, annual bonus and benets in kind for each of the executive directors and the fees of the non-executive directors in respect of the year ended 31 December 2005 together with comparative gures for the preceding year.

In respect of those shares notionally awarded on 1 January 2003, the EPS growth achieved by the company during the three years ended 31 December 2005 exceeded the pre-determined target and the average EPS growth achieved by the constituent companies in the Speciality and other Financials Index but was less than the average EPS growth achieved by the constituent companies in the FTSE All Share Index and as a result 95% of the shares notionally awarded on 1 January 2003 will vest in the directors and executives on 6 April 2006.
The difference between the numbers of shares notionally held by other executives on 1 January 2005 and the numbers of shares which vested in April 2005 and in which the other executives were potentially interested at 31 December 2005 was the result of one of the other executives ceasing to participate in the RSS following the sale of Cattles Commercial Finance Limited by the company.
The performance criteria attaching to the RSS are set out in the fifth to seventh paragraphs of the Restricted Share Scheme section of this report on page 29.
The performance criteria attaching to the LTIP are set out in the fourth to seventh paragraphs of the LTIP section of this report on page 28.
As at 1 January 2005 the employee benefit trust owned 1,289,065 shares.
On 6 April 2005 the employee benefit trust transferred 358,077 shares on the vesting of awards under the scheme.
On 19 October 2005 the employee benefit trust acquired 501,965 shares at a price of 275p.
As at 31 December 2005 the employee benefit trust owned 1,432,953 shares.

The accrued pension entitlement shown in respect of M W G Collins is the amount that would be paid each year to the director in the form of a pension on retirement at age 65 in the event of him having left service at the end of the year.
The accrued pension entitlement includes, where relevant, entitlements earned as an employee, prior to becoming a director, as well as those earned for qualifying services after becoming a director.
The increase in the accrued pension entitlement is the difference between the accrued benefit at the year end and that at the previous year end.
Transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The transfer values of the additional accrued benets and of the accrued pension entitlement in respect of qualifying services represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of the directors pension benets that he earned in respect of qualifying services.
They do not represent sums payable to the director and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The transfer value of the additional accrued benets earned in the year less directors contribution is the transfer value of the additional accrued benets in respect of qualifying services earned in the year after deducting the directors personal contribution to the scheme during the year.
The increase in the transfer value less directors contribution is the increase in the transfer value of the accrued benets in respect of qualifying services during the year after deducting the directors personal contributions to the scheme.
