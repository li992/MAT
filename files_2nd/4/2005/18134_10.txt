THE WORK OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The Board has appointed a Remuneration Committee that comprises James Dean Chairman and Keith Harris who are both considered to be independent Non-Executive Directors.
The remit of the Committee is to consider and recommend to the Board: a.
The remuneration of the Executive Directors, including any performance related awards b.
The administration of the Companys share option schemes The Committee has maintained the same membership throughout the year, and has held two formal meetings during the period.
In addition, the members of the Committee have had informal contact as necessary throughout the year.
The Committee received advice from the Executive Chairman, Sten Mortstedt.
The Committee is able to obtain independent professional advice where necessary, at the Companys expense.
REMUNERATION POLICY The Companys policy on remuneration is to set overall remuneration packages at a level sufficient to attract, retain and incentivise high calibre staff with a view to enhancing long-term shareholder value.
Executive Directors Consistent with this policy, emoluments awarded to Executive Directors are intended to be competitive and comprise a mix of both performance and non-performance related remuneration and include discretionary and non-discretionary awards.
This is designed to incentivise Directors and to align their interests with those of shareholders, whilst adhering to the goals of Corporate Governance.
The Remuneration Committee conducts an annual analysis of the remuneration and emoluments of the Directors against a group of appropriate quoted real estate companies.
In all cases, this analysis showed that, whilst the performance of CLS was in the median quartile of the review group, the remuneration of the Directors was in the third quartile for salary and other discretionary awards.
CLS does not operate any long term incentive plans.
The Board does not anticipate any significant change to its remuneration policy in the year ending 31 December 2006.
Non-Executive Directors The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is reviewed and determined by the Board, having received the recommendations of the Executive Directors.
Their remuneration consists of fees for their services to the Board and any additional services such as chairing Board Committees.
Basic salaries The basic salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed annually as at 1 January.
The annual review takes account of similar positions in a range of comparable companies as indicated above.
Performance-Related Remuneration The performance-related element, if any, of each Executive Directors remuneration is determined after taking into account the performance of the individual and the performance of the Company, together with the emoluments of the individual, compared to those in the comparator group mentioned above.
Sten Mortstedt does not receive a performance-related element in respect of his remuneration as the Remuneration Committee considers that the size of his shareholding in the Company gives an adequate link to performance.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors does not include a performance-related element.
For the year ended 31 December 2005, the apportionment of remuneration and other benefits between discretionary performancerelated and non-performance related elements was as follows: PerformanceNon performanceDirector related related Sten Mortstedt nil 100% Per Sjberg 44% 56% Dan Bverstam 57% 43% Steven Board 54% 46% Tom Thomson 50% 50% James Dean nil 100% Keith Harris nil 100% Thomas Lundqvist nil 100% Bengt Mrtstedt nil 100% 55 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT for the year ended 31 December 2005 3.

SHARE OPTIONS AUDITED During the year, shareholders approved a new Company Share Option Plan CSOP to replace the 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme.
The CSOP was approved by the Inland Revenue in December 2005.
The Board has delegated to the Remuneration Committee the authority to grant options under the Companys share option schemes, which are the above mentioned CSOP and the Companys Unapproved Share Option Scheme.
Share options have normally been awarded to Executive Directors on the commencement of employment.
Accordingly Per Sjberg was granted options at the time of the announcement of his impending appointment as Chief Executive Officer, with further options granted upon receipt of the Inland Revenues approval of the CSOP.
There is no policy to provide options to Directors on an annual basis.
It is policy not to provide share options to Non-Executive Directors.
The exercise of share options granted under the Schemes is conditional upon the satisfaction of performance criteria, namely the growth in the net assets of the Group being at least equivalent to the growth of the All Properties Capital Growth Index maintained by Investment Property Databank Limited.
Details of options held by Directors are set out below.
No other Directors were granted options over the shares of the Company or other Group entities.
None of the terms or conditions of the share options were varied during the year.
No Director exercised options during the year and therefore no directors made gains.
The highest, lowest and average mid-market share price in the year are detailed under Share Capital on page 17.
