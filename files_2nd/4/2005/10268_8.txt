23 MILLENNIUM & COPTHORNE HOTELS plc DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT PERFORMANCE GRAPH The graph below illustrates the performance of the Company and a broad equity market index over the past five years.
As the Company is a constituent of the FTSE All Share Leisure and Hotels Index, the directors consider that index to be the most appropriate broad equity market index against which the Companys performance should be compared.
Performance is measured by Total Shareholder Return share price growth plus dividends reinvested.
In future, the Companys Total Shareholder Return will be measured against the new FTSE All Share Travel and Leisure Index, of which the Company is a constituent from 1 January 2006.

AUDITED INFORMATION Share Options i Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Executive Share Option Scheme No further options have been granted under the Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Executive Share Option Scheme the 1996 Scheme.
Options outstanding under the 1996 Scheme may be exercised if the Companys earnings per share increases over a three year period by the Retail Price Index plus 6%.
24 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2005 ii Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme The Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme the 2003 Scheme provides for the grant of both approved and unapproved options.
Under the 2003 Scheme options over shares worth up to two times base salary may be granted each year although, in exceptional circumstances, such as in a recruitment situation, this limit is four times base salary.
The size of actual option awards will be determined by the committee, which will take into account a number of factors, including the financial performance of the Group and the successful attainment of speci ed objectives.
The exercise of options granted under the 2003 Scheme is subject to the achievement of stretching performance targets.
Earnings per share EPS targets have been chosen as the committee believes that participants in the 2003 Scheme should be incentivised to deliver signi cant earnings growth which, in turn, should return substantial shareholder value.
The performance condition applying to the exercise of options granted in 2003 require the Groups EPS to grow, in real terms, from a notional base gure of 17.8p, over a period of at least three consecutive financial years after grant measured from a xed base.
To the extent that the performance condition is not satis ed by the fifth anniversary of grant, the options will lapse.
Following consultation with major shareholders in early 2004, it was agreed that for options granted in 2004 and subsequent years, the notional base EPS gure will be 15p and that options granted from 2004 onwards will not be subject to re-testing and to the extent that performance conditions are not satis ed by the third anniversary of grant the options will lapse.
The EPS base gure used for options granted in 2005 was the Groups UK GAAP pre-exceptional EPS gure for 2004 of 15.3p.
Subject to the rules of the 2003 Scheme, options will become exercisable as follows: EPS growth target Proportion of option exercisable EPS growth of less than an average of RPI plus 3% per annum 0% EPS growth of an average of RPI plus 3% per annum 25% EPS growth of an average of RPI plus 3% per annum to 10% per annum 25% - 100% pro-rated EPS growth of an average of RPI plus 10% per annum or more 100% In determining the extent to which if at all the EPS targets are achieved, the committee believes that the most appropriate approach is for the calculations to be undertaken internally and then veri ed by an independent third party.
To account for the changes introduced by IFRS, the committee will arrange for EPS reported under IFRS to be converted to UK GAAP using the same methods adopted throughout these accounts, such calculations then being veri ed by an independent third party.
iii Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Sharesave Scheme The Company also operates the Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Sharesave Scheme the Sharesave Scheme which is an Inland Revenue approved scheme and under which the UK-based executive directors and Group employees are eligible to participate.
Early in 2006, the Board approved, in principle, the introduction of a new Millennium & Copthorne Hotels 2006 Sharesave Plan.
The introduction of the new Plan is conditional upon the passing of an appropriate resolution by shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Details of the Plan are shown in a separate shareholders circular.
All grants of share options conform to institutional dilution guidelines.
2 Performance conditions attaching to these options are those speci ed for the 2003 Scheme as detailed on page 25.
All of the options were granted for nil consideration.
The market price of ordinary shares at 31 December 2005 was 400p and the range during the year was 339.5p to 404p.
Aggregate gains made by directors on exercise of share options in 2005 were 40,223 2004: 518,087.
PENSIONS Mr Tony Potter participates in a contributory pension plan designed to provide up to two-thirds of his final salary subject to Inland Revenue limits at age 65 plus a spouses death in retirement pension of two-thirds of the pension payable at date of death.
In addition, death-in-service bene ts are provided comprising a lump sum bene t of four times salary at date of death.
The Companys pension contribution for the scheme is set at 20.6% of salary.
As Mr Potter entered service after 31 May 1989 the bene ts provided for him by the Companys pension scheme are restricted by the operation of the earnings cap.
Accordingly, a salary supplement of 20.6% of salary above the earnings cap was paid during the year.
No pension is provided for Mr Wong Hong Ren.
The committee has reviewed its pension provisions in anticipation of the introduction of the Pensions Act 2004 the Act in April 2006.
After April 2006, the UK fide ned bene t scheme will retain an earnings cap which will be increased each year in line with the retail price index.
For earnings in excess of the schemes cap, Mr Potter will either continue to receive a salary supplement or the Company will make equivalent contributions on his behalf into the Groups UK fide ned contribution pension plan or a personal pension arrangement.
