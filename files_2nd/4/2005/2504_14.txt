38 BRITISH ENERGY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2005 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2005 In preparing this Report the Remuneration Committee the Committee has given due consideration to the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and consider that they have complied with these regulations.
TERMS OF REFERENCE AND COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP The Committee is responsible to the Board for determining the pay, benefits and employment conditions of the Executive Directors and the members of the Executive Committee.
The Committee also reviews the pay and benefits of other senior staff to ensure reasonable consistency.
The Committee's Terms of Reference comply with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance and may be reviewed on the Company's website.
Copies may also be obtained from the Company Secretary.
The Committee is made up of the Non-Executive Directors identified on pages 30 and 31.
During the year other Non-Executive Directors have attended some meetings.
Details of attendance are set out on page 35.
The Committee is chaired by Clare Spottiswoode, Deputy Chairman of the Board.
ADVISERS TO THE COMMITTEE Mike Alexander, the Chief Executive until 20 March 2005, attended meetings throughout the year to give advice as required by the Committee.
In accordance with good practice, he was not present when matters affecting his own terms and conditions were being discussed.
It is the intention of the Committee that the Chief Executive will continue to attend.
Sally Smedley, the Group's Human Resources and Communications Director, is the Secretary to the Committee.
The Committee appointed Watson Wyatt LLP to give advice on general remuneration matters including market data comparison and the design of the LT plan.
Until November 2004, Watson Wyatt LLP also provided actuarial and investment advice in respect of the Company's pension schemes.
During the year the Committee also received legal advice from Clifford Chance LLP.
New Bridge Street Consultants gave advice throughout the year on equity incentive plans including the all-employee Share Incentive Plan.
They have also provided advice to the Company on implementation of these plans.
REMUNERATION POLICY The Group's remuneration policy aims to attract and retain management with the appropriate professional, managerial and operational expertise necessary to achieve the Group's objectives.
It is the Committee's aim to ensure that the total package including benefits is competitive not just in UK terms but can also attract specialist skills in the international nuclear market.
The Committee's policy is that base salaries are positioned broadly around the market median with an incentive opportunity which will reflect the Company's business strategy and the challenges it faces.
In particular, it is the Committee's policy that:- A significant proportion of the Executive Directors pay should be variable and linked to the performance of the Company.
Taking account of the external market, the movements in base pay of Directors and Executive Committee members should be broadly in line with the pay increases awarded to other staff.
In determining the link between base and variable pay, the Company should be mindful of safety and environmental issues.
There should be a strong and clear link between reward and performance against agreed stretch targets.
The Committee has considered the issue of suitable long-term incentives being in place for Executive Directors and senior staff.
It is disappointed that it was not possible to implement a suitable arrangement for this year.
The Committee has decided that it is not appropriate to introduce a traditional long-term plan at this stage of the Companys development.
It proposes to put in place an annual plan which pays out over three years.
ELEMENTS OF REMUNERATION In determining the remuneration package of each individual Executive Director, the Committee considers five main elements each of which is benchmarked against the external market.
The balance of elements is taken into account recognising the commercial and operational needs of the businesses and the policies outlined above.
The benchmarking process draws comparisons across a wide range of organisations including utility companies.
This year the benchmarking process included comparisons with other companies undergoing similar financial restructuring.
Benchmarking also involves consultation with external professional advisers and comparison with commercially available remuneration surveys.
BASE PAY Base pay and benefits in kind are reviewed annually.
The Committee aims to maintain individual salaries at or about the market median taking into account experience, level of responsibility and individual performance.
The base pay of Executive Directors and senior staff was last reviewed as at 1 July 2004 with the exception of Mike Alexander's salary which was reviewed on 1 April 2004.
39 BRITISH ENERGY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2005 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2005 Recognising that last year exceptional effort, commitment and determination was required both to meet the engineering challenges facing our power stations and to see Restructuring through to a final conclusion, the Remuneration Committee has decided to make a one-off discretionary payment to members of the Executive Committee equal to 50% of base salary.
This amount is shown under the heading Bonus in the Emoluments tables on pages 42 and 43.
Discretionary payments were also made to a number of other staff throughout the Company.
ANNUAL PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN The Prospectus included details of an Interim Bonus Plan intended to reward participants for performance over the financial year ended 31 March 2005.
This is a deferred bonus granted to members of the Executive Committee either wholly in shares in the case of Executive Directors or mainly in shares and partly in cash in the case of other Executive Committee members.
The Prospectus also indicated that the targets set and the results achieved would be disclosed in the Remuneration Committee report.
The table below shows the targets, their relative weighting, and the outturn.
The maximum level of award was 150% of salary except for Roy Anderson who was hired from the US and is entitled to 1.67 times that figure.
INTERIM PLAN AWARD Outcome as a multiple Target Weighting Target Min Max Unit Outturn of salary Adjusted EBITDA 30.00 180 201 260 m 96 0.00 Nuclear output 25.00 62.5 63.0 66.0 TWh 59.8 0.00 Non-outage defect backlog 10.00 7200 6800 4900 Instances 3722 0.15 Trading collateral 5.00 310.0 280.0 260.0 m 380 0.00 Free cash flow 10.00 87 114 174 m 31 0.00 Accident frequency rate 6.67 0.70 0.64 0.59 Rate 0.43 0.10 Environmental incidents 6.67 15 13 11 Instances 15 0.05 Unplanned automatic trip rate 6.67 1.09 0.98 0.78 Rate 1.02 0.08 Adjusted for target measurement purposes.
This includes data relating to contractors and is calculated on a different basis to the information on page 8.
On the basis of the outturn indicated above, the Executive Committee members will each receive 38.2% of salary, 63.6% in the case of Roy Anderson.
One-third of the award in shares is payable immediately with a further third released next year and the final third the year after.
The total value of the award is included under the heading Bonus in the Emoluments tables on pages 42 and 43.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES AND OTHER SHARE OPTION PLANS The Company has adopted a number of share plans which were outlined in the Prospectus.
No shares or options were granted under any of the plans during 2004 05.
Share options were granted in previous years by the former British Energy plc.
Legal advice has been obtained to the effect that the changes in the corporate structure of the Group as a result of the Restructuring did not trigger the early exercise provisions under these options.
The Committee decided not to allow holders of options in British Energy plc to roll them over into options over shares in the Company.
The options granted by British Energy plc are still capable of exercise, but immediately on exercise the shares will be converted into shares in the Company in the ratio of 50:1.
Accordingly, the effective exercise price of the options is significantly higher than the current share price and it is unlikely that the options will be exercised.
The Committee intends to implement the all-employee Share Incentive Plan during the year 2005 06 and Executive Directors are entitled to participate.
In addition, the Executive Committee have been invited to participate in the LT plan as set out in the Prospectus.
Other senior staff have been invited to participate in the LT plan with lower salary multiples.
For 2005 06, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the output target published in the Prospectus and exercised its discretion in accordance with the rules of the LT plan to modify the output targets.
For 2005 06, the revised targets are a Group Target of 64 TWh and an Adjusted Group Target of 62 TWh.
A number of improvements to the LT plan are proposed and these are described in the documents sent to shareholders with this Report.
Executive Directors are entitled to participate in the all-employee Sharesave Scheme for which there are no performance conditions.
40 BRITISH ENERGY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2005 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2005 RETIREMENT BENEFIT The retirement benefits offered to Executive Directors are individually tailored as described below.
Roy Anderson and Stephen Billingham are members of the British Energy Generation Group BEGG of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme.
Mike Alexander and David Gilchrist were also members of BEGG when they were Directors.
Martin Gatto was not a member of any company pension scheme nor was any payment made to him in lieu of any pension arrangement.
No elements of remuneration other than base pay are pensionable.
The following Directors have accrued entitlements under the defined benefits scheme as follows: PENSIONS TABLE Increase Increase in Transfer in transfer Accrued accrued value of Accrued value less pension pension Increase in increase in pension Transfer value of pension contributions at excluding accrued accrued at at 31 March made by Age 31 03 2004 inflation pension benefit 31 03 2005 2004 2005 directors M Alexander 56 10,833 9,664 10,000 135,845 20,883 107,000 242,845 114,595 R Anderson 57 n a 4,107 4,107 47,573 4,107 0 47,573 36,116 S Billingham 47 n a 3,155 3,155 23,341 3,155 0 23,341 14,539 D Gilchrist 51 56,389 4,505 6,253 178,881 62,642 542,000 720,881 168,776 The information in the table above has been subject to audit as required by the Companies Act 1985.
The accrued entitlements shown are those which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year.
The transfer value does not represent a sum due or paid to the individual and cannot meaningfully be added to the annual remuneration.
The accrual rate of Roy Anderson and Stephen Billingham is 1 30th per annum subject to total pension from all sources not exceeding two-thirds of final salary.
Roy Anderson and Stephen Billingham are required to make contributions of 5% of base salary as was Mike Alexander while he was a Director.
In respect of earnings above the pensions cap 102,000 this is achieved by sacrificing salary equivalent to the contribution.
The salaries shown in the Emoluments tables on pages 42 and 43 are net of the salary sacrifice.
OTHER BENEFITS Other benefits are available to Executive Directors.
These differ by individual but will comprise some or all of the following:- A company car or allowance in lieu and fuel.
Medical and additional life insurance.
Reimbursement of telephone rental and mobile phone.
Eligibility to participate in the all-employee Sharesave Scheme and Share Incentive Plan.
SERVICE CONTRACTS The Committees policy is to set notice or contract periods for Executive Directors at one year or less.
Where it is necessary to offer longer notice or contract periods to new Executive Directors who are externally recruited, it is the Committees policy to reduce these as soon as possible after the initial period has expired.
All Executive Directors have a 12-month rolling contract save for Bill Coley whose contract terms are yet to be finalised.
EXTERNAL NON-EXECUTIVE APPOINTMENTS The Company permits Executive Directors to accept external non-executive directorships provided they do not cause a conflict or inhibit the Directors ability to work for the Company.
It is recognised that these appointments increase the Directors commercial knowledge and business experience to the general benefit of the Company.
Each such appointment including the details of emoluments is subject to Board approval.
The Board has determined that any compensation receivable in respect of these appointments is paid directly to and retained by the Executive Director.
41 BRITISH ENERGY GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2005 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 31 MARCH 2005 TERMINATION PROVISION The Company's policy is that service contracts should not have express termination provisions other than the contractual notice periods outlined above.
David Gilchrist resigned from the Board on 4 August 2004 and his employment terminated on 4 November 2004.
The payment to him disclosed under the heading Compensation for loss of office in the Emoluments table on page 43 represents the balance of his contractual notice plus a payment in respect of bonus entitlement for 2004 05 and for loss of bonus entitlement for a proportion of 2005 06.
Mike Alexander resigned from the Board on 20 March 2005.
At the date of this Report no compensation for loss of office had been agreed.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board without the participation of the Director concerned.
Appointed for three-year terms, the Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts, they are not eligible for participation in any of the Companys Share Schemes and they do not receive any pension provision from the Company.

The levels of fees paid during the year are given in the Emoluments tables on pages 42 and 43.
