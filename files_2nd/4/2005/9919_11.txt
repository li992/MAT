McCarthy & Stone plc - Annual Report & Accounts Directors Remuneration Report This report is not subject to audit, with the exception of the sections dealing with Remuneration by Director, Directors Interests in Share Options and Directors Interests in Deferred Bonus Plan Shares.
Remuneration Policy The remuneration of the Executive Directors is determined by the Remuneration Committee with the objective of ensuring that the Group attracts, motivates and retains high quality management.
The remuneration package is intended to include a significant proportion of performance-related remuneration, set against challenging objectives.
During the year the Remuneration Committee was composed of the Non-Executive Directors, J Stevenson Chairman, Sir George Young and S E K Purser.
Independent professional advice on remuneration has been sought during the financial year from Monks Partnership a part of  LLP in respect of Executive Directors remuneration packages.
The Group Finance Director, M W J Thorne, provided information to the Remuneration Committee to enable it to review Executive Directors' salary and incentive packages and the Committee also sought the views of the Chairman & Chief Executive, K Lovelock, on such matters.
During the year the Committee received assistance from the Company Secretary, T L Green.
Remuneration of the Directors includes annual salary, bonuses, benefits, personal pension plans and participation in short and long-term incentive arrangements.
The remuneration of each Director is determined to reflect the duties and responsibilities of his role and his performance in that role.
The Remuneration Committees objective is to pay salaries at the median compared to companies in the sector of comparable size and complexity of operation and to provide overall packages at the upper quartile level, subject to the achievement of challenging performance targets.
The Committee seeks specific independent advice on remuneration levels, trends in executive remuneration packages and addresses corporate governance and best practice in making its determinations.
The Executive Directors who served during the year have service contracts with the Service Contracts Company terminable on the length of notice indicated below:- Executive Director Date of Contract Length of Notice K Lovelock 23.12.93 2 years H P S Phillips 07.08.95 1 year M W J Thorne 27.05.93 2 years M J Jennings 10.03.98 1 year G N Day 05.11.03 1 year Upon his appointment to the Board on 1 September 2005, D A Field had the benefit of a rolling service contract with the Company terminable on 1 years notice dated 1 December 1998 The Remuneration Committee is mindful of the fact that the termination period on some of the Directors service contracts is greater than one year.
Those service contract terms are historic and the Remuneration Committee has discussed this point with the Directors concerned but does not consider it appropriate to change at this time.
As indicated above on page 33 no service contract terminable upon notice of more than one year has been entered into for many years and the intention of the Committee is to approve future service contracts terminable upon notice of no more than one year, save in exceptional circumstances.
The above Service Contracts do not contain any special provision for payment of compensation on early termination, save in respect of K Lovelock and M W J Thorne.
By virtue of a Supplemental Agreement entered into on 22 December 1995, in the event of a takeover K Lovelock and M W J Thorne may, within six months of such event, elect to terminate the Service Contract on three months notice and be paid a termination payment of up to twice the value of annual basic salary and pension contributions.
The purpose of this provision was to ensure that the Directors concerned were not disincentivised should such an event occur.

The Company believes that share ownership by Executive Directors and senior executives can Share Option Schemes strengthen the link between their personal interests and those of the shareholders.
"The Company introduced a Company Share Option Plan the ""Share Option Plan"" at its Extraordinary General Meeting held on 5 October 2000."
This plan is designed to reward Directors and other senior executives for delivering long term returns to shareholders.
The Share Option Plan contains an Inland Revenue approved and an unapproved part.
Details of the interest of the Directors in options over the Company's Ordinary Shares are set out later in the report.
Options are granted at prevailing market prices at the time of grant.
Options granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme 1996 consisting of grants made on or after 27 November 1996 are subject to a performance condition.
These options only become exercisable if the Company's share price growth over a three year period exceeds the increase in the Retail Price Index by at least 6% over that period.
The Share Option Plan introduced on 5 October 2000 replaced the Executive Share Option Scheme 1996 and allowed options to be granted up to a maximum of three times salary each year.
The Remuneration Committee has considered past performance in deciding the level of grant on each occasion.
The approved part of the Share Option Plan has been used to allocate up to an aggregate of 30,000 of options to each executive, with the associated potential tax benefits.
All grants in excess of this Inland Revenue limit have been made under the unapproved part.
For options granted under the Share Option Plan stretching performance targets of earnings per share growth over a three year period to exceed the increase in the Retail Prices Index by a minimum percentage per annum have been imposed by the Committee as a condition of exercise, as follows:- Date of Grant Minimum Percentage p. a. over RPI November 2000 10% November 2001 8% December 2002 8% November 2003 8% November 2004 6% Details of options granted are set out in the table on page 39.
The Remuneration Committee considers that the performance conditions are appropriate both because of the Companys focus for management of the business on growth in earnings per share and because of the transparency and ascertainability of the measure.
The mid price of the ordinary shares at 1 September 2004 and 31 August 2005 was 568p and 565p respectively and the range during the year was 515p to 702p.

Details of both Plans are set out in the Appendices to the Notice of Meeting.
Performance Related The Remuneration Committee believes that it is important that Directors should focus both on short-term performance and the impact that short-term actions will have on longer term Bonuses and McCarthy & outcomes.
The annual bonus plan and the Deferred Plan are therefore linked.
"The terms of Stone plc Deferred Bonus the Deferred Plan were approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on Plan the ""Deferred Plan"" 21 December 2001."
Annual bonuses are payable on achievement of specific targets set by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of each year in relation to Group profit before tax.
On achievement of the prescribed performance target the bonus will amount to 30% of a Directors salary.
Above that target the bonus will increase on a percentage basis and is uncapped.
Achievement below a minimum target figure will result in no bonus becoming payable.
For the financial year ended 31st August 2005, the target figure at which bonus would amount to 30% of salary was set in November 2004 at pre-tax profit of 162m against a pre-tax profit figure for the year ended 31 August 2004 of 147.8m.
In respect of the financial year ended 31 August 2005 no bonus was payable under the Bonus Plan against the performance target mentioned above.
However, the Remuneration Committee considered that given the change in market conditions which had occurred since the target was set, the Companys performance in the year was commendable and awarded a discretionary bonus of 17% of salary, in line with the average percentage bonus awarded to those in the management level immediately below the Board.
The Directors' cash bonuses are awarded in conjunction with the Deferred Plan.
Under the Plan bonuses above 40% of salary are paid entirely in shares, which must be retained to qualify for additional shares, thereby aligning the interests of Directors and shareholders.
No such shares will be acquired under the Plan from the discretionary bonus referred to above.
"Shares acquired under the Deferred Plan Bonus Shares are held on behalf of participants, who are beneficially entitled to them, by the Trustee of the Company's Deferred Bonus Trust for a holding period the ""Holding Period"" being, the earlier of three years from the date of acquisition of Bonus Shares, the participant ceasing to be employed or a change in control of the Company."
The costs of acquiring the bonus shares are borne by the Company.
Depending on the duration of the Holding Period, participants will have the right to call for free shares in the Company.
If the Holding Period is between one and two years, participants will be able to call for one free share for every four Bonus Shares held.
If the Holding Period is between two and three years, participants will be able to call for one free share for every three Bonus Shares held.
If the Holding Period is three years, participants will be able to call for one free share for every two Bonus Shares held.
Any free shares so acquired by participants will be subject to payment by them of Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions on the value of such shares at the time of acquisition.
The Deferred Plan is part of the Company's policy of seeking to retain quality management, as well as encouraging share ownership by Executive Directors.
Directors will only benefit from the Plan to the extent that they have achieved the challenging performance targets determined annually by the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee will monitor retention of shares both during and after the Holding Period.
The Executive Directors are beneficially entitled to the Bonus Shares held by the Trust on their behalf.
