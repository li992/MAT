It is Group policy to hedge exposure to cash transactions in foreign currencies for a Sterling 23m Indian rupees 1,774m 2008 range of forward periods, but not to hedge exposure for the translation of reported profits.
In addition, currency assets are hedged by way of currency borrowings where practicable to protect total Euro borrowings, cash and cash equivalents equity.
The overall level of debt of the Group is not sufficient to allow the Group to fully hedge its Euro assets.
2005 As a consequence of this, the Group has entered into a series of cross currency interest rate swaps for Euro borrowings 972m hedging the net investment in foreign operations, which effectively create 1.3bn of Euro borrowings offset by 2004 0.9bn of Sterling deposits.
The net investment hedge for Euros at December 2005 was equivalent to 3.0bn.
Euro borrowings 2,873m At present, the Group effectively is a borrower of Euros.
Where debt has been issued in a currency other than Euros, cross currency interest rate swaps for hedging of the debt issuance back to Euros have Forward exchange contracts been entered into.
The Group also has a significant investment in India which is hedged by Indian Rupee currency swaps.
Contract Maturity The Group also has exposure to assets denominated in Russian Rouble as a result of the ownership of 50% 2005 of Baltic Beverages Holding BBH.
Modest levels of hedging have been undertaken in BBH.
Further hedging Sell US dollars 54m 2006 is kept under review but there is insufficient liquidity in the market to hedge all of the rouble asset base.

Credit risk Credit risk encompasses all forms of counterparty exposure.
Policy objectives in order of priority are security, liquidity and return.
Deposits and other counterparty exposures are only acceptable with financial institutions with an A1 short term rating or an A long term rating for exposures beyond one year or with wholly owned subsidiaries of such institutions approved as acceptable by the Treasury Committee.
The maximum risk with any counterparty or counterparty group is 50m on an S&N Group basis with the exception of AAA Money Market Funds where the maximum risk can be 150m.
The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of trade receivables and trade loans, however, given the spread of the Groups customers, credit risk is believed to be limited.
Where practical, security is taken on property owned by trade loan counterparties.
