Peter Hargreaves and Annual report and financial statements | Year ended 30 June 2010 30 BACK TO CONTENTS Directors Remuneration Report Outcome of review by Remuneration Committee The Committee reviewed the remuneration packages in the light of the Groups strong performance.
Full year profits were again ahead of the market analysts consensus, costs have been controlled, earnings per share have improved and dividends have increased.
Despite the ongoing economic uncertainty, once again these represent excellent results.

H 0 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 The Committee reviewed the overall remuneration of the executives.
Although profits have increased, the Committee agreed that given the current economic environment a more restrained approach, in particular to bonuses, was appropriate.
Therefore basic salaries of the Board executives were reviewed during the year with no increases taking effect.
Further it was agreed with effect from 1 July 2010 that the salary and benefits of Peter Hargreaves would be reduced from 406,000 to an amount of circa 60,000, and with effect from 1 March 2010 that the salary of Stephen Lansdown would be reduced from 275,000 to nil, until 26 August 2010 at which time he shall be paid fees of 30,000 p. a. for his position as non-executive director.
The salary of the new Chief Executive, Ian Gorham, was agreed at 450,000 from 2 September 2010, being the date of his appointment.
The Committee also agreed that Peter Hargreaves and Stephen Lansdown would not receive bonuses for the year 2009: 600,000 and 350,000 respectively and that Tracey Taylor should receive a bonus of 75,000 2009: 250,000.
The bonuses paid to executive directors of the Company and of the subsidiary companies averaged 0.54 times salary and varied between nil and 1.68 times salary 2009: average 1.88 times, varied between half and four times.
Looking forward, strong performance in future years is likely to generate more generous total rewards.
