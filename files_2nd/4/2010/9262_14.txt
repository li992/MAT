Chairman of the Remuneration Committee ComPany Business CoRPoRate finanCial oveRview Review goveRnanCe statements Lamprell plc Annual report and accounts 2010 43 executive remuneration policy and pay principles Our remuneration policy for Executive Directors gives consideration to remuneration policy and levels for the wider employee population and is designed to enable the recruitment, retention and motivation of Executive Directors and senior managers of the highest calibre.
Our remuneration policy aims to drive business performance and maximise shareholder value through offering remuneration packages to our senior management that are appropriately balanced between base salary and variable compensation and taking into account policy and practice in the UAE.
Our key remuneration principles are: base salaries should be competitive and bonus should reflect both collective financial performance and personal performance.
Personal performance will be determined based on stretching, quantitative and qualitative targets set individually at the beginning of each year: the Individual Performance Targets for the Executive Directors are recommended by the Company Chairman and approved by the Remuneration Committee.
Individual Performance Targets for the Vice Presidents are recommended by the Chief Executive Officer: maintaining the highest possible health and safety standards is of paramount importance to the Company and its business and is the collective responsibility of all Executive Directors, Vice Presidents and Employees.
Any fatality that takes place in a facility operated by the Company or any of its subsidiaries will be taken into account when considering whether to pay the whole or part of the Personal Performance Bonus: and performance shares are awarded in order to align the interests of senior staff and shareholders and to encourage the recipients to remain with the Company.
The Remuneration Committee has met five times during this financial year.
Items covered in the meetings included: Executive Director benchmarking: investor consultation: variable pay: consideration of the ABI Guidelines: review of PSP awards: and review and agreement of financial targets for the annual bonus plan.

The Committee considers all elements of the pay structure to be important in supporting the Companys remuneration policy.
ComPany Business CoRPoRate finanCial oveRview Review goveRnanCe statements Lamprell plc Annual report and accounts 2010 45 Pay mix In 2010, the remuneration mix for Lamprell Executive Directors, including long-term and short-term incentives LTI and STI respectively, was as follows: CEO Basic Salary Target STI Target LTI CFO 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Benchmarking The Committee aims to provide our Executive Directors with a remuneration package that is competitive to those offered to directors in similar positions in comparable companies and that takes into account internal company conditions.
As such, in 2010, the Committee conducted a review of the pay and benefits of senior management.
The findings of that review were taken into consideration and will be reflected, as appropriate, in the revised remuneration packages for 2011.
Mercer benchmarked Total Remuneration and all its components for our senior management against the remuneration levels offered to senior mangers in a peer group consisting of companies that were of an industry relevant to Lamprells operations: Hargreaves Services Limited Salamander Energy Plc Wellstream Holdings Plc Melrose Resources Plc Hunting Plc Energy XX1 Bermuda Limited Fortune Oil plc JKX Oil & Gas Plc Gulfsands Petroleum Plc Premier Oil Plc Emerald Energy Plc Venture Production Plc Afren Plc elements of remuneration Base salary Provide a market competitive base salary that reflects the role, skills, experience and contribution of the individual In 2009, after a review of the overall package, especially in the light of a highly volatile market in that year, the Remuneration Committee decided to adjust the CEO and CFO basic salaries to be competitive at the upper quartile of the market and limit bonus opportunities further detail below to bring the remuneration packages more in line with the Companys benchmarking peer group.
For 2011, following the 2010 review of base salaries For more information visit: www.
com Lamprell plc Annual report and accounts 2010 46 Directors Remuneration Report against a new comparator group, the Committee has decided to continue to position base salaries at upper quartile, largely to recognise the following: Lamprell being larger than the majority of peer group companies, positioning pay at upper quartile to reflect the size and performance of the Company: the results of the benchmarking exercises undertaken by Mercer in both 2009 and 2010 had indicated anomalies between the base salaries and bonus amounts paid by the Company, and that of its comparator group, with base salaries significantly lower and variable pay through bonus significantly higher than the comparator group: and the Committee considers that too high a level of variable pay i. e. pay which is at risk could lead to the loss of key Executive Directors in difficult economic circumstances when continuity is most important.
The table below shows the base salaries of each current Executive Director effective as at 1 April 2010, and those that will apply from 1 January 2011.
Base Base salary from salary from 1 January 1 January Name Position 2010 2011 % increase Nigel McCue Chief Executive Officer $785,662 $801,375 2% Scott Doak Chief Financial Officer $472,153 $472,153 0% 1 Chris Hand Chief Operating Officer n a $400,000 n a 1 Chris Hand was appointed to the Board of Directors with effect from 26 January 2011.
Annual bonus Focus and motivate Executive Directors to achieve annual performance targets Performance measures The Committee establishes performance measures and targets under the annual bonus plan for Executive Directors.
Performance measures used are designed to reward the delivery of key strategic priorities for the year.
In the 2010 plan year, payout of 60% of the bonus was based on financial targets, with the remaining 40% dependent on the achievement of personal objectives.
In setting financial targets, the Board focuses on key annual strategic objectives.
For 2010, financial metrics were based upon achievement of a net profit target, and the Committee determined that in order to achieve the maximum payout in respect of the portion of bonus dependent on the achievement of financial targets, such targets would be required to be exceeded by at least 20%.
In setting the personal objectives for the Executive Directors, the Board focuses on the Companys strategic plan and taking into account the Companys corporate values.
Personal objectives cover a variety of financial and operational targets that contribute to the achievement of goals in the strategic plan and in 2010 included, amongst other matters, the introduction of a new management system, and effective risk control.
Bonus opportunities In reviewing total remuneration arrangements, the Committee decided in 2009 to reduce the bonus opportunity for Executive Directors from a maximum of 200% of base salary to a maximum of 100% of base salary.
For 2010, there was no change to the annual maximum bonus opportunity for Executive Directors with bonus opportunities capped at a maximum of 100% of base salary.
The annual bonus plan is discretionary and the Committee reserves the right to make adjustments to payouts if it believes exceptional circumstances warrant doing so.
In particular, the Committee has an overriding discretion to consider, if deemed necessary, performance on environmental, social and governance issues when determining the annual bonus payments for the Executive Directors.
