There has been no 9 change to his shareholding since the year end.
Non-executive directors terms of appointment Term All non-executive directors have letters of appointment with the Company for an initial three-year term, terminable on three months notice by either party without liability for compensation.
Their dates of appointment are as follows: Original letter of Appointment Notice Name appointment date date period Richard Greenhalgh 05 Mar 2004 01 Jul 2004 3 months John Warren 19 Oct 2005 01 Jan 2006 3 months Bill Shannon 28 Feb 2006 03 Apr 2006 3 months Owen ODonnell 20 Aug 2008 11 Sep 2008 3 months Tim Scoble 17 May 2010 22 Apr 2010 3 months Mike Smith 17 May 2010 22 Apr 2010 3 months Remuneration Throughout the five year period from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2010, fees payable to non-executive directors were as follows: Base non-executive annual fee 38,000 Audit committee chair 8,500 Remuneration committee chair 7,500 Senior independent director 2,500 In December 2010, the chairman and executive directors reviewed the level of fees payable to the non-executive directors, in conjunction with advice from Towers Watson.

Having regard to all the circumstances, the committee thought it appropriate to increase the non-executives base annual fee by 2,000 to 40,000 with effect from 1 January 2011.
Therewere no increases made to additional committee chair and senior independent director fees.
Shareholdings Until 1 January 2009, independent non-executive directors were required to use 30% of their base net fees after tax to purchase ordinary shares in the Company at quarterly intervals, such shares to be retained throughout their tenure of service.
This requirement was relaxed with effect from 1 January 2009 but, nevertheless, all independent non-executive directors continue to make quarterly purchases of shares in this way and, with effect from 1 January 2011, Owen ODonnell is applying 40% of his base net fees after tax in this way.

The Rank Group Plc: Annual report and financial statements 2010 59 Directors report: Remuneration report continued Executive directors performance-related remuneration Short-term incentives 2010 annual cash bonus scheme Profitability remained the executive teams main focus during 2010 and 106.6% of target was achieved.

Target and maximum levels of annual bonus payment remain unchanged from last year.
NPS continues to be an important tool in assessing our effectiveness in meeting and exceeding customer expectations.
Therefore an element of the 2011 annual cash bonus opportunity is again being linked to achieving specific NPS targets.

The committee is of the view that targets should be robust, yet reasonably achievable.
Following a review by the committee of incentive arrangements for executives, at the Companys 2010 annual general meeting shareholders approved a new umbrella long-term incentive plan the 2010 LTIP to replace both the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan that expired in April 2010 the 2005 LTIP and the 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme pursuant to which no awards had been made since 2006 and which in any event was due to expire in 2012.
The Rank Group Plc: Annual report and financial statements 2010 60 All outstanding awards under the 2005 LTIP and the 2010 LTIP have absolute adjusted EPS as the primary measure with absolute adjusted EPS targets for both threshold and maximum vesting, pro-rated for performance at intermediate points between threshold and maximum.
The choice of absolute adjusted EPS by the committee as the primary measure reflects in part Ranks specialist sector and few publicly quoted direct competitors which make the selection of a relevant comparison problematic.
However, when determining whether or not an award should vest, the committee also takes into account total shareholder return TSR over the performance period against the FTSE-350.
The remuneration committee recognises that some shareholders have concerns over the use of absolute adjusted EPS and wish toensure that EPS provides a robust and transparent measure of executive performance which is well aligned with shareholder value creation.
The remuneration committee believes that it is important that measures continue to be relevant and motivational and is of the view that EPS is the most appropriate measure for Ranks long-term incentives at the present time.
The remuneration and audit committees will continue work to ensure the principles for fair treatment of exceptional items in the performance period are applied, the principle being that any adjustments make the measure no less stretching for the executives and are linked closely to the creation of shareholder value.
Targets for individual awards are set against a number of factors including analysts consensus forecasts for the Rank Group, rates of inflation, interest rates, the general economic environment and the expected impact of legislation.
The rules of the 2005 LTIP provide that the committee shall, as soon as possible after the expiry of the performance period, determine whether the awards should vest and if the committee so determines, the awards vest immediately upon such determination.
The rules of the 2010 LTIP provide that awards vest as soon as practicable following the third anniversary of the date of grant.

The grant dates were 22 April 2010, 10 May 2010 and 1 August 2010.
The executive directors interests in the 2005 LTIP and the 2010 LTIP are detailed on Table 3, page 65.
LTIP awards with a performance period ended on 31 December 2010 Following the year end, the committee considered whether the 2007 four-year and 2008 three-year awards should vest.

Whilst, on the basis of the adjusted EPS measure alone, 58% of the award was due to vest, the committee considered the Groups four-year TSR performance over the same period.
Given Ranks performance, relative to the FTSE-350, the committee was of the view that it was inappropriate for any part of the award to vest.
With regard to the three-year 2008 LTIP award, on the basis of the EPS measure, 100% of the award was eligible to vest and given the Groups significantly improved three-year TSR performance over the same period, relative to the FTSE-350, the committee was of the view that the award should vest in full.
On vesting, sufficient shares will be sold in order to meet the associated income tax and national insurance obligations and executives will be expected to retain the balance until they achieve and maintain their shareholding guideline for so long as they are employed by Rank in order to align their personal interests with those of Ranks shareholders.
The Rank Group Plc: Annual report and financial statements 2010 61 Directors report: Remuneration report continued LTIP awards made in 2010 Following approval by shareholders of the 2010 LTIP at the annual general meeting in April 2010, a performance share award was made to the chief executive, finance director and other members of the executive committee.

No such awards have vested since the 2002 award partly vested in 2005.
However, following the vesting of the 2008 three-year LTIP award, the chief executives total shareholding in Rank will be 587,406 with a market value using Ranks closing share price as at 21 February 2011 of 128.6p of 755,404, representing more than 143% ofhis base salary.
In the case of the finance director, his total shareholding in Rank immediately following the vesting of the 2008 three-year award will be 346,666 with a market value on 21 February 2011 of 445,812, representing more than 148% of his base salary.
The Rank Group Employee Benefit Trust The Trust holds shares to satisfy the vesting of LTIP awards.
Executive directors are deemed to have an interest in the ordinary shares of the Company held by the Trust.
As at each of 1 January 2010, 31 December 2010 8 and the date of this report, the Trust held 1,059,826 ordinary 13 p shares.
