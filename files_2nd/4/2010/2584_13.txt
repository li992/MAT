7884 Report 2010 Report 2010 02 06 2010 17:40 Page 48 48 Directors and governance BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Remuneration report continued Remuneration policy The policy for remuneration, which is established by the Board on the recommendation of the Committee, is to provide a combination of salary, shortand long-term incentives and benefits, to form a competitive and fair total remuneration package.
Employees of the Group including executive directors but excluding non-executive directors are remunerated using this policy.
Performance related remuneration is in the form of an annual bonus half of which is awarded in shares, deferred for three years for directors and certain senior staff, together with share options and performance shares.
This forms a significant proportion of the total remuneration which is subject to demanding performance conditions and the intention is that approximately 50% of executive directors remuneration should be fixed and 50% variable.
The balance of fixed and variable remuneration is illustrated below for the two executive directors.
The table is a theoretical model showing the on-target value of annual bonus and the fair value of PSP and ESOP awards assuming PSP awards have a fair value of 55% of salary and ESOP awards have a fair value of 25% of salary : Fixed Annual Long-term remuneration bonus incentives % total % total % total Louise Makin 47% 20% 33% Rolf Soderstrom 48% 20% 32% The Committee believes that the bonus opportunity aligned with the deferral into shares and forfeiture provisions, together with other elements of the long-term incentive plans, provides a balanced market-competitive package for the executive team.
However the Committee keeps such targets under regular review in order to ensure they remain appropriate.
The Committee continues to believe that: the overall remuneration package must be market competitive shortand long-term variable pay should continue to be a substantial part of overall remuneration significant rewards should be available for delivering the Groups shortand long-term objectives and achieving sectorleading returns for shareholders the structure of the remuneration package should continue to provide significant lock-in for the executive team executives should be required to build significant shareholdings of 100% of base salary in the Company to increase alignment with shareholders.
Remuneration levels are reviewed annually and the Committee seeks to target reward packages around the mid-market level for companies of the size, market capitalisation and sectors in which the Group operates.
The Committee and its advisers use a number of surveys of the employment market covering pharmaceutical and a wider group of similar sized companies from which to obtain data.
In line with the Association of British Insurers Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee will ensure that the incentive structure for executive directors and senior management will not raise environmental, social or governance ESG risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
More generally, the Committee will ensure that the overall remuneration policy does not encourage inappropriate operational risk-taking.
Components of the remuneration package Base salary: Base salary is reviewed annually taking into account the areas and level of responsibility together with the performance of the individual, benchmarked against information from independent sources and consultants on market levels.
As part of their consideration the Committee reviewed information from management on planned salary changes and bonus levels for the rest of the Group and how each individuals personal performance would affect their level of salary increase.
Following the full review of directors remuneration that took place in 2009, HNBS were asked to provide information on remuneration in similar sized companies in both the biopharmaceutical and healthcare sectors and a more general group of companies of similar market capitalisation in the FTSE 250 sector.
Following consideration of this information and the performance of the directors and the Group, the Committee recommended salary increases as follows.
As from Percentage As from 1 April 2009 increase 1 April 2010 % Louise Makin 419,664 4 436,452 Rolf Soderstrom 260,000 9 283,694 7884 Report 2010 Report 2010 02 06 2010 17:40 Page 49 49 Directors and governance BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 The Committee proposed a larger increase for Rolf Soderstrom taking account of the increasing complexity of his role compared with the position he held when he was Finance Director of Protherics PLC, and current market levels which indicated that his current remuneration was below that of comparator companies.
Benets and pension: Benefits mainly comprise the provision of medical benefits and permanent health insurance.
Louise Makin is a member of the Companys defined benefit pension scheme to which she contributes 7% and the Company 17.1% of base salary up to the HMRC Earnings Cap.
She makes additional pension contributions to a separate Executive Pension Scheme to which the Company contributed 59,213 during the year 2009: 49,920, being 20% of base salary above the HMRC Earnings Cap.
Rolf Soderstrom is a member of the Protherics company defined contribution pension scheme to which the Company contributed 20% of base salary.
The Company paid contributions of 51,995 to the pension scheme for his benefit 2009: 15,467 from 4 December 2008 being 20% of base salary.
Annual bonuses: The annual bonus incentive scheme applies to all members of staff, including executive directors.
The intention of this bonus is to link incentives more closely to Group performance over the short to medium term.
Bonuses are calculated based on personal and business performance.
For the year ended 31 March 2010 bonuses may not exceed 100% of base salary for executive directors and up to 75% for other staff.
Half of the bonus earned by the executive directors is deferred under the Companys Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP into a conditional award over shares, to be held for three years.
Normally these will be subject to forfeiture on a time-pro rated basis should they leave the Company during the deferral period unless they leave as a good leaver due to death, redundancy, or any other permitted reason.
If a participant is a good leaver their deferred shares award will vest in full on cessation but may be pro rated for time.
In the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement, demerger or winding-up etc.
all awards will vest in full unless the Committee determines to pro rate the awards for time.
Bonus targets were set at the start of the financial year for both Louise Makin and Rolf Soderstrom based on the achievement of certain objectives.
These included the achievement of targets for an EBITDA measure, cash generation and growth in the business.
For each category the Committee defined threshold, target and stretch levels.
The level of bonus payable is dependent on the degree to which each target is exceeded.
The EBITDA measure, used for both bonuses and long-term incentives, is a normalised measure relating to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
The table below shows the amount of base salary that would be paid out in bonus depending on the performance against each measure set by the Committee at the start of the year.
The target level of performance for cash and EBITDA was the achievement of budget.
Threshold and stretch being 5m either side of budget for cash and between 80% and 120% of budget for EBITDA: payout between the various performance levels being calculated on a straight-line basis.
The maximum level of bonus payable is 100% of base salary.
The performance level for growth was measured by the Committee based on various predetermined measures.
Total percentage Performance measure base salary Performance level Cash EBITDA Growth payable Threshold 5% 5% 15% 25% Target 10% 10% 30% 50% Stretch 20% 20% 60% 100% The Company achieved Cash of 82.6m being above the target performance level, EBITDA of 21.0m being above the maximum performance level and Growth assessed as being above the target performance level.
EBITDA is calculated as profit before tax 9.1m, add back depreciation and amortisation 12.4m, less net interest 0.5m.
7884 Report 2010 Report 2010 02 06 2010 17:40 Page 50 50 Directors and governance BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Remuneration report continued Following a review of performance against targets, the Committee recommended that the following bonuses be payable for the period.
Bonus payable in deferred Percentage Bonus payable shares under Total value bonus payable in cash the DSBP of bonus Director % Louise Makin 78.8 165,347 165,347 330,694 Rolf Soderstrom 78.8 102,440 102,440 204,880 The Committee has set business performance objectives for the executive directors for 2010 11 which focus on trading profit and operating cash targets with the balance concerned with various growth measures.
As last year, the target level of performance is the achievement of budget with threshold and stretch levels either side.
Other employees and senior managers were also eligible to receive annual bonuses for the year to 31 March 2010, ranging from a maximum of 10% to 75% of base salary depending on seniority, and subject to the achievement of both business and personal performance targets.
Long-term incentive arrangements: Executive directors and senior managers, together with all other employees, are eligible to participate in the Companys share schemes as operated from time to time.
The Company currently operates the Performance Share Plan 2006 PSP and the Executive Share Option Plan 2009 ESOP.
The Committees current policy is that executive directors should receive annual awards under both plans as this: places significant weight on longer-term performance given the strategy to transition the business from a research and development-focused biotech company to an earnings-driven speciality pharma company: and ensures that packages for the executive directors include a strong emphasis on the absolute growth in shareholder value by the use of share option grants.
Performance share plan The awards for 2009 10 have performance conditions based on a combination of an EBITDA measure as described on page 49 and total shareholder return TSR measured over three financial years.
The Companys TSR is compared with that of a peer group comprising FTSE 250 companies excluding investment trusts, companies in the financial services sector banking, insurance, broking, fund management etc.
and companies in the consumer discretionary sector non-food retail, media, leisure, gambling with opening and closing TSR values averaged over three months prior to the start and end of the performance period.
The two measures were combined as shown in the table below.
Relative TSR 10th 9th 8th 7th 6th 5th 4th 3rd 2nd highest highest highest highest highest highest highest highest highest Highest decile decile decile decile decile decile decile decile decile decile Percentile Percentile Percentile Percentile Percentile Percentile Percentile Percentile Percentile Percentile EBITDA 1 to 10 11 to 20 21 to 30 31 to 40 41 to 50 51 to 60 61 to 70 71 to 80 81 to 90 91 to 100 Above stretch 15% 30% 45% 60% 80% 100% 100% 100% Target to stretch 20% 35% 50% 60% 80% 100% 100% Threshold to target 30% 40% 60% 65% 80% Below threshold 20% 40% 45% 60% Recipients of awards under the PSP are entitled to receive annual awards of shares with a face value of up to 100% of base salary.
EBITDA targets for the awards made during 2009 10 were based on cumulative EBITDA measures over a three year period with a range of performance levels between threshold and stretch.
EBITDA will be measured on a normalised basis over the three year period in the range 38m to 76m.
7884 Report 2010 Report 2010 02 06 2010 17:40 Page 51 51 Directors and governance BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Executive share option plan The Company presented a new share option plan for approval at the 2009 AGM under which grants of options may be made to executive directors and other employees at the invitation of the Committee.
Participants may be granted awards of options the vesting of which will normally be dependent upon performance conditions measured over a period of not less than three years.
Awards will typically be limited to 100% of base salary, although, in exceptional circumstances, there will be an individual limit on each award of 150% of base salary.
Performance conditions for awards made in 2009 10 were the same as for the PSP awards described above.
The Committee has agreed to make awards for 2010 11 of 100% of base salary to Louise Makin and Rolf Soderstrom under the ESOP.
These will be subject to the same performance conditions as for the 2010 11 PSP awards.
Special award to Rolf Soderstrom made on 22 July 2009 As a result of the merger between BTG and Protherics in 2008, existing awards of long-term incentives under the Protherics long-term incentive arrangements vested on the change of control.
In order to ensure that appropriate incentive arrangements are in place to retain Rolf Soderstrom, the Committee approved a one-off award of 76,448 performance shares that vest two years after grant, subject to his being employed within the Group at that time and to the extent that challenging performance conditions have been met.
To the extent that the award vests, the relevant shares will be delivered for nil consideration.
The award may also be satisfied in cash.
The award was granted pursuant to the exemption from the need for prior shareholder approval contained in Listing Rule 9.4.
The award is non-pensionable and non-transferable other than on death.
The award was granted on substantially the same terms as awards made under the PSP, the principal terms of which are described below.
The performance conditions attached to these awards are substantially the same as those that apply to the 2009 10 PSP awards save that performance is measured over two financial years from the start of the financial year in which the award was made and the cumulative EBITDA defined as set out on page 49 targets were set to take account of the shorter performance period.
If Rolf Soderstrom ceases employment with the Group before the second anniversary of grant, the outstanding part of the award will lapse, unless he leaves in certain good leaver situations due to death, redundancy or any other permitted reason.
In this event, it will vest on cessation or, if the Committee so decides, the second anniversary of grant to the extent the performance condition is met at the relevant time.
This would be subject to time pro rating to reflect the period of time between the date of grant and the date of cessation rounded up to the next half-year, relative to the period of two years, unless the Committee concludes in its discretion that it is not appropriate to apply the pro rata reduction.
If the executive ceases employment by reason of death the award will vest in full.
In the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement, or winding-up of the Company, the award will vest early to the extent that the performance conditions are met at that time and, unless the Committee decides otherwise, subject to time pro rating to reflect the period between the grant date and the relevant event on the basis set out above.
The award may also vest on this basis in the event of a demerger, special dividend or other similar event which, in the Committees opinion, materially affects the price of the Companys shares.
The award will not, unless the Committee decides otherwise, vest on an internal reorganisation but will instead be exchanged for an equivalent award over shares in the new holding company.
The award will not confer any shareholder rights on Rolf Soderstrom until it vests, except that he will be entitled to a payment in cash and or shares, at the discretion of the Committee shortly after vesting to reflect the dividends that would have been paid on those shares, assuming such dividends were reinvested in further shares at the closing price on the relevant ex-dividend dates.
In the event of any variation of the Companys share capital, demerger, payment of a special dividend or any other event which materially affects the price of the Companys shares, the number of shares under the award may be adjusted as the Committee sees fit.
The terms of the award may be amended in such manner as the executive and the Committee may agree, provided that amendments to his benefit in relation to the basis for determining the executives entitlement to, and the terms of, the shares or cash to be acquired and the adjustment of the award may only be made with the prior approval of shareholders in general meeting.
Shareholder approval will not be required for alterations to the performance conditions or any minor alteration made to benefit the administration of the arrangement, to take account of a change in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment for the executive or any Group company.
The Committee confirms that the matching award was felt to be necessary to facilitate the retention of Rolf Soderstrom following the merger of BTG and Protherics.
The EBITDA performance targets were based on cumulative EBITDA measured over a two year period with a range of performance levels between threshold and stretch.
EBITDA will be measured on a normalised basis over the two year period in the range 24m to 41m.
7884 Report 2010 Report 2010 02 06 2010 17:40 Page 52 52 Directors and governance BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Remuneration report continued Other plans The Company operates an HMRC-approved save-as-you-earn scheme, open to all eligible employees including executive directors who open an approved savings contract, to enable them to purchase shares in the Company.
The options are exercisable after three years at a price not less than 80% of the market value of the shares at the date of grant.
The Scheme provides an international section to allow for the participation of Australian employees.
The Company also provides a US Internal Revenue Service 423 Plan for its US employees and a restricted share scheme in order to award nil paid shares to employees below Board level.
External appointments The Board believes that it may be beneficial to the Company for executives to hold non-executive directorships outside the Group.
Any such appointments are subject to approval by the Board and the director may retain any fees payable.
Louise Makin received fees, from her position at Premier Foods plc, of 61,375 during the year to 31 March 2010 2009: 57,000.
Rolf Soderstrom does not currently hold any outside directorships.
Service contracts The Companys policy on directors service contracts is that, in line with the best practice provisions of the Code, they should be terminable by the Company on a maximum of one years notice and contracts do not provide for predetermined compensation in the event of termination or provision for enhanced payments in the event of a takeover of the Company.
The Company may terminate the contracts of the executive directors with immediate effect by making a payment in lieu of notice.
Any payments made would be determined by reference to normal contractual principles with mitigation being applied as wherever relevant or appropriate.
The directors contracts do not provide for automatic entitlement to bonus or share-based payments.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts, but have letters of appointment for an initial period of three years, which may be renewed by mutual agreement, normally for a further three-year term.
The terms of appointment do not contain any contractual provisions regarding a notice period or the right to receive compensation in the event of early termination with the exception of the Chairman whose appointment is on six months notice other than if he is not re-elected at an AGM.
Details of contracts and letters of appointment, for directors serving at the date of this report, are as set out below.

In proposing such fees, account is taken of similar fees paid to non-executive directors in listed companies within the Groups listing sector and of similar size and the time commitments of BTGs non-executives.
The decision on fee changes is taken by the Board as a whole.
Individual non-executive directors do not take part in discussions on their remuneration.
Non-executive directors do not receive benefits or pension contributions from the Group and do not participate in any Group incentive scheme.
In March 2010 the Committee reviewed the fees payable to the Chairman, following advice from HNBS.
HNBS also advised the Chairman and executive directors on changes to fees for the non-executive directors.
Set out in the table below are the fees paid for the year ended 31 March 2010 together with changes as the results of the reviews.

2 This equals the accrued pension as at 31st March 2010 less the equivalent pension as at 31st March 2009 disclosed in the 2009 Annual Report.
3 This is the transfer value as at 31 March 2010 less the transfer value as at 31 March 2009 less the contributions paid by the director in the year.
4 Note that inflation was negative over the year.
The BTG Pension Fund is a contracted-out defined benefit arrangement which provides a pension based on an accrual rate of either one sixtieth or one eightieth of basic salary up to the earnings cap, depending on the level of contributions paid by members of 7% or 5% respectively.
Members are able to retire at any time from age 60 onwards and under current legislation, if members continue to work beyond age 60, they may continue to pay contributions and enhance their pension entitlement, subject to a maximum of 40 years pensionable service.
In the event of a death of a member the Fund provides for a spouses pension to be payable equal to two-thirds of the deceased members pension and for current active members a lump sum death benefit equal to four times basic salary up to the earnings cap plus refund of the members contributions is also payable.
During the year Louise Makin, aged 49, contributed 8,652 to the fund.
Details of her individual pension entitlements are shown in the above table.
Directors share awards The directors have the following interests in BTG plc shares under the Companys various plans.
Full details of their holdings at the start and end of the financial year and at 20 May 2010 are set out below.
Following the acquisition of Protherics on 4 December 2008, the Committee recognised that the performance conditions for the PSP awards made in 2007 and 2008 were no longer relevant having been set prior to the acquisition of the Protherics Group.
As it would no longer be possible to measure the profit performance condition, in accordance with the rules of the Plan, the Committee elected to amend the conditions for the 2007 and 2008 awards.
The Committee reviewed the performance against profit targets for the period to March 2009 for each of the awards and HNBS were asked to advise on the level of TSR performance.
The level of under over performance for the period was noted.
For the balance of the three year period the Committee elected to use the TSR and EBITDA measures used for the 2009 10 PSP awards.
At the end of the three year period the results for the final year will be adjusted for the under over performance in the period to 31 March 2009.
Following advice from HNBS on the TSR performance for the year to 31 March 2010, which, combined with the performance for the first two years of the performance period, exceeded the maximum target, the Committee approved the release of 284,734 shares to Louise Makin under the 2007 PSP award, the balance of 1,241 shares to lapse.
The shares being due to vest on 15 June 2010.
