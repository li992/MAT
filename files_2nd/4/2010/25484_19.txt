Remuneration report Statement from the Chairman of the Board Remuneration Committee This has been an This Remuneration Report was prepared by the Remuneration Committee and approved unprecedented year by the board.
The board believes that a properly constituted and effective Remuneration Committee is key to improving the link between pay and performance.
The committee in that remuneration consists entirely of non-executive directors, and executive directors are not involved in determining their own remuneration packages.
This report describes our remuneration policy has been widely and directors remuneration for the 2010 financial year.
discussed by Overview regulators, This has been an unprecedented year in that remuneration has been widely discussed politicians and the by regulators, politicians and the public across the jurisdictions in which we operate.
It is incumbent on a public company to reflect upon these changes.
public across the The committee, in addition to its regular business, has reviewed a comprehensive survey 44 jurisdictions in of the new remuneration regulations and changing attitudes in all our core geographies.
An which we operate extensive gap analysis was done to capture the extent of the changes required of us and we have received independent confirmation that this analysis was comprehensive and robust.
There are some subtle nuances and differences in the requirements across the geographies in which we operate.
We have concluded that Investecs long-standing fundamental remuneration philosophies are consistent with these requirements.
Our overall remuneration philosophy and practices have thus remained largely unchanged from the prior year.
At the level of operational implementation we have, however, made some changes to the detail of our approach in order to be more closely aligned with these new requirements.
We have worked hard at closing any gaps and believe we comply with the substance of these various regulations.
The committee continues to consider remuneration policies and packages of the executive directors, persons discharging managerial responsibilities, a number of other senior and highly paid employees across the group, as well as paying specific attention to the rewards allocated to employees within the Internal Audit, Compliance and Risk divisions.
Talent management and the retention of senior management and executives remained key items on our agenda during the year.
We are conscious of the need to constantly refresh the means of incentivising our staff in order to meet the pressures of competition in our labour markets within the context of a much changed global landscape.
Remuneration in context The details of our remuneration philosophy, practices and programmes are detailed later in this report.
In summary, we recognise that banks have to divide the return from their enterprises between the suppliers of capital and labour and the societies in which they do business, the latter through taxation and corporate social responsibility activities.
Our global remuneration philosophy seeks to maintain an appropriate balance between the interests of these stakeholders, and is closely aligned to our core values and philosophies which include risk consciousness: meritocracy: material employee ownership: and an unselfish contribution to colleagues, clients and society.
Over the last five years our consolidated compensation ratio has been between 35% and 40%, with a 10 year average of 42%, reflecting a key emphasis on balancing risks, rewards Investec Annual Report 2010 PAGE 231 Remuneration report continued and incentives.
We note that several investment banks which used to operate at higher ratios have more recently reduced to this level.
We encourage our employees to be shareholders Staff compensation ratio and thus also derive benefits from the organisation through the returns on their shareholdings.
The proportion of shares owned directly and indirectly by employees is approximately 15%.
36.1% Remuneration and effective risk management Risk management is embedded in the organisational culture from the initiation of transactional activity through to the monitoring of adherence to mandates and limits.
The Board Risk and Capital Committee determines the categories of risk, the specific types of risks and the extent Total shareholder return of such risks which the group should undertake, as well as the mitigation of risks and overall capital management and allocation process.
This is executed via a number of forums and Investec plc internal processes on a day to day basis, with risk functions that are both embedded in return business units as well as subject to oversight by independent central risk functions.
We have, for in excess of 10 years, applied a variable performance reward model which is 90.6% closely linked to business profit performance using a realised Economic Value Added EVA 4 model against pre-determined targets above risk and capital weighted returns.
Independent risk committees approve all limits and risk exposures.
In terms of the EVA structure, capital is Investec Limited allocated based on risk and therefore the higher the risk, the higher the capital allocation and the higher the hurdle return rate required.
This model, which has remained largely unchanged return for several years, ensures that risk and capital management form the basis for key processes at both a group and transaction level thus balancing the rewards between all stakeholders.
65.1% The persons responsible for alignment of all stakeholder interests are the various risk managers of the group as well as the group executive whose awards are not linked to specific performance based on a formula but on the overall performance of the group taking into FTSE 350 Index consideration financial performance, compliance with culture and values and numerous other qualitative factors set out later in this report.
return Year in review 49.8% In addition to the information provided above, key points to note for the period under review include: Investecs recurring revenue base and operational diversity have continued to support profitability across its core geographies.
Core capital and liquidity ratios remain sound and the group has reported attributable earnings of 309.7 million 2009: 269.2 million.
Further information on our risk management indicators, policies and procedures and the groups performance can be found on pages 35 to 49 and pages 105 to 108 The total staff compensation to operating income ratio is 36.1% 2009: 34.9% 30.1 million of the current years variable remuneration has been paid in the form of share awards and deferred representing 16.6% of our variable remuneration expense for the year Non-executive directors will receive a modest increase in their fees in the forthcoming year, roughly in line with inflation Our total shareholder return was 90.6% for Investec plc in Pounds Sterling and 65.1% for Investec Limited in Rands.
This compares to a return of 49.8% for the FTSE 350 General Finance Index and a return of 50.4% for the FTSE 100 Index.
Towards the end of our financial year, Investec plc was included as a new entrant to the FTSE 100 index.
Since listing on the London Stock Exchange in 2002, Investec plc has outperformed the FTSE 350 General Finance Index and the FTSE 100 Index see graph on page 243 Investec Annual Report 2010 PAGE 232 Executive directors hold 1.6% and 2.9% of the issued share capital of Investec plc and Investec Limited, respectively.

remuneration policy Signed on behalf of the board The committee unanimously recommends that you vote to approve this report at the 2010 annual general meeting George Alford Chairman, Remuneration Committee 15 June 2010 Investec Annual Report 2010 PAGE 233 Remuneration report continued Remuneration philosophy and policies Remuneration philosophy We have a strong Our philosophy, which remains unchanged from prior years, is to employ the highest calibre entrepreneurial, individuals who are characterised by integrity, intellect and innovation and who adhere and subscribe to our culture, values and philosophies.
We strive to inspire entrepreneurship by merit and valuesproviding a working environment that stimulates extraordinary performance, so that executive based culture, directors and employees may be positive contributors to our clients, their communities and the group.
characterised by We reward executive directors and employees for their contribution through: passion, energy payment of an industry competitive annual package base salary and benefits and stamina a variable performance reward linked to our EVA model as discussed on pages 236 and 237 ownership in the form of share incentive scheme participation.
4 We tend to look at the aggregate of the above as the overall remuneration package designed to attract, retain, incentivise and drive the behaviour of our employees over the short, medium and longer term.
Overall rewards are considered as important as our core values of work content greater responsibility, variety of work and high level of challenge and work affiliation entrepreneurial feel to the company and unique culture in the attraction, retention and motivation of employees.
We have a strong entrepreneurial, merit and values-based culture, characterised by passion, energy and stamina.
The ability to live and perpetuate our values, culture and philosophies in the pursuit of excellence is considered paramount in determining overall reward levels.
The type of people the organisation attracts, and the culture and environment within which they work, remain crucial in determining our success and long-term progress.
Our reward programmes are clear and transparent, designed and administered to align directors and employees interests with those of all stakeholders and ensure the groups short and long-term success.
Remuneration policy The key principles of our remuneration policy for executive directors and employees, which were consistently applied during the financial year, are as follows: Total rewards comprise a fixed and variable component The fixed component of our rewards includes a base salary, pension and benefits and is set at median market levels to keep fixed cost elements low Variable rewards a portion of which is deferred for senior employees are largely EVA based and underpinned by our risk appetite and capital utilisation as discussed on pages 179 to 183 Long-term share incentive participation ensures alignment with stakeholders Total compensation base salary, pension, benefits and incentives is targeted in normal market conditions to the relevant competitive market see below at upper quartile levels for superior performance We do not apply an upper limit on performance bonuses given our risk based EVA approach and prefer to contain the fixed cost component of remuneration at modest levels.
Investec Annual Report 2010 PAGE 234 Qualitative and quantitative issues form an integral part of the determination of reward levels.
Key inputs into the reward process are as follows: The reward package for A significant proportion of rewards, including annual and long-term incentive components, are explicitly linked to the performance of the business and the individual business units executive directors and We recognise the performance of the business and the individual employees comprises: An individuals alignment with and adherence to our culture and values system is a key consideration Base salary and benefits Other aspects considered include, for example, attitude displayed towards risk Annual performance bonuses consciousness: the level of co-operation and collaboration fostered: the ability to grow Long-term share incentive and develop markets: the possible replacement cost of such individuals.
plans Reward levels are targeted to be commercially competitive, on the following basis: The most relevant competitive reference points for reward levels are based on the scope of responsibility and individual contributions made Appropriate benchmark, industry and comparable organisations remuneration practices 4 are reviewed regularly For executive directors, the FTSE 350 General Finance firms have provided the most appropriate benchmark to date For employees, combinations of firms from the JSE Financial 15 and the FTSE 350 General Finance sector have offered the most appropriate benchmark The committee also reviews data on other international banks with which we compete, including certain FTSE 100 companies The committee recognises that we operate an international business and compete with both local and international competitors in each of our markets In order to avoid disproportionate packages across areas of the group and between executives, adjustments are made at any extremes to ensure broad internal consistency.
Adjustments may also be made to the competitive positioning of pay components for individuals, in cases where a higher level of investment is needed in order to build or grow either a business unit or our capability in a geography.
Components of remuneration The elements of the reward package, as listed above, are discussed below and the components for each director are detailed in tables accompanying this report.
As a consequence of the global financial markets crisis and the resultant debate and review surrounding remuneration policies and procedures, the committee has made a few changes to the components of our reward programmes.
Base salary and benefits Salaries are reviewed annually and reflect the relative skills and experience of, and contribution made by, the individual.
It is the companys policy to set base salaries including benefits at median market levels.
Benefits are targeted at competitive levels and are delivered through flexible and tailored packages.
Benefits include pension schemes: life, disability and personal accident insurance: medical cover: and other benefits, as dictated by competitive local market practices.
Only salaries are pensionable, the annual bonuses paid are not.
Our disclosure of executive directors salaries on page 244 has been done on a gross basis i. e. inclusive of pension fund contributions from the company.
Investec Annual Report 2010 PAGE 235 Remuneration report continued Annual performance bonus Annual performance bonuses are closely linked to business performance, based on target Developments over business unit performance goals determined in the main by realised EVA profit performance against pre-determined targets above a risk and capital weighted return.
These targets have the past year been in force, and unchanged, for the past few years and are subject to annual review.
During the prior financial year the group refined its performance EVA model and process bonus policies by introducing a Our business strategy and associated risk appetite, together with effective capital utilisation, non-cash element in the form of form the key cornerstones which underpin the EVA annual bonus allocation model.
This forfeitable share awards for all model has been consistently applied for more than 10 years and encompasses the following principals and processes: employees whose bonuses exceed a pre-determined hurdle Targeted returns differ by business unit reflecting the competitive economics and shareholder expectation for the specific area of business, and are set with reference level and by introducing a formal to competitive benchmarks for each product line.
In essence varying levels of return deferral requirement.
These are required for each business unit reflecting the state of market maturity, country of 4 awards are made in terms of our operation, risk, capital invested capital intensive businesses or expected expense base existing long-term incentive plans fee-based businesses Capital allocated is a function of both regulatory and internal capital requirements, the risk During the current year, the assumed within the business and our overall business strategy pre-determined hurdle level was The group has always held capital in excess of minimum regulatory requirements, and increased and the deferral period this philosophy is perpetuated in our internal capital allocation process.
This process was extended from 11 months to ensures that risk and capital discipline is embedded at the level of deal initiation and two years incorporates independent approval outside of the business unit of transactions by the various risk committees.
A detailed explanation of our capital management and allocation process is provided on pages 179 to 183 Growth in profitability over time will result in an increasing incentive pool, as long as it is not achieved at the expense of capital efficiency Target returns must be reflective of the inherent risk assumed in the business.
Thus, an increase in absolute profitability does not automatically result in an increase in the annual bonus pool.
This approach allows us to embed risk and capital discipline in our business processes A fixed predetermined percentage of any return in excess of the EVA hurdle accrues to the business units EVA pool A portion of the total EVA pool is allocated towards the bonus pool for central service and head office employees Once the annual determination of the EVA pools is complete, line managers in each business unit will make discretionary bonus recommendations for each team member taking into consideration qualitative and quantitative criteria as mentioned above Bonus recommendations are then subject to an extensive geographic review involving Human Resources, local management and local remuneration committees Thereafter, these recommendations are subject to a global review by executive management, before the DLC Remuneration Committee review and approval process.
In terms of our EVA process, if business and individual performance goals are achieved or bettered, the variable element of the total reward package is likely to be substantially higher than the relevant target market.
This ensures that overall reward levels are positioned at the upper quartile level for superior performance, in line with our overriding remuneration policy.

Share option and long-term share incentive plans We have a number of share option and long-term share incentive plans that are designed to link the interests of directors and employees with those of shareholders and long-term organisational interests, through performance and risk-based equity grants.
Prior to the implementation of our DLC structure and our listing on the London Stock Exchange in July 2002, we had a number of share option, share purchase and leveraged share schemes in place that were appropriate for a South African listed company.
However, at the time of the London listing it was necessary for us to consider implementing a more internationally recognised share scheme structure and philosophy.
As a result, a number of share option plans were introduced to cater for regulatory, tax and other considerations pertaining to the various jurisdictions in which we operated.
At the same time, however, a decision was taken to maintain the schemes that were in place prior to the London listing until the allocations made in terms of those schemes matured.
While this gives rise to what appears to be a multitude of schemes, the philosophy and practical implications are fairly simple the appropriate level of equity allocation is determined for each employee and then awards are made out of the scheme that is considered most appropriate for that individual given his her location, tax and regulatory environment.
The share option and long-term share incentive plans in operation, and in which the directors are eligible to participate, are summarised in the table below and further details are provided on our website.
Executive directors collectively hold approximately 2.1% of our issued share capital.

The limits for allocations to employees and executive management during a financial year may be exceeded if the directors determine that exceptional circumstances make it desirable that options should be granted in excess of that limit.
These conditions require growth in headline earnings per share EPS over the relevant option period to equal or exceed the UK Retail Price Index RPI plus 3% compounded annually over the same period.
In choosing the performance targets for this plan, the committee considered the merits of EPS-based targets against other possibilities, such as comparative performance or comparative growth in ROE against a basket of other companies.
The committee determined that EPS-based targets are most appropriate as they measure our underlying growth.
The committee intends to continue to apply this during the 2011 financial year but keeps the matter of the suitability of target-linked share based remuneration under periodic review.
This note does not apply to the Share Matching Plan 2005 which has different performance conditions as approved by shareholders further information is available on our website.
This represents the number of awards made to all participants.
For further details, see the Directors report on page 277.
More details on the directors shareholdings are also provided in tables accompanying this report.
Dilution limits: Investec is committed to following the Association of British Insurers ABI guidelines and, accordingly, as from the date of the implementation of our DLC structure 29 July 2002, the maximum number of new shares which may be issued by the company under all of the share plans in respect of grants made after July 2002 may not exceed 10% of the issued share capital of the company over a rolling 10 year period.
The committee regularly monitors the utilisation of dilution limits and available headroom to ensure that these guidelines are complied with.
The issued share capital of Investec plc and Investec Limited at 31 March 2010 was 471.1 million shares and 269.8 million shares respectively.
As announced on the stock exchange news services, 2.2 million Investec plc and 0.7 million Investec Limited shares were issued to the staff share schemes during the year.
The market price of an Investec plc share as at 31 March 2010 was 5.39 2009: 2.92, ranging from a low of 2.87 to a high of 5.62 during the financial year.
The market price of an Investec Limited share as at 31 March 2010 was R62.49 2009: R38.86, ranging from a low of R37.51 to a high of R65.40 during the financial year.
The rules of these long-term incentive plans do not allow awards to be made to executive directors.
Investec Annual Report 2010 PAGE 240 Non-executive directors remuneration The board agrees and determines the fees of non-executive directors and the fees are reviewed annually.
The boards policy is that fees should reflect individual responsibilities and membership of board committees.
In view of the current market conditions and the focus on controlling fixed remuneration, it was decided that the non-executive directors will receive a modest increase in their fees in the forthcoming year, roughly in line with inflation.
Their fee structure covers the dual roles that the directors perform for the UK listed Investec plc and the South African listed Investec Limited boards.
The fee structure for non-executive directors for the 2010 and 2011 financial years is shown below: As approved by the board Non-executive directors remuneration 2010 financial year for the 2011 financial year Chairmans total fee 360 000 per year 375 000 per year Basic non-executive director fee 53 000 per year 55 000 per year Chairman of the DLC Audit Committee 45 000 per year 47 000 per year Chairman of the DLC Remuneration Committee 32 000 per year 33 500 per year Member of the DLC Audit Committee 13 000 per year 13 500 per year 4 Member of the DLC Remuneration Committee 12 500 per year 13 000 per year Member of DLC Nomination and Directors Affairs Committee Nil 9 500 per year Member of Investec Bank plc board 9 000 per year 9 500 per year Member of the Investec Bank Limited board R150 000 per year R160 000 per year Fees are also payable for any additional time committed to the group including attendance at certain other meetings.
There is no requirement for non-executive directors to hold shares in the company.
The company has left this choice to the discretion of each non-executive director.
Governance section Compliance and governance statement The Remuneration Report complies with the provisions of the 2008 London Combined Code, Section 420 of the UK Companies Act 2006, the UK Financial Services Authority Listing Rules, the South African King III Code of Corporate Practice and Conduct and the JSE Limited Listing Rules.
In addition, as mentioned elsewhere in this report, the committee has reviewed an extensive survey of the new remuneration regulations and changing attitudes in all of our core geographies and concluded that Investecs long-standing fundamental remuneration philosophies are consistent with these requirements.
Notably, the committee believes that the group is in principle compliant with the eight principles contained in the FSAs Remuneration Code of Practice.
Composition and role of the committee George Alford Chairman, Geoffrey Howe and Sir Chips Keswick were members of the committee throughout the year.
Sir David Prosser was appointed as a member on 9 September 2009.

Three out of the four members are also members of the groups Board Risk and Capital Committee and all members are also members of the Audit Committee as discussed on pages 211 and 212 and page 214, thus bringing risk and control mechanisms into their deliberations.
The committees principal responsibilities and objectives are to: Determine, develop and agree with the board, the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of executive directors and executive management comprising individuals discharging managerial responsibilities, who are the global heads of our core areas of activity and are members of our Global Operations Forum Ensure that qualified and experienced management and executives will be provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and will be, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their contribution to the success of the group and alignment with the corporate objectives and business strategy Review and approve the design of, and determine targets and objectives for, any performance related pay schemes operated by the group and approve the aggregate annual payouts under such schemes Investec Annual Report 2010 PAGE 241 Remuneration report continued Review and approve, within the terms of the agreed policy, the total individual remuneration packages of executive directors and executive management including, where appropriate, bonuses, incentive payments and share scheme awards Review and approve, within the terms of the agreed policy, the total individual remuneration packages of members of the internal audit, risk and compliance functions Oversee any major changes in our employee benefit structures Ensure that the comments, recommendations and rules within the UK and South Africa pertaining to remuneration are given due regard.
The committee is authorised by the board to seek any information it requires from any employee in order to perform its duties.
The committees terms of reference are available on our website.
Meetings The committee met nine times during the financial year with full attendance other than for three meetings which Sir Chips Keswick was unable to attend.
Sir David Prosser attended all the meetings that followed his date of appointment to the committee.
The Company Secretary of Investec plc acts as Secretary to the committee.
Executive directors do not attend these meetings.
The Chairman of the committee reports on the activities of the committee at each meeting of the full board.
4 Advisers to the committee Where appropriate, the committee has access to independent executive remuneration consultants.
The selection of the advisers is at the discretion of the committee Chairman, and Investec funds any expenses relating to the appointment of external consultants.
During the financial year, the committee continued to use the services of its advisers, Hewitt New Bridge Street, which among other things specifically reviewed and provided information on industry consultation papers, regulations and developments with respect to remuneration practices and our alignment to them.
In addition, they continued to review and provide information on appropriate benchmark, industry and comparable organisations remuneration practices.
Their recommendations are important in the ongoing review of our remuneration practices.
Furthermore, we have used the services of Linklaters, who have advised this year mainly on issues pertaining to our incentive plans.
Linklaters is one of Investec plcs legal advisers.
Certain specialist divisions within the group, for example Human Resources and the Staff Shares division, provide supporting information and documentation relating to matters that are presented to the committee.
This includes, for example, comparative data and motivations for proposed salary, bonus and share awards.
The variable remuneration pools are determined by our Finance teams taking into account risk adjusted capital requirements and after eliminating unrealised gains.
The employees within these specialist divisions, who provide support to the committee, are not board directors and are not appointed by the committee.
The committee, together with the board, attends a strategic offsite each year at which senior executive employees provide information and presentations on the groups strategic direction, prospects, key focus areas and annual budget.
While executive directors have the right to address any meeting of the committee, they play no role in the determination of their remuneration package.
Furthermore, no employee participates in discussions or decisions of the committee relating to their own remuneration.
Service contracts and terms of employment Our executive directors have indefinite contracts of employment, terminable by either party giving six months written notice to the other.
Each executive director is entitled to receive a basic salary and is also eligible for an annual bonus, the amount of which will be determined at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Furthermore, the executive directors may elect to sacrifice a portion of their annual salary to receive company benefits such as a travel allowance and medical aid.
The full costs of these benefits are deducted from their annual salary.
The contracts of employment do not contain provisions for compensation payable on early termination.
Executive directors are permitted to accept outside appointments on external boards or committees so long as these are not deemed to interfere with the business of the company.
Any fees earned by executives in this regard are not retained and are given back to the respective companies.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts and letters of appointment confirm the terms and conditions of their service.
The letters of appointment do not contain provisions for compensation payable on early termination.
Unless the non-executive directors resign earlier or are removed from their positions, they will remain as directors until the close of our Annual General Meeting in 2011 subject to rotational re-election as directors at the 2010 meeting and in terms of the provision of the Articles of Association.
All non-executive directors who have been members of the board for longer than nine years are subject to annual re-election as required in terms of our Articles of Association.
Those directors seeking rotational re-election at the 2010 annual general meeting are shown on page 206.
Investec Annual Report 2010 PAGE 242 Biographical details of the directors of the board These details can be found on pages 260 to 262.
Dates of appointment to the board The boards of Investec plc and Investec Limited are separate and subject to different legal obligations for each company.
In terms of the DLC arrangements, they comprise the same persons who are authorised, as boards, to manage Investec as if it were a unified economic enterprise.
Details on the dates the directors were appointed to the board can be found on page 206.
Performance graph total shareholder return We have implemented a DLC structure, in terms of which we have premium primary listings in London and Johannesburg.
The listing on the London Stock Exchange LSE took place on 29 July 2002, although we have been listed in South Africa since 1986.
Section 420 of the UK Companies Act 2006 requires this report to include a performance graph of Investec plcs total shareholder return TSR performance against that of a broad market index.
We found it difficult to locate an appropriate group of companies to benchmark ourselves against because of our specialist activities.
A number of companies within the FTSE 350 General Finance Index conduct similar activities to us, 4 although they do not necessarily have the same geographical profile.
Nevertheless, to date this has been the most appropriate index against which to measure our performance on the LSE.
The graph below shows the cumulative shareholder return for a holding of our shares in green in Pounds Sterling on the LSE, compared with the average total shareholder return of other members of the FTSE 350 General Finance Index.
It shows that, at 31 March 2010, a hypothetical 100 invested in Investec plc at the time of its listing on the LSE in July 2002 would have generated a total return of 514 compared with a return of 111 if invested in the FTSE 350 General Finance Index.
Investec plc has therefore outperformed the FTSE 350 General Finance Index over the period.
Towards the end of our financial year, Investec plc was included as a new entrant into the FTSE 100 Index.
We have included the total shareholder return of that index for illustrative purposes.
During the period from 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010, the return to shareholders of Investec plc measured in Pounds Sterling and Investec Limited measured in Rands was 90.6% and 65.1%, respectively.
This compares to a return of 49.8% for the FTSE 350 General Finance Index.
The market price of our shares on the LSE was 5.39 as at 31 March 2010, ranging from a low of 2.87 to a high of 5.62 during the financial year.
Furthermore, the market price of our shares on the JSE Limited was R62.49 as at 31 March 2010, ranging from a low of R37.51 to a high of R65.40 during the financial year.
Gross remuneration comprises base salary and other benefits see point 2 and 3 below.
Gross remuneration of S Koseff, B Kantor and A Tapnack has on average declined by approximately 2%.
The gross remuneration of GR Burger is determined in Rands and converted into Pounds Sterling.
In Rand terms GR Burgers gross remuneration remained at R3 050 000 for the 2010 and 2009 financial years.
Gross remuneration increases for other employees across the group have generally been in the range of 0% to 8%.
For the 2011 financial year it is proposed that the executive directors will receive salary increases roughly in line with inflation.
The executive directors receive other benefits which may include pension schemes: life, disability and personal accident insurance: and medical cover, on similar terms to other senior executives.
In determining annual bonuses, a number of quantitative and qualitative factors metrics were considered which included: The group recorded an increase in attributable earnings, dividends per share and total shareholder return The group reported operating profits in all of its core geographies, benefiting from its recurring income base The group further improved the quality of its balance sheet, with an increase in both capital and liquidity over the period.
Leverage ratios remain low and the group has further reduced reliance on wholesale funding The group has made significant progress in increasing its non-lending revenue base and further balancing the revenue generated from its operational risk businesses and its financial risk businesses.
Initiatives and developments in this regard include: the substantial 4 increase in funds under management over the period: the group is in the process of establishing a global wealth management division: and the acquisition of Rensburg Sheppards plc The group has maintained its capital strength over the past two years without recourse to shareholders, new investors or government assistance.
Investec has demonstrated its resilience in the face of the worst financial crisis in decades A focused and intimate involvement of the executive directors in ensuring stringent management of risk, liquidity and capital Investment in the Investec brand continues to deliver shareholder value Business units have moved onto the front foot and are taking advantage of new opportunities Continuous engagement with key stakeholders.
Over the past two years, in addition to our day-to-day communication with all stakeholders, executive management conducted several roadshows presenting to clients, employees and investors on the financial and operating position of the group in order to give a sense of comfort during this difficult and uncertain period The group has maintained its commitment to its sustainability efforts, and received a number of awards in this area.
Further information on the groups performance and risk management metrics have been discussed elsewhere in the annual report.
Based on comparator analyses provided by the committees advisers, Hewitt New Bridge Street, the total remuneration of the executive directors falls within median market levels.
S Koseff and B Kantor are each awarded a total bonus of 2 250 000, comprising 990 000 in cash payable in June 2010 and the balance deferred and payable in two equal installments on 31 January 2011 and 31 January 2012.
