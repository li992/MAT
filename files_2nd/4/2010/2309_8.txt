Unaudited Information The Remuneration Committee Membership the committee from 27 March 2009 until 27 May 2009 comprised lord Bilimoria chairman and andrew cripps.
From 27 May 2009 onwards richard Farr joined the committee following his appointment as a non-executive Director.
all members of the committee are considered to be independent non-executive Directors.
charles Wilson, chief executive, attends committee meetings by invitation.
Details of attendance at committee meetings are set out on page 12.
Role of the Committee the committee advises the Board and makes recommendations to it about all elements of the remuneration packages of the executive Directors including remuneration, incentives and other benefits.
It also recommends the terms of service contracts with executive Directors and any compensation arrangements resulting from the termination by the company of an executive Directors service contract.
the committee also makes recommendations concerning the grant of shares and share options.
the committees responsibilities are set out in its terms of reference, which are published on the Groups website.
In determining remuneration, the committee consults where appropriate with the chief executive about its proposals.
no Director participates in discussions about his own remuneration.
no external consultants were engaged in relation to the design of remuneration packages during the year.
When setting its remuneration policy, the committee gives due consideration to the provisions and principles of the code.
Remuneration policy the company wishes to attract, retain and motivate executive Directors and senior management of the requisite quality.
accordingly, its policy, in a competitive market, is to design remuneration packages which, through an appropriate combination of basic salary and bonus, reward executive Directors and senior management fairly for their individual contribution.
In determining remuneration, consideration is given to reward levels throughout the organisation as well as in the external employment market.
the committees overall policy is to provide competitive and potentially rewarding remuneration packages.
the committee, having reviewed the equity incentives it had in place, established in July 2008 a savings-related share option scheme the saYe, as approved by HM revenue & customs, which was offered to all employees within the Group, and a performance share plan the psp also in July 2008, which was extended on a discretionary basis to certain employees only.
certain information relating to the saYe and psp were set out in the remuneration report contained in the companys 2008 annual report and accounts which was approved by shareholders at the companys annual General Meeting in 2008. under the psp, employees selected to participate are entitled to acquire ordinary shares for no payment at the end of a vesting period which will normally be 2 to 3 years.
the company has made awards under the psp in relation to a total of 36 million new ordinary shares.
the Directors believe that the best indicator of performance of this company and its directors is its share price performance.
Vesting is subject to continued employment and the requirement that the companys share price be equal to or exceed certain share price targets for 60 consecutive days ending on or before the relevant vesting date.
In certain circumstances, however, a proportion of awards may vest early.
as at the 26 March 2010, three of the four share price targets had been met.
consequently, half of the shares will vest in July 2010, with at least a further quarter vesting in July 2011, subject to continued employment at the dates of vesting.
Details of awards made to the executive Directors under these plans are set out later in this report.
options under the saYe are exercisable three years from the commencement of the relevant savings contract and not more than six months thereafter.
these incentive arrangements reward participants if shareholder value is created, thereby aligning the interests of executive Directors, senior management and employees with those of shareholders.
no psps were awarded to Directors during the year ended 26 March 2010.
