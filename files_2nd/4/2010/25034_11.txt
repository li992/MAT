The Board sets the strategy and policies for the management of these risks and delegates the management and monitoring of these risks As at 31 May 2010 to the Risk and Audit Committees.
Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents - 8 - 8 8 Financial risks arising from financial instruments are analysed into market, credit, concentration and liquidity risks, and these are discussed below.
Financial liabilities Redeemable preference shares - - 40 40 40 i Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
This is analysed into market price, currency and interest rate risk components.
The Groups market risk is managed on a group-wide basis and exposure to market risk at any point in time depends primarily on shortterm market conditions and the levels of client activity.
The Group does not take proprietary positions based on an expectation of market movements.
However, not all net client exposures are hedged and, as a result, the Group may have a residual net position in any of the financial or sport markets in which it offers products.
The Groups market risk policy incorporates a methodology for setting market position limits, consistent with the Groups risk appetite, for each financial market in which the Groups clients can trade, as well as certain markets which the Board consider to be correlated.
These limits are determined based on the Groups clients trading levels, volatilities and the market liquidity of the underlying financial product or asset class and represent the maximum long and short client exposure that the Group will hold without hedging the net client exposure.
The Groups real-time market position monitoring system allows it to continually monitor its market exposure against these limits.
If exposures exceed these limits, the Groups market risk policy requires that sufficient hedging is undertaken to bring the exposure back within the defined limit.
There is a significant level of natural hedging arising from the Groups global client base pursuing varying trading strategies which results in a significant portfolio hedging effect.
This effect reduces the Groups net market exposure prior to the Group hedging any residual net client exposures, as well as minimising concentration risk within the market risk portfolio.
