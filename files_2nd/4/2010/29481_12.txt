iv For the 2010 annual bonus, Executive Directors could earn up to 80% of salary by reference to the Groups financial performance, largely based on growth in EEV operating profit and new business profit, by reference to objectives set by the Committee at the start of the year.
A further payment of up to 40% of salary could be earned by reference to the team performance of the Executive Directors, based on a number of financial and non-financial objectives set at the start of the year by the Committee.
The Committee met in January 2011 to review the performance of the Group and the executives against the objectives set at the start of the year.
As regards the elements of the annual bonus based on the financial objectives set by the Committee based on EEV operating profit and new business profit, the Committee awarded the maximum bonus of 80% of salary to the Executive Directors, given the substantial increases in both operating profit and new business profit in 2010, well in excess of the scale set by the Committee at the start of the year.
The Committee awarded a further payment of 35% of salary out of a possible 40% to each of the Executive Directors for the team performance element of the bonus, making a total bonus of 115% of salary out of a possible 120% of salary.
