The full remuneration report can be viewed on the corporate website, Following a review at the end of 2008 09 of the Companys remuneration arrangements against www.
co. uk annualreport10 the stated remuneration policy, and in light of the Companys performance, the Committee concluded that incentive pay needed to increase to enable the Company to pay its executives The members of the Remuneration Committee competitively.
However, taking into account the views of certain shareholders and representative are shown in the Corporate governance report bodies, and with support from the Companys Executive Directors, the Committee concluded that within the Annual report and financial statements the proposals were not appropriate to the wider external climate at that time and were withdrawn.
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee The Committee, however, remained clear that incentive pay needed to increase to enable the are Hewitt New Bridge Street on remuneration Company to pay its executives competitively where success was demonstrated.
Accordingly, matters, Pension Capital Strategies Limited in 2009 10, the Committee re-considered the position and decided that it is vital that the a member of the Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group Companys remuneration arrangements are positioned competitively the recruitment of a in respect of pensions, and Ashursts in respect new Chief Executive has re-emphasised how important this is to the business.
Therefore, the Committee has decided to: maintain Executive Director base salary levels: increase the maximum annual bonus potential for Executive Directors from 100% of base salary to 200% of base salary for 2010 11.
Bonus potential will also be increased for other less senior executives.
Reflecting the increased bonus potential, the bonus vesting schedule has been made more stretching: introduce bonus deferral, so that 50% of any bonus payable to Executive Directors is deferred in shares for three years: and increase the level of Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP awards for Executive Directors with the exception of the incoming Chief Executive for 2010 11 from 200% of salary to 240% of salary.
The incoming Chief Executive will receive an LTIP award equal to 275% of salary.
These award levels are within the individual limit of 300% of salary contained in the LTIP rules.
As a result of these changes, the Executive Directors ongoing total remuneration, with base salary at current levels and a greater focus on performance-related elements, will be consistent with the stated remuneration policy in the Summary Directors remuneration report which follows and will be broadly comparable to the packages provided by the Companys key competitors.
The Committee considers that this is critical to the Groups future success and the recruitment and retention of key individuals.
During the year, the Committee has also had to deal with the change of Chief Executive.
Details of the termination arrangements for Marc Bolland, and Dalton Philips ongoing remuneration package from appointment on 1 March 2010 which is consistent with the revised Executive Director remuneration policy and share awards required to facilitate his recruitment, are set out in the Summary Directors remuneration report which follows.
Following Marc Bollands resignation the Remuneration Committee considered that it was responsible and commercially appropriate to secure the services of Richard Pennycook and Mark Gunter.
The Committee, therefore, very quickly took certain steps to this end and agreed to an additional LTIP award of 100% of salary to these two individuals, in addition to the 200% of salary award already received in 2009 10 and within the 300% of salary annual limit contained in the LTIP rules.
More details of all of these changes are set out in the Summary Directors remuneration report which follows.
