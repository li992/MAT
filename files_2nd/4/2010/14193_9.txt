Unaudited information Dear Shareholder On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committees Report for 2010 for which we will be seeking approval from shareholders at our AGM in April 2011.
Since my appointment as Chair of the Remuneration Committee, I have taken time to look at the effectiveness of our current arrangements and also to meet with our largest shareholders to gauge their views on our approach to remuneration.
I am comfortable that the current arrangements continue to appropriately reward our high performing management team for delivering strong performance and shareholder value.
The Remuneration Committee and management believe that the long-term incentive arrangements approved at last years AGM are working well within the business and delivering increased alignment to Shires strategic goals.
I am grateful to all my fellow Remuneration Committee members for their commitment and global perspectives in the discussions we have had on a wide variety of key issues ensuring that the right outcomes have been achieved for both our senior management and our shareholders.
As highlighted in the Chairmans review on pages 2 and 3 the pharmaceutical industry has faced a tough operating environment in 2010, yet Shire has seen another year of excellent performance and achievement of 28% growth in operating income.
Our approach to growth has continued to be through internationalization, acquisition and continuing focus on our niche markets.
Value to our patients remains paramount as our best-in-class products focus on meeting the needs in our markets.
Our strong performance is reflected in our remuneration outcomes for the year in terms of both our annual bonus achieved for 2010 and long-term performance award: the vesting of the 2008 Portfolio Share Plan award at 88% reflects our strong total shareholder return over the last three years.
Our committed management team continues to work together to deliver our innovative, forward thinking business model for which Shire is well respected.

The Committee aims to maintain an appropriate balance between fixed ii EAIP and performance-related remuneration and between elements linked The Executive Directors and Leadership Team participate in an EAIP, to short-term financial performance and long-term shareholder value which rewards individuals with a bonus based on achievement of creation.
The EAIP and LTIP are considered performance-related pre-defined, Committee-approved corporate objectives and the elements, while base salary is essentially fixed, although performance individuals contributions toward achieving those objectives.
All other is considered when determining annual increases.
Assuming on-target non-sales employees participate in an Annual Incentive Plan AIP : performance, the CEOs remuneration for 2011 is 28% fixed and 72% the two programs are essentially the same with the exception that the variable, and the CFOs remuneration is 33% fixed and 67% variable.

The scorecard is cascaded to each business and corporate function to ensure alignment with corporate goals.
Individual goals are also set to align with the Corporate Scorecard and the individuals business function scorecard.
EAIP and AIP awards are determined by the Committee based on the CFO level of achievement across all key performance measures, ensuring that both financial and non financial results are considered.

The bonus pool is determined by calculating the sum of all employees annual incentive targets multiplied by the corporate bonus modifier.
The Committee determines the corporate bonus modifier based on its assessment of the achievement of the scorecard goals in the first quarter of the year following the performance year.
The same bonus modifier is used throughout the Group for all bonus-eligible employees.
The maximum bonus modifier is 200% of target.
EAIP awards are paid in cash 75% and Ordinary Shares or American Depositary Shares ADS 25%.
The cash element is paid in the first quarter of the year following the performance year, and the sharebased element is deferred and released on the third anniversary of the date of the award and is not subject to further performance conditions.
However, the release of the shares is subject to the participants employment not being terminated for cause.
Dividends are not paid on the shares during the three-year period, unless determined by the Committee at the date of the award.
No dividend was paid on the EAIP awards granted in 2010.
To align with the Groups approach for other share-based plans, the Committee approved the payment of accumulated dividends on shares deferred in 2011.

The performance criteria were reviewed in 2002 to ensure the criteria reflected the market in which Shire operates.
Given Shires development, it was considered appropriate that an earnings per share-based measure should be adopted in place of share price growth targets.
The performance criteria are based on real growth in the diluted earnings per share reported in Shires Form 10-K under US GAAP, adjusted to ensure a consistent basis of measurement, as approved by the Committee, including the add back of significant one-time items Option EPS.
Therefore, the performance criteria were amended so that an option would become exercisable in full if Shire plcs Option EPS growth over a three-year period from the date of award exceeds the UK Retail Prices Index RPI for the following tranches of grants: Options with a grant value of up to 100% of salary RPI plus 9% Directors, RPI plus 15% Between 101% and 200% of salary RPI plus 15% Between 201% and 300% of salary RPI plus 21% Over 301% of salary RPI plus 27% The RPI-based earnings per share performance criteria applied to options granted under the 2000 Executive Scheme from August 2002.
After consultation with certain institutional shareholders, Shire decided that, for options granted under the scheme from 2004 onwards, the performance condition will be retested once only, at five years after the grant, if Shires Option EPS growth falls short of the minimum annual average percentage increase over the three-year period from grant.
Hence the level of Option EPS growth in the next two years needs to be consequentially higher to meet the test.
In December 2006 the Committee exercised its powers to amend the performance conditions for options granted under the 2000 Executive Scheme which had not vested.
The RPI based growth rate was replaced with an equivalent fixed growth rate based on historical and forecast inflation.
Under Part B of the scheme, six weeks prior to the expiration date, any options that have not become exercisable at an earlier date, automatically vest without reference to the performance criteria.
2 Options granted under the Sharesave scheme are granted with an exercise price equal to 80% of the mid-market price on the day before invitations are issued to employees.
Employees may enter into three or five-year savings contracts.
3 No options were granted under the Executive Scheme or the 2000 Executive Scheme in 2010.
