30 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 Report on Directors remuneration for the 53 week period ended 31 December 2010 This report sets out the remuneration policy operated by the Group in respect of the Executive Directors, together with disclosures on all Directors remuneration.
The auditors are required to report on the auditable part of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The Board has reviewed the Groups compliance with the 2008 Combined Code the Code on remuneration related matters and has followed the Code in the preparation of the report of the Remuneration Committee.
It is the opinion of the Board that the Group complied with all remuneration related aspects of the Code during the period.
Unaudited information The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing policy on remuneration for Executive Directors and senior management and for determining specific remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors.
Bill Forrester chairs the Remuneration Committee and its other members are the independent NonExecutive Directors: James Newman, Ishbel Macpherson and Alan McWalter.
The Code requires that a Group of the size of Dignity plc has a Remuneration Committee comprising a minimum of three nonexecutives.
The Remuneration Committee members have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interests arising from cross directorships and no daytoday involvement in running the business.
The Chairman and the Chief Executive attend the Remuneration Committee by invitation or when required and the Company Secretary, who is also the Corporate Services Director, attends meetings when required as Secretary to the Remuneration Committee.
No Executive Director takes part in discussions relating to their own remuneration and benefits.
The Remuneration Committee is formally constituted with written terms of reference.
A copy of the terms of reference is available for inspection on the Groups investor website www.
The Committee met six times during 2010.
At those meetings basic salaries of Executive Directors and senior managers were reviewed, the targets and quantum of annual performance related bonuses for Directors were also agreed, as were options granted under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The meetings also approved the payment of the 2009 performance related bonus and the vesting of the shares awarded under the LTIP scheme in 2007.
A further meeting was also held in March 2011 to approve the payment of the performance related bonus for 2010, LTIP awards and bonus targets for 2011.
In 2008, the Committee retained the external benefit consultants, Hewitt New Bridge Street, to complete a review of the Executive Directors remuneration.
In discussions with the Committee, and in consultation with Hewitt New Bridge Street, it was decided that a Comparator Group would be defined consisting of all companies in the Consumer Goods and Consumer Services Sector of the FTSE 250 filtered to exclude companies deriving more than 50 per cent of their turnover from overseas or having a market capitalisation in excess of 1.4 billion at that time.
This gave a group of 32 companies with an average market capitalisation of 628 million at November 2008 as the Comparator Group.
At that date Dignity had a market capitalisation of 473 million and an enterprise value including net debt of 710 million.
The bottom half of the FTSE 250 was also used as a reference point for the benchmarking process.
The Committee continue to believe that the use of this Comparator Group is the most appropriate way of reviewing and setting Executive Directors salaries.
Remuneration policy The objective of the remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages to each Executive Director that will: Align rewards with the interests of shareholders: Motivate and encourage superior performance: Allow the Group to retain the talent needed to execute its business strategy: and Enable the Group to be competitive when recruiting appropriately skilled and experienced management.
The Remuneration Committee believes that this policy will retain and develop further the Groups entrepreneurial culture, whilst also focusing executive remuneration on performance which the Committee believes will best serve shareholders interests.
It is therefore the aim of the Remuneration Committee to encourage and reward superior performance by Executive Directors with that performance being based on strong financial performance and returns to shareholders.
This is achieved by weighting the overall remuneration package towards achievement of that performance.
Only 31 per cent of each Executive Directors total potential remuneration package ignoring benefits and pension contributions is accounted for by basic salary, assuming a full annual bonus is achieved and a maximum conditional award under the LTIP is made.
The Remuneration Committee will continue to review all aspects of the policy on an annual basis to ensure that rewards continue to be in line with the Groups objectives and shareholders interests.
31 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 Basic salary When determining the basic salary of the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration: The levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills, in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity: The performance of the individual Executive Director: The individual Executive Directors experience and responsibilities: and Pay and conditions throughout the Group.
No changes were made to their basic salaries during the period.
With the exception of Steve Whittern the salary review for 2011 was set at 2 per cent by the Remuneration Committee.
Steve Whittern received a pay review of 54,000 36 per cent recognising his increasing experience in the role of Finance Director following his appointment at the start of 2009.
Salaries effective from 1 January 2011 are: 2010 2011 Name 000 000 Mike McCollum 440 449 Andrew Davies 250 255 Richard Portman 200 204 Steve Whittern 150 204 Total 1,040 1,112 Annual performance related bonus The targets for the year, which are based on the achievement of set earnings per share targets, are reviewed and set annually by the Committee to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and remain challenging.
They are ratified by the full Board.
The targets are designed to enhance shareholder value.
The maximum bonus attainable for 2010 by Executive Directors was 100 per cent of basic salary.
A bonus of 70 per cent is attainable for meeting the first earnings per share target set by the Committee and a further bonus of 30 per cent may be earned by achieving a second and more demanding earnings per share target.
The increase in underlying earnings per share during the period was 15 per cent and the bonus percentage earned by the Executive Directors in the period was 100 per cent.
No other bonuses of any description were paid in the period to Executive Directors.
No changes have been proposed to the Annual Performance Related Bonus for 2011 and there were no departures from this policy in the current period.
This will continue to be based on demanding earnings per share targets with a maximum bonus equal to 100 per cent of base salary.
Share incentives Shareholders approved the current discretionary share incentive plan, the LTIP, on 5 June 2009.
If existing LTIPs were to be amended or if there was a new LTIP Scheme, approval would be sought from the shareholders.
The Committee is currently reviewing the performance conditions for future LTIP awards.
All Executive Directors and other employees are entitled to be considered for the grant of conditional share awards under the LTIP.
Under the rules, the maximum annual award that can be made to an individual is 125 per cent of salary.
All four Executive Directors serving at the start of the year, were granted conditional share awards during 2010 equivalent to the maximum award.
The Committee deemed this award appropriate, as in previous years, mindful of the need to encourage superior performance from the Executive Directors and ensure that a significant proportion of their total remuneration is linked to the performance of the Group.
This award is in addition to those made in 2004 through to 2010.
Steve Whittern received awards of 4,000 shares in each of the years in 2007 and 2008, prior to his appointment to the Board on 29 December 2008.
Total awards made to the Executive Directors under the scheme are shown on page 35.
Eligible Executives are awarded rights, in the form of nil cost conditional share awards, to acquire a maximum number of shares at the beginning of a three year period, the proportion of which they will be entitled to receive at the end of that period depending on the extent to which the performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the time the allocation is made, are satisfied.
The Remuneration Committee selected comparative Total Shareholder Return TSR as the performance condition for LTIP awards as it ensures that the Group outperforms the FTSE 350 Index over the measurement period in delivering shareholder value, before participants are entitled to receive any of their awards.
The constituent companies of the FTSE 350 Index, at the time the awards are made, are selected as a benchmark as there are no directly comparable quoted companies in the United Kingdom and as Dignity is a constituent of the FTSE 350 this is a valid benchmark.
The Remuneration Committee will calculate the TSR in accordance with the rules of the scheme and ratify the calculation prior to the release of any award.
Performance conditions under the LTIP are not subject to retesting.
32 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 Report on Directors remuneration continued for the 53 week period ended 31 December 2010 The percentage of the conditional share awards made up to and including the awards in 2009 are exercisable on vesting as follows: Ranked in the top quintile: 100 per cent of the total award: Ranked at median: 40 per cent of the total award: Ranked below median: zero: and Ranked between median and top quintile: straightline apportionment.
The percentage of the conditional share awards exercisable on vesting from the 2010 awards and onwards is calculated as follows: Ranked in the top quartile: 100 per cent of the total award: Ranked at median: 25 per cent of the total award: Ranked below median: zero: and Ranked between median and top quartile: straightline apportionment.
In addition and irrespective of the TSR performance target, no award will vest unless, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the underlying financial performance of the Group has been satisfactory over the measurement period.
The graph shows the Groups TSR compared to the FTSE 350.
This gives a broad indication of the likelihood of any conditional award vesting.
6 Year Total Shareholder Return 300% 250% 200% 150% 100% 50% 0% Dignity plc FTSE 350 Index On 27 March 2010 the conditional share awards made in 2007 under the LTIP became capable of vesting.
The TSR of the Group over the measurement period was compared to that of the constituent companies of the FTSE 350 at the time the awards were made.
The performance of the Group was found to be above median but below upper quintile such that 62.68 per cent of the shares were capable of vesting.
On that basis the Remuneration Committee, mindful also of the continued strong performance of the Group, recommended that 62.68 per cent of shares vest.
Shares were issued to Peter Hindley, Mike McCollum and Andrew Davies on 29 March 2010 and sold in their entirety on 31 March 2010 by the Groups brokers.
On the same day 16,116 shares were issued to Richard Portman who sold 7,885 shares on 31 March 2010 and Steve Whittern was issued with 2,507 shares and sold 1,227 shares on 31 March 2010.
Both sales were completed by the Groups brokers.
The total conditional awards held by each Director are shown on page 35 in the section of the Remuneration Committees Report that is subject to audit.
In accordance with the ABI guidelines, the Group can issue a maximum of 10 per cent of its issued share capital in a rolling ten year period to employees under all share plans.
In addition, of this 10 per cent, the Company can only issue 5 per cent to satisfy awards under discretionary or executive plans.
At the period end, conditional awards under the LTIP Scheme to Executive Directors and senior managers amount to 1.38 per cent of the current issued share capital.
If the awards in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, that have vested, are included, that percentage is 3.15 per cent.
The total, including SAYE options granted in both the 2004, 2007 and 2010 Schemes, is 5.25 per cent.
Pensions Mike McCollum and Richard Portman are members of the Groups pension scheme into which the Group contributed 10.5 per cent of salary details are set out within the audited section of this report on page 34.
The Group makes no pension contributions for Andrew Davies or Steve Whittern.
No NonExecutive Directors receive any pension contributions.

All Executive Directors received all of their benefits in kind.
NonExecutive Directors fees The Board determines the fees of the NonExecutive Directors.
It is based upon recommendations from the Chairman and Chief Executive or, in the case of the Chairman, based on recommendations from the Remuneration Committee and the Chief Executive.
The level of fees of the NonExecutive Directors reflects the time commitment and responsibility of their respective roles.
Their fees are set by reference to the constituent companies of the bottom half of the FTSE 250.
Service contracts Details of the service contracts with all Executive Directors and letters of appointment with NonExecutive Directors are as follows: Unexpired term of contract Name Contract date Notice period or letter of approval Mike McCollum 1 April 2004 12 months Rolling Contract Andrew Davies 1 April 2004 12 months Rolling Contract Richard Portman 1 November 2006 12 months Rolling Contract Steve Whittern 1 January 2009 12 months Rolling Contract Peter Hindley 7 December 2010 3 months 36 months James Newman 31 March 2010 3 months 15 months Bill Forrester 31 March 2010 3 months 15 months Ishbel Macpherson 7 December 2010 3 months 24 months Alan McWalter 7 December 2010 3 months 24 months There are no special provisions in service contracts of employees or Directors relating to cessation of employment or change of control.
The policy on termination is that the Group does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations, which do not include any payment from the takeover or liquidation of the Group.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee ensures that there have been no unjustified payments for failure.
The contracts of the Non Executive Directors, Ishbel Macpherson and Alan McWalter were renewed for a further two years in December 2010.
The contract of the Chairman, Peter Hindley, was also renewed for a three year period, rather than two, to provide additional continuity to the Board.
Under the Companys Articles of Association, one third of the Directors are required to submit themselves for re election every year.
This requirement will be superseded by the requirements of the 2010 Code from January 2011 which specifies that all Directors offer themselves for reelection each year.
In accordance with the terms of the 2010 Code all Directors will submit themselves for reelection at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting in June 2011.
No Executive Directors hold a Non Executive position with any other company.
However, the Group allows one such appointment per Executive Director, for which they can retain the fees.
