REMUNERATION REPORT 48 Michael Page International REMUNERATION REPORT REMUNERATION REPORT DEAR SHAREHOLDER As the new Chairman of Michael Pages Remuneration Committee I am pleased to present the Committees Remuneration Report for 2010 for which we will be seeking approval from shareholders at our AGM in May.
Following my appointment, the Remuneration Committee has started to undertake a review of the Companys current remuneration arrangements to ensure that they remain appropriate in the current environment and are well aligned with the business strategy and creation of shareholder value.
It is intended that a revised remuneration structure will be developed during 2011, to be implemented in 2012.
In doing so, the Remuneration Committee has established a number of key principles which it intends will form the basis of the revised remuneration structure.
These key principles have been outlined below.
Business context Following a very challenging year in 2009, with signi cant fall in demand in our key markets, the Company took a number of actions to reduce its cost base, whilst retaining the existing platform of business disciplines in established countries and cities, and cautiously invested for the future.
Economic recovery remained uncertain during 2010, and as such we have continued to operate in a dif cult environment.
However, as a result of the actions taken over the last two years the Company has continued to perform strongly, delivering an operating pro t of 71.5m more than three times reported pro t for 2009 and delivering signi cant value to shareholders with a 50% increase in share price during 2010.
The Committees intention is that the future remuneration structure will support the Companys continued growth over both the medium and longer term whilst becoming further aligned with the interests of shareholders.
Principles of the review The current remuneration structure was established when Michael Page was appreciably smaller.
It has served the business well in some respects, being strongly aligned to pro t and based on a simple and transparent structure.
However, shareholder representative bodies have expressed concerns about the structure of the arrangements and that some of the share elements of the package are not based on longer term performance.
As economic volatility continues, the Board is also concerned that the current highly geared package is signi cantly more volatile than the underlying business, which may reduce the ability to retain the strong management team.
This management continuity is critical for a business which has built its success on organic growth and promotion from within.
The principles we intend to apply to our review of remuneration are: Moderate the volatility in remuneration arrangements so they are more in line with business performance: Encourage active investment in Company shares linked to performance: Establish longer term incentives less dependent on short-term performance.
The intention is that the revised structure will take due account of the relevant guidelines regarding remuneration policy published by the ABI and other representatives of institutional shareholders.
