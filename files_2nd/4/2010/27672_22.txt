Old Mutual plc 153 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED The Management Remuneration Committee MRC The MRC oversees governance of executive remuneration at the tiers immediately below director and Group Executive Committee level, provided such executives fall outside the designated group of employees reviewed individually under the Committees terms of reference.
The MRC reviews and approves, as appropriate, remuneration arrangements and pay review decisions recommended by subsidiary remuneration committees.
It is chaired by the Group Chief Executive and includes the Group Finance Director and two other members of the Group Executive Committee.
It is supported by Group HR, which supplies supporting materials and analysis in a similar format to those supplied to the Committee.
All minutes of MRC meetings are noted at the Committee and the MRC can escalate matters for decision by the Committee as appropriate.
The MRC has adopted the following detailed remuneration policies to ensure that the policies agreed by the Committee are properly implemented at the Groups main subsidiaries: Q Remuneration must be viewed in conjunction with wider people-management practices to support a consistent approach to achieving desired culture and behaviour: Q Remuneration must support the business drivers, corporate vision, strategy and strategic priorities: Q Incentives should align the interests of employees with shareholders: Q Incentives should be performance-related and effectively linked to success in delivering the chosen strategy: Q Pay should be set at levels that are both competitive and sustainably affordable: Q Remuneration should not encourage risk that exceeds the Companys risk tolerance: Q All pay must be compliant with local legislation: and Q Underperformance should be dealt with formally according to local policies.
Terms of engagement of the executive directors The terms of engagement of the executive directors are considered by the Committee to provide a proper balance of responsibilities and security between the parties.
The following is a summary of the main provisions: Provision Service contract Contract dates Q Julian Roberts 23 January 2009 Q Philip Broadley 10 November 2008 Retirement Age Q 65 Date current appointment terminates Q Julian Roberts 7 June 2022 Q Philip Broadley 31 January 2026 Notice Period Q 12 months by either the Company or the director Compensation for loss of ofce Q Tailored to reect the Companys contractual obligations and the obligation on the part of the employee to mitigate loss Compensation payable on early termination Q No contractual provision Remuneration Q Salary Q Cash benefit allowance Q Short-term incentive 50% cash and 50% deferred into Company shares Q Long-term incentive Q Other benets Life cover of 1,000,000 and disability cover capped at 140,000 per annum The retirement age provision is in the process of being removed from the service contracts of the executive directors to reect the removal of the default retirement age under UK law with effect from 1 October 2011.
Alignment with strategy and shareholders The graph on the next page shows the total shareholder return to 31 December 2010 on 100 invested in shares in Old Mutual plc on 31 December 2005 compared with 100 invested in the FTSE100 Index.
The other points are the comparative returns at the intervening financial year ends.
In the opinion of the directors, the FTSE100 Index is the most appropriate index against which to measure the Companys total shareholder return, as it is an index of which Old Mutual plc is a member and is located where the Company has its primary listing.
In reviewing performance, the Committee also considers a variety of other sector-specic comparators.

These are the guiding principles that the Committee has applied during 2010 and intends to apply during 2011: Q To take account of appropriate benchmarks, while using such comparisons with caution and recognising the risk of an upward ratchet of remuneration levels with no corresponding improvement in performance.
Members of the UK FTSE100 Index provide the benchmark for UK-based executive directors, with particular reference to subsets of that data within the financial sector and by market capitalisation: Q To be sensitive in determining, reviewing, monitoring and approving matters under its remit in relation to pay and employment conditions around the Group, where relevant: Q To make a significant percentage of total maximum potential rewards in the form of share-based incentives in order to align the executive directors interests closely with those of shareholders: Q To provide an opportunity for remuneration packages to be in the upper quartile of the comparator group through payments under short-term and long-term incentive schemes if superior performance is delivered: Q To focus attention on the main drivers of shareholder value by linking performance-related remuneration to clearly dened objectives and measurable targets: and Q To design remuneration arrangements that will attract, retain and motivate individuals of the exceptional calibre needed to lead the Groups development.
The Committee has regard to risk-related metrics in reviewing the executive directors short-term performance and it received and considered a report from the Group Risk and Actuarial Director, which had been approved by the Board Risk Committee, in evaluating the short-term performance outcome for 2010.
It also has discretion to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance ESG issues when setting their remuneration.
It aims to ensure that the incentive structures for executive directors do not raise ESG risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
It ensures regulatory requirements relating to remuneration matters are met and that remuneration policies are consistent with, and promote, effective risk management.
The Committees policy is inuenced by the need to be competitive with other international financial services groups, while avoiding any excess.
This includes its approach to setting the xed elements of remuneration at or below appropriate median levels.
It reviews this policy regularly and continues to consider it to be appropriate.
Old Mutual plc 155 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Executive directors remuneration during 2010 The Committee reviews the structure of the executive directors remuneration packages annually to satisfy itself that the balance between xed and variable remuneration and short-term and long-term incentives and rewards remains appropriate.
The overall make-up of the remuneration packages for the executive directors in 2010 was as follows: Julian Roberts, Group Chief Executive Element Quantum Additional information Basic salary 830,000 Paid monthly in cash.
Reviewed with effect from 1 January each year, taking into account market benchmarks.
benefit allowance 280,640 Paid monthly in cash 35% of basic salary less pension contributions.
Pension contribution 9,860 Paid in lieu of a monthly cash payment under the benefit allowance now ceased.
Short-term incentive 1,220,100 147% of a maximum of 150% of basic salary, to be paid half in cash and half deferred for three years under the Old Mutual plc Share Reward Plan.
The short-term incentive for 2010 was based on achievement of Group financial targets, as well as delivery of individually agreed objectives.
Long-term incentive 1,660,000 Annualised expected value of the 2010 award after discounting by 40% for the impact of performance targets, as described in the section of this report titled Performance targets applicable to share incentives.
This includes the value of one third of the one-off award granted under the OMSIP in 2010.
Other benets 1,933 Life cover of 1,000,000 and disability cover capped at 140,000 a year.
Restricted share release 110,473, based on the market On 30 March 2010, Julian Roberts received a release of 90,812 shares value of the shares at date of held under the deferred short-term incentive restricted share award release originally granted in 2007.

Long-term incentive 1,100,000 Annualised expected value of the 2010 award after discounting by 40% for the impact of performance targets, as described in the section of this report titled Performance targets applicable to share incentives.
The following diagrams show the breakdown of the executive directors total remuneration arrangements during 2010 excluding restricted share award releases : 1 SPHU 9VILY[Z 7OPSPW YVHKSL` Q Q Q Q Q HZPJ ZHSHY` LULMP[Z HZO ::0 LMLYYLK ::0 3:07 156 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Management statements Business review Risk and Responsibility Governance Financials Shareholder information Short-term incentive targets for performance year 2010 The payment of short-term incentives is subject to the achievement of pre-determined financial targets and personal objectives based on the key deliverables for each executive director, as reviewed and approved each year by the Committee.
Details of the structure and outcomes of the metrics for Julian Roberts and Philip Broadleys short-term incentives for 2010 are set out in the following table: Julian Roberts Philip Broadley Potential Achieved Potential Achieved Group targets as % of salary 112.5 112.5 75 75 Personal targets as % of salary 37.5 34.5 75 66 Total as % of salary 150 147 150 141 000 incentive for period 1,245 1,220 825 775 Achieved incentive as % of maximum 98 94 Performance targets applicable to share incentives 2008 Share Options and Bonus-Matching Restricted Share Awards Target 1 Target 2 Target 3 For bonus-matching restricted share awards For tier 2 of share option awards between For tier 3 of share option awards above 200% and tier 1 of share option awards up to 100% 100% and 200% of base salary of base salary of base salary Growth in IFRS EPS must exceed growth in Growth in IFRS EPS must exceed growth in Growth in IFRS EPS must exceed growth in UK RPI by at least 9% over the three-year UK RPI by at least 12% over the three-year UK RPI by at least 15% over the three-year vesting period vesting period vesting period The IFRS EPS-based targets attached to the share options and the bonus-matching restricted share awards granted in 2008 were not met and the options and restricted share awards therefore lapsed on 8 March 2011.
2009 Bonus-Matching and Joining Restricted Share Awards One third of each award vests on attainment of the Return on Average Equity RoAE and real growth in adjusted operating profit IFRS earnings per share EPS targets at each tier as set out below, with pro-rata vesting between tiers, after tier one has been attained.
Targets are tested on a once-only basis after three years from the year prior to the grant and any award or part thereof that does not vest then lapses.
The targets are set out in the table below: RoAE Tier 1 Tier 2 Tier 3 RoAE required 10% 11% 12% EPS Growth Factor above UK RPI Stock Market growth Tier 1 Tier 2 Tier 3 50% 9% 12% 15% 0% 0% 3% 6% Growth will be calculated by the value of 100 invested as follows: Q 33.33 in the FTSE100 index average price over Q4 2008 Q 66.67 in the JSE ALSI index average price over Q4 2008 against the value of that investment in calculated by reference to the average price converted into, in the case of the JSE ALSI component, by reference to the average daily exchange rates for the period on the respective indices over Q4 2011.
The choice of criteria was intended to reect the principal stock markets with which the Groups results are substantially correlated.
2010 OMSIP OMSIP replaced the long-term incentive awards for the executive directors and certain other senior members of management in 2010, following its approval by shareholders at the 2010 AGM.
Old Mutual plc 157 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Accordingly, the 2010 OMSIP award was made in two parts.
The first part is based on rationalising objectives and the second on key financial objectives in relation to the restructuring of the Group.
The targets for these awards are set out below: Rationalising Objectives Component Objective Measurements significant Rationalise the Group by achieving strategic initiatives Based on Committee evaluation of the following three rationalising in accordance with the Groups strategy statement to factors: initiatives streamline the Group, unlock value and reduce debt 1.
Total value released relative to available benchmark transactions 2.
Quality of execution including risk, reputation and other non-financial impacts 3.
Amount available to reduce debt from the proceeds of rationalisation At the end of the three-year measurement period, the Committee will assess the sum of the evaluations of the individual initiatives when determining total achievement of this component and may exercise its discretion to reduce the vesting level of the award when factoring in total achievement toward debt reduction and any new information arising which suggests a different performance assessment.
The Committee believes that these measures provide a balanced approach to assessing the success of implementing the strategic plan, underlying financial performance of the future business, and delivery of shareholder value.
The Committee also believes that these measures give it the time and discretion to judge performance with the benefit of additional information emerging during the whole of the performance period.
Following the sale of the US Life business, which is currently expected to take place shortly after the date of this report, the Committee will carry out a full review and calculation of the impact of that transaction for the purposes of the related OMSIP rationalising objective and details of its conclusions will be disclosed in next years Remuneration Report.
Financial Objectives This part of the award relates to key financial goals of restructuring, split equally between the financial performance of the Companys Long-Term Savings business post-restructuring and absolute Total Shareholder Return TSR targets, as set out below: Long-Term Savings business 50% Cumulative Vesting growth in 1 2 3 % IFRS AOP Return on Equity Ratio of NCCF AUM Weighting 40% 40% 20% Below Threshold Nil Below 30% Below 15% Below 2% pa Threshold 20% 30% 15% 2% pa Threshold to Maximum |Interpolated| Maximum 100% 70% 18% 6% pa 1 Growth in Adjusted Operating profit AOP excluding Long-Term Investment Return on a constant currency basis over the three-year performance period 2 IFRS AOP over aggregate equity allocated to the Long-Term Savings business for 2012 3 The ratio of the Net Client Cash Flow NCCF over Assets under Management AUM will be calculated on a simple average basis over the full three years Absolute TSR 50% TSR will be measured on an absolute basis, 50% in Rand and 50% in, and will be averaged at the start Q4 2009 and end Q4 2012 of the three-year performance periods.
Old Mutuals TSR growth will then be compared with the vesting schedule set out below to determine the outcome: Absolute Vesting TSR growth percentage p. a.
Below threshold 0% Less than 10% Threshold 20% 10% Threshold to Maximum Interpolated 10% to 20% Maximum 100% 20% The Committee must be satisfied that the Companys TSR performance reasonably reects its underlying financial performance over the period.
Threshold performance is aligned with Old Mutuals cost of equity and the maximum is aligned with performance in excess of the historic upper quartile performance within the insurance sector.
158 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Management statements Business review Risk and Responsibility Governance Financials Shareholder information The Committee obtains external audit sign-off as part of its oversight procedures.
The Company undertakes the performance measurement for each specic award and obtains agreement to the calculations from KPMG Audit Plc.

2 Benets include cash allowances payable to the executive directors, as well as travel costs for directors spouses to accompany them to certain Board meetings or other corporate events of the Company and its major subsidiaries.
The amount of this expenditure is reported to and considered by the Committee, and procedures are in place for such costs to be authorised.
The Committee is satisfied that such expenditure is reasonable and in the interests of the Company.
3 The Company made pension contributions in lieu of an equivalent cash payment under Julian Roberts benefit allowance.
7 The prior-year comparative number as published in the Remuneration Report for 2009 was 4,722,000, which included 297,000 paid to the former Chairman, Chris Collins.
The executive directors were required to waive fees for non-executive directorships held in subsidiary companies totalling 30,400 during the year ended 31 December 2010 2009: 2,000 in favour of the Company or its subsidiaries.
These waivers are expected to remain in force in the future.
Old Mutual plc 159 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Executive directors remuneration in 2011 With effect from 1 January 2011, Julian Roberts basic salary was increased by 2.4%, from 830,000 to 850,000, and Philip Broadleys basic salary was increased by 2.7%, from 550,000 to 565,000.
This was in line with the expected inationary rise of 3% for senior executives of other companies in the FTSE100 index and compares with similar inationary increases for other employees across the Group, ranging from 3% for staff in the UK, Europe and the US to in excess of 5% in South Africa, in line with the local market.
Before making the decision on the increase for executive directors, the Committee reviewed the salary increases for the Group as set out above, and had regard to those increases.
The overall make-up of the remuneration packages of the executive directors for 2011 is as follows: Julian Roberts, Group Chief Executive Element Quantum Additional information Basic salary 850,000 p. a.
Paid either as contributions to agreed benets or monthly in cash 35% of basic salary.
Short-term incentive 1,275,000 Maximum of 150% of basic salary payable half in cash and half deferred maximum for three years under the Old Mutual plc Share Reward Plan.
The short-term incentive for 2011 will be based on the achievement of Group financial targets as well as delivery of individually agreed objectives.
Long-term incentive 1,275,000 Expected value of the maximum OMSIP award, after discounting by 40% for the impact of performance targets, as set out in the section of this report titled Performance targets applicable to share incentives.
Philip Broadley, Group Finance Director Element Quantum Additional information Basic salary 565,000 p. a.
Short-term incentive 847,500 Maximum of 150% of basic salary payable half in cash and half deferred maximum for three years under the Old Mutual plc Share Reward Plan.
Long-term incentive 847,500 Expected value of the maximum OMSIP award, after discounting by 40% for the impact of performance targets, as set out in the section of this report titled Performance targets applicable to share incentives.
Excludes annualised value of a one-off award granted under the OMSIP in 2010.
Short-term incentive targets for performance year 2011 The respective weightings attached to the Group metrics and personal objectives, shown as a percentage of basic salary, for the executive directors short-term incentives for 2011 are as follows: Julian Roberts Philip Broadley Metric Group % Group % IFRS earnings Adjusted Operating profit per share 56.25 37.5 Return on Equity 56.25 37.5 Subtotal 112.5 75 Personal objectives 37.5 75 In his role as Group Finance Director, Philip Broadley is responsible to the Board for all financial matters, including management control over the internal audit, group compliance and risk functions.
The financial elements of his annual incentive therefore have a lower weighting than line management executives as more emphasis is placed on personal objectives.
160 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Management statements Business review Risk and Responsibility Governance Financials Shareholder information 2011 OMSIP The awards to be made to the executive directors under the OMSIP in 2011 will have a face value of 250% of basic salary.
The awards will be subject to the achievement of key financial goals of restructuring, split equally between the financial performance of the Companys Long-Term Savings business post-restructuring and absolute TSR targets.
The basis for these targets was determined in 2010 as set out in the section of this report titled Performance targets applicable to share incentives, with the financial performance of the Companys Long-Term Savings business being measured over a three-year performance period between 2011 and 2013 and with TSR being measured on an absolute basis, 50% in Rand and 50% in, averaged at the start Q4 2010 and end Q4 2013 of the three-year performance period.

The Committee has reviewed the operation of the share incentive schemes, including how discretion is exercised and the grant levels currently applicable, and considers these to be appropriate to the Companys circumstances and prospects.
Employee Share Ownership Trusts The Group operates a number of Employee Share Ownership Trusts ESOTs through which it collateralises some of its obligations under employee share schemes.
At 31 December 2010, the following shares in the Company were held in ESOTs: Old Mutual plc shares held in Trust Country trust 1 Capital Growth Investment Trust Zimbabwe 1,414,930 2 Mutual & Federal Broad-Based Trust South Africa 248,267 2 Mutual & Federal Management Incentive Trust South Africa 26,045,139 2 Mutual & Federal Senior Black Management Trust South Africa 5,019,860 3 Mutual & Federal Namibia Broad-Based Trust Namibia 41,391 3 Mutual & Federal Namibia Management Incentive Trust Namibia 311,875 3 Mutual & Federal Namibia Senior Black Management Trust Namibia 173,221 4 Old Mutual plc Employee Share Trust Guernsey 31,469,665 5 OMN Broad-Based Employee Share Trust Namibia 904,223 5 OMN Management Incentive Trust Namibia 2,234,800 6 OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Trust South Africa 22,169,975 6 OMSA Management Incentive Trust South Africa 81,258,520 6 OMSA Share Trust South Africa 31,249,063 Total 202,540,929 1 The Capital Growth Investment Trust is used to satisfy restricted share awards or Deferred Delivery Shares in Zimbabwe under a locally run scheme.
Any surplus shares held in trust because of non-vesting are taken into account when purchasing shares in respect of future grants.
2 The Mutual & Federal Broad-Based Trust, the Mutual & Federal Management Incentive Trust and the Mutual & Federal Senior Black Management Trust were established during 2005 to subscribe for and hold shares in connection with its South African BEE ownership transactions.
The strategy has historically been to ensure that sufficient shares were acquired to match future obligations.
3 The Mutual & Federal Namibia Broad-Based Trust, the Mutual & Federal Namibia Management Incentive Trust and the Mutual & Federal Namibia Senior Black Management Trust were established during 2006 to subscribe for and hold shares in connection with its Namibian BEE ownership transactions.
4 The Old Mutual plc Employee Share Trust is used to satisfy awards under the RSP, SRP and PSP excluding South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe.
Its strategy is to hold shares approximately equal to the number of shares awarded, but not yet vested, at any time.
Any surplus shares held in trust because of non-vesting are taken into account when purchasing shares in respect of future awards.
5 The OMN Broad-Based Employee Share Trust and the OMN Management Incentive Trust were established during 2006 to subscribe for and hold shares in the Company in connection with its Namibian BEE ownership transactions.
The OMN Broad-Based Employee Share Trust holds shares for the purposes of the Namibian awards under both the OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Plan and the SBP, while the OMN Management Incentive Trust holds shares for Namibian awards under the MISP.
Awards to white employees in Namibia under the MISP are settled by the OMSA Share Trust.
6 The OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Trust and the OMSA Management Incentive Trust were established during 2005 to subscribe for and hold shares in the Company in connection with its South African BEE ownership transactions.
The OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Trust holds shares for the purposes of both the OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Plan and the SBP, while the OMSA Management Incentive Trust holds shares for the MISP.
Awards to white employees under the MISP and all awards that have been granted to South African and Namibian employees under the RSP and SOP are settled by the OMSA Share Trust.
The strategy has historically been to ensure that sufficient shares were acquired to match at least 90 percent of the obligations of each share incentive grant.
However, as a result of the requirements of the Companys BEE transactions in South Africa and Namibia, it was necessary to place shares allotted as part of the transactions in the relevant BEE employee share trusts immediately, in order to cover the total annual share grant allocations likely to be made to black participants in terms of the BEE transactions up to 2014 and 2016 respectively.
164 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Management statements Business review Risk and Responsibility Governance Financials Shareholder information The general practice of the ESOTs shown in the table above save for the BEE-related trusts is not to vote the shares held at shareholder meetings, although beneciaries of restricted shares may in principle give directions for those shares to be voted.
However, with respect to the OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Trust, the OMSA Management Incentive Trust, the OMN Broad-Based Employee Share Trust, the OMN Management Incentive Trust, the Mutual & Federal Management Incentive Trust, the Mutual & Federal Senior Black Management Trust, the Mutual & Federal Broad-Based Trust, the Mutual & Federal Namibia Management Incentive Trust, the Mutual & Federal Namibia Senior Black Management Trust and the Mutual & Federal Namibia Broad-Based Trust, the Trustees may, because of BEE considerations, vote any unallocated shares held in these trusts as well as those shares held in respect of any unexercised share options.
The beneciaries of any restricted shares allocated by these BEE employee share trusts are entitled to vote their relevant shares.
Options excluding nil-cost options granted under the SOP for employees outside South Africa and Namibia, Sharesave, SRP, PSP and SAYE are currently intended to be settled by the issue of new shares rather than using shares held in an ESOT.
Dilution limits For the purposes of calculating dilution limits, any awards that are satisfied by transfer of pre-existing issued shares such as shares acquired by market purchase through ESOTs and any shares comprised in any option that has lapsed are disregarded.
The Company has complied with these limits at all times.
At 31 December 2010, the Company had 2.41% of share capital available under the 5%-in-five-years limit applicable to discretionary share incentive schemes and 6.56% of share capital available under the 10%-in-10-years limit applicable to all share incentive schemes.
The issued share capital gures used for these calculations have not been reduced to reect shares bought back into treasury by the Company.
Listed subsidiarys share incentive schemes The Companys separately-listed subsidiary, Nedbank Group Limited, has its own share incentive schemes, which are under the control of the Remuneration Committee of its board and are not further addressed in this report.
Neither of the executive directors of the Company has any interest under any such subsidiary share incentive schemes.

3 Dividends are paid and the directors can vote the shares during the vesting period.
4 Awards are subject to a claw-back provision under which the Committee may reduce the number of shares under option or award if financial results or business performance for which the director is responsible is found to have been materially incorrect or misleading or if undue risk was taken, resulting in financial loss to the Company.

7 Nil-cost options under the PSP granted on 13 May 2010 were based on the closing middle-market price of the Companys shares on the London Stock Exchange on 12 May 2010, namely 119p.
8 Subject to the achievement of certain initiatives relating to the restructuring of the Group.
9 Subject to the fullment of performance targets prescribed by the Committee, under which 50% of the award would be subject to the financial performance of the Companys Long-Term Savings business post restructuring and 50% of the award would be subject to absolute total shareholder return.

The Companys share price at the date of grant 9 April 2009 was 63.3p.
Company share price performance The market price of the Companys shares was 123.1p at 31 December 2010 and ranged from a low of 97.3p to a high of 145.2p during 2010.
Executive directors shareholding requirements The Committee has established guidelines on shareholdings by the executive directors of the Company.
Under these, the Group Chief Executive is expected to build up a holding of shares in the Company equal in value to at least 150 percent of his annual basic salary within five years of appointment and the equivalent gure for other executive directors is 100 percent of their annual basic salary.
For the purposes of the calculations, unvested options and restricted share awards are excluded.
The following table shows Old Mutual plc shares held by the executive directors at 31 December 2010 including holdings by their connected persons compared to the shareholding requirements prescribed by these guidelines: Personal shares held at Minimum Personal 31 December number of shares held at 2010 as a Date by which shares required 31 December percentage of holding must be 1 to be held 2010 base salary achieved Julian Roberts 1,011,373 1,591,644 236% September 2013 Philip Broadley 446,791 55,353 12% November 2013 1 The minimum number of shares required to be held has been calculated using the market price of Old Mutual plc shares on 31 December 2010, namely 123.1p and the basic salaries of the executive directors at 31 December 2010.

However, it is envisaged that they will remain in place on a three-year cycle, in order to provide assurance to both the Company and the nonexecutive director concerned that the appointment is likely to continue.
