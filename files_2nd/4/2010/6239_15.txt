REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for making recommendations to the Board on the Groups remuneration policy for senior management Chief Executive Officer and other members of the Executive Committee, and for determining specific remuneration packages for senior management, including pension rights and any compensation packages, as well as remuneration of the Chairman within agreed terms of reference.
The Remuneration Committee consisted of the following Directors in the year ended 31 December 2010: lord Cairns chairman, Independent Non-executive Director Mr Fernando Ruiz, Independent Non-executive Director Mr Alberto Baillres, Chairman of the Board, non-independent at the time of his appointment The Board believes that Mr Baillres experience and knowledge of the Group and the Mexican market and his considerable contribution to the Remuneration Committees deliberations justifies his membership of the Remuneration Committee.
Terms of reference for the Remuneration Committee have been approved by the Board and are available for inspection on the Companys website at www.
The Remuneration Committee met twice during the year.
The Chief Executive Officer usually attends meetings of the Remuneration Committee at the invitation of its chairman and the Company Secretary acts as secretary to this committee.
No Director is present when his own remuneration is being discussed.
In October 2010, the Remuneration Committee undertook an evaluation of its performance.
REMUNERATION POLICY The Groups remuneration policy seeks to ensure that the Company is able to attract, retain, and motivate its executives and senior management.
The retention of key management and the alignment of management incentives with the creation of shareholder value are key objectives of this policy.
In setting the basic levels of pay for senior executives, the Remuneration Committee seeks to ensure that salaries are market competitive both within the Mexican context and in the international context for gold and silver producers.
Total compensation is set around the median level.
Salaries are benchmarked annually and total remuneration is benchmarked biennially.
Pensions and other benefits are also set at levels that are market competitive.
GROUP OVERVIEW STRATEGY PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIALS 101 The variable component of remuneration is embodied within the short-term incentive plan which is available to the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Operating Officer and the vice President of Exploration as well as other corporate managers.
The achievement of annual performance targets is rewarded through an annual performance related bonus.
The performance targets upon which bonuses are based include a mix of financial and operational performance measures.
In 2008, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the remuneration policy and recommended that the upper limit for short-term, cash-based remuneration incentives should be increased from a maximum of four months salary to a maximum of six months salary in future years.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the impact of this change in policy and is satisfied that it has helped to improve performance by senior management.
It is the Companys policy not to use its equity to incentivise long-term performance.
AdVISERS ANd BENCHMARkING Benchmarking information on pay and employment conditions is supplied annually to the Company by Mercer, Hay Group and Data Compensation.
The information provided is used across the Group in determining salaries for all employee grades including senior management.
This approach seeks to maintain consistency between Group executive and staff pay structures, and ensure that a competitive remuneration structure, compared to the Companys peer group within Mexico, is preserved.
Before agreeing the salaries for the senior executives in April 2010, the Remuneration Committee received a presentation from Mercer concerning approaches to executive remuneration in comparable countries where gold and or silver is mined, in order to validate the Companys policy towards short-term and longterm remuneration and in order to ensure that it was globally as well as locally competitive.
In Mexico, short-term, cash-based incentivisation is considered more appropriate in helping attract, retain and motivate quality senior management, thus supporting the Companys policy not to use its equity to incentivise long-term performance.
CHAIRMAN ANd NON-EXECUTIVE dIRECTORS The remuneration of the Chairman of the Company and the Non-executive Directors consists of fees that are paid quarterly in arrears.
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors do not participate in any long-term incentive or annual bonus schemes, nor do they accrue any pension entitlement.
Neither the Chairman nor any of the Non-executive Directors has a service contract with the Company: however each has entered into a letter of appointment with the Company.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES Fresnillo does not offer any share or cash-based long-term incentives to management.

The Remuneration Committee approved a number of Key Performance Indicators KPIs for each member of the Executive Committee, and KPI targets were set at which payments equivalent to 0% to 50% of annual salary could be earned.
