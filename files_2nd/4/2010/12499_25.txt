The other options listed above are executive options which are subject to the performance conditions described below.
The rules of the ESOS allow annual awards to be made, with a maximum grant equal to 100% of the individuals annual salary.
Exercise of options granted under the scheme is subject to a performance condition.
This condition is that the growth in the Companys adjusted EPS over the three consecutive financial years starting with the year of grant exceeds the growth in RPI over the same period by at least 9%.
At this level of performance half of the options granted are exercisable.
Exercise of all options granted requires that the Companys EPS growth exceeds RPI over the period by at least 15%, with a sliding scale for performance between 9% and 15%.
The rules of the scheme approved by shareholders in 2003 provided that, if the performance condition was not met over this three-year period, options could also be exercised if the Companys EPS growth exceeded RPI by a minimum of 12% over the four financial years starting with the year of grant.
The Committee decided to remove this re-testing provision with effect from 13 March 2006 and it does not apply to any options granted after that date.
Options granted under earlier schemes operated by the Company remain outstanding.
Executive options granted under such schemes after 13 March 2001 may not be exercised unless the growth in the Companys EPS over a period of three consecutive financial years exceeds the growth in RPI over the same period by at least 9%.
The Company has met the performance condition for options awarded up to and during January 2003 and for options awarded from March 2004 up to and during October 2006.
These options are now exercisable.
No price was paid for any option.
