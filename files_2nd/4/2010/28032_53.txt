34 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2010 The Board presents this Remuneration Report which has been prepared under the requirements of Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008.
An Ordinary Resolution for the approval of this Report will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting AGM.
The Companys Auditors are required to audit certain of the disclosures provided in this Report.
The Auditors opinion is included in their report on pages 36 and 37.
Remuneration Responsibilities The Board have resolved that a remuneration committee is not appropriate for a company of this size and nature.
Remuneration responsibilities are part of the Boards responsibilities, to be addressed regularly by the Board as a whole.
All Directors are non-executive and all participate in meetings of the Board at which Directors remuneration is considered.
The Board seeks advice, inter alia, from the Company Secretary, Invesco Asset Management Limited, when considering the level of Directors fees.
Policy on Directors Remuneration The Boards policy is that the remuneration of non-executive Directors should be fair and reasonable in relation to the time commitment and responsibilities of the Director.
It is intended that this policy will continue for the year ended 31 March 2011 and subsequent years.
During the year, the Board has reviewed Directors remuneration taking into consideration the increasing demands and accountability of the current corporate governance and regulatory environment.
They concluded that it was appropriate to increase Directors remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2011.
In order to recognise the additional workload that each Director has and will continue to experience, with effect from 1 April 2010, the remuneration of Chairman increased from 25,000 to 30,000, the Audit Chairman from 20,000 to 25,000 and the other Directors from 17,500 to 20,000.
Fees for the Directors are determined by the Board within the limits stated in the Companys Articles of Association.
As at 31 March 2010, the maximum dictated by the Companys Articles of Association was 150,000 in aggregate per annum.
At an EGM on 9 June 2010, the maximum fees were increased to 200,000 in aggregate per annum as a result of a change in the Companys Articles of Association.
The Directors are not eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share options or other incentives or benefits.
Directors Service Contracts All Directors have letters of appointment which are available for inspection at the Registered Office of the Company or on the Companys website.
Under the Articles of Association of the Company, the terms of the Directors appointments provide that a Director shall retire and be subject to election at the first AGM after appointment and re-election at least every three years thereafter.
The terms also provide that a Director may be removed from office without notice and that no compensation will be due on leaving office.
