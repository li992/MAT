Service contracts for all Executive Directors and letters of appointment for all Non Executive Directors are available for inspection as described in the Notice of 2011 Annual General Meeting.
Details of the Directors contracts are summarised in the table below: Notice period Notice period Normal Unexpired by Company by Director retirement Current Name Date of contract term months months months age age Pete Redfern 13 October 2004 12 12 12 60 40 Ryan Mangold 16 November 2010 12 12 12 65 39 Sheryl Palmer 4 August 2009 12 12 12 65 49 As mentioned earlier, all Directors will submit themselves for election or re-election, as appropriate, at the Annual General Meeting in accordance with the Governance Code.
It is the Companys policy that liquidated damages should not automatically apply on the termination of an Executive Directors contract.
In accordance with this approach, payment for early termination of contract without cause by the Company is to be determined, in the case of each of the Executive Directors, having regard to normal legal principles which require mitigation of liability on a case-by-case basis.
Any such payment would typically be determined by reference to the main elements of a Directors remuneration, namely: salary, bonus entitlement subject to Committee discretion as appropriate, benefits-in-kind and pension entitlements.
Phased payments will be considered by the Company where appropriate.
There are no change of control provisions that apply in relation to the service contract of any Executive Director.
Chairman and Non Executive Directors Neither the Chairman nor the Non Executive Directors have service contracts.

This was to reduce the potential overlap of the vesting of the 2009 and 2010 awards in 2013 due to the fact that the 2009 awards were effectively based on four year performance periods.
g Vesting will be 20% for both tranches of the 2010 award and also for the 2011 award 2009: 25% for threshold performance 50th percentile for TSR: 10% ROCE and 100% 2009: 100% for upper quartile performance 75th percentile for TSR: 20% ROCE with straight line vesting between these two thresholds.
h For awards made in 2009, the performance target is that ROCE is 10% or more for 25% of the award to vest or 20% or more for 100% of the award to vest, with straight-line vesting between the two thresholds.
There have been no variations to the terms and conditions or performance criteria for outstanding share options during the financialyear.
