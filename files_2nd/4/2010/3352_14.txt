Awards normally only vest on or after the third anniversary of the date of grant provided that the individual remains an employee of the Company and the performance conditions have been satisfied.
The Committee recognises that relative TSR aligns management reward with returns to investors, but considers that the introduction of an EPS-related element provides a good balance and a clear connection between financial performance and rewards.
Overall, the two measures provide a good balance between incentivising executives to improve financial performance and deliver above median stock market returns.
The Committee considers the EPS range for every award and the range for 2010 was set following consultation with the Companys major shareholders and independent advice received from the Companys brokers.
The range of targets for the 2010 awards was set at RPI plus an average of 6 per cent p. a. to RPI plus an average of 12 per cent p. a. which the Committee considers to be a demanding range.
The Committee intends to consult the Companys major shareholders in future if it considers it appropriate to alter the current 60:40 mix of the TSR and EPS elements of the performance condition.
The Committee has considered the EPS growth range to apply to the awards granted in 2011 and has concluded that the same RPI plus 6 per cent to 12 per cent p. a. range should apply.
In making this decision the Committee recognised that the 2010 EPS, from which the growth would be measured, was signicantly ahead of the 2009 EPS gure.
TSR calculations are carried out independently by HNBS by monitoring the percentage change in the Companys share price plus dividends reinvested over a period of time.
The chart below shows the performance of the Company relative to the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts index over the past five years.
The Company was a member of the FTSE 250 during the year.

In the opinion of the Directors, the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts is the most appropriate index against which the TSR of Charter should be measured because it is an index of similar-sized companies.
Share ownership guidelines The Executive Directors are encouraged to build and maintain a holding of 100 per cent worth of salary in shares in the Company via the retention of at least 50 per cent of the net gain on vested awards under the Companys share incentive schemes until the guideline has been achieved.

In respect of the service agreement of James Deeley, and for Directors appointed in the future, the Committee will look to apply the principles of mitigation following termination.
The normal retirement age of all the Executive Directors is 65.
CCSL has agreed tax equalisation arrangements with each Executive Director under which, if the amount of any remuneration paid by CCSL or any Associated Company to that Director is taxed in a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom, CCSL or the Director will make a balancing payment so that the amount received by the Director after tax in respect of that remuneration is the same as it would have been had he only been subject to United Kingdom tax in respect of it.
The Executive Directors entered into letters of appointment in respect of their duties as Directors of the Company on 22 October 2008.
Each appointment is subject to termination by either party giving the other party not less than one months notice in writing and automatically ceases if that Executive Director ceases to be an employee of CCSL.

It is standard practice for the Committee to consider the fees payable to the Chairman on an annual basis but the fees are not necessarily revised annually.
Similarly the Standing Committee considers the fees of the Non-Executive Directors on an annual basis.
The Remuneration Committee has considered the fee level payable to the Chairman and has concluded that this should be increased from 202,750 to 215,000 with effect from 1 March 2011.
This increase takes account of the increased scope and complexity of the role since the date of his fee being last reviewed in 2008.
The Chairman did not participate in the decisionmaking process of this review.
Tax equalisation arrangements have been in place for the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors since the time of the Corporate Head Ofce move to Ireland, with the exception of Manfred Wennemer, who is a German resident and was not previously on the board of the former Charter plc.

The accrued entitlement includes that earned by Robert Careless as an employee, prior to becoming a Director, as well as that earned for qualifying services after becoming a Director.
The pension entitlement shown in the first row is the aggregate amount which would be paid annually on normal retirement based on service to the end of 2010 under the approved scheme.
The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The transfer value of the accrued entitlement represents the value of assets that the pension schemes would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liabilities in respect of the Directors pension benets.
It does not represent sums payable to the individual Directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The transfer value of the increases in accrued benets, required by the Listing Rules, discloses the current value of the increase in accrued benets that the Director has earned in the period, whereas the change in its transfer value, required by the Companies Act, discloses the absolute increase or decrease in its transfer value and includes the change in value of the accrued benets that results from market volatility affecting the transfer value at the beginning of the period, as well as additional value earned in the year.

The value of the awards under the LTIP shows the number of the awards held multiplied by the market price of the Companys shares at 31 December 2010.
The assumption is that the maximum number of awards vested in accordance with the performance conditions described on pages 48 to 49.
It should be noted that the actual value may be less than the maximum, including zero if performance conditions are not met.

The share price on the dividend payment date of 7 May 2010 was 717.0 pence per share and the price on the dividend payment date of 10 September 2010 was 671.5 pence per share.
On 5 May 2010 Messrs Foster, Careless and Deeley exercised their awards under the LTIP granted on 22 March 2007.
The assessment of the TSR performance condition produced a vesting of 58.5 per cent of the original award.
Michael Foster sold 13,836 shares to meet the tax and NI liabilities and retained 13,467 shares.
Robert Careless sold 8,648 shares to meet the tax and NI liabilities and retained 8,416 shares.
James Deeley sold 6,918 shares to meet the tax and NI liabilities and retained 6,733 shares.
The market price on the date of exercise was 752.25 pence.
During the year, the range of share prices was 567.0 pence to 848.5 pence, with the price on 31 December 2010 being 844.5 pence.
The performance conditions applying to any of the above awards are as described on pages 48 to 49 except for the awards granted in 2008 and 2009 which are based exclusively on the TSR performance condition.
The accrued cost of Directors long-term incentive awards outstanding at 31 December 2010, calculated in accordance with IFRS 2 share-based payment was 1.7 million 2009: 1.4 million.
