Base salary The Committees policy is to position base salary for each director at the median level compared to market practice.
Base salaries are reviewed annually and are determined by taking into account the performance of the individuals, changes in their responsibilities and information from independent remuneration consultants on the levels of salary for similar jobs having regard to the size of the Company its turnover, market capitalisation and complexity.
The Committee also takes into account internal relativities and the total remuneration of the executives compared to the 35 market.
Base salary is the only element of remuneration which is pensionable.
In addition, benefits are provided to executive directors in accordance with market practice.
As a result of the Companys restructuring in 2006, the salaries for the CEO and CFO have been above the median of market practice and therefore outside the stated policy.
The Committee has been committed to aligning policy with practice and has made no increases since 2008.
In line with this stated policy and reflecting the current economic environment, executive director salaries were frozen for 2010.
For 2011, the Committee felt it appropriate to again freeze the CEOs salary and to grant a 5% increase to the CFO.
This delivers median positioning against the comparator group and reflects the increased scope of the role held by the CFO over 2010.

Incentive arrangements Annual bonus Annual bonuses payable to executive directors in respect of 2010 comprised two elements.
The first element related to pre-exceptional profit before tax PBT, and the second element related to cash flow performance over the year.
The maximum annual bonus a participant can receive under the combined elements is 200% of salary.
Any bonus earned over 100% of salary will be deferred into shares, with 50% of the deferred amount released after one year and 50% released after two years subject to continued employment.
Directors remuneration report continued The PBT element of the bonus is determined on a profit share basis whereby an executive can earn a bonus based on a fixed percentage of the Companys PBT.
No bonus in respect of the PBT element is paid below a minimum acceptable risk-adjusted level of performance.
For 2010, the minimum level of performance was set at 40m being equivalent to a Return On Assets equal to at least the Weighted Average Cost of Capital return.
The following table shows the percentage Profit Share for the main board directors for 2010: Percentage Profit Share M Ingle M Robson Less than 80m 0.40% 0.26% Equal to or greater than 80m 0.52% 0.34% In respect of the cash flow element of the bonus, executives can earn up to 40% of salary based on achieving pre-determined cash flow targets.
15% of salary will be paid for achieving Threshold target with up to 40% of salary payable for achieving a maximum target, with payments determined on a straight-line basis between these points.
No bonus in respect of the cash flow element will be paid below Threshold.
Cash flow targets are assessed again at the end of February 2011 to ensure that cash flow levels have been maintained beyond the December 2010 year end.
Cash flow is defined as the difference between reported Net Debt at the end of the financial year and the beginning of the financial year.
A summary of the operation of the annual bonus plan for 2010 is shown below: 36 Deferred Shares Cash flow targets Any bonus earned over 100% up to 40% of salary of salary, up to 100% salary Annual bonus Profit Share Cash % of PBT up to 100% salary Performance measures Delivery mechanism The Groups performance against its financial targets, as it affected the payout of the bonus in respect of the performance year ending December 2010, is shown in the table below: Actual performance in 2010 Bonus as % of salary Key performance indicator M Ingle M Robson PBT 101m 98 95 Cash inflow 33m 40 40 Total bonus earned 138 135 Share Option Plan Portfolio Share Options With the support of some of our largest shareholders, the Committee decided to grant market value share options in 2010 with profit targets on a sliding vesting scale instead of using premium priced options with a profit underpin as per awards made in 2009.
The reason for the change was that premium priced options with an underpin could Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual report & accounts 2010 potentially reward executives for general market movements in share price rather than underlying improvements in performance.
An award of market value share options was granted in 2010 to the CEO and CFO with a face value equivalent to 200% of salary.
These options will be exercisable after three years subject to the following PBT growth over the three financial years ending December 2012 as set out in the table below: PBT growth targets Proportion of the share option award that is exercisable RPI 8% p. a. or above 100% Straight-line vesting between these points RPI p. a.

Incentives for 2011 In light of the opportunities to develop the business and invest in its growth, the Committee considers a return to the pre-2009 remuneration framework appropriate for 2011.
The framework for 2011 will therefore combine the profit share annual bonus used in prior years with the Co-Investment Plan albeit the matching ratio on the Co-Investment Plan in 2011 will be lower than it was pre-2009.
Annual bonus For 2011, executives will be eligible to earn a bonus comprising two parts 1 a profit share and 2 a cash flow bonus.
Under the profit share part, the minimum Threshold level of PBT performance will be increased to 80m 40m in 2010 based on a WACC return.
No profit share bonus will be payable below Threshold performance.
At Threshold performance, 25% of salary can be earned under the profit share part rising to 77% of salary at Target.
Above Target level of PBT, the CEO will be eligible to earn 0.45% of PBT 0.52% in 2010.
The CFO will be eligible to earn 0.31% of PBT 0.34% in 2010.
Profit share bonuses will vest on a straight-line basis between Threshold and Target performance.
Under the cash flow bonus, executives can earn up to 40% of salary subject to achieving predetermined cash flow targets on a sliding scale.
The maximum overall bonus opportunity remains capped at 200% with any bonus earned in excess of 100% of salary being deferred into shares.
Directors remuneration report continued Co-Investment Plan CIP Under the CIP, the CEO will be eligible to invest up to the lesser of 650,000 shares and 150% of salary of his own shares into the Plan for a period of three years.
In return for this commitment, each invested share will be matched with up to two additional shares subject to the achievement of stretching performance targets over the three year vesting period.
The CFO will be eligible to invest up to the same proportion of salary as the CEO based on the share price at the time of grant.
The performance targets will be measured by PBT growth over the period as set out in the table below.
The PBT targets will focus managements attention on unlocking shareholder value by generating sufficient profit growth to address legacy issues.
PBT growth Number of matching shares that vest 12% per annum 2 Straight-line vesting between these points 6% per annum 0.5 Less than 6% per annum 0 Other existing arrangements The following incentive plans discretionary and all-employee are also at the Committees disposal.
Co-Investment Plan CIP Under the CIP, participants are eligible to invest up to a predetermined number of their own shares into the Plan for a 38 period of three years.
In return for their commitment, each invested share can be matched with up to a maximum five additional shares subject to the achievement of stretching performance targets over the three year vesting period.
No award was made under the CIP in 2010.
See Incentives for 2011 which outlines the proposed structure for the use of the Co-Investment Plan in 2011.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP A new LTIP was adopted by the Company at the AGM in 2009 on broadly similar terms to our previous Plan but with rules i. e. change of control and leavers brought into line with current corporate governance best practice.
Awards of restricted shares or share options may be made under the LTIP.
There is no intention to use the Plan in 2011 for executive directors.
FreeShare Plan The FreeShare Plan was introduced in 2002.
Executive directors may participate in the Plan on the same terms as all other eligible employees.
The Plan is HMRC approved and is not subject to performance conditions other than continued employment.
Under the FreeShare Plan all eligible employees were invited to accept an allocation of up to 200 of the Companys shares in September 2002 and again in May 2003.
The shares are held in a Trust for a holding period being between three and five years after which the award of shares will vest and participants may withdraw their shares.
No further allocations have been made since those dates.
Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual report & accounts 2010 iii.
Pensions Executive directors can participate in the Howden Joinery Group Pension Plan The Plan.
The Plan is funded and HMRC approved.
With effect from 1 September 2006 the basis changed to a hybrid defined benefit occupational pension plan.
Its main features are currently: The defined benefit pension accrues on a Career Average Revalued Earnings CARE basis at the rate of 1 50th of actual pensionable pay in each year currently capped at 123,600 : post-retirement increases are linked to the increase in the retail prices index with a maximum of 2.5%: members contribute 8% of pensionable pay to the CARE plan: in addition to the defined benefit section, the Company will match any voluntary member contribution made to the defined contribution top-up section to a maximum of 8% of pensionable pay.
To recognise the impact of the change in the taxation of pensions on individuals, the member may opt to receive a salary supplement of 8% of salary in lieu of this defined contribution opportunity: life assurance cover of six times pensionable pay for those members with dependents and two times for those without dependents: pension payable in the event of ill health: spouses pension on death in retirement of 2 3 of deceaseds pension: and pensionable pay is limited to the members basic salary.
39 All plan benefits are subject to HMRC limits.
A pension supplement system operates concurrently with the Plan which recognises that pension entitlement in respect of the CARE part of the Plan has included maximum benefit restrictions the Plan Cap which was 123,600 for 2010 being based on the Earnings Cap applied prior to April 2006.
This supplement is 30% of basic salary above the Plan Cap to reflect competitive market practice.
If a director chooses to opt out of membership of the pension plan, then the supplement payment will be 30% of total basic salary.
The CEO had a fully funded pension position in 2006 and hence has chosen to opt out of membership of the Plan and consequently receives a salary supplement.
Mark Robson continues to participate in the Plan.
Service contracts All executive directors employment contracts have twelve months notice of termination on both sides.
In the event of termination by the Company, there will be no compensation for loss of office due to misconduct or resignation.
In other circumstances, executive directors may be entitled to receive compensation for loss of office which will be paid monthly for a maximum of twelve months.
Such payments will be equivalent to the monthly salary that the executive would have received if still in employment with the Company.
Executive directors will be expected to mitigate their loss within a twelve month period of their departure from the Company.
Directors remuneration report continued v. External appointments It is recognised that executive directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies and that exposure to such duties can broaden their experience and skills, which will benefit the Company.
Howden Joinery Group allows executive directors and other appropriate senior employees to accept a maximum of one non-executive appointment outside the Company, subject to permission from the Committee, provided this is not with a competing company nor likely to lead to conflicts of interest.
No such appointments are currently in place.
Executive directors may retain the fees paid to them in respect of their non-executive duties.
Non-executive directors remuneration Non-executive director appointments are for an initial period of three years.
They are subject to reappointment every three years, and annually after nine years.
Non-executive directors do not have contracts of service or notice periods and are not entitled to any form of compensation in the event of early termination for whatever reason.
The remuneration of non-executive directors, other than the Chairman, is considered by the Chairman and the Chief Executive.
The Chairmans remuneration is determined by the Remuneration Committee while the Chairman is absent.
A review was conducted in 2010 to ensure that remuneration for non-executive directors reflects the time commitment and responsibilities of their roles.
The review resulted in no increase in the remuneration of the Chairman and non-executive directors.

3 Pension supplements are paid every six months in arrears and the next payment is due in March 2011.
The table above includes an accrued amount for the period from 1 October 2010 to 25 December 2010.
Further details of the pension supplement are given on page 39.
4 Employee pension contributions are made on a salary sacrifice basis.

At the end of a three year performance period, each invested share will be matched by an award of up to three matching shares if 2010 PBT of 135 million is achieved: 25 percent of the maximum match i. e. 0.75:1 will be earned for achieving 2010 PBT of 110 million and the awards will vest on a sliding scale between these two points.
A further match of up to two shares will be made for achieving upper quartile Total Shareholder Return TSR, measured against the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts.
Post year end, these awards lapsed in full on 31 December 2010 as the performance conditions were not met as at year end 25 December 2010.
2 The directors were required to defer a third of their annual bonus earned in 2008 into shares.
These shares were bought out of taxed income and are held in Trust for three years.
Mr Ingle has 570,416 shares held in Trust under this arrangement and Mr Robson 403,374 shares.
3 From 2009 onwards, the directors have been required to defer any part of their annual bonus payment earned in excess of 100% of salary into shares.
The shares are 44 bought out of taxed income.
Half of these shares will be held in trust for a further year and the remaining 50% will be held in trust for a further two years.
Mr Ingle has 104,340 shares held in Trust under this arrangement and Mr Robson 69,074 shares.
