32 Directors remuneration report in tHis seCtiOn Dear Shareholder 32 Letter to Shareholders from the The Remuneration Committee reviews, on a regular basis, the operation and overall competitiveness of the total remuneration packages for Executive Directors and senior executives.
Chair of the Remuneration Committee 33 U naudited information Following a review at the end of 2008 09 of the Companys remuneration arrangements against 33 Remuneration policy the stated remuneration policy, and in light of the Companys performance, the Committee 33 Performance-related versus concluded that incentive pay needed to increase to enable the Company to pay its executives fixed remuneration competitively.
However, taking into account the views of certain shareholders and representative bodies, and with support from the Companys Executive Directors, the Committee concluded that 33 Base salary the proposals were not appropriate to the wider external climate at that time and were withdrawn.
33 Annual bonus The Committee, however, remained clear that incentive pay needed to increase to enable the 34 All Employee Sharesave Scheme Company to pay its executives competitively where success was demonstrated.
Accordingly, in 2009 10, the Committee re-considered the position and decided that it is vital that the 34 Long Term Incentive Plan Companys remuneration arrangements are positioned competitively the recruitment of a 35 Share ownership guidelines new Chief Executive has re-emphasised how important this is to the business.
35 Pension arrangements 35 Benefits Therefore, the Committee has decided to: 35 Appointment of new Chief Executive maintain Executive Director base salary levels: 36 Performance graph 36 Directors contracts increase the maximum annual bonus potential for Executive Directors from 100% of base salary to 200% of base salary for 2010 11.
Bonus potential will also be increased for other 36 Executive Directors less senior executives.
Reflecting the increased bonus potential, the bonus vesting schedule 37 Non-Executive Directors has been made more stretching: 38 Audited information introduce bonus deferral, so that 50% of any bonus payable to Executive Directors is deferred 38 Directors emoluments in shares for three years: and and pension entitlements 39 Share awards increase the level of Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP awards for Executive Directors 40 Share options with the exception of the incoming Chief Executive for 2010 11 from 200% of salary to 40 Dilution and share usage 240% of salary.
The incoming Chief Executive will receive an LTIP award equal to 275% of salary.
These award levels are within the individual limit of 300% of salary contained in the LTIP rules.
40 Directors interests 40 A pproval As a result of these changes, the Executive Directors ongoing total remuneration, with base salary at current levels and a greater focus on performance-related elements, will be consistent with the stated remuneration policy in the Summary remuneration report which follows and will be broadly comparable to the packages provided by the Companys key competitors.
The Committee considers that this is critical to the Groups future success and the recruitment and retention of key individuals.
During the year, the Committee has also had to deal with the change of Chief Executive.
Details of the termination arrangements for Marc Bolland, and Dalton Philips ongoing remuneration package from appointment on 1 March 2010 which is consistent with the revised Executive Director remuneration policy and share awards required to facilitate his recruitment, are set out in the detailed Directors remuneration report which follows.
Following Marc Bollands resignation the Remuneration Committee considered that it was responsible and commercially appropriate to secure the services of Richard Pennycook and Mark Gunter.
The Committee, therefore, very quickly took certain steps to this end and agreed to an additional LTIP award of 100% of salary to these two individuals, in addition to the 200% of salary award already received in 2009 10 and within the 300% of salary annual limit contained in the LTIP rules.
Within the limitations imposed by the urgency to communicate the proposals to these individuals, the Committee consulted with major shareholders who understood the reasons for the increased LTIP grant and the future increases to incentive pay and who were, in the majority, supportive.
More details of all of these changes are set out in the detailed Directors remuneration report which follows.

2 LTIP awards granted on 24 May 2007 and 24 October 2007 Martyn Jones received an additional LTIP award in October 2007 to reflect an increase in salary upon joining the Board were subject to three year performance targets, measured to 31 January 2010.
Performance measures were 75% based on EPS 25% of the EPS related component of the award vested for Group EPS in 2009 10 of 15.8p per share, rising on a pro rata basis to 100% for an EPS of 19.0p per share and 25% based on like-for-like non-fuel sales growth 25% of the sales growth related component vested if the Groups like-for-like non-fuel sales grew by 3% p. a. compound rising on a pro rata basis to 100% for growth of 5% p. a. compound.
Following the end of the 2009 10 financial year, the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that these performance targets have been met in full.
To allow the taxation of the 24 May 2007 LTIP awards to fall within the 2009 10 tax year potentially leading to a taxation saving for participants at no cost to the Company, the Remuneration Committee has concluded that all participants including Executive Directors should be given the opportunity to elect to pay the tax due on the awards in March 2010 i. e. before the normal vesting date of the third anniversary of grant date.
For individuals electing to pay the relevant taxes early, May 2007 LTIP awards will be converted into forfeitable shares in March 2010, with the relevant number of shares sold to meet the income tax and National Insurance liability on the awards.
The net number of forfeitable shares will be held by the Companys employee benefit trust and will be released to individuals on the normal vesting date.
Dividends will continue to accrue on forfeitable shares held in the trust although post March 2010, this accrual will be based on the net number of shares held.
The tax paid in March 2010, via a sale of shares, will be subject to a claw-back provision providing that if the LTIP awards would otherwise have been forfeited between the accelerated tax payment and the normal vesting date e. g. in a bad leaver situation, the Company may recover an amount from the participant equal to the income tax and National Insurance charge paid by the employee on that award.
3 LTIP awards granted on 14 April 2008 and 14 October 2008 Marc Bolland received an additional LTIP award in October 2008 to reflect his personal contribution since appointment and to act as a further incentivisation and retention mechanism over and above his existing awards are subject to three year performance targets.
Performance measures are 75% based on EPS and 25% based on like-for-like non-fuel sales growth.
25% of the EPS related component of the award will vest if the Groups EPS in 2010 11 is 19.6p per share rising on a pro rata basis until 100% vests for an EPS of 23.5p per share.
25% of the sales growth related component will vest if the Groups like-for-like non-fuel sales grow by 3% p. a. compound rising on a pro rata basis until there is 100% vesting for growth of 5% p. a. compound.
No awards can vest under the sales targets unless the threshold EPS target has been met.
4 LTIP awards granted on 9 April 2009 and 29 January 2010 Mark Gunter and Richard Pennycook received additional LTIP awards in January 2010 to secure their services and incentivise them further following Marc Bollands resignation are subject to three year performance targets.
Performance measures are 75% based on EPS and 25% based on like-for-like non-fuel sales growth against the IGD Index.
25% of the EPS related component of the award will vest if the Groups Underlying EPS grows in line with the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus an average of 4% per annum, rising on a pro rata basis until 100% vests for outperforming the Index by at least 10% per annum over the three years ending with the 2011 12 financial year.
25% of the sales growth related component will vest if the Groups like-for-like non-fuel sales match the IGD Index, rising on a pro rata basis until 100% vests for outperforming the Index by at least 2% over the three years ending with the 2011 12 financial year.
5 Marc Bollands outstanding LTIP awards lapsed on 1 February 2010 when he ceased to be employed by the Company.
6 To fulfil promises made to Richard Pennycook at the time of his recruitment, as reported in prior year Remuneration reports, the annual bonus award made to him for 2006 07 included, in addition to the cash element, a deferred share award as a result of no LTIP being adopted by shareholders in the 2006 07 financial year.
That award was in shares of the Group with a value equal to 950,400 two times the amount of the cash bonus earned for the 2006 07 financial year with the number of shares calculated by reference to the average share price over the five dealing days prior to the deemed date of the award 1 April 2007 which was 307.5p.
This deferred share award vested on 1 April 2009 when the share price was 254.25p.
In accordance with the terms of the award, Mr Pennycook also received a cash sum of 27,739 as payment for the equivalent of dividends that would have been paid on the vested shares during the period between the deemed date of award and the vesting date.
7 In addition to the awards set out in the table, Roger Owen who retired on 1 February 2009 retains LTIP awards in accordance with the leaver rules of the plan.
These awards are in respect of 305,798 shares granted on 24 May 2007 and 356,581 shares granted on 14 April 2008.
These two awards will vest three years from the date of grant, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions and time pro-rating to reflect the shorter period of time served in the vesting period.
All performance conditions attached to options granted under this scheme have been satisfied in prior years.
The ordinary share mid-market price ranged from 234.50p to 300.80p and averaged 264.80p during the period.
The price on 31 January 2010 was 289.10p compared to 259.75p on 2 February 2009.
Dilution and share usage Awards under the Groups share option and SAYE schemes are satisfied by the issue of new shares within the limits agreed by shareholders when the plans were approved.
These limits comply with the Association of British Insurers guidelines restricting dilution from employee share plans.
The overall limits under the guidelines are that no more than 10% of a Groups issued share capital may be used in any 10-year period.
Up to 5% may be used for executive share plans.
As at 31 January 2010, the Groups share usage against these limits was 3.6% and 0.58% respectively.
It is currently intended that LTIP awards be satisfied by market purchased shares which are held in an Employee Benefit Trust.
