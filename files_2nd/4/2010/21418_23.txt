Directors remuneration report Andy Pomfret Chairman, remuneration committee This report has been prepared by the remuneration committee the committee of Beazley plc and approved by the board of Beazley plc.
The report complies with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008.
Section headings marked indicates the information in that section has been audited.
Dear shareholder In the following pages the Committees report on directors remuneration for 2010 is presented.
Beazley produced an exceptional performance for the year ended 31 December 2010 delivering a pre-tax profit of $250.8m 2009: $158.1m, against a background of increased competition, softening insurance markets and macro-economic uncertainty.
Market conditions placed increased emphasis on the skill of our underwriters in identifying profitable underwriting opportunities, as well as optimising the portfolio mix to achieve healthy returns across the cycle.
Our combined ratio of 88% and 21.4% return on equity in 2010 reflects the success of our underwriters, both individually and collectively, in achieving this, and we maintained our track record of 25 years of unbroken profitability.
This success has been achieved by virtue of our greatest asset: our people.
Talent management is one of the cornerstones of our business success, as we seek to recruit and retain people who rank among the best insurance professionals in the world.
Against that background, ensuring Beazley has a competitive remuneration mix that rewards sustainable performance remains important to our future success.
Our executive remuneration policy is governed by two guiding principles alignment to shareholder interests and performance of the group.
The committee considers the overall package to be appropriate, responsible and balanced.
We have made no significant changes to our executive remuneration policies during this year.
The salary increase for executive directors was 2% which was in line with the standard increase throughout the organisation.
Best practice remuneration structures in financial services continue to be a developing area.
During the year the Committee reviewed Beazleys policies against the revised UK Corporate Governance Code and other relevant shareholder guidance.
Ensuring that Beazleys reward policy is sensitive to risk considerations continues to be a key priority for the Committee.
Our executive director pay packages include a number of best practice features, which are consistent with, and take account of, the risk profile of the company.
These include bonus deferral into shares: provisions for clawback in certain circumstances: performance periods extending to five years: and shareholding guidelines.
The committee will continue to monitor developments in the external environment over the next year.
We are keen to encourage an on-going dialogue on our policies and continue to welcome our shareholders views.

US SAYE As above but for US participants Remuneration committee The committee consists of five non-executive directors and during the year the members included Andy Pomfret as Chairman, Gordon Hamilton, George Blunden, Padraic OConnor and Ken Sroka.
The board views each of these directors as independent.
The committee met seven times during the year.
In addition to the five regular meetings there were another two ad-hoc meetings.
The committee considers the individual remuneration packages of the deputy chairman, chief executive, executive directors and executive committee members.
It also has oversight of the salary and bonus awards of individuals outside the executive committee who are either direct reports of executive committee members or who have basic salaries over 200,000, as well as the overall bonus pool and total incentives paid by the company.
The terms of reference of the committee are available on the companys website.
The committee receives advice from a variety of sources.
During the year the committee were advised by Hewitt New Bridge Street and Deloitte LLP.
The committee also calls on specialist advice from a variety of additional sources including Bluefin Advisory Services Limited for benefits and pensions advice, Towers Watson publications for salary data and Equiniti for employee share incentives matters.
None of the advisors provides other services to the company.
Input was also received by the committee during the year from the chief executive, head of talent management and the company secretary.
However, no individual plays a part in the determination of their own remuneration.
Remuneration policy The committee has oversight of the remuneration policy.
The general philosophy underlying the reward strategy for executive directors is the same as that applied to all other employees.
Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the company and data on comparable positions in other similar organisations are taken into consideration when determining executive directors remuneration.
The main aim of the policy is to ensure that management and staff are remunerated fairly and in such a manner as to facilitate the recruitment, retention and motivation of suitably qualified personnel.
com Quick read Annual statement Performance by division Financial review Corporate governance Financial statements The key elements of the companys remuneration policies are: To remunerate management and staff fairly and in such a manner as to facilitate the recruitment, retention and motivation of suitably qualified personnel: That performance-related remuneration is an essential motivation to management and staff and should be structured to ensure that executives interests are aligned with shareholders: That individual rewards should reflect the group objectives but be dependent on the profitability of the group as well as take account of the operational risks: The structures of packages should support meritocracy, an important part of Beazleys culture: That reward potentials should be market competitive: and That executives pay should include an element of downside risk.
Remuneration and the Lloyds market The companys market for talent is primarily underwriters at Lloyds.
In line with our peer group within the Lloyds market, there are no upper limits on the amounts payable to individuals under short-term incentives.
The committee has considered whether it is appropriate to set an upper limit and has agreed that such a limit would adversely affect the companys competitive position and would not be in the interests of shareholders.
Fixed and variable remuneration The balance between fixed and variable elements of executive directors remuneration changes with performance.
The anticipated normal mix between fixed and variable remuneration is c. 40% fixed and c. 60% variable.
This mix is illustrated in the following chart.
Balance of fixed versus variable pay Chief executive 36.5% 63.5% Finance director 40% 60% Underwriting 40% 60% directors 020408 60 0 100 Fixed Variable A significant proportion of variable pay is delivered in shares as illustrated below: Incentives: cash versus shares Chief executive 37.5% 62.5% Finance director 43% 57% Underwriting 43% 57% directors 020408 60 0 100 Cash Shares Beazley Annual Report 2010 63 Directors remuneration report continued Risk and reward at Beazley Although, the company is not subject to the FSAs Remuneration Code, the committee takes the Code into account when considering remuneration, along with other corporate governance developments and institutional shareholders guidance.
During the year the committee undertook a review of remuneration against various guidelines and continues to monitor developments.
The committee believes the company is adopting an approach which is consistent with and takes account of the risk profile of the company.
We believe reward at Beazley is appropriately balanced against risk considerations, particularly in the following areas: Features aligned with risk considerations Share deferral A portion of bonus is deferred into shares for three years.
These deferred shares together with shares awarded under the long-term incentive plan mean that a significant portion of total remuneration is delivered in the form of shares deferred for a period of years.
Extended performance periods A portion of the long-term incentive plan has performance measured over an extended five year period, in line with the Walker recommendations and FSA guidelines.
Shareholding requirements Executive directors are expected to build up and maintain a shareholding of 150% of salary 200% for the CEO.
Investment in Underwriting Management and underwriters defer part of their bonuses into the Beazley staff underwriting plan providing alignment with capital providers.
Underwriters remuneration aligned with Under the profit related plan payments are aligned with the timing of profits profit achieved achieved on the account.
For long-tail accounts this may be in excess of six years.
If the account deteriorates then payouts are clawed back through adjustments to future payments.
Clawback of deferred shares For deferred share awards from 2011 onwards, a clawback provision is being introduced, so that shares may be forfeited in certain circumstances, including material misstatement of accounts or significant adverse company performance developments.
Salary The committee reviews salaries annually taking into account levels in comparable positions in other similar financial service companies.
It also considers the performance of the group and individual as well as the average salary increase for employees across the whole group.
The annual salary reviews take place in December of each year, with new salaries effective from 1 January.
For 2011, the salary increase is 2%.
This is in line with standard salary increases across the group.
com Quick read Annual statement Performance by division Financial review Corporate governance Financial statements Bonus plans Enterprise bonus plan The enterprise bonus plan is a discretionary plan in which all employees are eligible to participate.
The pool is calculated as a percentage of profit subject to a minimum group return on equity target.
The proportion of profit allocated to the pool increases as higher returns on equity are achieved.
The proportion of the pool awarded to executive directors takes into account the individuals contribution and the performance of their division if appropriate.
Pre tax Post tax Enterprise Year underlying profit underlying ROE pool 2010 $220m 17.9% $21.1m 2009 $210m 21% $22.5m 2008 $93m 10.7% $7.2m Note that ROE is calculated based on estimated profit taking into account the adjustments described below and is therefore on a different basis to underlying ROE as shown on page 2 of the Annual Report.
Profit and enterprise pool for years prior to 2010 were converted from sterling based on the average prevailing exchange rate for the year.
The pool is calculated based on the latest post tax return at the end of the year for the financial year having been adjusted for the enterprise pool payments.
The calculation uses the underlying profit which excludes the charges or credits that arise from the IFRS foreign exchange adjustments on non-monetary items and a one-off currency conversion adjustment relating to change of reporting currency during the year.
The pool approach to the calculation of bonuses is aligned to shareholders and ensures that bonuses are affordable, while the ROE return targets increase the performance gearing.
The following table and graph illustrates the way in which bonuses reflect profit and ROE performance.
Average executive Forecast Forecast director Pre tax Post tax bonus as a underlying underlying percentage profit ROE of salary 2010 $220m 17.9% c. 230% 2009 $210m 21% c. 230% 2008 $93m 10.7% c. 75% See previous note Average executive director bonus payout 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 2008 2009 2010 PBT: $93m PBT: $210m PBT: $220m ROE: 11% ROE: 21% ROE: 18% A portion of the bonus will generally be deferred into shares for three years.
The deferral will range from 0% to 35% dependent on the level of bonus.
For deferred share awards from 2011 onwards, a clawback provision is being introduced.
The committee may determine that unvested shares will be forfeited in certain circumstances, such as a material misstatement of accounts or a significant adverse company development.
Beazley Annual Report 2010 65 % of salary Directors remuneration report continued Underwriter bonus plan profit related pay plan Underwriters participate in a profit related pay plan based upon the profitability of their underwriting account.
Executive directors do not participate in this plan.
The objective of the plan is to align the interests of the group and the individual through aligning an underwriters reward to the long-term profitability of their portfolio.
Underwriters that have significant influence over a portfolio may be offered awards under the plan.
There is no automatic eligibility.
Profit related pay is awarded irrespective of the results of the group and is capped at a maximum of 150% of salary.
This bonus is awarded as cash and is based upon a fixed proportion of profit achieved on the relevant underwriting account as measured at three years and later.
Any movements in prior years are reflected in future year payments as the accounts develop after three years.
For long-tail accounts the class is still relatively immature at the three year stage and therefore payments will be modest.
They will receive further payouts in years 4, 5 and 6 and even later as the account matures.
Therefore each year they could be receiving payouts from multiple underwriting years.
If the account deteriorates as it develops any payouts are clawed back through reductions in future profit related pay bonuses.
The fixed proportion is calculated based upon profit targets which are set through the business planning process and reviewed by a committee formed of executive committee members and functional specialists including the group actuary and the head of talent management.
Underwriting risk is taken into account when setting profit targets.
In addition to profit related pay, underwriters are also eligible to receive a discretionary bonus, based upon performance, from the enterprise bonus pool.
A proportion of this bonus may be paid in deferred shares, which vest after three years subject to continued employment.
Support bonus plan Employees who are not members of the executive and who do not participate in the underwriters profit related pay plan participate in a discretionary bonus pool.
This pool provides the employees with a discretionary award of an annual performance bonus that reflects overall individual performance including meeting annual objectives.
A proportion of this award may also be dependent on the groups return on equity and therefore allocated from the enterprise bonus pool.
Share plans Long-term incentive plan LTIP Under the LTIP, executive directors, senior management and underwriters receive awards of free shares subject to the achievement of stretching performance conditions measured over five years.
The key features of the plan are as follows: 50% of the award is measured after three years and 50% after five years.
Awards are in the form of nil-cost options with a ten year term.
Dividends do not accrue on shares prior to vesting.
Participants are expected to build a shareholding in Beazley equal to their annual award level.
For example the CEO has a shareholding guideline of 200% of salary.
Participants have three years to build this shareholding from March 2010, when this feature was introduced.
In good leaver circumstances and on change of control, awards are pro-rated for time and performance.
The award level policy for 2011 is set out in the table below: Other executive Chief executive directors Maximum annual award as a percentage of base salary 200% 150% Vesting of awards is based on growth in net asset value per share NAVps, one of Beazleys key performance indicators.
The Committee considers the LTIP NAVps growth targets to be very stretching, particularly taking into account that growth must be over a sustained three and five year period.
com Quick read Annual statement Performance by division Financial review Corporate governance Financial statements The performance condition for awards for 2011 is as follows: NAVps performance % of award vesting NAVps growth risk-free rate 10% p. a.
0% NAVps growth risk-free rate 10% p. a.
25% NAVps growth risk-free rate 15% p. a.
100% NAVps growth between risk-free rate 10% and 15% p. a.
Straight line between 25% and 100% The LTIP awards that were granted on 13 March 2007 were based on NAVps growth and TSR performance.
These awards met the performance criteria in part and 50% of the awards vested in March 2010.
The results were independently calculated by Hewitt New Bridge Street.
SAYE The company operates an HMRC approved SAYE scheme for the benefit of UK-based employees.
The scheme offers a three-year savings contract period with options being offered at a 20% discount to the share price on grant.
Monthly contributions are made through payroll deduction on behalf of participating employees.
US SAYE The Beazley plc savings-related share option plan for US employees permits all eligible US-based employees to purchase shares of Beazley plc at a discount of up to 15% to the shares fair market value.
Participants may exercise options after a two-year period, although the shares are non-transferable for a further 12 months following exercise.
The plan is compliant with the terms of Section 423 of the US Internal Revenue Code and is similar to the SAYE scheme operated for UK-based Beazley employees.
Retention shares The retention plan is now only used in exceptional circumstances for recruitment or retention purposes.
Any awards vest at 25% per annum over years three to six.
Policy going forward is that existing executive directors do not participate in this plan.
However, some executive directors have subsisting legacy awards.
Option plan The option plan does not form part of Beazleys current remuneration policy.
The plan comprises an HMRC approved plan and an unapproved plan.
All options granted under this plan have vested or lapsed.
It is the committees intention to only grant options under this plan in exceptional circumstances.
No options have been granted since 2005.
Dilution The share plans permit 10% of the companys issued share capital to be issued pursuant to awards under the LTIP, SAYE and option plan in a 10-year period.
Since November 2002, 3.6% of this allowance 2009: 2.5% has been allocated for SAYE option and LTIP awards.
Investment in underwriting Traditionally, Lloyds underwriters contributed their personal capital to syndicates in which they worked.
With the move to corporate provision of capital, individual membership of Lloyds has declined significantly.
The committee feels that having personal capital at risk in the syndicate is an important part of the remuneration policy and provides a healthy counterbalance to incentivisation through bonuses and long-term incentive awards.
The company has operated the Beazley Staff Underwriting Plan for this purpose since 2004 and executive directors and other selected staff are invited to participate through bonus deferral with an element of their cash incentives at risk as capital commitments.
These capital commitments can be lost in full if underwriting performance is poor.
The group funds the initial capital for the participants in the scheme.
The initial capital outlay is then reimbursed by individual bonus deferral.
The aim is for individuals to fund their capital within three years.
To date over 100 employees of the group have committed to put at risk 6.7m of bonuses to the underwriting results of syndicate 623.
Of the total at risk, 5.6m has already been deferred from the bonuses awarded.

The company contributes 15% of salary for directors.
Andrew Beazley and Nick Furlonge did not participate in this plan but, instead, received a salary supplement in lieu of pension.
These supplements ceased for Nick Furlonge on 18 October 2010 and for Andrew Beazley on 31 October 2010.
Prior to 31 March 2006 the company provided pension entitlements to directors that are defined benefit in nature, based on its legacy policy under the Beazley Furlonge Limited Final Salary Pension Scheme.
Future service accruals ceased on 31 March 2006.
Only base salary is pensionable.
No other pension provisions are made.
The normal retirement age for pension calculation purposes is 60 years.
A spouses pension is the equivalent of two-thirds of the members pension before any commutation payable on the members death after retirement.

Service contracts Executive directors have service contracts with Beazley Management Limited.
In June 2009, following the redomiciliation to Ireland, the directors were issued with new service contracts from Beazley Management Limited and appointment letters as directors of Beazley plc.
It is company policy that such service contracts with executive directors contain notice periods, from the company or employee, of not more than 12 months.
The current contracts in place for executive directors are as follows: Date of contract M L Bride 9 June 2009 A P Cox 6 Dec 2010 N H Furlonge 9 June 2009 J G Gray 9 June 2009 D A Horton 9 June 2009 N P Maidment 9 June 2009 C A Washbourn 9 June 2009 68 www.
com Quick read Annual statement Performance by division Financial review Corporate governance Financial statements The notice period for each of the above contracts is 12 months.
There is no unexpired term as each of the executive directors contracts is on a rolling basis.
Subject to the notice requirements described above, there is no provision in the service agreements for compensation to be payable on early termination of the contract.
Any payments of compensation will be subject to negotiation and the company policy includes consideration of appropriate mitigation, including phasing of payments.
Executive directors other interests Nick Furlonge holds a non-executive appointment with the Lloyds franchise board.
He was appointed to this role on 4 February 2008.
He receives and retains a fee of 55,000 per annum in respect of this appointment.
Non-executive directors fees The fees of non-executive directors, other than the chairman, are determined by the board.
The fees for the chairman are determined by the board, following a recommendation from the remuneration committee.
When setting fee levels consideration is given to levels in comparable companies for comparable services in addition to the time commitment and responsibilities of the individual director.
No non-executive director participates in the companys incentive arrangements or pension plan.
Non-executive directors are appointed for fixed terms, normally for three years, and may be reappointed for future terms.
Nonexecutive directors are typically appointed through a selection process that assesses if the candidate brings the desired competence and skills to the group.
The board has identified several key competencies for non-executive directors to complement the existing skill-set of the executive directors.
These competencies are as follows: Insurance sector expertise: Asset management skills: Public company and corporate governance experience: Risk management skills: and Finance skills.
A review of the fees and other income payable was carried out by the board in December 2010.
The review took into account market data for other financial services companies in the FTSE 250 and the changes to Beazleys operating and regulatory environment.
Beazley operates across Lloyds and the US markets through a variety of legal entities and structures.
Non-executive directors, in addition to the plc board, typically sit on either one of our key subsidiary boards Beazley Furlonge Ltd BFL, our managing agency at Lloyds, and Beazley Re Ltd, our re-insurance company.
As a result of developments in regulation, the way in which these subsidiary boards operate has changed significantly since 2008, when fees were last reviewed.
The degree of autonomy in the operation of each board has increased, with a consequent increase in time commitment and scope of the role.
As a result of the review: basic fees were increased by 2%.
the fees for chairing the Audit and Remuneration Committees were increased to 15,000 and 10,000 respectively from 10,000 and 8,000 respectively.
There was no increase in the fee for Senior Independent Director which remains at 6,000.
Fees were introduced for board membership in respect of the two key subsidiary boards, BFL and Beazley Re.
Chairman fees were also considered as part of the review.
This was in the context of both the changes in the regulatory and operational environment, as described above, as well as a review of the market data.
Following the review we considered it was appropriate to: Increase chairman fees from 105,000 to 120,000: and Introduce a fee for chairmanship of the BFL board of 30,000, consistent with the approach for subsidiary boards described above.
The Committee considered that this increase was appropriate given the size and scope of the company, and hence the role, and the significant changes to the complexity of the environment in which it operates.
