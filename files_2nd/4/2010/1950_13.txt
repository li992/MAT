Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration Introduction The remuneration of the executive directors is determined by the Board Committee on Executive Directors Remuneration the Committee within a framework set by the Board.
As at the date of this report, the Committees members are three non-executive directors, Mr Toms Chairman, Mr Johnson and Mr Cuthbert.
Mr Perry was a member of the Committee until his retirement at the AGM on 15 January 2010, when his place on the Committee was taken by Mr Cuthbert.
None of the Committee members has a personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided.
There are no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Terms of Reference of the Committee are available on the Companys website.
During the year, the Group Company Secretary attended a number of Committee meetings at the invitation of the Committee and provided advice on issues other than those relating to his own remuneration.
The Committee also received independent external advice from Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS.
HNBS was appointed by the Committee and does not provide any other services to the Company other than to the Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors Remuneration.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors apart from the Chairman is determined by the Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors Remuneration, which comprises the executive directors.
The Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors Remuneration also receives advice from the Group Company Secretary and HNBS.
The Chairmans remuneration is determined by the other non-executive directors.
Objectives The aim of the Committee is to ensure that the Company has competitive remuneration packages in place in order to recruit, retain and motivate executive directors in the overall interests of shareholders, the Company, its employees and its customers.
The Committee has set, as an objective, a policy of paying remuneration around the median of a peer group of similar UK housebuilding businesses and it is satisfied that the structure of the executives packages broadly achieves this objective.
The Committee has used this comparative approach to benchmarking with caution, recognising the risk of upward only reviews of remuneration.
The structure of the package has been designed to ensure that the performance-related elements of remuneration annual bonus and long-term incentives constitute a significant proportion of an executives potential total remuneration package, but are only receivable if demanding and stretching performance targets are achieved.
The Committee considers that the remuneration level and structure are fully competitive with the market, with a significant element of the package payable in the form of share-based incentives, subject to long-term performance conditions, including relative Total Shareholder Return TSR performance against other UK housebuilders, thereby creating an alignment with the strategy of the business and the long-term interests of shareholders.
In framing the Companys remuneration policy for executive directors, the Committee has given full consideration to the best practice provisions in the UK Corporate Governance Code and the Association of British Insurers ABI guidance.
When determining the elements of remuneration for the executive directors, the Committee takes into consideration the pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group as a whole, paying particular attention to the levels of pay increase awarded to the workforce generally.
Allemployees, including the executive directors, can join the Savings Related Share Option Scheme.
Most employees have access to pensionand life assurance benefits and a significant proportion of staff benefit from health insurance, company car or car allowance.
Summary of Remuneration Policy The policy in relation to each component of executive remuneration is described below: Component Policy Performance period How achieved Salary To be market competitive.

to promote alignment of interest with shareholders.
32 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Business Review Governance Accounts Other Information Service Contracts and Letters of Appointment The executive directors have fixed-term service contracts which specify that retirement is at age 60, with a 12-month notice period from the Company and a six-month notice period from the executive.
On termination by the Company, an amount equivalent to one years salary, benefits and the average amount of the last two years annual bonus payments, would be payable.
Within six months of a change of control, if the Company or the executive director serves notice to terminate the contract, the liquidated damages payment would be triggered.
The inclusion of average annual bonus in the calculation of compensation payable for early termination will ensure that there is variability in the potential level of compensation.
In particular, after a period of poor performance, it could be expected that little or no bonus would be payable, reducing potential payout in these circumstances.
The current executive directors have long service with the Company and the Committee does not consider it appropriate to re-negotiate their contracts in relation to this material provision.
However, for future executives contracts the Committee will include a provision for bonus to be taken into account in the calculation for compensation payable.
This will ensure that, going forward, service contracts are consistent with current best practice.
The details of the executive directors service contracts are as follows: Executive director First appointed as a director Current contract commencement date J K Watson 1 August 1995 16 March 2001, amended 7 October 2009 P J Stoker 1 August 1995 19 January 1996, amended with effect from1November 2003 and further amended 7 October 2009 A M Leitch 1 August 2002 1 September 2002, amended 7 October 2009 All non-executive directors have letters of appointment with the Company of no more than three years with a three-month notice period by either side.

Salaries and Fees Salaries are reviewed on 1 August each year, taking into account the general settlement across the Company.
Any changes are implemented from that date.
For the year under review, the executive directors received no pay rise while the workforce was awarded an increase generally of 2%.
For 2010 11, the executive directors have been awarded a 2.5% increase in basic salary, which will reflect the average percentage increase across the workforce generally.
Fee levels for non-executive directors reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of the role, including membership or chairmanship of Board Committees.
Fees are reviewed annually, taking into account the level of fees for similar positions in comparable companies.
Fortheyear under review, fees were not increased from their 2008 09 level.
With effect from 1 August 2010, fees have been increased byaround 6% to reflect the increasing responsibilities, complexity and time commitment of their role.
They are not entitled to any benefits with the exception of the Chairman or pension.
They do not participate in any bonus or long-term incentive plan and they are not entitled to compensation on termination of their agreements, other than normal notice provisions of three months notice given by either party.
Taxable Benefits Taxable benefits provided relate to the provision of motor vehicles, telephones and private medical insurance.
Bellway p. l. c. 33 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration continued Annual Bonus Scheme For the year under review, bonuses were capped at 100% of basic salary.
The performance conditions related to operating profit pre-exceptional items 80% and personal performance 20%, with personal performance being assessed by reference to board structure and succession planning, land bank management, health and safety and customer care.
Details of the bonus payments are set out in the notes to the table of directors emoluments on page 36.
Annual bonuses are not pensionable.
The bonus will be payable in cash, with executives having the opportunity to invest up to 25% of their net cash bonus in Bellway shares under the terms of the Bellway p. l. c. 2008 Share Matching Plan.
The 2010 11 bonus will again be based on similar performance parameters as for the 2009 10 bonus and in the same proportions.
TheCommittee considers that outperformance of targets in relation to year-on-year profitability and non-financial metrics provide a good link to the long-term performance of the business.
Long-term Incentive Schemes The Company operates two long-term incentive plans which are designed to focus executive directors on longer term value creation, provide a strong retentive element and also alignment of interest with shareholders.
The Bellway p. l. c. 2004 Performance Share Plan the PSP was introduced for the Companys executive directors and the Group Company Secretary.
Under the PSP, executives have been granted awards over shares worth 100% of basic salary each year, subject to the achievement of TSR-based performance conditions or, for the award granted in January 2008, a combination of TSR and Return on Capital Employed ROCE conditions.
The policy for long-term incentives to be granted in the 2010 11 financial year, as was the case in prior years, will be for awards to be granted over shares worth 100% of basic salary.
Awards will vest to executives after three years, subject to the achievement of performance conditions based around TSR, which compares the stock market performance share price movement and dividends paid of different companies.
The TSR performance condition will compare Bellways TSR against that of an index created by the average TSR of the other UK housebuilders.
Awards will start to vest at 25% if Bellways TSR matches the performance of the index.
Full vesting will occur if Bellways TSR outperforms the index by an average of 7.5% per annum over three years.
The Committee has carried out significant modelling during the year under review, the results of which continue to support the premise that 7.5% per annum outperformance is equivalent to average upper quartile TSR performance of the housebuilders over the long term.
The companies comprising the Index for the awards to be granted in the 2010 11 financial year are Barratt Developments PLC, The Berkeley Group plc, Bovis Homes Group PLC, Persimmon plc, Redrow plc and Taylor Wimpey plc.
TSR is recognised as enabling alignment with the interests of institutional shareholders by providing a reward mechanism for delivering superior stock market performance.
TSR calculations are independently calculated for the Committee by the Companys brokers.
Further, regardless of TSR performance, for the award granted in the 2010 11 financial year, no part of the TSR element of an award will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that there has been an improvement in underlying financial performance over the performance period, taking into account, inter alia, operating profit, operating margin, ROCE and Net Asset Value NAV.
The Committee will scale back the level of vesting indicated by the TSR performance condition potentially to zero in circumstances where there has not been an improvement.
This is a change from the provision applying to previous years awards, where the requirement was that TSR performance was simply reflective of underlying financial performance.
The Bellway p. l. c. 2008 Share Matching Plan the SMP operates in conjunction with the annual bonus plan.
Under the SMP senior executives may invest up to 25% of their net cash bonus, on a voluntary basis, in Bellway shares, which must be held for a minimum of three years.
Invested shares will not be subject to a risk of forfeiture and executives will enjoy full beneficial ownership including voting rights and dividends.
In return for investing in shares under the SMP, an award of matching shares is granted.
The level of matching is on a gross basis to the net of tax bonus invested in shares.
Matching shares will vest subject to the executive remaining employed, retention of the invested shares and also subject to a performance condition.
No awards have been made to date.
For any awards which may be made, the performance condition will be the same as will apply to the award under the PSP in the same period.
In addition to the two executive plans detailed above, the Bellway p. l. c. 2003 Savings Related Share Option Scheme 2003 SRSOS isavailable to all employees, including the executive directors.
34 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Business Review Governance Accounts Other Information Shareholding Guidelines There is a minimum shareholding requirement for the executive directors, equivalent to 100% of basic salary.
As at 31 July 2010, and at the date of this report, all executive directors hold shares with an equivalent value well in excess of 100% of their basic salary.
Any executive directors appointed in the future will be given an appropriate period of time to acquire the requisite shareholding.
Directors Interests The directors interests including family interests and holdings in which the directors are interested only as trustees in the ordinary share capital of the Company are set out below: Fully paid ordinary 12.5 pence shares 31 July 2010 1 August 2009 or date of appointment if Beneficial interests later H C Dawe 143,634 143,634 J K Watson 400,527 400,527 P J Stoker 540,000 540,000 A M Leitch 132,473 132,473 P M Johnson 4,300 4,300 M R Toms 1,500 J A Cuthbert 6,000 The directors interests including family interests in the preference share capital of the Company are set out below: Fully paid cumulative redeemable 1 preference shares Beneficial interests 31 July 2010 1 August 2009 H C Dawe 679,164 629,164 P J Stoker 150,000 A M Leitch 150,000 50,000 There has been no change in any of the above interests between 31 July 2010 and the date of this report.
Pensions In July 2008 the executive directors took enhanced transfer values from the final salary section of the Bellway p. l. c. 1972 Pension & Life Assurance Scheme, and therefore have no accrued pension entitlements.
Since 1 June 2008 they have received a cash payment in lieu of pension contributions amounting to 30% of basic salary.
Following advice to the Committee, this amount was agreed as being reasonable inthe circumstances and was less than the annual accrual foregone by the executive directors under the previous final salary arrangements.
Bellway p. l. c. 35 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration continued The auditors are required to report on the information contained in the following part of this report.
Taxable benefits relate to the provision of motor vehicles, telephones and private medical insurance.
The annual bonus is payable in November 2010 for performance during the year ended 31 July 2010.
The performance conditions for the 2009 10 bonus were operating profit pre-exceptional items 80% and non-financial performance 20%, with non-financial performance being assessed by reference to board structure and succession planning, land bank management, health and safety and customer care.
The actual bonus payments against each of these metrics were determined on the following basis: Q operating profit was 51.255 million.
This was above City expectations of underlying profitability and towards the higher end of the target range.
A bonus of 64.259% of salary was therefore achieved out of the maximum 80%.
Q in respect of the non-financial elements, the Committee took account of performance against each metric and determined that, overall, a bonus of 12.666% of salary should be payable out of the maximum 20%.
Executive directors receive a cash payment in lieu of pension contribution amounting to 30% of basic salary.

Bellway p. l. c. 37 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration continued 6.
The performance conditions for each award are summarised below: a For awards made on 18 October 2006, which vested during the year, a TSR performance condition required Bellways TSR to be at least at the median of a comparator group of other housebuilders at which point 33% of the award vested, and at or above the upper quartile of the comparator group for full vesting.
Bellways TSR was above the upper quartile and therefore the awards vested in full.
The comparator group comprised Barratt Developments PLC, The Berkeley Group plc, Bovis Homes Group PLC, Persimmon plc, Redrow plc and Taylor Wimpey plc plus Crest Nicholson plc, McCarthy & Stone plc, Taylor Woodrow plc and Wilson Bowden plc, all of whom have now delisted.
b For awards made on 16 January 2008, two performance conditions applied to separate parts of the award: i 50 % of the award is based on a TSR condition against other housebuilders but, instead of a ranking approach comparing Bellways TSR to that of each other company an Index is created out of the TSR of the other housebuilders in the group.
Bellways TSR is compared to that of the Index.
If Bellways TSR matches that of the Index, 25% of the TSR part of the award vests reduced from the previous vesting profile whereby 33% of the award vested at median.
Full vesting is achieved for 7.5% per annum outperformance of the Index.
The companies comprising the Index for the awards made on 16 January 2008 are Barratt Developments PLC, The Berkeley Group plc, Bovis Homes Group PLC, Persimmon plc, Redrow plc and Taylor Wimpey plc.
This TSR condition has been achieved as at 96.6% of the maximum.
ii The remaining 50% of the award is based on a range of ROCE based targets requiring average annual ROCE of 15% per annum at which point, 25% of the ROCE part of the award would vest to 22% per annum for all of this part of the award to vest.
Awards vest on a straight-line basis in between these two points.
This performance condition has not been achieved.
c For the awards made on 4 November 2008 and 29 October 2009 the TSR part of the award applied as the sole performance condition compared to the same companies as for the award made on 16 January 2008. d Regardless of TSR performance, no part of the TSR element of an award will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that the Companys TSR over the performance period reflects underlying financial performance.
The market price of the ordinary shares at 31 July 2010 was 579.50p and the range during the year was 560.00p to 927.50p.
There has been no change in the above potential future beneficial interests between 31 July 2010 and the date of this report.

They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors Report, Directors Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Companys website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the directors in respect of the Annual Report and Accounts We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: Q the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole: and Q the Directors Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the issuer and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
