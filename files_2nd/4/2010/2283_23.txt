the trustee of the bodycote uK pension scheme has not reviewed the basis on which transfer values are calculated in order to allow for the change of statutory indexation from rpi to Cpi.
therefore, the above figures continue to assume rpi increases in deferment and payment.
However, when the trustee reviews transfer value assumptions, this is likely to lead to a change in actuarial assumptions that would reduce the transfer value entitlement at the year end to 627,000.
