68 Experian Annual Report 2010 Governance Report on directors remuneration The report has been drawn up in line with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 and the UK Listing Authority Listing Rules.
The Remuneration Committee: members, role and frequency of meetings 63 Details of the Committee members, the scope of their role and frequency of meetings can be found in the corporate governance statement.
Working with advisers In making its decisions, the Committee consults with the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, the Group HR Director and the Global Head of Reward who are invited to attend meetings of the Committee as appropriate.
The Chief Financial Officer is also consulted in respect of performance conditions attaching to short and long-term incentive arrangements.
No executives are present when their own remuneration arrangements are being discussed.
The Committee has access to independent consultants to ensure that it receives objective advice.
In 2007, Deloitte LLP Deloitte were appointed by the Committee as independent advisers and they continued to act during the year under review.
Deloitte also provided unrelated advisory and tax services to the Group during the year.
Kepler Associates Kepler were also appointed by the Committee in 2007 and, during the year under review, provided advice and valuation data for Experians current and proposed executive remuneration arrangements and also provided advice on target calibration for the short and longterm incentive plans.
Kepler do not provide any other services to the Group.
Linklaters LLP provided legal advice in respect of incentive plan design and interpretation.
Remuneration philosophy Experians remuneration philosophy is that reward should be used to drive long-term, sustainable business performance.
In this regard, the Remuneration Committee aims to have in place a remuneration policy for Experian which is consistent with its business objectives and is designed to: pay market-competitive base salary levels: provide competitive performance-related compensation which influences performance and helps attract and retain executives by providing the opportunity to earn commensurate rewards for outstanding performance, leading to longterm shareholder value creation: apply demanding performance conditions to deliver sustained profitable growth in all our businesses, thereby aligning incentives with shareholders interests, setting these conditions with due regard to actual and expected market conditions: provide a balanced portfolio of incentives - both cash and share-based - which align both short-term one-year and longer-term three-year performance such that sustainable growth and value are delivered for our shareholders: drive accountability and transparency and align remuneration with the interests of shareholders: and deliver competitive benefits to underpin the other components of the remuneration package.
Consistent with the policy, the Committee compares the Experian remuneration arrangements with those of other relevant organisations and companies of similar size and scope to Experian.
The remuneration arrangements are also reviewed in light of changing market conditions, which have continued to be challenging over the year under review.
Performance-related incentives are targeted at upper quartile levels for outstanding performance to produce a highly leveraged package but only if the Groups stretching growth objectives are attained.
Experian is committed to performance-related pay at all levels within the organisation and the Committee takes into consideration the remuneration arrangements throughout Experian when determining those for the executive directors.
Summary of remuneration arrangements for 2010 11 Each year the Committee reviews remuneration arrangements to ensure they remain suitable in the light of both internal and external factors.
This year, the Committee concluded that the key elements of our arrangements remain aligned with the core principles of remuneration policy and long-term strategy, but that it was appropriate to make certain changes to ensure all elements of the package effectively incentivise executives to drive long-term performance and create shareholder value.
The main changes to remuneration arrangements are summarised below.
Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements 2 11 12 51 52 84 85 160 Experian Annual Report 2010 Governance 69 The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the overall quantum of the remuneration package for executive directors relative to relevant market benchmarks and has concluded that no grants will be made to executive directors under the Experian share option plan in 2010.
This plan remains part of the suite of long-term incentives which the Committee may choose to use in subsequent years, if circumstances warrant this.
The Committee has also considered again the performance measures used across all incentive plans and decided to include cumulative operating cash flow as an additional performance measure for the co-investment plan CIP.
Performance targets for awards to be made in 2010 have been increased from those for the awards made in 2009 to reflect the improving economic climate.
The revised arrangements will reduce the proportion of incentives which are determined with reference to profit based performance measures.
Further details of how remuneration arrangements were operated during 2009 10 and are intended to be operated going forward are set out in the following pages.
Service contracts Each executive director has a rolling service contract which can be terminated by the Group giving twelve months notice.
In the event of termination of the directors contract, any compensation payment is calculated in accordance with normal legal principles, including the application of mitigation to the extent appropriate in the circumstances of the case.
Further details are 82 provided in the section titled 'Executive directors service contracts'.
Remuneration of executive directors Each element of reward is important and has a specific role in achieving the aims of the remuneration philosophy.
The combined potential remuneration from annual bonus and share-based incentives outweighs the other elements and is subject to performance conditions, thereby placing much of it at risk.
In fair value terms, the proportion of the executive directors total remuneration excluding pension and benefits which is variable is approximately 74%, as illustrated.
Fair value of executive director remuneration Fixed Variable: short-term Variable: long-term Fixed remuneration Base salary and benefits To assess the appropriate market salary for a role, external remuneration consultants provide benchmark data to the Remuneration Committee.
Executive directors salaries are benchmarked against the mid-market of executive directors from the companies in the FTSE 100 Index and other global comparators, reflecting the markets from which Experian recruits talent.
These include, but are not limited to, international companies of a similar size and geographic scope, companies in the financial services and related industries and companies with significant operations in the same markets as Experian for example, North America.
Before making a final decision on individual salary awards, the Committee assesses each directors contribution to the business to reflect individual performance and experience as well as the average pay increase awarded for other employees in the Group.
The Chief Executive Officer CEO has not received an increase in base salary since 1 April 2007 and the other executive directors last received a base salary increase on 1 April 2008.
The Committee reviewed salaries in early 2010 and.
taking into account the factors described above, approved increases as detailed below: Salary to Salary from 31 March 2010 1 April 2010 Don Robert US$1,400,000 US$1,450,000 Paul Brooks 460,000 475,000 Chris Callero US$900,000 US$930,000 In addition to base salary, executive directors receive certain benefits-in-kind including a car or car allowance, private health cover and life assurance.
These are set at market norms for each role.
70 Experian Annual Report 2010 Governance Report on directors remuneration continued Summary of remuneration The Remuneration Committee selects performance measures that are designed to be aligned with the Groups strategic goals and that are transparent to directors and shareholders.
Each element of remuneration is designed to support the achievement of different corporate objectives, as outlined in the following table.

No grants are being made under this plan in 2010.
Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements 2 11 12 51 52 84 85 160 Experian Annual Report 2010 Governance 71 Pensions The pension age is 60 for directors with defined benefit arrangements which broadly provide a pension of two thirds of final salary, ill health and dependants pensions in addition to life assurance cover during the period of employment.
Incentive payments such as annual bonuses are not pensionable.
The Group has had arrangements in place for a number of years which were designed to ensure that UK directors who were affected by the 1989 HM Revenue and Customs earnings cap were placed in broadly the same position as those who were not.
With the agreement of the trustees of the pension scheme, the Group decided to retain a notional earnings cap for its existing and future employees, with the exception of new senior executives who are pensioned on full basic salary up to the Lifetime Allowance.
The Experian Pension Scheme was closed to new members on 31 December 2008, subject only to exceptions approved by the Remuneration Committee on a case by case basis.
The Group has put security in place for the unfunded pension entitlements of UK executives affected by the earnings cap, by establishing Secured Unfunded Retirement Benefits Schemes SURBS.
Further details are provided under the disclosure of the arrangements for each director.
In the US, Experian provides a Personal Investment Plan 401k which all US employees, including directors, are eligible to join.
This is a defined contribution arrangement to which participants are able to contribute up to 50% of salary, up to a maximum salary and participant contribution limit established by the IRS, each calendar year.
Variable remuneration Annual bonus plan and co-investment plan Annual bonuses are awarded for achieving profit growth targets.
The Committee believes that linking incentives to profit growth helps to reinforce Experians growth strategy.
The maximum bonus opportunity for executive directors is 200% of base salary.
However, this level of annual bonus is only payable if Experians financial performance surpasses stretching financial targets designed to deliver exceptional results to shareholders.
During the year, Kepler advised on the calibration of these targets using benchmarks that reflect stretching internal and external expectations.
The benchmarks used include: broker earnings estimates: earnings estimates for competitors: straight-line profit growth consistent with median upper quartile shareholder returns over the next three to five years: latest projections for the current year: budget: strategic plan: and long-term financial goals.
From 2009 onwards, executive directors have been offered the opportunity to defer receipt of between 50% and 100% of their bonus and invest it in Experian shares invested shares under the Experian co-investment plan CIP.
The invested shares are matched with an additional award of shares matching shares with the maximum match being calculated on a 2:1 basis.
The maximum matching opportunity is determined by the Committee at the time the matching share awards are made, taking into account overall company performance and the fair value of total remuneration.
The release of invested shares and matching shares is deferred for three years and the release of the matching shares is subject to performance conditions which are measured over a three-year period.
Dividend equivalents accrue on these awards.
If a participant resigns during the three-year period they will forfeit the right to the matching shares and the associated dividends, although they would be entitled to retain any invested shares.
2008 09 CIP awards The executive directors elected to defer 100% of their annual bonus earned in respect of the 2008 09 financial year into the CIP and were given the opportunity to match their deferral on a 1:1 basis.
Details of the awards made are given in the table titled GUS and Experian co-investment plans and Experian reinvestment plans.
The release of the matching shares awarded in June 2009 is subject to the achievement of growth in PBT of 3% per annum on average, measured over a three-year period.
The Committee selected PBT as the performance metric for the matching shares in order to incentivise participants to drive sustained profit growth in line with the long-term business strategy.
72 Experian Annual Report 2010 Governance Report on directors remuneration continued 2009 10 bonus The Remuneration Committee set stretching targets for the annual bonus in 2009 10 which required broadly upper quartile levels of performance in order for maximum bonus to be earned.
In what continued to be an extremely challenging business environment for both Experian and our clients, the performance of the Group exceeded the stretching performance targets set by the Committee.
In the light of this excellent achievement, in uncertain and testing market conditions, maximum bonus is payable to the executive directors in respect of 2009 10.
The executive directors have all elected to defer 100% of their bonus earned in respect of the 2009 10 financial year into the CIP.
For this year, the Committee has determined that matching shares will be awarded on a 2:1 basis.
It is intended that the release of 50% of the matching share awards will be subject to the achievement of a growth in PBT performance condition and will vest as shown in the table below.
The Committee considers growth in PBT to be an appropriate measure as this represents one of the key drivers of the business and is aligned with Experians core growth strategy.
Average annual growth in PBT over three years Percentage of award vesting Less than 5% 0% 5% 25% 11% 100% Between 5% and 11% Between 25% and 100% pro rata This level of growth in PBT is expected by the Committee to be broadly equivalent to upper quartile performance In order to broaden the success factors against which long-term performance is assessed, it is intended that the other 50% of the matching share awards will vest subject to the achievement of a stretching three-year cumulative operating cash flow target.
This target has been calibrated to be similarly stretching as the growth in PBT ranges shown above and is based on a cash conversion rate of at least 90% on average, representing what is expected by the Committee to be broadly equivalent to upper quartile performance.
The Committee considers cumulative operating cash flow to be an appropriate measure as it is a key metric for the business, particularly in the more challenging economic climate.
2010 11 bonus It is intended that annual bonus arrangements and the operation of the CIP for executive directors will remain unchanged for the 2010 11 financial year.
The final performance conditions and targets for matching shares awarded under the CIP will be determined shortly before the awards are made in June 2011 and will be disclosed at the appropriate time.
However, the Committee undertakes to ensure that any targets, whilst they must be seen as achievable to retain and motivate executives during the deferral period, must be sufficiently stretching to deliver significant shareholder value.
Experian performance share plan Experian PSP The Experian PSP was approved by GUS plc shareholders at the Extraordinary General Meeting EGM held on 29 August 2006.
Performance shares are Experian shares for which no exercise price is payable.
Shares are allocated subject to performance conditions, which are measured over a three-year performance period, with any vesting occurring three years from the date of grant.
Performance conditions for awards under the Experian PSP will be determined by the Committee in advance of grant.
2009 10 Experian PSP awards 80 Details of Experian PSP awards made to executive directors in June 2009 are given in the table titled Performance share plans.
75% of these awards are subject to a growth in PBT performance condition measured over a three-year period as shown in the table below.
Average annual growth in PBT over three years Percentage of award vesting Less than 4% 0% 4% 25% 8% 100% Between 4% and 8% Between 25% and 100% pro rata This level of growth in PBT was expected by the Committee to be broadly equivalent to upper quartile performance, at the time of grant Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements 2 11 12 51 52 84 85 160 Experian Annual Report 2010 Governance 73 The remaining 25% of the awards made in June 2009 is subject to a total shareholder return 'TSR' performance condition, with vesting according to the percentage extent to which Experians TSR outperforms the TSR of the FTSE 100 Index, as shown in the table below.
The Remuneration Committee determined that TSR was an appropriate performance measure as it represents value delivered for our shareholders relative to our peers.
TSR of Experian over three years Percentage of award vesting Below that of FTSE 100 Index 0% Equal to that of FTSE 100 Index 25% At least 25% above that of FTSE 100 Index 100% Between equal to and 25% above that of FTSE 100 Index Between 25% and 100% pro rata In addition, vesting of these awards will be subject to satisfactory ROCE performance, to ensure that earnings growth is delivered in a sustainable and efficient way.
2010 11 Experian PSP awards For awards to be made in 2010 11, it is intended that 75% of any award will be subject to a growth in PBT performance condition and will vest as shown in the table below: Average annual growth in PBT over three years Percentage of award vesting Less than 5% 0% 5% 25% 11% 100% Between 5% and 11% Between 25% and 100% pro rata This level of PBT growth is expected by the Committee to be broadly equivalent to upper quartile performance It is intended that the remaining 25% of any award will be subject to the same relative TSR performance condition as applied to the awards made in June 2009 see above.
In addition, vesting of any awards made in 2010 11 will be subject to satisfactory ROCE performance.
Experian share option plan The Experian share option plan was approved by GUS plc shareholders at the EGM held on 29 August 2006.
Grants were made to executive directors under this plan in June 2009.
However, following a review of the remuneration package for the executive directors, the Committee has concluded that no grants will be made under this plan in the coming financial year.
Use of the Experian share option plan in the future will remain under review by the Committee.
2009 10 Experian share option plan grants 79 Details of Experian share option plan grants made to executive directors in June 2009 are given in the table titled Share options.
Vesting of these options is subject to the achievement of the following growth in EPS performance condition: Average annual growth in EPS over three years Percentage of option grant vesting Less than 4% 0% 4% 25% 8% 100% Between 4% and 8% Between 25% and 100% pro rata This level of performance was expected by the Committee to be broadly equivalent to upper quartile performance, at the time of grant In addition, vesting of these grants will be subject to satisfactory ROCE performance.
For each of the long-term incentive plans, external consultants will be used to calculate whether, and the extent to which, the performance conditions have been met.
74 Experian Annual Report 2010 Governance Report on directors remuneration continued Experian sharesave plans All executive directors and employees of the Company, and any participating subsidiaries in which sharesave or a local equivalent is operated, are eligible to participate if they are employed by the Group at a qualifying date.
The UK sharesave plan provides an opportunity for employees to save a regular monthly amount, over either three or five years which, at the end of the savings period, may be used to purchase Experian shares for up to 20% below market value at the date of grant.
Outcome of performance testing determined in 2009 10 GUS performance share plan In June 2006, executive directors received a share award under the GUS performance share plan with a face value of one times salary.
On the demerger of Experian and Home Retail Group from GUS plc in October 2006 demerger these awards were automatically exchanged for equivalent awards over Experian shares.
The performance condition for these awards was TSR over the period from demerger to 31 March 2009 relative to the comparator group adopted by Experian at demerger see below.
A threshold level of vesting of 40% of the award was available if Experians TSR was at the median of the comparator group, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% of the award vesting for upper quartile performance or better.
The Committee tested the performance condition at the end of the period and determined that Experians TSR was at the 65th percentile of the comparator group and, as a result, 76% of these awards vested in June 2009.
Details of the number of shares which were released to the 80 directors are given in the table titled Performance share plans.
Experian performance share plan At demerger, executive directors received a share award under the Experian PSP with a face value of two times salary.
The vesting of 50% of these awards was subject to achievement against a sliding scale of growth in PBT performance condition.
A threshold level of vesting of 25% of this part of the award was available for average growth in PBT of 7% per annum over a three-year period, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% of this part of the award vesting for average PBT growth of 14% per annum.
The vesting of the remaining 50% of these awards was subject to the performance of Experians TSR relative to the following group of comparator companies as set at the award date : Acxiom Fair Isaac Harte-Hanks Alliance Data Systems Fidelity National Financial IAC Interactive Corp Bisys Group Fimalac Moodys Capita Group First American Reuters Group Choicepoint First Data Thomson Dun & Bradstreet Fiserv Total System Services Equifax Global Payments A threshold level of vesting of 25% of this part of the award was available if Experians TSR over a three-year period was at the median of the comparator group, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% of this part of the award vesting for upper quartile performance or better.
The Committee tested the two performance conditions at the end of the performance periods and determined that: Experians average annual growth in PBT over the performance period was 13.2% and as a result 91.4% of the awards subject to this performance condition will vest: and Experians TSR over the performance period was at the 65th percentile relative to the comparator group and as a result 70% of the awards subject to this performance condition will vest.
The vesting date for these awards is 11 October 2011.
Details of the number of shares which will be released to the executive 80 directors on this date are given in the table titled Performance share plans.
Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements 2 11 12 51 52 84 85 160 Experian Annual Report 2010 Governance 75 Experian reinvestment plan Awards to executive directors under the 2004 and 2005 cycles of the GUS co-investment plan and North America co-investment plan were reinvested in awards under the Experian reinvestment plan and North America reinvestment plan at demerger to ensure that directors remained fully aligned with the performance of the demerged business.
Matching awards of shares were made under these plans, the release of which is subject to the achievement of performance conditions, the retention of reinvested shares and continued employment.
A threshold level of vesting of 30% of this part of the award was available for average growth in PBT of 7% per annum over a three-year period, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% of this part of the award vesting for average PBT growth of 14% per annum.
This part of the matching award will vest in two equal tranches on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant.
The remaining 50% of the matching award vested as to 50% on the third anniversary of grant and vests as to 25% on each of the fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant.
The Committee tested the PBT performance condition, at the end of the performance period, and determined that Experians average annual growth in PBT over the performance period was 13.2% and as a result 92% of the awards subject to this performance condition will vest on the applicable vesting dates.
Details of the number of shares which will be released to the 81 executive directors are given in the table titled GUS and Experian co-investment plans and Experian reinvestment plans.
GUS executive share option scheme Options granted in June 2006 under the GUS executive share option scheme were automatically exchanged for equivalent options over Experian shares on demerger.
Vesting of these options was subject to Experians average annual growth in EPS exceeding the UK Retail Price Index by at least 4% per annum over a three-year performance period.
The Committee tested this performance condition, at the end of the performance period, and determined that it was achieved and so these options vested 79 in June 2009.
Details of the number of shares under option held by the directors are given in the table titled Share options.
The Committee considers that the outcome of the various performance conditions described above is appropriate given the overall performance of the Group since demerger.
76 Experian Annual Report 2010 Governance Report on directors remuneration continued Performance graph The Committee has chosen to illustrate the TSR for GUS plc until demerger and Experian plc for the period since listing on 11 October 2006 to 31 March 2010 against the FTSE 100 Index.
The FTSE 100 Index is the most appropriate index against which TSR should be measured as it is a widely used and understood index of leading UK companies.
Value of 100 invested in GUS Experian Value of 100 invested in GUS Experian and the FTSE100 on 31 March 2002 and the FTSE100 on 31 March 2005 250 160 140 200 120 100 150 80 100 60 40 50 20 0 0 March 02 March 03 March 04 March 05 March 06 March 07 March 08 March 09 March 10 March 05 March 06 March 07 March 08 March 09 March 10 Performance as GUS to 6 October 2006 Performance as Experian from 6 October 2006 FTSE 100 The above graphs show that, at 31 March 2010, a hypothetical 100 invested in GUS, and subsequently Experian, would have generated a total return of 193 compared with a return of 134 if invested in the FTSE 100 Index on 31 March 2002, and a total return of 142 compared with a return of 138 if invested on 31 March 2005.
With respect to Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee is satisfied that environmental, social and governance risks are not raised by the incentive structure for senior management and do not inadvertently motivate irresponsible behaviour.
Meeting obligations under share-based incentives Obligations under Experians employee share plans may be met using either shares purchased in the market or, except for rolledover awards under certain GUS schemes, newly issued shares.
The current policy is that, where possible, all awards will be satisfied by the purchase of shares, or from shares previously purchased, by the employee trusts.
The policy will remain under regular review.
The rules of the Experian share plans are in line with the guidelines set out by the ABI regarding dilution.
Shareholding guideline The Committee believes that it is important that executives should build a significant shareholding to align their interests with those of shareholders.
Therefore, the Committee has established guidelines under which the CEO should hold the equivalent of two times his base salary in Experian plc shares and other executive directors one times their base salary, including shares held under the CIP and the reinvestment plan.
Each of the executive directors meets these guidelines.
Value of 100 invested in March 2002 Value of 100 invested in March 2005 Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements 2 11 12 51 52 84 85 160 Experian Annual Report 2010 Governance 77 Remuneration of non-executive directors The Boards policy on non-executive directors remuneration is that: Fees should reflect individual responsibilities and membership of board committees: Remuneration should be in line with recognised best practice and be sufficient to attract, motivate and retain high calibre non-executives: Remuneration should be a combination of cash fees paid quarterly and Experian shares bought annually in the first quarter of the financial year until the non-executive directors individual shareholding requirement is met see below : Experian shares should be included in the non-executive director package to help align the interests of non-executive directors with those of shareholders: Non-executive directors do not receive any benefits-in-kind with the exception of the Chairman who has the use of a company car and private healthcare.
The fees of the non-executive directors were initially set in November 2006, following demerger.
The first review of these took place in late 2009 taking into account market practice in FTSE 100 companies, anticipated number of days worked, tasks and responsibilities.
As a result of this review non-executive directors fees were increased, with effect from 1 October 2009, to the amounts detailed below.
Non-executive directors fees from 1 October 2009 Base fee 120,000 Plus additional fees for: Senior Independent Director 22,000 Chair of Audit Committee 35,000 Chair of Remuneration Committee 27,000 The Chairman's terms have been amended to recognise that Experian is no longer his primary chairmanship and consequently his annual fee has been reduced to 350,000 with effect from 1 April 2010.
Experian requires its non-executive directors to build up a holding in the Companys shares equal to their annual fee.
One quarter of their net annual fee is used to purchase shares in the Company each year until they reach this holding: such shares 83 are included in the table titled 'Directors interests'.
Any tax liability arising from these arrangements is the responsibility of the individual director.
Non-executive directors do not participate in any Experian share plans.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts but each has a letter of appointment with no provision for any termination payment.
Each appointment is for a renewable three-year term but may be terminated by either party on one months written notice six months notice in the case of the Chairman.
The information set out in the remainder of this report has been subject to audit.
