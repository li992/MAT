Governance Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2010 Report of the Remuneration Committee Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee is chaired by Robert Farnes with Simon Neathercoat, Stuart Corbyn, Donald Newell and June fide Moller serving throughout the year.
Stephen Young joined the Committee on 2 August 2010.
None of the members who have served during the year had any personal interest in the matters decided by the Committee, or any day-to-day involvement in the running of the business and, therefore, are considered to be independent.
The Committees responsibilities include determining remuneration packages for the executive Directors and selected other senior executives.
It also oversees the operation of the Groups bonus scheme and performance share plan and considers whether the schemes encourage the taking of excessive business risk.
The full terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Companys website.
Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS a trading name of Aon Corporation was retained to provide independent assistance to the Committee regarding the setting of salaries and the operation of the performance share plan and bonus scheme.
In particular, HNBS determine entitlements under the bonus scheme and the extent of vesting of outstanding share awards and ensure that the measures used for both schemes are comparable and consistent.
HNBS did not provide any other services to the Group during the year.
No Director had any involvement in determining his own remuneration although some of the matters considered by the Committee were discussed with John Burns.
The Company Secretary acted as secretary to the Committee.
Remuneration policy The key aims of the Committees remuneration policy for senior executives are: to ensure that the Company attracts, retains and motivates executives that have the skills and experience necessary to make a significant contribution to the delivery of the Groups objectives: to incentivise key executives by use of a remuneration package that is appropriately competitive with other real estate companies taking into account the experience and importance to the business of the individuals involved, whilst also having broad regard to the level of remuneration of the Companys senior management and in similar sized FTSE 350 companies.
The Committee also took account of the pay and conditions throughout the Company noting that the constituent parts of the employees remuneration package were similar to those of the Directors and that the average pay increase awarded for 2011 was in line with the basic increase made to the Directors: to align, as far as possible, the interests of the senior executives with those of shareholders by providing a significant proportion of the Directors total remuneration potential through a balanced mix of short and long-term performance related elements, that are consistent with the Groups business strategy and desired risk profile: and to ensure that incentive schemes are subject to appropriately stretching performance conditions and designed so as to be consistent with best practice.
Elements of remuneration package A full review of executive remuneration arrangements was last carried out by HNBS during 2007 and a revised remuneration structure applied from 2008.
This structure has now operated for three years and the Committee will consider whether there is a need to review it during 2011.
The key elements of the structure are outlined below: a Base salary and benefits Base salaries for executive Directors are reviewed annually by the Committee with changes being effective from 1 January.
At the review carried out in December 2010, the Committee agreed a basic increase of approximately 5% for 2011 which took into account the excellent results that the management team had produced over the past year and the competitive nature of the market for top performing executives in the sector.
82 Governance Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2010 The Committee continued its practice of awarding recently appointed Directors an additional salary increase above the basic increase, as a reflection of their increasing experience and importance to the business, so as to move them over time to an appropriate market benchmark.
At the December 2010 review, the Committee agreed an additional 10,000 increase for David Silverman and Damian Wisniewski which closes the gap between their salaries and that of the other Directors but which still leaves a differential.
The executive Directors receive a pension contribution worth 20% of base salary to a defined contribution scheme or a salary supplement in lieu of this contribution.
The principal benefits in kind comprise a company car and medical insurance.
b Annual bonus The annual bonus structure has been unchanged since 2008 and the Committee will consider whether there is a need to review it during 2011.
For 2010 the scheme offered a maximum bonus potential for John Burns and Simon Silver of 150% of salary and for the other executive Directors, 125% of salary.
Any bonus worth up to 100% of salary is paid in cash.
Any bonus earned above 100% of salary is compulsorily deferred in shares with half released 12 months after the award and the remainder released 24 months after the award.
These shares will be potentially forfeitable if the executive leaves prior to the share release date.
The bonus is based 75% on two annual financial measures, namely net asset value NAV growth compared to the total return of properties in the IPD Central London Offices Total Return Index and total return being NAV growth plus dividends measured against that of other major real estate companies.
An additional 25% is available for the Committee to award at its discretion.
Provision has been made for a bonus for 2010 of 87.5% 2009: 62.5% of the maximum potential.
In making this award, the Committee has given due regard to the performance measures mentioned above, the Groups total return for the year and the other achievements outlined earlier in the report and accounts.
c Long-term incentives The Groups Performance Share Plan PSP was established in 2004, with a number of changes approved by shareholders at the 2008 AGM.
During 2011, when the PSP in its current form will have been through a complete three-year cycle, the Committee will consider whether there is a need to review the scheme.
The maximum permitted annual award of shares under the plan is 200% of salary with a higher limit of 300% of salary for use in the event of exceptional circumstances such as recruitment.
The Committees policy for 2010 was to limit awards to no more than 175% of salary for John Burns and Simon Silver and 150% of salary for the other Directors.
83 Governance Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2010 Report of the Remuneration Committee Vesting of awards under the PSP will normally occur to the extent that pre-set performance targets have been satisfied provided that, in usual circumstances, the executive is still employed at the end of the three-year vesting period.
Special rules apply where an employee retires during the three-year vesting period, in which case their award will be adjusted to reflect the time that they were employed during the vesting period.
Performance targets for awards granted in 2010 were as follows: 50% of an award will be determined by the Companys total shareholder return TSR compared to that of the companies listed below: Land Securities plc Quintain Estates and Development plc British Land plc Workspace Group plc Hammerson plc Big Yellow Group plc Segro plc St Modwen Properties plc Great Portland Estates plc Capital & Regional plc Shaftesbury plc Minerva plc Capital Shopping Centres Group plc TSR will be measured over a single three-year performance period from the date of grant and will be calculated by comparing average performance over three months prior to the start and the end of the performance period.
TSR calculations are performed independently for the Committee by HNBS.
50% of an award will be determined by the Companys NAV growth compared to the return from properties in the IPD Central London Offices Total Return Index over the performance period.
Performance will be measured over a single three-year period from the start of the financial year in which the award is granted.
Vesting will be on the basis outlined below: TSR performance NAV growth performance Vesting Percentage Below median Below median 0% Median Median 25% Upper quartile Out-perform median by 5% p. a.
100% Intermediate performance Intermediate performance Pro-rata between 25% and 100% This mix of measures is felt by the Committee to be appropriate as it rewards executives for achieving above market levels of growth in asset value and above market returns to shareholders.
The Committee will have discretion to reduce the extent of vesting in the event that it considers that performance against the relevant measure of performance whether TSR or NAV growth is inconsistent with underlying financial performance.
Awards will be satisfied by either newly issued shares or shares purchased in the market.
Any use of newly issued shares will be limited to corporate governance compliant dilution limits contained in the scheme rules.
Details of outstanding share entitlements under the scheme, along with associated performance conditions, are set out on page 87 in table 2.
84 Governance Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2010 Shareholding guideline Following the independent review in 2007, and in line with best practice, the Company has a share ownership guideline for executive Directors requiring them to retain at least half of any share awards vesting from 1 January 2009 as shares after paying any tax due on the shares until they have a shareholding worth at least 100% of their salary 200% of salary for the CEO.
David Silverman and Damian Wisniewski, who have both recently joined the Board and therefore not received any shares from the Groups performance share plan, have yet to reach the guideline.
Service contracts The service contracts of John Burns and Simon Silver are dated 20 May 1997 whilst those of Nigel George and Paul Williams are dated 31 March 1999 and that of David Silverman 2 January 2008.
These contracts have no stated termination date but require 12 months notice of termination by the Company or six months notice by the executive.
A provision is included whereby the Company will pay, by way of liquidated damages, a cash amount equivalent to 12 months salary, benefits in kind and a pension contribution or salary supplement of at least 20% of basic salary.
No defined contractual entitlement to compensation arises from a change of control of the Company.
Damian Wisniewskis service contract is dated 2 February 2010.
In addition to terms similar to those of the other Directors, his contract includes certain post termination restrictions and a mitigation clause.
Under this mitigation clause, instead of paying the liquidated damages provision outlined above, the Company can, at its discretion, alternatively make monthly payments throughout the notice period until the executive obtains an alternative employment at which point except in the event of the Company giving notice following a change of control monthly payments cease or are reduced depending upon the value of remuneration arising from the alternative role.
If this clause is used by the Company, monthly payments would comprise one-twelfth of the total of his annual basic salary, annual pension contribution, annual value of benefits in kind and 20% of his maximum bonus potential.
Chairman and non-executive Directors The remuneration for the Chairman is set by the full Board.
The remuneration for nonexecutive Directors, which consists of fees for their services in connection with Board and Board committee meetings and, where relevant, for additional services such as chairing a Board committee, is also set by the whole Board.
Neither the Chairman nor non-executive Directors are eligible for pension scheme membership and do not participate in the Companys bonus or equity-based incentive schemes although the Chairman has a number of unexercised options granted under the historic LMS Executive Share Option Scheme.
The non-executive Directors do not have service contracts and are appointed for three year terms which expire as follows: John Ivey, 12 December 2011: Robert Farnes, 31 March 2012: Stuart Corbyn, 23 May 2012: June fide Moller and Donald Newell, 31 January 2013: Simon Neathercoat, 28 February 2014 and Stephen Young, 9 July 2013.
Mr Rayne has a letter of appointment, which runs for three years, expiring on 31 January 2013.
In addition to his fee as Chairman, it provides for a car, driver and secretary, together with a contribution to his office running costs.
His letter of appointment also contains provisions relating to payment in lieu of notice, which are similar to those for the executive Directors.
John Burns served as a non-executive Director of Berendsen plc formerly The Davis Service Group Plc until 24 September 2010 and received fees of 30,000 2009: 40,000.
In accordance with the Committees policy, the fees were retained by Mr Burns.
The weighted average exercise price of awards that either vested or lapsed in 2010 was nil 2009: nil.
The weighted average market price at the date of vesting in 2010 was 13.81 2009: 12.08.
87 Governance Derwent London plc Report & Accounts 2010 Report of the Remuneration Committee For all awards granted under the PSP: half of the shares vest based on TSR performance relative to a comparator group of companies.
This element will only vest if the Committee is also satisfied that the TSR performance reflects underlying financial performance: and half of the shares vest based on NAV performance compared to properties in the IPD Central London Offices Total Return Index.
The TSR comparator group comprises the constituents, as at the date of grant, of the FTSE All-Share Real Estate Index for awards granted up to 2007 and a defined comparator group of real estate companies for subsequent awards.
The comparator group for 2011 is likely to be the same as for 2010 which is set out earlier in this report.
25% of awards subject to the TSR target vest for median performance over the three-year performance period increasing to full vesting for upper quartile performance.
If the Groups NAV performance matches that of the median performing property in the Index over the three-year performance period 25% of awards subject to the NAV target vest.
Vesting increases on a sliding scale to full vesting for matching the return from the upper quartile performing property in the Index awards up to 2007 or for out-performing the median performing property by 5% per annum subsequent awards.
The performance criteria in respect of the 2007 award were measured on 7 April 2010 and showed a vesting percentage of 47.58%.
The balance of the awards lapsed.
As required, before allowing any vesting, the Committee considered whether the Groups TSR performance reflected its underlying financial performance.
Having considered a range of key financial indicators, including profits and NAV performance, the Committee concluded that this was the case.
Share option schemes Details of the options held by Directors and employees under the Groups share option schemes at 31 December 2010 are given in table 3 opposite.
Disclosure relating to a further share option scheme in which the Directors do not participate is given in note 13.
The weighted average exercise price of options that lapsed during 2010 was 13.63.
