The latter is an unfunded arrangement, but with appropriate security provided via a fixed charge on a hotel asset.
As an alternative to these unfunded arrangements, a cash allowance may be taken.
Following recent changes to UK pensions legislation, the pension provision is under review.

Non-Executive Directors pay policy and structure Non-Executive Directors are paid a fee which is approved by the Board, taking into account fees paid in other companies of a similar complexity.
These fees also reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of the roles.
Accordingly, higher fees are payable to the Senior Independent Director who chairs the Audit Committee and to the Chairmen of the Remuneration and Corporate Responsibility Committees, reflecting the additional responsibilities of these roles.
Non-Executive Directors fee levels are reviewed annually.
In the final quarter of 2010 an increase of 2% for the Chairman and 3% for the Non-Executive Directors was agreed by the Board to be effective from 1 January 2011.
This increase is broadly in line with anticipated salary increases for executive and senior management employees across the wider organisation.

Service contracts Policy The Remuneration Committees policy is for Executive Directors to have rolling contracts with a notice period of 12 months.
Messrs Cosslett, Abrahamson, Kinsell and Solomons have service agreements with a notice period of 12 months.
All new appointments are intended to have 12-month notice periods.
However, on occasion, to complete an external recruitment successfully, a longer initial notice period reducing to 12 months may be used, in accordance with the Combined Code.

In the event of any early termination of an Executive Directors contract, the policy is to seek to minimise any liability.
Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment.
David Websters appointment as Non-Executive Chairman, effective from 1 January 2004, is subject to six months notice.
The dates of appointment of the other Non-Executive Directors are set out on page 43.
