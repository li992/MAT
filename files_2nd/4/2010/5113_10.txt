This is taken to be the thirty companies larger and smaller than easyJet by reference to comparative market capitalisation: a formal appraisal of their contribution to the business: the competitive environment: and pay and employment conditions of employees elsewhere within easyJet.
Annual bonus All Executive Directors participate in an annual bonus scheme.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity of the Chief Executive during the year was 200% of salary pro-rata for service, with a 100% of salary maximum for other senior executives.
The maximum will remain at these levels during the financial year ending 30 September 2011.
Bonus targets are aligned with easyJets strategic objectives, with specific targets around its key performance indicators.
Performance targets for Executive Directors annual bonus opportunities in the financial year ending 30 September 2011 are as follows: Measure % maximum bonus opportunity Profit before tax 70% Customer satisfaction targets 10% Operating costs exc fuel per seat at constant currency 10% On time performance 10% The safety of our customers and people underpins all of the operational activities and is required to be achieved before any bonus would be payable and therefore is not included in the bonus targets.
Performance against the targets set for the year under review is discussed below.
Long Term Incentive Plan The easyJet Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP provides for annual awards of performance shares and matching shares.
The plan was approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2005 and amended at the 2008 AGM.
The annual award limit for performance shares is 200% of basic salary.
Matching share awards are linked to the investment of up to 50% of annual bonus earned into easyJet shares, which are then matched on a 1:1 gross basis.
Performance and matching share awards vest three years after grant, subject to continued employment and the satisfaction of challenging performance conditions which to date have largely related to ROE performance.
Overview Business review Governance Accounts Other information easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2010 45 LTIP awards to be granted in 2011 The policy for future LTIP awards and targets will be determined in line with the outcome of reviews being undertaken by management and the Board which are described in the Chief Executives statement.
An announcement relating to grants and targets will be made as soon as is practical.
Any significant changes in policy will be discussed with shareholder representative bodies and major shareholders.
A full summary of the performance targets applying to all subsisting LTIP awards are set out on pages 51 and 52.
All-employee share plan participation easyJet encourages share ownership throughout the Company by the use of a Share Incentive Plan and a Sharesave Plan.
Take up of the schemes remains very positive with over 80% of eligible staff now participating in one or more of the plans.
Executive Directors may also participate in these plans.
They are summarised in the Corporate responsibility section on page 30.
Previous share awards Executive Share Option Scheme The LTIP replaced the existing Approved and Unapproved Executive Share Option Schemes the ESOS as the primary long term incentive arrangement for the Executive Directors and other senior employees although the ESOS was retained for flexibility, but lapsed on 30 October 2010.
There were no grants during the year.
Shareholding guideline Executive Directors are required to build up a shareholding equivalent to 175% of basic salary.
There is no specific timeframe within which the shares must be acquired.
However, executives must retain all the shares acquired on the vesting of LTIP awards net of tax until the required holding is attained.
Any shares already held by the executive will count towards the guideline, as will shares bought by participants as Investment Shares under the Matching Shares element of the LTIP, together with any shares held on an executives behalf through participation in the Companys all-employee share plans.
These shares are owned absolutely by the executive.
Any unvested performance shares or matching shares granted under the LTIP will not count since they are subject to future performance.
For senior executives who report to the Executive Management Team and receive LTIP awards, a 50% share ownership guideline will apply.
Pension contributions easyJet makes a contribution for Executive Directors to a defined contribution pension scheme of 7% of basic salary.
While individuals are not obliged to make a contribution, easyJet operates a pension salary sacrifice arrangement where individuals can exchange their salary for Company paid pension contributions.
Where individuals exchange salary this reduces easyJets National Insurance contributions.
easyJet credits half of this saving to the individuals pension currently 6.4% of the amount exchanged.
Executive Directors cannot contribute to a pension during their first three months of employment.
Where an Executive Director has reached the lifetime pension limit, a cash alternative may be paid with the agreement of the Committee.
easyJet plc 46 Annual report and accounts 2010 Report on Directors remuneration continued Benefits easyJet has a very low level of benefits provision and does not include, for example, company cars or final salary pensions as part of the package.
External appointments Executive Directors are permitted to accept one appointment on an external board or committee so long as this is not deemed to interfere with the business of the Group.
Any fees received in respect of these appointments are retained directly by the relevant Executive Director.
No fees were received by Executive Directors during the year ended 30 September 2010.
Service contracts Carolyn McCalls contract provides for 12 months notice by either party.
On termination by the Company, she will continue to receive 12 monthly instalments of basic salary and benefits that would cease to the extent that commensurate alternative employment was taken up.
Alternatively, by mutual consent, the Company may elect to make a payment to the value of 12 months basic salary only.
With regard to bonus, this would be included in a termination payment, payable on a pro-rata basis, only for the period of time served from the start of the financial year to the date of termination and not for any period in lieu of notice.
Any bonus paid would be subject to the normal bonus targets, tested at the end of the year.
Chris Kennedys notice period is six months by either party, during the first six months of employment and twelve months by either party thereafter.
There is no provision for bonus to be paid on termination.
In recognition of the Companys low level of benefits provision and to avoid consolidation into basic salary, the absence of future benefit provision equivalent to those provided under previous employment arrangements for Chris Kennedy was compensated by two payments each of 25,000, one made in the month of joining July 2010 and one made three months later October 2010.
As payments are intended to compensate future benefit provision, these will be repayable if Chris Kennedy were to leave within 12 months of his start date.
The arrangements in place for Andrew Harrison throughout the year under review are set out on pages 48 and 49.
The Companys relationship with its Non Executive Directors is governed by letters of appointment.
The Non Executive Directors are appointed for a period not exceeding three years and their appointment may be terminated with three months notice without compensation.
Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou did not have a letter of appointment and his appointment was of no fixed term.

When determining the remuneration of Non Executive Directors, account is taken of practice adopted in competitors and other similar sized organisations, committees chaired and anticipated time commitment.
With the exception of the Chairman and Deputy Chairman during the year under review the NEDs received a basic annual fee of 45,000 in respect of their Board duties.
A further fee of 10,000 is paid in respect of Chairmanship of Board committees.
The annual fee for the Chairman from 1 January 2010 was 250,000 and for the Deputy Chairman was to 70,000.
Fees are regularly reviewed and are set by the Board to attract individuals with the required range of skills and experience.
The basic annual fee increased to 55,000 with effect from 1 October 2010.
The fee for the Chairman increased to 300,000 and the fee for Deputy Chairman increased to 90,000.
Total shareholder return Given the nature of easyJets operations, the Committee does not consider that there is a suitable comparator group against which to measure total shareholder return.
However, for completeness, the following graphs show the Companys performance compared with 1 the performance of the FTSE 250 and that of a group of European Airlines.
The FTSE 250 has been chosen as it is the FTSE index in which the Company resides.

easyJet plc 48 Annual report and accounts 2010 Report on Directors remuneration continued Directors emoluments audited Details of emoluments, paid or payable by easyJet to the Directors of easyJet plc who served in the financial year ended 30 September 2010 are as follows: Pension contributions Salary fee Bonus Total Total Figures stated in 000s 2010 2010 2010 2009 2010 2009 Executive Carolyn McCall OBE appointed 1 July 2010 178 178 Chris Kennedy appointed 1 July 2010 150 150 Andrew Harrison resigned 30 June 2010 2,266 250 2,516 1,633 47 53 Non Executive Sir Michael Rake 205 205 23 Sir David Michels 135 135 114 David Bennett 55 55 55 Sven Boinet 45 45 45 John Browett 45 45 45 Professor Rigas Doganis 45 45 45 Keith Hamill 55 55 29 Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou resigned 14 May 2010 Bob Rothenberg resigned 14 May 2010 28 28 8 3,207 250 3,457 1,997 47 53 The table above excludes gains as a result of the exercise of share options.
Details of share options and share awards and any movements during the year are shown on pages 50 and 51.
The annual basic salary of Carolyn McCall OBE is 665,000, plus 48,000 as a cash alternative to a contribution to a pension scheme made by the Company.
The annual basic salary for Chris Kennedy is 400,000.
The salary payment for Andrew Harrison includes a payment in lieu of notice on the termination of his contract of 1,221,300, plus revised remuneration arrangements from 1 April 2010 as detailed below.
Pension contributions for Andrew Harrison shown above are greater than 7% of salary for the period to 31 March 2010 as they include half of the National Insurance saving resulting from employee contributions made through easyJets salary exchange scheme equivalent to 6.4% of the sum sacrificed.
Andrew Harrison exchanged 96,000 for additional pension contributions in the period to 31 March 2010 2009: 195,000.
Arrangements relating to Andrew Harrison Andrew Harrison ceased to be Chief Executive and stepped down from the Board on 30 June 2010.
As was reported in the 2009 Report on Directors remuneration, the Company entered into a retention agreement with him on 15 May 2009.
The terms and reasons for that agreement are set out in that report.
This agreement effectively expired on 31 March 2010.
Under the terms of this agreement, Andrew Harrison continued to receive a salary equivalent to 590,000 per annum plus benefits.
In the event of resignation or termination other than for bad leaver reasons at any time after 31 March 2010 he would also receive a lump sum payment in lieu of notice in respect of his full 12 month notice period with no obligation to mitigate the payment.
The payment in lieu of notice would include the value of 12 months salary: 12 months pension contributions and the on target level of annual bonus equivalent to 100% of salary.
In addition, he would receive a pro rata bonus for the year in which he left the Company based on performance and would be considered a good leaver in relation to an LTIP award made in December 2007, subject to a pro rata amount for his period of service.
The maximum number of shares which could vest under this provision was 193,325.
The agreement precluded the Company from commencing the recruitment of his successor until after 31 March 2010.
Overview Business review Governance Accounts Other information easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2010 49 In order to enable the Company to operate its activities as an airline on the basis of appropriate management resources and structure while it undertook an effective recruitment process for a new Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, the Remuneration Committee subsequently approved a further fixed term agreement covering the period 1 April to 30 September 2010.
Under these arrangements, Andrew Harrison agreed that he would continue to act as Chief Executive until 30 June 2010 and that he would be available for consultation and to provide advice as requested for the three months to 30 September 2010.
The total remuneration for the period from 1 April to 30 September 2010 was fixed at 750,000 plus a bonus of 250,000.
Also, under these arrangements he agreed that the previous entitlement under the 15 May 2009 agreement relating to the 2007 LTIP of up to 193,325 shares would not apply.
For reasons explained below in the section 2010 Bonus, Andrew Harrison has also agreed to waive a potential claim for a pro rata bonus for the period 1 October 2009 to 31 March 2010 which could have amounted up to 590,000.
The amount shown in the Directors emoluments table above for Andrew Harrison includes a lump sum payment of 1,221,300 under the 15 May 2009 agreement and the amounts paid under the 1 April 2010 fixed term agreement covering the period 1 April to 30 September 2010.
Directors remuneration 2010 There was a pay freeze in place during the year under review for Executive Directors and the wider senior management population.
Remuneration for the new Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer was agreed with them to secure their recruitment and is consistent with the Companys remuneration policies.
2010 Bonus The results and performances targets for the year were not achieved in full.
However, these were materially affected by the substantial disruption following the eruption of the Eyiafjalla volcano, which increased costs by 27.3 million and resulted in lost contribution estimated at approximately 30 million.
In view of this it was decided that certain management and staff with bonus entitlements, excluding the Executive Management Team, would benefit from discretion on the profit element of their bonuses at 50% of their maximum entitlements.
The Executive Management Team including Carolyn McCall OBE and Chris Kennedy who joined the Company in July 2010 informed the Board and Remuneration Committee, that in view of the effect of the further operating problems over the summer and the resulting difficulties experienced by customers and staff, they did not consider that it would be appropriate for its members to receive bonuses, even if it were deemed to be appropriate to make an adjustment for the effect of volcanic ash.
Accordingly, no bonus will be paid to the Executive Directors or other members of the Executive Management Team.
Had it been appropriate for the discretion applied to certain management and staff to be applied in the same way for Executive Directors, Carolyn McCall OBE would have received 159,000 and Chris Kennedy would have received 48,000.
Andrew Harrison would have received 267,000. easyJet plc 50 Annual report and accounts 2010 Report on Directors remuneration continued Directors interests The following Directors hold direct interests in the share capital of easyJet: 30 September 30 September Number 2010 2009 Carolyn McCall OBE 6,141 Chris Kennedy 6,141 Sir Michael Rake 6,200 3,100 Sir David Michels 12,100 12,100 David Bennett 10,000 10,000 John Browett 4,705 4,705 Professor Rigas Doganis 13,600 13,600 Executive Directors are deemed to be interested in the shares held by the easyJet UK Employee Share Ownership Trust, the easyJet Overseas Employee Share Ownership Trust, the Long Term Incentive Plan and the Share Incentive Plan Trust the Trusts.

As is usual market practice, the option price for SAYE awards is determined by the Committee in advance of the award, by reference to the share price following announcements of results.
Note 2: Participants purchase shares monthly under the plan and the Company provides one matching share for each share purchased.
These are first available for vesting three years after purchase.
The potential vesting of outstanding awards if the performance were based on that for the year under review is nil as shown at the end of this section.
The performance criteria for vesting of these share options and awards are as follows: Discretionary Share Option Schemes A&B Based on the average annual growth in earnings per share EPS, where no shares vest if EPS growth is less than RPI plus 5%, 30% vest where EPS growth is RPI plus 5% and 100% vest where EPS growth is RPI plus 20%.
Straight-line vesting will occur between these points.

The December 2007 and February 2008 award is due to be tested against the performance targets in December 2010.
The award has performance targets relating to return on equity achieved in the year ended 30 September 2010.
However, the targets have not been met and the award will not vest.

Position against dilution limits easyJet complies with the 5% in five years guidelines on share dilution and current dilution is 2.5%.
It is the intention of easyJet to source shares by market purchase, rather than by the issue of new shares.
The requirement for shares under all current share-based schemes will be met by market purchased shares LTIP, Share Saving and Share Incentive Plans.
The remaining options under the Discretionary Share Option Schemes will continue to be met from new issue shares.

Company law requires the Directors to prepare accounts for each financial year.
Under that law the Directors have prepared the Group and parent company accounts in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing these accounts, the Directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the accounts: and prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Companys transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the accounts and the Report on Directors remuneration comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group accounts, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
