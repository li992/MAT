Directors pension entitlements The pension entitlements of the Directors from the Dairy Crest Group Pension Fund, a defined benefit scheme, which have been excluded from the table on page 41, were as follows: Accumulated Accumulated Increase Transfer value total accrued total accrued in accrued of increase Length of pension at pension at pension during in accrued service 31 March 2010 31 March 2009 the year pension Age years 000 000 000 000 M Allen 50 19.3 64 55 9 131 A S N Murray 49 7.2 29 22 7 82 The transfer value of each Directors accrued benefits at the end of the financial year is set out below.
The transfer values shown in the table have been calculated in accordance with actuarial guidance note GN11.
Transfer values are determined based on financial conditions at the date of calculation including stock market values and bond yields.

The accumulated total accrued pension at 31 March 2010 also includes service accrual to November 2010 and, in the case of Mark Allen, represents the deferred pension prior to any reduction resulting from his decision to draw early retirement benefits and the early retirement lump sum.
Mark Allen decided to draw benefits from 31 March 2010 and will receive a pension of 33,227 pa and a cash lump sum of 221,510.
Mark Allens accrued pension immediately before electing to draw it early was 63,931 pa including seven months additional pension service.
The future pension payable is less than 63,931 pa due to the application of an early retirement reduction and because some pension was exchanged for a lump sum cash payment.
The transfer value of 957,000 at 31 March 2010 is made up of 735,000 in respect of pension and 222,000 in respect of the cash lump sum.
Part of the increase in the transfer value over the year is due to the benefit being valued as an immediate pension rather than a deferred pension.
The 131,000 transfer value of the increase in accrued pension for Mark Allen shown above is made up of 111,000 in respect of pension accrued during the year and 35,000 in respect of cash less 15,000 in respect of contributions.
The pension value of 111,000 is calculated based on a pension of 5,000, representing the increase of 9,000 after reductions for early retirement and exchange of pension for cash lump sum.
The increase in accrued pension excludes the increase in pension due to inflation.
The rate of inflation over the year was negative.
As a result, pensions have not increased from last year as it is not possible to grant a negative increase to pensions.
