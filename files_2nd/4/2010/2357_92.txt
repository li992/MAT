For clarity, the pre-sacrifice amount has been shown in the table above.
The Companys annual salary review date is 1 January each year.
2010 was a year of continued pay restraint within the Group.
An allowance of 2% of salary roll was provided for general staff, which was applied on a merit basis effective from 1 January 2011.
Against this background, the Remuneration Committee undertook a review of David Ritchies salary, which had not been increased since July 2008, having regard to the significant contribution made to the Groups performance since his appointment in July 2008.
As a result the Committee decided to increase his salary by 3.75% to 415,000 from 1 January 2011.
The salary of Jonathan Hill was set at 240,000 on appointment on 23 August 2010 and will next be reviewed on 1 January 2012.

Taking account of the strong leadership provided to the Board and the value of the Chairmans industry and sector knowledge, the fee was increased by 4% to 130,000 from 1 January 2011.
Separately, the Board reviewed fees paid to the non-executive directors, again supported by appropriate independent advice.
As a result, the fee for the Deputy Chairman and the non-executive director base fee were not increased, but the fees for the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee were increased to take account of increased workload and responsibility.
John Warrens fee has therefore increased from 47,000 to 48,000 and Colin Holmes fee has increased from 45,000 to 48,000 both from 1 January 2011.
The level of fees paid to the Chairman and the non-executive directors were last reviewed in 2008.
