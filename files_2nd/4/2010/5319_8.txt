80% Variable Pay Whilst ultimately Total Remuneration is the key benchmark, Fixed and Variable pay cannot be too far away from the adopted policy if Total Remuneration is to be around benchmark levels.

Options granted under the LTIOP are subject to a performance condition based on TSR, with no options vesting unless TSR performance is above the median for the selected comparator group, and full vesting only occurring if Electrocomponents is first out of the 14 in that group in terms of TSR.
The Committee chose TSR because it felt it was the measure most closely aligned to shareholders interests.
TSR performance is measured over a minimum period of three years from the date of grant but, if the target is not met at all, the period is extended to four, and then five years from a fixed base.
Once the target has been met in part, however, performance is not subsequently retested and the unvested part of the option lapses.
If the target has not been met at all at the end of five years, the option lapses.
For performance at or below median, no part of the option will vest.
25% of the option will vest for performance of one position above the median with full vesting if the Company is ranked first in the comparator group selected.
Between those two levels, the option will vest on a sliding scale.
