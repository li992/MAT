Governance Greene King plc Annual Report 2010 75 diRectoRS RemuneRAtion RepoRt Composition of the remuneration committee The remuneration committee is appointed by the board.
During the year the committee comprised Norman Murray chairman of the committee, Ian Durant and Jane Scriven.
All of the committee members during the year were regarded by the board as independent non-executive directors.
Terms of reference and reporting The committee determines, and annually reviews, all elements of executive directors remuneration and the remuneration of other senior executives.
It recommends the fees that should be payable to the chairman to the board.
It approves the contracts of the executive directors and any compensation arrangements arising from their termination.
It also approves all LTIP allocations and oversees the operation of all of the companys share based plans.
The committee is made aware of the salary levels of the senior management team and of the incentive arrangements operating throughout the company.
During the year the composition of the board changed with David Elliott leaving the company and Justin Adams and Jonathan Lawson stepping down from the board whilst retaining their management responsibilities.
There are now two executive directors and five other managing directors.
The committee retains overall responsibility for determining the remuneration of all of these.
Advisers to the remuneration committee The committee has taken external advice on general remuneration matters and comparator information from Hewitt New Bridge Street, who do not provide any other services to the company.
Advice and assistance is also obtained, where appropriate, from the companys brokers, Deutsche Bank.
During the course of the year legal advice has been obtained from law firms Pinsent Masons and Osborne Clarke.
The committee also received internal advice from Rooney Anand, chief executive, in determining appropriate remuneration and incentive packages for the other executive directors.
Remuneration policy The company operates in a highly competitive market and must attract, motivate and retain high quality directors.
The committee considers current market practice and makes comparisons with turnover, market capitalisation and operational details against a selection of other companies.
The committee is made aware of and has regard to pay and conditions elsewhere within the group and endeavours to ensure that pay rises for executive and non-executive directors are generally comparable with those being applied elsewhere in the group.
A range of bonus plans are operated for managers throughout the group, and all staff with the requisite qualifying service have access to the companys share save scheme.
No director makes a decision relating to his own remuneration.
Individual directors leave the meeting when their own remuneration is being discussed.
A significant proportion of each executive directors potential remuneration is performance-related, thus aligning the directors interests with those of shareholders and encouraging performance at the highest levels.
The committee has considered whether there are any aspects of the remuneration policy which could inadvertently encourage executives to take inappropriate risk and has concluded that the policy remains appropriate in this regard.
Components of directors remuneration The remuneration package of each executive director consists of the following elements: Annual pay Annual pay reflects the responsibilities, market value and sustained performance level of executive directors.
Pay is reviewed annually or when a change in responsibility occurs.
The pay rises for the executives in 2009 10 were considered appropriate taking account of the performance of the company, the individuals and the relative market positioning of the individuals packages and it should be remembered that in general there were no pay rises in 2008 9.
Benefits in kind The range of taxable benefits available to executive directors is listed on page 78. bonus Bonus payments are determined by the remuneration committee and awarded where justified by performance.
For the financial year 2009 10, the executive directors were eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus, the maximum amount being 100% of annual pay, for the achievement of stretch targets.
This is based on pre-determined performance metrics, set at the start of the year, based on group profitability and personal business unit metrics as relevant.
The committee retains the right to adjust targets to ensure that the effects of changes to capital employed within particular business units, as well as other external factors, are taken into account, to ensure overall fairness.
The committee believes that the policy for any adjustments continues to be applied in an even-handed manner and ensures that there is a better link between reward and performance overall.
For 2010 11 and future years, the committee is proposing to increase the annual bonus potential from 100% of salary to 150% of salary for the executive directors, with a similar level of increase for other senior executives below board level.
Bonus up to 100% of salary will be determined by reference to group profit and personal objectives similar to those set out above.
The additional 50% uplift will be subject to a new performance condition based on challenging levels of annual economic profit performance in excess of the companys strategic plan, with all of any additional bonus being invested in shares or granted in the form of nil cost options, which would be deferred or, as the case may be, not exerciseable for a period of one year and which would be forfeited in the event that the relevant director or employee leaves the group, other than as a good leaver, during that time.
The enhanced element of the annual bonus will provide improved strategic linkage through the use of an economic profit-based performance condition.
Economic profit operating profit before exceptional items less the weighted average cost of capital multiplied by capital employed has been introduced into the business as a key performance driver and its use in the annual bonus will complement this strategic focus.
The use of economic profit will also provide a balance to the rest of the bonus plan, which is based on profit before tax and exceptionals and specific business unit-related targets.
The additional focus on economic profit will encourage the management team to target medium-term decisions to ensure growth by: ensuring better deployment of capital expenditure: encouraging further improvements in relation to returns on invested capital: freeing up assets where higher economic profit can be gained by the group: and extracting higher returns from existing uninvested assets.
The board has identified additional economic profit above the 2009 strategic plan which is potentially deliverable over the next two financial years, after discounting the effect of the recent rights issue.
In future years, this proportion of the annual bonus will continue to be dependent on the achievement of stretch economic profit targets.
If this economic profit is achieved, it will benefit shareholders and the committee therefore considers that senior management should be incentivised to deliver this additional performance.
There will be disclosure in the directors remuneration report each year of the basis on which the bonuses were payable.
Greene King plc Annual Report 2010 76 diRectoRS RemuneRAtion RepoRt Components of directors remuneration continued bonus continued The committee considers that the additional bonus potential will provide a stronger incentive to deliver against a rounded range of performance metrics and will improve motivation, lock-in and alignment of interest with the additional element being deferred in shares.
In addition, the additional bonus will be reclaimable by the company in exceptional circumstances of misstatement or misconduct.
The committee has consulted with a number of the companys key shareholders and incorporated their feedback in relation to this proposal.
Pension and life assurance The pension arrangements for Rooney Anand and Ian Bull are on a defined contribution basis.
They both have self-invested personal pension schemes to which the company makes a contribution.
The contribution rates are 25% for Rooney Anand and 20% for Ian Bull.
No element of remuneration other than annual pay is treated as pensionable.
Both executive directors participate in a group death-in-service insurance scheme, with death benefits in excess of the HMRC maximum being provided through additional insurance.
The cost of this insurance is disclosed as a non-cash benefit in the emoluments table on the opposite page.
long-term incentives Long-term incentives form an important part of the companys remuneration for its directors and senior employees, with historically a mix of options and LTIP awards being granted, subject to performance conditions based on earnings per share EPS.
Following a review in 2009 10, the companys policy is now to grant only LTIP awards.
Directors are now entitled each year to an LTIP award equivalent to a maximum of 133% of base salary.
It is the companys intention that no further share options will be granted under the companys executive share option scheme, although the committee retains the flexibility to use the scheme again in exceptional circumstances should the business strategy support its future use.
The companys major shareholders will be consulted if any proposed future use of share options would result in an increase in total remuneration.
Awards are made in the form of restricted forfeitable shares, on which dividends are payable.
Dividends in respect of future awards will accrue until vesting and will be released to the directors to the extent that the awards vest.
Since 2009 10 all LTIP awards have been subject to two performance measures, namely an adjusted free cash flow condition and an earnings per share condition, both measured over a three year period.
There is a 60:40 weighting in favour of the cash measure, given the importance of cash management as a medium term business priority.
The use of two separate performance conditions is designed to provide a rounded assessment of the companys financial performance.
For the three-year adjusted free cash flow measure the same definition as was used in 2009 10 will be adopted: net cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditure.
Net cash flow from operating activities will include the impact of changes in working capital, and interest and tax payments, but will be adjusted to exclude exceptional items at the discretion of the remuneration committee in consultation with the audit committee.
The capex related deduction in the free cash flow measure will be for capital expenditure on properties that were within the estate at the beginning of the performance measurement period, where that capital expenditure has not been funded from property disposal proceeds.
Free cash flow has been chosen as a performance condition because converting EBITDA to positive cash flows to support debt repayment, continued investment in the business and the ongoing payment of dividends is a key measure for both management and shareholders.
The target range for the adjusted free cash flow performance target for the 2010 11 awards will be that the aggregate adjusted free cash flow of the company for the three financial years ending in April 2011, 2012 and 2013 must be more than 230.4m to vest at the minimum level and at least 270.4m to vest in full.
Measuring on an aggregate three-year basis rather than the more common approach of focusing on the end-year only of the three will ensure that there will be a focus on delivering cash across all three years.
The adjusted earnings per share part of the performance condition for awards granted in 2010 11 will be based on a sliding scale range of pence per share targets for the 2012 13 year end, with between 0% and 100% of that part of the award vesting depending on the extent to which the targets are met.
The committee does not consider it appropriate to disclose the range, but does consider it to be appropriately challenging in the current economic climate.
There will be disclosure of the conditions and the extent to which they have been achieved in the remuneration report at the time each award vests.
employee share schemes In common with all other employees, the executive directors are also entitled to participate in the sharesave and share incentive plan.
Further details of these schemes are given later in this report, together with the directors entitlements under them.
Remuneration from other company directorships Since September 2007 Rooney Anand has served as a non-executive director of Drive Assist Holdings Limited, a company unconnected with the group.
He is entitled to receive and retain for his personal benefit 40,000 per annum from that company by way of directors fees.
Governance Greene King plc Annual Report 2010 77 Remuneration for non-executive directors The fees paid to the chairman and the other non-executive directors are determined by the board as a whole.
They are agreed after taking external advice and making market comparisons, and relate to the services of the directors in connection with the companys business.
The non-executive directors do not have service agreements and cannot participate in the pension scheme, the bonus scheme or the share option schemes.
Service agreements Newly appointed executive directors are offered a service agreement with a notice period of one year.
In the event of the employment of an executive director being terminated, the committee would pay due regard to best practice and take account of the individuals duty to mitigate their loss.
Rooney Anand and Ian Bull, whose contracts with the company commenced on 6 August 2001 and 9 January 2006 respectively, are both subject to one year notice periods from the company.
Their contracts do not contain any additional terms relating to compensation for termination of employment.
The terms of Rooney Anands appointment as chief executive were agreed and set out in a letter dated 24 December 2004.
The contracts of Justin Adams, David Elliott and Jonathan Lawson, who ceased to be directors during the year, were also subject to one year notice periods.
Justin Adams and Jonathan Lawson, who remain managing directors of the Brewing Company and Local Pubs divisions respectively notwithstanding that they stood down from the board on 30 April 2010, were not paid any compensation in connection therewith.
David Elliott, who left the company on 31 January 2010 and ceased to be a director, was paid an amount of 266,000 in lieu of notice, in line with his contractual entitlement.
Non-executive directors are appointed pursuant to letters of appointment for three-year periods.

directors pensions Amounts paid or payable to the self-invested personal pension schemes of the executive directors made by the company in respect of the period are shown in the table below: 2010 2009 000 000 Rooney Anand 121 116 Justin Adams 46 46 Ian Bull 63 62 David Elliott 125 67 Jonathan Lawson 42 40 The amount above in relation to David Elliott includes 58,000 of contributions due for his service during the year and a further 66,500, being an additional one years contributions, payable in accordance with his contractual entitlements when he left the company.
Tim Bridge is a pensioner member of the groups defined benefit scheme.
His pension is equivalent to 1 45th of his final pensionable earnings for each year of service, with a pro rata payment for a part year, subject to HMRC limits.
His final pensionable earnings were those received immediately prior to him ceasing to be chief executive.
Two former directors receive additional pension income from the company.
John Bridge, who retired as a director on 31 December 1989, receives a pension of 26,000 pa in excess of his scheme entitlements and Bernard Tickner, who retired as a director on 27 August 1992, receives a pension of 21,000 pa in excess of his scheme entitlements.
As required by law, both of these figures are stated net of their company-funded pension in payment at 31 March 1997.
Share price during the period The closing price of the companys shares on 30 April 2010 being the last business day before the financial period end was 453.9p 2009: 490.37p, adjusted for the rights issue.
The closing price of the companys shares during the period ranged between 366.75p and 530.57p, adjusted for the rights issue.
Following David Elliotts departure on 31 January 2010, a proportion of the unvested options granted to him in 2007 and 2008 lapsed, as indicated, proportionate to the unexpired period from the end of his employment until the end of the performance period.
The remainder of the unvested options will vest on their original vesting date, subject to satisfaction of the performance conditions.
His vested options are exerciseable until 31 July 2010.
During the year, adjustments were made in respect of all outstanding options, both to the option price and the number of options held by each director, to reflect the impact of the rights issue completed in May 2009, to ensure that the aggregate exercise price of each option remains unchanged.
There were otherwise no changes made during the period to the terms and conditions of any options then outstanding, and no options were exercised during the period 2009: no changes made and no options exercised.
There have been no options exercised and no other changes to the date of this report.
Unvested options can only be exercised if a performance condition has been met.
This condition relates to the growth in audited adjusted earnings per share which must exceed RPI inflation by 4% per annum, measured over the period of three consecutive financial years of the company, starting with the year in which the award is granted.
Since the year end, the options granted in 2007 have lapsed, as a result of the remuneration committee having determined that the performance conditions applicable to those options have not been met.

The remainder of the awards will vest on their original vesting date, subject to satisfaction of the performance conditions.
As disclosed in the RNS announcements at the time of the awards, directors are entitled to receive dividends on their shares.
During the year the directors received dividends in the amounts set out below in respect of the 2007 LTIP awards which, as explained below, will be forfeited shortly on the third anniversary of their grant.
000 Rooney Anand 9 Justin Adams 3 Ian Bull 6 David Elliott 5 Jonathan Lawson 4 The market price of the shares on 9 December 2009 was 411.6p, although the number of shares comprising the award was determined by reference to the closing market price on 8 December 2009, namely 420.3p.
During the year the 2006 LTIP awards lapsed on the third anniversary of their grant as a result of the remuneration committee having determined that the performance conditions applicable to those awards had not been met.
The 2007 LTIP awards will also lapse on the third anniversary of their grant for the same reasons.
Total gains made by directors under the LTIP in the period ended 2 May 2010 therefore amounted to nil 2009: 522,720.
The 2008 LTIP awards will only vest if the companys growth in earnings per share is equal to or greater than the increase in RPI plus 3% per annum compound over the three consecutive financial years starting immediately before the award.
At this level, 25% of the award rounded down to the nearest 1,000 shares will vest.
100% of the award will vest if the companys growth in earnings per share is greater than the increase in RPI plus 8% per annum over the same three year period.
There is a pro-rata scale rounded down to the nearest 1,000 shares between the minimum level of RPI plus 3% and the maximum level of RPI plus 8%.
If the targets are not met, the award will lapse.
Governance Greene King plc Annual Report 2010 81 Audited information continued long-term incentive plan continued The 2009 LTIP awards will only vest to the extent that two separate performance targets are met, over the three financial years ending in April 2012.
A maximum of 60% of each award will vest if an adjusted free cash flow performance condition has been met.
The remaining 40% of the award will vest if an earnings per share performance condition has been met.
The target range for the adjusted free cash flow performance condition is that the aggregate adjusted free cash flow of the company for the three financial years ending in April 2010, 2011 and 2012 must be more than 190.0m to vest at the minimum level and at least 230.0m to vest in full.
The earnings per share performance condition sets a range for the EPS for the financial year ending in April 2012 which the remuneration committee considers to be sufficiently challenging in the current market conditions.
Details as to the extent to which the targets have been met and the awards have vested will be provided at the end of the three year performance period.
No changes were made during the period, or since the year end to the date of this report, to the terms and conditions of any awards then outstanding.
Save as set out above, no awards vested or lapsed during the period.
There have been no other changes to the date of this report.
Sharesave scheme The company has operated an HMRC approved sharesave scheme for a number of years.
Options are granted over the companys ordinary shares at an option price which, at board discretion, is at a discount of up to 20% of the closing price at the time of granting.
The company has historically granted all such options at a 20% discount.
The interests of directors in options granted under the sharesave scheme were as follows: Outstanding Granted Exercised Lapsed Outstanding Option as at 3 May during the during the during the as at 2 May price 2009 period period period 2010 p Rooney Anand Justin Adams 5,917 5,917 273.71 Ian Bull David Elliott 3,424 3,424 273.71 Jonathan Lawson 5,917 5,917 273.71 All relevant figures adjusted for the rights issue in May 2009 using a factor of c 1.245 in relation to the number of options and of c 0.802 in relation to the share price.
Following his departure, David Elliott has until 31 July 2010 in which to exercise a proportion of his options with his accrued savings.
Justin Adams and Jonathan Lawsons options can be exercised between 1 April and 30 September 2014.
All options outstanding at 2 May 2010 were granted at an option price below the year-end closing price.
Share incentive plan The directors beneficial interests in Greene King shares resulting from participation in the companys HMRC approved share incentive plan are reflected in their shareholding data in the directors report.
No award will be made in respect of the 2009 10 financial year 2008 9: no award.
Shareholders will be asked to vote on this remuneration report, as an ordinary resolution, at the companys AGM.
