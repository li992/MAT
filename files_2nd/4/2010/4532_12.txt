Section 3 Management and Governance Remuneration Report This Remuneration Report for the year ended 28 August 2010 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee on behalf of the board for approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 11 January 2011.
The report complies with the requirements of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority, Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 and the provisions of the 2008 Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
On 1 October 2010, Mark Rolfe was appointed as an independent non-executive director and he is a member of the Remuneration, Nomination and Audit Committees of the board.
Since Mr Rolfe was appointed post-year end, all regulatory disclosures will be included within next years annual report.
The terms of his appointment and remuneration arrangements are in line with those of other non-executive directors.
Part 1: Unaudited Information The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee comprises the following non-executive directors: Adam Crozier Committee Chairman, Dennis Millard, Sophie Turner Laing, Martina King who was appointed on 1 May 2010 and Nigel Northridge who was appointed a member on 3September 2010.
Details of non-executive directors experience and their other roles are set out in the directors biography section on page 37.
The Company Secretary is secretary to the Committee.
There were two meetings of the Committee during the year under review.
The individual attendance of the directors is detailed in the table within the Corporate Governance Report on page 43.
The Committee has responsibility for setting the remuneration of the executive directors and the Company Secretary, reviewing the bonus structure for senior managers below board level, reviewing the appropriateness and relevance of the remuneration policy and administering all aspects of any share incentives in operation for senior management.
The Committee is governed by formal terms of reference which are reviewed annually and can be downloaded from the Companys website at www.
com under the corporate governance section on the investors page.
Deloitte LLP Deloitte acted as external advisers to the Committee throughout the financial year, providing independent advice on directors remuneration and share incentives.
Deloitte also provides industry and comparative employee remuneration data to Debenhams management.
The Companys Chief Executive, Finance Director and Human Resources Director have also provided advice to the Committee during the year but not on matters relating to their own compensation or contracts.
Deloitte also provided unrelated advisory services in respect of corporate tax planning during the year.
The Remuneration Committee reviews external data produced through surveys and benchmarking from Deloitte about total remuneration in other comparable companies, and the elements of that total remuneration, in order to inform its consideration of the remuneration of Company executives.
During the year the Committee: Reviewed the executive directors remuneration packages: t Approved the executive directors bonuses for 2009: t Approved the executive directors bonus plan for 2010: and t Consulted with shareholders in relation to performance conditions to be operated for options awards made under the Companys t share schemes during the financial year and administered the awards made in November 2009.
Following the year end, the Committee also considered the operation of the Deferred Bonus Matching Plan and consulted with shareholders regarding this.
Remuneration Policy When determining remuneration policy and arrangements for executive directors, the Remuneration Committee considers pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group and that offered by other comparable companies to ensure that the pay of executive directors remains appropriate.
The Committee particularly takes into account pay increases throughout the Group when determining salary increases for executive directors.
It is the Companys policy to provide remuneration packages that will attract, motivate and retain high-calibre employees in a competitive retail market and, where possible, to do this in the most cost-effective way for the business.
In addition to basic salary and pension provision or equivalent cash contribution, the Company seeks to incentivise its executives and senior managers through an annual bonus scheme and through its share incentives when appropriate.
In 2009 there was a pay freeze for all senior management and the executive directors.
As disclosed last year, the pay freeze continued for the executive directors in 2010 whilst the salary reviews of senior management were reinstated.

To ensure the attraction and retention of the quality of individuals required to successfully run the business, the Committees policy is for base pay to be at or close to the market median of companies of a similar size and complexity.
In 2010 executive directors continued to take a pay freeze there already being no increase in 2009, whereas base salary throughout the Group increased by c. 2 per cent.
The Committee reviewed salaries during the year and concluded that, given the performance of executives in recent years, it would be appropriate to give a modest salary increase of 2 per cent with effect from 1September 2010.
Salary increases throughout the Group are of a similar level.
Executive Directors Bonus Schemes 2010 Bonus As disclosed in last years remuneration report, the annual bonus scheme for executive directors for 2010 was based on one measure: Earnings Before Interest and Tax EBIT to ensure the executive directors focused on achieving exceptional earnings performance and to provide a clear objective in a year where a renancing of the Companys debt was anticipated.
The maximum bonus potential for 2010 was 100 per cent of base salary.
Achieving an EBIT before exceptional items of 193.1 million would result in a maximum bonus payment of 100 per cent of base salary.
The Company achieved EBIT before exceptional items of 195.1 million representing growth of 7.1 per cent which resulted in bonus payouts of 100 per cent of salary.
The Committee believes that this represents exceptional performance in challenging economic circumstances and that the resulting bonus payments reect the value added for shareholders and in particular noted that despite the difficult market conditions experienced across the retail sector in the past two years, the Company has delivered five consecutive halves of profit growth.
The Committee has agreed that executives will be given the opportunity to defer up to 50 per cent of their post-tax bonus into shares and will be able to earn a matching award under the Deferred Bonus Matching Plan.
Further details are provided below.
2011 Bonus It is intended that the maximum bonus opportunity will remain at 100 per cent of base salary for 2011.
Now that the renancing of the business is complete, the Committee has determined that the performance measure for the 2011 bonus will revert to profit Before Tax and will be adopting this metric as a single measure.
The Committee believes that this measure is strongly aligned with shareholder value creation and will effectively incentivise executives to grow profit on an annual basis.
We cannot disclose the target for 2011 due to commercial sensitivities, but as for 2010 we will provide details of the target and performance against it in next years RemunerationReport.
The Companys Share Incentives In 2009 the Committee reviewed the performance measures for the PSP and the ESOP.
It was agreed that going forward PSP awards would be subject to stretching EPS targets and options granted under the ESOP would be subject to performance against ROCE targets.
The Committee believes that the combined use of performance share awards with an EPS measure and share options with a ROCE performance measure effectively incentivises management to achieve both share price and efficient earnings returns, goals which are aligned with the Companys long-term strategy and shareholder value creation.
The Committee consulted with major shareholders regarding these proposed measures who were generally supportive.
Following the review of targets, awards were made to Michael Sharp, the Deputy Chief Executive, in November 2009 the Chief Executive and the Finance Director having elected not to receive awards.
It is intended that the Deferred Bonus Matching Plan will be the primary long-term incentive vehicle for 2010 and it is currently intended that no awards will be granted under the PSP or ESOP to directors this year other than in exceptional circumstances.
52 Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Section 3 Management and Governance The Debenhams Deferred Bonus Matching Plan the DBMP The DBMP was approved by shareholders in 2006.
However, no awards have been made to date under the plan.
During the year the Committee reviewed the plan and consulted with the Companys major shareholders regarding its operation.
It was agreed that executives and approximately 400 members of the management team would be invited to invest to up 50 per cent of their net annual bonus earned in respect of 2010 into shares invested shares which will be held in trust for the duration of the performance period.
The terms of DBMP provide the ability for the participants to defer 100 per cent of their bonus.
However, the Committee determined that for the current year participation would be limited to 50 per cent of bonus earned.
If the participant remains in service for three years s he will, subject to the satisfaction of stretching performance targets, be eligible to receive a matching share award equal to the pre-tax amount of the bonus that has been invested, i. e. in this instance the matching award will have a maximum value of 50per cent of base salary.
If the performance target is not met at the end of the performance period, the matching share awards will lapse immediately invested shares will be retained by the participant and there will no opportunity to re-test the performance condition.
The Committee determined that for these matching awards earnings per share EPS would be used as the primary performance metric.
In addition, the vesting of awards would be subject to the achievement of an underpin level of return on capital employed ROCE performance.
The Committee considered that EPS is an appropriate measure as it incentivises strong earnings growth over a sustained period which is in line with our long-term strategy and the generation of future shareholder value.
The ROCE underpin ensures that profit performance remains sustainable and efficient.
An absolute EPS growth of 6 per cent per annum over the threeyear performance period will trigger 30 per cent vesting of the matching share award and an EPS growth of 12 per cent per annum will trigger 100 per cent vesting.
Targets triggered between 6 per cent and 12 per cent would result in vesting of the matching share award on a straight-line basis between 30 per cent and 100 per cent.
When setting these targets the Committee reviewed internal projections, analysts expectations and market practice and believes these targets to be sufciently stretching.
In addition, no portion of the award shall vest unless ROCE exceeds the cost of capital by 2 per cent.
Invitations under the DBMP will create alignment throughout the organisation with executives focusing on a common goal.
The Debenhams Performance Share Plan the PSP The Committee has discretion to grant awards under the PSP up to a maximum of 200 per cent of base salary to executive directors and other senior executives.
Up to 250 per cent of base salary may be awarded in exceptional circumstances e. g. for recruitment.
Michael Sharp was the only executive director to receive an award under the plan during the year.
His award represented 75 per cent of his salary.
Details of the award are disclosed on page 58 of this report.
Awards under the PSP comprise a right to receive free shares or a nil cost option.
The awards normally vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant and in the case of nil cost options must be exercised within six months of vesting subject to satisfaction of performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the time awards are granted and generally provided that the participant remains in employment.
In addition, in order for the award to vest, the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the underlying financial performance of the Company over the performance period is sufficient to justify the vesting of the award.
Historically awards have been subject to two performance targets, 50 per cent being based on the Adjusted Earnings Per Share growth of the Company above the percentage increase in the Retail Prices Index over a three-year performance period and the other 50 per cent being based on the Companys Total Shareholder Return against the weighted TSR of the FTSE 350 General Retailers Index over a three-year performance period.
If the performance condition s is are not met at the end of the performance period, 50per cent or 100 per cent as appropriate of the awards will lapse immediately without any opportunity to re-test the relevant performance condition.
As noted above, for awards granted in 2009 to Michael Sharp, the Committee determined that just one performance measure would apply, earnings per share growth.
The Committee believes that using this sole measure increases focus on delivering strong earnings growth and generating shareholder value throughout the performance period.

The awards granted in May 2008 to participants below the board have also lapsed since the performance conditions attaching to those awards were not satisfied as at 28 August 2010.
The Debenhams 2006 Executive Share Option Plan the ESOP The Committee has discretion to grant options to acquire shares to eligible employees.
Options with a face value of up to a maximum of 100 per cent of base salary can be granted under the plan.
Options may, in exceptional circumstances, be granted with a market value in excess of this amount at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Options can be granted in the form of unapproved options or Her Majestys Revenue & Customs approved options up to the prescribed limit, currently 30,000.
Michael Sharp was the only executive director to receive an option under the scheme during the year.
His options in the form of approved and unapproved options represented 75 per cent of his salary.
Details of the options granted are disclosed on page 58 of thisreport.
Share options are granted at the closing mid-market price on the day prior to the date of grant and normally become exercisable three years after grant, expiring seven years later.
The exercise of the options is subject to performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the time awards are granted.
Historically, options exercised under the ESOP have been subject to the Adjusted Earnings Per Share EPS growth of the Company increasing above the percentage increase in the Retail Prices Index RPI over a three-year performance period.
For the options granted in November 2009 the performance criteria was based upon the Companys Return on Capital Employed ROCE exceeding the Cost of Capital.
The Committee believes ROCE is an appropriate performance condition as it incentivises sustainable, efficient profit performance.
In addition, in order for the award to vest the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the underlying financial performance of the Company over the performance period is sufficient to justify the vesting of the award.
If the performance condition is not met at the end of the performance period the options will lapse immediately without any opportunity to re-test the relevant performance condition.
The table below sets out the performance conditions of ESOP options existing during the year: Date of grant Vesting criteria Performance condition over three-year period 12 November 2007 EPS growth RPI 3 per cent pa 100 per cent vesting against RPI growth 24 November 2009 ROCE ROCE Cost of Capital zero vesting against Cost of Capital ROCE Cost of Capital 30 per cent vesting ROCE Cost of Capital 5 per cent 100 per cent vesting Between these points the options vests on a straight-line basis between 30 per cent and 100 per cent No options under the ESOP were exercised during the year.
The options granted in November 2007 to participants below the board lapsed since the performance conditions attaching to those options were not satisfied as at 28 August 2010.
54 Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Section 3 Management and Governance Debenhams 2006 Sharesave Scheme the Sharesave Scheme Under the Sharesave Scheme, employees may be granted an option to acquire shares at a xed exercise price.
At the end of the savings period the employee may either exercise the option within six months of the end of the savings period using the savings contributions and bonus accumulated or have the savings and bonus repaid.
No options have been granted under this scheme and there is currently no intention to use the scheme.
The Debenhams 2008 Share Incentive Plan the Plan The Debenhams 2008 Share Incentive Plan is an unapproved plan operated by the Company.
This Plan is focused at key senior managers and executive directors do not participate in this Plan.
The first tranche of options granted under the Plan was awarded on 24 November 2009 for nil consideration.
These options were granted to a small number of key senior employees below board level to retain and incentivise those employees in the short to medium term and have an 18-month vesting period.
The Debenhams Retail Employee Trust 2004 The Trust The Debenhams Retail Employee Trust 2004 the Trust currently holds 1,413,536 shares in the Company.
715,000 shares held in the trust were allocated to participants as a result of the grant of options under the Debenhams 2008 Share Incentive Plan.
The Trust is also to be used to hold the invested shares of participants of the Deferred Bonus Matching Plan DBMP.
Dividends receivable on the shares held in the Trust, which are not subject to the DBMP, are waived on the recommendation of the Company.
Funding of Share Schemes It is the Companys current intention to satisfy any future requirements of its share schemes in a method best suited to the interests of the Company, either by acquiring shares in the market, or, subject to institutional guidelines, issuing new shares.
Where the awards are satisfied by newly issued shares, the Company will comply with ABI guidelines on shareholder dilution.
Current levels of shareholder dilution are 0.23 per cent 2009: 0.38 per cent of share capital.
Change of Control Generally, the rules of the Companys share schemes provide that in the event of a change of control, awards options would vest to the extent that the performance conditions where applicable are satisfied at the date of such event.
Any such early vesting would generally be on a time pro-rata basis.
Pension The directors are not members of a Company pension plan, except for Michael Sharp who is a deferred member of the Debenhams Executive Pension Plan.
Full details are disclosed on page 58 of this report.
However, under the terms of their contracts of employment, the executive directors are entitled to a salary supplement of 15 per cent of base salary in lieu of pension provision.
These amounts are disclosed in the directors emoluments table on page 57.

Each agreement is terminable by either party giving not less than 12 months written notice.
It is the Companys policy that the notice periods of executive directors should not exceed one year.
The Remuneration Committee has considered the financial consequences of early termination of directors service contracts: in order to limit and provide certainty in the event of termination of a contract without cause, the directors contracts contain liquidated damages clauses.
If the Company terminates the employment without due notice, other than in circumstances such as gross misconduct or other immediate justifiable cause, the Company is required to make a payment equal to the aggregate of the executive directors basic salary and the value of their contractual benets for the notice period together with a payment equal to the average of the annual bonus paid to the executive director in the two bonus years prior to the termination of employment.
The liquidated damages clause within service agreements of any future executive directors appointed to the board will exclude the requirement to make a payment by reference to any bonus payments made prior totermination.
Executive directors are entitled, in addition to salary, to other benets or equivalent cash allowances, the value of which is set out in the table of directors emoluments.
Such benets include company car and fuel as well as life, medical, dental and personal accident insurance together with product discount and personal financial advice.
Rob Templeman and Chris Woodhouses contracts permit each of them to hold up to two non-executive directorships in noncompeting companies and to retain payments received in respect of those other directorships.
Chris Woodhouse, who is Group non-executive Chairman of Gondola Group Limited, retained fees of 150,000 2009: 170,000.
