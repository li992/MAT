A resolution will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 16 November 2010 inviting them to approve this report.
Remuneration policy and arrangements The Remuneration Committee Responsibilities of the Committee include making recommendations to the Board on the Groups executive remuneration policy and determining, on behalf of the Board, specific remuneration packages for the executive directors and Chairman.
In doing so, the Committee takes into account pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Company and operates within agreed terms of reference which are available for inspection on the Companys website.
The Company complied with the provisions of the Combined Code 2008 on Corporate Governance, to be renamed the UK Corporate Governance Code relating to directors remuneration throughout the financial year except as is disclosed on page 67.
The Committee met four times in the past year to consider and agree, amongst other matters, Annual Incentive Plan performance and payments for the financial year ended 31 July 2009 Annual Incentive Plan structure and performance targets for the financial year ended 31 July 2010 remuneration arrangements for the new Finance Director follow-on long-term incentive arrangements to the Value Sharing Plan for the financial year ending 31 July 2011 framework of executive total remuneration principles to govern the Annual Incentive Plan for the financial year ending 31 July 2011 Committee terms of reference structure of the directors remuneration report for the financial year ended 31 July 2010 In 2009 10 the Committee consisted of: Stuart Chambers Chairman of the Committee Bruno Angelici from 1 July 2010 Donald Brydon David Challen Peter Jackson until 17 November 2009 Anne Quinn Kevin Tebbit Mr Brydon is absent when his own remuneration as Chairman of the Company is under consideration.
The Chief Executive attends meetings of the Committee by invitation: he is absent when his own remuneration is under consideration.
During the year, the Committee received material assistance and advice from the Chief Executive and the HR Director who is also Secretary to the Committee.
The Committee and the Company also received advice from Kepler Associates and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP.
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP was appointed by the Company to advise the Group on various legal matters during the year.
Remuneration policy The Committee applies a remuneration policy which has at its core the following objectives: to align the interests of executives with those of shareholders to focus on top-line growth, margin improvement and capital discipline to link a significant proportion of remuneration to financial and individual performance, both in the short term and long term to provide strong linkage between remuneration and performance to ensure total remuneration is market-competitive and helps attract and retain executives of the highest calibre.
It is the Companys policy to take in to accountthe pay and conditions of employees throughoutthe Group when determining directors remuneration.
During the year, the committee received a paper from the Group HR Director and noted the pay policy applicable in the Groups main areas of operation in determining that directors base pay should be frozen for the 2011 financial year.
Remuneration arrangements The remuneration of senior executives balances fixed, variable, short-term and long-term remuneration, and is reviewed each year on a total remuneration basis to ensure that executives continue to be appropriately incentivised to achieve the Groups objectives.
For 2009 10, executive directors remuneration comprised basic salary, benefits in kind, annual bonus and pension benefits.
In addition, executive directors and senior executives participate in share-based incentive schemes, which in 2009 10 included the Smiths Group Sharesave Scheme, the Smiths Group Co-Investment Plan CIP and a continued interest in the Smiths Group Value Sharing Plan VSP granted on 28 July 2008.
Other than under the CIP, no long-term incentive awards were granted to executive directors in the financial year ended 31 July 2010.

Value Sharing Plans VSPs The Group and divisional VSPs are long-term one-off incentive plans designed to reinforce Smiths strategy of focusing on shareholder value creation at the Group and divisional levels.
No grants were made under the VSPs during the financial year ended 31 July 2010.
Group VSP Messrs Bowman and Langston are participants in the Group VSP, which rewards executive directors and selected senior executives with a pre-determined number of shares for every 5m of value created above a hurdle over the three-year and four-year performance periods from 1 August 2008 or until a vesting event, if earlier.
On 28 July 2008 Mr Bowman was granted an award under which he will be entitled to receive 1,250 Smiths Group shares for each 5m of surplus value created in respect of each performance period.
On the same date Mr Langston was granted an award under which he will be entitled to receive 500 Smiths Group shares for each 5m of surplus value created in respect of each performance period.
In line with the Plan Rules approved by shareholders in July 2008, the Committee agreed that Mr Langston would retain a reduced interest in the Group VSP but the potential share entitlement under his award will be prorated for time served to the date of his retirement and will vest on the normal vesting dates subject to corporate performance.
TSR Element One-third of the award will depend on the growth, over each performance period, in Smiths market capitalisation plus net equity cash-flows to shareholders ie dividends plus share buybacks less share issues over and above the median total shareholder return of the FTSE 100 companies excluding financial services companies.
Participants will only be entitled to a vesting of shares under the TSR Element if the Committee is satisfied that this is justified by the underlying financial performance of the Company over the performance period.
Earnings Element The remaining two-thirds of each award will be determined by the growth, over each performance period, in adjusted Profit Before Tax PBT from a baseline PBT of 338.6m in 2007 08 times a fixed multiple of 12.0 plus net equity cash-flows to shareholders over and above a cost of equity hurdle return of 9.5% a year.
The Committee may reduce the payout of the Earnings Element if an acquisition results in a material reduction in return on invested capital.
No retesting of either performance condition is permitted.
Performance measure selection The Remuneration Committee believes that the combination of relative TSR and PBT provides the best balance between internal line-of-sight and shareholder alignment, between absolute and relative performance and between internal and external perspectives.
PBT is considered the best internal measure of Smiths financial performance as it is highly visible internally and regularly monitored and reported.
Relative TSR provides strong alignment with shareholders and the FTSE 100 index excluding financial services companies continues to be considered a relevant and robust indicator of the relative value created by Smiths management for its shareholders.
Divisional VSPs In addition to the Group VSP, the Committee has implemented divisional plans for each of the five divisions Smiths Detection, Smiths Medical, John Crane, Smiths Interconnect, and Flex-Tek.
The plans are along the same lines as the Group VSP to help focus the most senior divisional executives on maximising the value of their divisions and returning surplus cash to the Group.
75 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2010 Accounts Governance Risks and responsibility Operating and financial review Strategy Overview smi ar10 middle aw2:Layout 1 12 10 10 10:32 Page 76 Directors remuneration report continued Proposed long-term incentive arrangements for 2010 11 The Remuneration Committee explained in the 2008 09 Directors Remuneration Report its intention to consider potential long-term incentives for participants in the VSP during 2010.
This was in line with the commitment to shareholders at the time of implementation of the VSP in 2008 that long-term incentive arrangements for participants in the Group or Divisional VSPs would not be reviewed until 2010.
The Committee has reviewed long term incentive arrangements and believes the broad structure of the VSP remains appropriate going forward.
As a result, it is proposed that awards be made under a new VSP to be known as Smiths Group 2010 Value Sharing Plan, as follows: Annual grants vesting after 3 years Individual VSP opportunities reduced by approximately two-thirds to reflect the proposed frequency of grants and following an assessment of the market competitiveness of the fair value of the total package For the Group VSP, awards granted in 2010 11 to comprise an Earnings Element and a TSR Element Approval for this new VSP will be sought at the Annual General Meeting on 16 November 2010.
Further details on the VSP can be found in the Notice of AGM.
Performance Share Plan PSP No awards were made under the PSP to executive directors or other participants in the VSP in 2008 09 or 2009 10 and none will be made to these executives in 2010 11.
Outstanding awards vest after three years, subject to performance conditions.
One-third of an award is subject to the Companys TSR performance relative to other FTSE 100 companies excluding financial companies and investment trusts.
For full vesting, the Companys TSR must be at or above the 75th percentile over the three-year performance period.
Of the award, 25% will vest if the Companys TSR is at median.
Awards will vest on a straight-line pro rata basis between median and 75th percentile.
The remaining two-thirds of the award will be subject to earnings per share EPS growth targets measured before exceptional items.
For the outstanding three-year cycle commencing in 2007 08, full vesting will occur if the compound annual growth in EPS is equivalent to 12% a year.
If the compound annual growth in EPS is equivalent to 5% a year, 25% vesting will occur with vesting on a straight-line basis between 5% and 12%.
There will be no retesting of the TSR and EPS performance measures.
Sharesave Scheme The Smiths Group Sharesave Scheme, which is open to all UK employees with at least 12 months service, is subject to UK legislation as to the maximum amount that can be saved.
Participants save a fixed sum of up to 250 a month for three or five years and may use the sum generated by their savings contracts to exercise options to acquire shares which are usually granted at a 20% discount to the market price.
Share ownership guidelines It is the Committees policy that executive directors should, over time, acquire a shareholding with a value equal to at least one and a half years gross salary two years gross salary for the Chief Executive and retain at least 50% of any net vested share awards after sales to meet tax liabilities until those values are achieved.
Share scheme dilution limits The Company follows the guidelines laid down by the Association of British Insurers.
These restrict the issue of new shares under all the Companys share schemes in any 10-year period to 10% of the issued ordinary share capital and under the Companys discretionary schemes to 5% in any 10-year period.
As at 31 July 2010, the headroom available under these limits was 5.27% and 1.28%, respectively excluding the conditional share awards granted under the VSP.
Pension The Company operates pension arrangements for executive directors.
In the case of Mr Bowman, the Company pays a monthly salary supplement worth 42% of salary per annum as approved by the Committee to enable him to make his own pension provision.
In the case of Mr Turner, the Company pays a monthly salary supplement worth 25% of salary per annum as approved by the Committee to enable him to make his own pension provision.
Prior to his retirement, Mr Langston participated in a final salary scheme providing a pension of up to two-thirds of final pensionable salary.
Details of the salary supplements, waiver and other pension provisions are set out in the tables on page 77.
Five-year historical TSR performance The following graph shows the Companys total shareholder return TSR performance over the past five years compared to the FTSE 100 Index.
The FTSE 100 Index, of which the Company has been a member throughout the period, has been selected to reflect the TSR performance of other leading UK-listed companies.
The values of hypothetical 100 investments in the FTSE 100 Index and Smiths Group plc shares after adjustment for the Return of Cash in June 2007 were 118 and 137 respectively.

The benefits provided under the relevant pension schemes were not affected by these arrangements.
Transfer values of the accrued benefits have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with pensions regulations, and represent the amount that the pension scheme would pay to another pension provider if the member elects to transfer all of his benefits out of the scheme.
The transfer values do not represent sums payable or due to the director and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.

All pensions in excess of the Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMP are guaranteed to increase the lesser of i 7% per annum compound and ii the annual increase in the Retail Prices Index.
There has, however, been a long-standing practice of granting additional discretionary increases on pensions in excess of the GMP to bring them into line with price inflation.
On his retirement at 31 May 2010, Mr Langston commuted 16,000 per annum of his pension for a lump sum of 314,000.

Mr Bowman Mr Bowman is employed under a service contract with the Company dated 15 November 2007 and effective from 10 December 2007.

The Company may elect to terminate the contract by making a payment in lieu of notice equal to 150% of Mr Bowmans basic salary, this being a genuine pre-estimate of Mr Bowmans entitlement in respect of the unserved notice period, to cover: 1. salary: 2. annual pension contribution by the Company 42% of base salary : 3. the annual cost to the Company of providing all other benefits to which Mr Bowman is entitled under his contract, but excluding bonus.
In this event, the contract provides that Mr Bowmans bonus entitlement for the financial year in which termination occurs and for the unserved notice period will be the subject of a separate, good faith discussion between Mr Bowman and the Chairman: the contract also specifies that Mr Bowman would in this case be treated as a good leaver for the purposes of relevant share plans.
In certain constructive dismissal events, Mr Bowman is entitled to resign and be treated in the manner set out above.
