Board reports REMUNERATION REPORT Overview In 2010 the Remuneration Committee reviewed the remuneration policy with particular emphasis on alignment with the creation of shareholder value, providing balance between long-term and short-term reward and compatibility with the Companys approach to risk.
The main conclusions of the review were that the remuneration policy supports the corporate strategy, financial performance is reflected in executive reward and the incentive arrangements are appropriate.
The committee is encouraged by the outstanding results achieved by the business and regards performance pay as an important element of remuneration and a driver of success.
A review of remuneration decisions and proposals is set out below: Base salaries: reflecting the wider initiatives to control fixed costs across the Group, no base salary increases were awarded to the executive directors and the other most senior executives in 2009 or 2010.
Taking into account in particular the financial performance and internal relativities within the senior management team highlighted by recruitments made in the previous two years, salary increases have been awarded in 2011.
Closure of the IMI Pension Fund: the main UK defined benefit fund was closed to future accrual on 31 December 2010.
Executive pension provision: the committees policy approach has been to provide a long term savings opportunity for UK executives which is both tax efficient and cost neutral to the Company.
During 2010 an executive retirement plan, which is an unregistered defined contribution pension plan, was established for UK senior managers.
At the 2010 annual general meeting shareholder approval was given to amend the Share Matching Plan and the Performance Share Plan so that the awards could, at the committees discretion, be settled as employer contributions into this executive retirement plan.
In response to changes announced by the UK Treasury in December 2010 the executive retirement plan will have to be reviewed again in 2011.
Annual bonus: in 2010 the bonus metrics were profit before tax and exceptional items, return on sales, cash conversion percentage to ensure that cash is managed effectively across the Group and some non-financial measures based on health and safety, ethics and compliance and personal objectives.
This worked well in 2010 and the same approach has been taken for 2011 bonuses.
Claw-back: power to seek recovery of bonuses in certain circumstances where they ought not to have been paid has been attached to bonuses since 2009.
This claw-back power has been applied to the Share Matching Plan since 2009 and in 2010 the committee decided to extend claw-back power to the Performance Share Plan.
Share Matching Plan: the committee reverted to the normal three year economic value added targets for 2010 matching awards and this policy will continue in 2011 save that targets will be based on segmental operating profit with no charge for acquired intangible amortisation.
Share Matching Plan awards for 2011 and subsequent years will be subject to percentage targets for improvement in economic value added EVA.
The percentage targets are designed to be more transparent than the absolute internal targets used for previous awards.
Subject to these targets remaining appropriate in the conditions prevailing at the time awards are made, the vesting scale for 2011 and future awards would be: 10% of maximum for positive EVA, 25% for 6% EVA growth and 100% for 17% or more EVA growth.
EVA will be measured as a compound annual growth rate over a three year period calculated by reference to EVA over the previous three year period with vesting in each band being on a linear scale.
Performance Share Plan: awards made in 2010 were subject to a combination of earnings per share 50% weighting, relative Total Shareholder Return TSR 25% weighting and a new performance measure, return on operating capital 25% weighting.
The same metrics will be used for 2011 save that the latter element will be targeted excluding all intangible assets.
A risk review of the remuneration policy and its implementation was undertaken.
Overall the committee was satisfied that risk is appropriately managed, but three actions resulting from this review were: 1 introducing a claw-back power to future Performance Share Plan awards so that claw-back extended to all equity incentive plans for which executive directors are eligible, 2 having a process whereby all long term incentive targets are reviewed at the time of any material corporate transactions, and 3 continuing the improvement in the communication and understanding of the incentive schemes.
Reflecting the international nature of the Group, close to 200 IMI senior managers were granted market-value share options in 2010.
At the 2011 annual general meeting we will be seeking shareholder approval for this plan in order to introduce the flexibility to use new issue and treasury shares to satisfy awards under it.
New all-employee global share plans: at the forthcoming annual general meeting we will be seeking shareholder approval for new share plans that will enable employees outside the UK to choose to make regular savings that can be used to buy IMI plc shares.
This is an exciting project and the committee fully endorses the principle of employee share ownership.
It will reinforce the IMI culture across our businesses and emphasise the Groups combined value.
Initially, the intention is to operate the new plans, if approved, in the USA and Germany and to extend that over time to other countries.
48 BOARD REPORTS BUSINESS OVERVIEW GROUP OPERATING REVIEW RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS BOARD REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Remuneration Committees composition The members of the Remuneration Committee throughout the year were Bob Stack Chairman, Kevin Beeston, Terry Gateley, Anita Frew and Norman Askew, the Companys non-executive Chairman.
In accordance with the Combined Code, all of the foregoing non-executive directors were regarded by the Board as independent and Norman Askew was considered independent on his appointment as Chairman of the Company.
Remuneration Committees role The Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration policy and rewards for the executive directors and, in his absence, the Chairman.
The committee also reviews the packages of those at the next most senior level of management and has regard to levels of pay across the Group.
A copy of the Remuneration Committees terms of reference is available from the corporate governance section of the IMI website, where it appears as part of IMIs Corporate Governance Framework.
New terms of reference were adopted in December 2010 which explicitly recognise the committees responsibility for considering the risk implications of incentives and the remuneration structure and for reviewing its compatibility with the Groups risk policies and systems.
Advice received by the Remuneration Committee The committee consulted the Chief Executive, Martin Lamb, regarding the remuneration policy and the packages of the other executive directors and senior managers.
It also received the advice and services of the Finance Director, Douglas Hurt, the Group Human Resources Director, Matt Huckin and the Company Secretary, John OShea, who is secretary to the committee.
None of these executives was involved in determining their own remuneration.
Independent remuneration advisors, Hewitt New Bridge Street have been appointed by the committee to provide advice on directors remuneration to the committee.
These advisors also attended certain meetings at the request of the committee.
During the year Hewitt New Bridge Street also provided advice to the Group Human Resources Director in relation to the implementation of the committees decisions.
The terms of engagement with the committees advisors are available on request from the Company Secretary.
Chairmans remuneration The Chairmans sole remuneration consists of fees of 195,000 per annum inclusive of all committee and other work.
The level of fees was last revised in 2007 and has remained fixed since that time.
Non-executive directors remuneration The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined, after reference to external benchmarks, by the Chairman and the executive directors.
The policy on non-executive remuneration is to pay an appropriate level on a comparative basis for their time and work on the Board and its committees.
They do not participate in any bonus or employee share schemes of the Company and no part of their remuneration is conditional upon the performance of the Company.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is shown in the table on page 58.
Annual remuneration in 2010 was as follows: Non-executive directors fee 45,000.
Additional remuneration for chairing a committee 10,000.
Additional remuneration for the senior non-executive director 5,000.
Following the first review since 2007, the basic non-executive directors fee has been increased from 45,000 to 52,500 with effect from January 2011.
Terms of appointment of the Chairman and the non-executive directors Letters of appointment set out the key duties and expectations for the non-executive Chairman and the independent non-executive directors.
They include appropriate time commitments, provisions for induction and familiarisation with the businesses and wider senior management team and require approval for other directorships and potential conflicts of interest.
The Board has established a shareholding guideline for non-executive directors, each of whom is encouraged to build up a holding of at least 7,500 shares, or 10,000 shares in the case of the Chairman, within a reasonable period of appointment.
All of the non-executives held the relevant number of shares at the year end see table of directors interests on page 62.
IMI ANNUAL REPORT 2010 49 Board reports REMUNERATION REPORT The dates and unexpired terms of the letters of appointment for the non-executive directors, which are available for inspection at the annual general meeting and at the Companys registered office, are as follows: Date of letter Unexpired term Date of appointment of appointment at 01.01.11 as a director N B M Askew 01.03.11 1 year 14.05.05 K S Beeston 05.01.11 1 year 2 months 08.03.05 A M Frew 05.01.11 2 years 2 months 02.03.06 T M Gateley 05.01.11 1 year 10 months 01.11.03 R J Stack 05.01.11 3 years 5 months 13.06.08 The normal period for initial appointment and first renewal is three years.
After six years, renewal is usually considered on an annual basis and this currently applies to Kevin Beeston.
However, in January 2011 Terry Gateleys term was extended until October 2012, at which time he will have been a non-executive director for nine years, to ensure he continues to be available as senior independent director to support the transition to a new Chairman.
Appointments are made under a letter of agreement subject to removal under the Companys articles of association, and with effect from 2011, all directors will be submitting themselves for annual re-election at the annual general meeting in accordance with the new UK Corporate Governance Code.
There are no provisions for the Company to give notice or pay compensation in relation to the early termination of the appointment of the Chairman or any non-executive director.
There is a provision in the appointment letters to the effect that a non-executive director is normally expected to give at least one months prior notice of termination to the Company.
Executive directors remuneration and terms of appointment Statement of policy The Company aims to ensure that remuneration generally and incentives in particular provide strong links between individual performance and shareholder interests.
The remuneration policy also recognises that the Company operates in global and highly competitive markets with the vast majority of its activities outside the UK.
The policy is to provide competitive remuneration packages to attract, motivate, reward and retain executives of the calibre required, and to align their interests with those of shareholders by relating a significant element of the remuneration package to specific short and long term performance measures.
During 2010 the committee reviewed the structure and metrics of the incentive arrangements for the executive directors from a risk perspective and concluded that they were aligned with appropriate risk-taking and shareholders interests.
The Remuneration Committee considers it to be important to maintain the flexibility to respond to individual circumstances.
However, its normal approach has been to pay salaries within appropriate market competitive ranges, combined with realistic potential for above market total compensation if performance is outstanding.
Remuneration comprises basic salaries, annual performance bonuses, benefits in kind, pension arrangements or a cash allowance and participation in a share matching plan and a performance share plan.
In the case of the new operational executive director, Ian Whiting, relocation assistance has and will be provided to support his move in 2011 to new divisional head offices in Switzerland.
In setting the remuneration of each executive director, the Remuneration Committee takes into account their role and responsibilities, skills and individual performance and makes reference to market rates as evidenced by published studies and comparisons with international UK-based groups of a similar size and complexity.
In connection with this the committee considered benchmarking data prepared by Hewitt New Bridge Street.
The committee uses such data with caution in view of the risk of an upward ratchet of remuneration levels.
It also has received information about and had regard to pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group.
The committee has the discretion to take account of environmental, social and corporate governance matters when setting the remuneration of the executive directors.
The policy of the committee is to set performance conditions for incentives which are both stretching but also reasonably attainable in the environment in which the Company is then operating.
The following charts show the fixed and performance related elements of the Chief Executives remuneration at both target and maximum based on the proposed 2011 incentive arrangements assuming maximum personal investment in the Share Matching Plan and excluding the impact of changes in share price.
This supports the committees policy that a significant proportion of remuneration should be performance related.
The mix of remuneration for the other executive directors is broadly comparable, although their maximum bonus potential and maximum matching plan awards are lower.
50 BOARD REPORTS BUSINESS OVERVIEW GROUP OPERATING REVIEW RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS BOARD REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Chief Executive Chief Executive Target remuneration Maximum remuneration 25% Fixed pay 15% Fixed pay salary salary 75% Variable pay 85% Variable pay annual bonus and annual bonus and long-term long-term incentive incentive awards awards Consistent with the policy on service contracts, the executive directors service contracts are subject to termination on one years notice by the Company or the executive.
Contractual retirement age for UK based executive directors is 65 but none applies to Ian Whiting who is employed in the USA.
These contracts do not include any specific provision for compensation payable upon early termination save that, as a consequence of the closure of the IMI Pension Fund on 31 December 2010, the Company has made alternative contractual arrangements in lieu of certain contractual entitlements to pension benefits, which, but for the closure, would have been provided through the IMI Pension Fund to all members in the same membership category as the Chief Executive.
The alternative contractual arrangements for all these members include augmentation of Fund benefits to the level that would have been provided save for the closure or payment in lieu in respect of benefits arising on early retirement by reason of redundancy or other termination at the Companys instance.
Had such benefits arisen for the Chief Executive as at 31 December 2010, the estimated cash cost to the Company would have been approximately 4.7m.
The payment in lieu computation is designed to be neutral to the Company on a net of tax basis and compared with the cash contributions that would otherwise have been expected to provide the benefits through the Fund.
It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee to limit any compensation which might be paid in the event of early termination of an executive directors contract to the legal minimum, taking into account mitigation and other relevant factors.
The dates of the contracts and period to normal retirement age for those serving as executive directors during the year are as follows: Period to normal Date of retirement age as Date joined appointment Date of service at 31 December Group to Board contract Notice period 2010 M J Lamb 31.10.86 18.07.96 01.01.11 12 months 14 years 1 month D M Hurt 01.05.06 01.07.06 01.10.06 12 months 10 years 6 months R M Twite 26.09.88 01.02.07 01.02.07 12 months 22 years 5 months I WWhiting 18.07.05 01.09.10 01.01.10 12 months N A WIWhiting is a US employee and is not subject to a normal retirement age Base salary Salary reviews for the executive directors are conducted annually with any increases effective from 1 January.
Salaries are set by the Remuneration Committee taking into account the executives role, responsibilities and individual performance and pay conditions elsewhere in the Company and external benchmark data looking at UK listed companies of similar size, complexity and international presence.
The normal policy is to pay salaries within appropriate market competitive ranges for each role.
Reflecting the wider initiative to control fixed costs across the Group, the executive directors salaries were not increased in the annual reviews conducted in either December 2008 or December 2009.
The salaries for the 2011 financial year were reviewed in December 2010 and the committee decided that it was no longer appropriate to freeze salaries.
The two most compelling reasons for awarding an increase were the outstanding financial performance of the Group and addressing concerns arising from internal relativities.
During the past two years recruitments have been made into the senior management group, both in terms of direct replacements and expansion, and this has caused unacceptable internal differences.
Accordingly, a thorough salary analysis was undertaken by the committee.
These inputs resulted in the committee making the following changes to take effect from 1 January 2011: M J Lamb - 720,000 2008, 2009 and 2010: 656,000.
In making these decisions the committee took account of the salary increases that have been and will be awarded to staff, as well as the salary multiple of the directors salaries to that of the average UK staff salary.
IMI ANNUAL REPORT 2010 51 Board reports REMUNERATION REPORT Annual bonus Executive directors participate in an annual performance bonus plan.
Maximum bonus is only payable if the stretching targets set by the Remuneration Committee are met and for both 2010 and 2011 the maxima are: Maximum bonus as a % of salary Chief Executive 150% Finance Director 125% Operational executive directors 115% All the bonus metrics have a sliding scale calibration and in 2011 on-target bonus will pay 50% of the maximum bonus.
Details of the bonus metrics are given on page 48 in the section headed Overview.
The executive directors and senior executives are subject to share ownership guidelines.
To the extent that an individual does not meet their shareholding guideline, then up to 50% of the annual bonus award is required to be invested in shares and a matching award will be made under the Share Matching Plan at a lower level of maximum match.
If the individual meets the shareholding guideline, then investment of bonus in shares is encouraged through participation in the SMP with matching at a higher level.
The Remuneration Committee always reserves the right to apply discretion in awarding bonuses and performance shares and may exercise this freedom should an executive not achieve their share ownership guideline within a reasonable period.
The committee retains power to reduce or withhold annual bonus payments in exceptional circumstances and in 2009 following best practice it introduced the power to seek claw-back of bonuses in certain cases where the bonus should not have been paid in the first place.
Under the rules of the executive retirement plan ERP, UK based directors and senior managers may waive their bonus entitlement.
The Remuneration Committee may then choose, at its discretion, to make a contribution into the ERP on their behalf.
Long term incentive arrangements The Company operates two share incentive plans for executive directors: 1. the Share Matching Plan formerly the Deferred Bonus Plan which is a co-investment arrangement: and 2. the Performance Share Plan which is a conventional long term incentive plan.
Share Matching Plan The Share Matching Plan SMP runs in conjunction with the annual incentive plan and is linked to the achievement of the share ownership guidelines for executive directors and senior executives.
Under the SMP individuals may invest up to 100% of their maximum annual bonus potential into shares: the limit being set on an annual basis by the Remuneration Committee.
The committee intends to allow such a level of investment in 2011.
By investing in the SMP, matching shares may be earned, which vest after three years, subject to the achievement of stretching performance conditions.
Current policy is that awards made under the share matching arrangements, where settled in shares, will be satisfied through shares purchased in the market but the committee retains the flexibility to use new issue and treasury shares.
Since 2009, matching awards have allowed for a higher level of match up to 2:1 for shares that are purchased through the voluntary investment of bonus or other monies.
The lower levels of match up to 1.25:1 for the Chief Executive and 1:1 for other executive directors apply to annual bonus that is to be compulsorily paid in shares, being up to 50% of the bonus according to whether, and, if so, the extent to which, an executive has not met their share ownership guideline.
The matching share awards are usually subject to EVA performance over a three year period.
The calculation of EVA is based on segmental operating profit after tax with appropriate adjustments, less a capital charge on the invested capital in the business reflecting IMIs cost of capital.
Further details of the performance conditions attaching to existing awards are set out in the notes to the table on page 61 including details of the change made to the targets attached to 2010 SMP awards following the acquisition of Z&J.
The EVA targets for intended 2011 awards are described in the section above headed Overview.
For 2011 and subsequent awards there will be no charge to NOPAT for acquired intangible amortisation, which will reduce the volatility in the measure caused by the valuation and amortisation of intangible assets following an acquisition.
The 2007 SMP awards vested in 2010 at 63.5% of maximum and the 2008 SMP awards will vest in 2011 at 97% of maximum.
Performance Share Plan The Performance Share Plan PSP allows for share-based awards worth up to the maximum of 100% of annual salary.
Details of the awards made under the PSP are contained in the table of directors awards on page 60.
The vesting of awards is subject to the satisfaction of stretching performance conditions over a three year period.
The current policy is for PSP awards, where settled in shares, to be satisfied through shares purchased in the market but the committee retains the flexibility to use new issue and treasury shares.
52 BOARD REPORTS BUSINESS OVERVIEW GROUP OPERATING REVIEW RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS BOARD REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The 2007 awards vested in 2010 at 44.7% of maximum.
The 2008 PSP awards will vest in 2011 at maximum.
For awards made up to and including 2008, one half of the award is subject to an earnings per share EPS performance condition and the other half to a comparative total shareholder return TSR target.
EPS was chosen as an appropriate measure because it rewards absolute growth in underlying earnings and because the Remuneration Committee believed it worked well in combination with TSR which is a comparative measure.
TSR is well understood and accepted as a performance measure for long-term incentives and links rewards to shareholder value.
Details of the performance conditions attached to awards granted under the PSP are shown in the notes to the table on page 60.
PSP awards granted under the plan in 2009 were subject to a single performance condition in respect of relative TSR because economic uncertainties made it difficult to set a realistic three year EPS target.
Measures applied to awards made in 2010 are described under the Overview section above along with the metrics to be used for intended 2011 PSP awards.
The TSR comparator group for awards made in 2008 and 2009 and for awards made in 2010 are shown below: Name Country Name Country Amada Japan Johnson Matthey United Kingdom Atlas Copco A Sweden Manitowoc United States BBA Aviation United Kingdom Meggitt United Kingdom Bodycote International United Kingdom Metso Corporation Finland Borgwarner United States NSK Japan Charter United Kingdom Parker-Hannifin United States Cobham United Kingdom Pentair United States Cookson Group United Kingdom Rotork United Kingdom Eaton United States Sandvik Sweden Emerson Electric United States Seco Tools B Sweden Fanuc Japan SKF B Sweden Flowserve Corp United States SMC Japan GKN United Kingdom Spectris United Kingdom Halma United Kingdom Spirax-Sarco Engineering United Kingdom Heidelberg Druck Germany Sulzer AG Switzerland Honeywell United States THK Japan IDEX Corp United States Tyco International United States Illinois Tool Works United States Weir Group United Kingdom Ingersoll-Rand United States Yaskawa Electric Japan Invensys United Kingdom Country is shown as country of primary listing.
Note: Enodis, Tomkins and FKI had been included in the comparator group but delisted.
The 2011 comparator group will be the same as it was in 2010 subject to any delistings.
IMI ANNUAL REPORT 2010 53 Board reports REMUNERATION REPORT Long term incentive arrangements continued Performance Share Plan continued 25% of the 2010 and intended 2011 PSP awards are subject to a TSR performance condition.
TSR is defined as the movement in the share price during the performance period on a local currency basis with adjustments to take into account changes in capital structure and dividends which are assumed to be reinvested in shares on the ex-dividend date.
The vesting schedule for the element of awards subject to the TSR performance condition is as follows: Ranking Vesting Upper quartile top 25% or above 100% Between median and upper quartile Pro-rata between 25% and 100% Median 25% Below median 0% To ensure that TSR reflects improvement in the underlying performance of the Company the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the financial performance of the Company over the performance period warrants the level of vesting as calculated under the TSR condition.
In the event that the Remuneration Committee is not satisfied in this respect on the vesting of a PSP award it has committed to disclose the factors that it reviewed and give a commentary on the exercise of its overriding discretion.
The performance condition for one half of the 2010 PSP awards and the intended 2011 PSP awards will be based on the Companys compound annual EPS growth over a three-year period.
The Remuneration Committee sets the EPS targets in respect of each annual award at the level it considers appropriately stretching given the conditions in which the Company is operating.
The vesting schedule for the awards subject to the EPS performance condition proposed to be granted in 2011, which is the same as for the 2010 awards, is as follows: Compound EPS growth Vesting 15% per annum 100% Between 6% and 15% per annum Pro-rata between 25% and 100% 6% per annum 25% Less than 6% per annum 0% As for 2010 awards, the EPS measure for 2011 PSP awards will be based on EPS subject to certain adjustments including the elimination of the after tax cost of restructuring, acquired intangible amortisation and impairment, and financial instruments excluding economic hedge contract gains and losses.
The vesting of the other 25% of the 2010 and the intended 2011 PSP awards will depend on IMIs average return on operating capital employed RoOCE over the three years from the year of grant.
Operating capital used for the calculation of RoOCE for the 2011 PSP awards will exclude intangible assets.
This is considered appropriate as it will reduce the volatility in the measure caused by the valuation and amortisation of acquired intangible assets under IFRS3 following acquisitions.
Following the acquisition of Z&J, the RoOCE targets attached to 2010 PSP awards were adjusted to allow 25% vesting at 24% RoOCE originally 25% and between 25% and 100% vesting for RoOCE in the range from 24% to 30% originally 25% to 32%.
For the intended 2011 and subsequent awards, RoOCE will not include intangible assets and the 2011 awards will be calibrated as follows: Average RoOCE Vesting 85% 100% Between 65% and 85% Pro-rata between 25% and 100% 65% 25% Less than 65% 0% 54 BOARD REPORTS BUSINESS OVERVIEW GROUP OPERATING REVIEW RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS BOARD REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UK SAYE plan The Company operates an HM Revenue and Customs approved savings-related share option scheme which is open to the majority of the Groups UK employees, including the UK-based executive directors, and allows the grant of options to all participants at a discount of up to 20% below the market price.
Such schemes are not subject to performance conditions and offer tax incentives to encourage employees to use their own money to purchase shares in their employers business or group.
UK All Employee Share Ownership Plan UK executive directors also participate in an All Employee Share Ownership Plan which is open to the majority of the Groups UK employees.
In 2011 shares to a value equal to the lesser of 3,000 and 0.6% of each participants basic salary will be acquired at market value by the trustee of the plan in respect of their participation during 2010.
The plan is not operated subject to specific performance conditions but the level of shares awarded to participating employees is set taking into account performance, in particular that of the UK operations of the Group.
Eligible employees are also able to invest up to 1,500 annually in a tax-efficient manner in purchasing partnership shares under the plan.
Each of the UK executive directors makes the maximum contribution from their salary towards partnership shares under the plan.
Matching shares may be awarded in respect of partnership shares acquired under the plan although the policy to date has been not to award any matching shares.
Global All Employee Share Plans As mentioned above, proposals for the establishment of two new all-employee share plans to encourage employee investment in IMI shares are to be put to shareholders for approval at the 2011 annual general meeting.
Further details are contained in the notice of annual general meeting.
Share Option Plan A share option plan for senior employees was established in 2009 but awards under it are not made to executive directors or others who receive PSP awards.
As explained in the Overview section above, shareholder approval of this plan will be sought at the forthcoming annual general meeting in order to introduce the flexibility to satisfy awards using new issue and treasury shares and further details are given in the notice of meeting.
Share ownership guidelines The shareholding guidelines were increased in 2009 to 125% of salary for all the executive directors to be achieved by 30 June 2011 or, for new appointments, within a five year period after joining the Board.
All of the executive directors met the guidelines at the year end.
The levels of holdings at the end of 2010 relative to basic salaries calculated using the average share price in December 2010 were as follows: Executive director Level of share ownership M J Lamb 581% D M Hurt 479% R M Twite 399% I W Whiting 596% Share dilution The Association of British Insurers has set recommended guidelines on the number of new issue and treasury shares that can be used under a companys share plans.
The guidelines are 10% of the issued share capital in any 10 year period for all share plans, with an inner limit of 5% in 10 years for executive schemes.
IMI operates within these limits and its standing as at 31 December 2010 was 3.59% and 2.33% respectively.
IMI ANNUAL REPORT 2010 55 Board reports REMUNERATION REPORT Pension entitlement During 2010 the Board with appropriate support from the Remuneration Committee undertook a comprehensive review of pension provision at IMI.
This was prompted by the Boards desire to manage pension risks.
With regard to the pension provision for executive directors the main principle adopted when undertaking this review was that any new arrangements should be cost neutral for IMI.
The IMI Pension Fund was closed to all employees in respect of future service from 31 December 2010 and alternative pension arrangements were established including an executive retirement plan ERP, which is intended to be a tax efficient long term savings vehicle for UK senior managers to save for retirement outside the registered pensions regime.
Pension benefits provided for 2010 service In respect of 2010 the executive directors were entitled to and waived the following pension benefits: Value of pension allowance Value of allowance waived Martin Lamb 229,600 35% of salary 82,000 Douglas Hurt 126,000 35% of salary 105,000 Roy Twite 119,000 35% of salary 99,000 Ian Whiting 38,500 35% of salary since appointment N A Executive directors are entitled to receive a taxable cash allowance instead of pension benefits.
UK executive directors may waive some or all of this cash allowance, and any annual bonus award, and the Remuneration Committee may then choose, at its discretion, to make a contribution into the ERP, which is an unregistered defined contribution arrangement structured as an offshore trust.
Such contributions to the ERP in respect of executive directors are determined on a basis that is intended to be cost neutral to the Company.
At the 2010 AGM shareholders approved changes to the rules of the SMP and PSP that permit these awards to be settled in the form of employer contributions to the ERP.
Martin Lamb waived part of his cash allowance payable in lieu of future accrual in the IMI Pension Fund and all of his 2010 bonus, and the Company exercised its discretion to make contributions to the ERP totalling 979,000.
He also waived his 2009 bonus entitlement, and the Company exercised its discretion to make contributions to the ERP totalling 747,000.
Douglas Hurt waived part of his cash allowance payable in lieu of pension benefits and all of his 2010 bonus, and the Company exercised its discretion to make contributions to the ERP totalling 513,000.
Roy Twite waived part of his cash allowance payable in lieu of pension benefits and 2010 bonus, and the Company exercised its discretion to make contributions to the ERP totalling 313,000.
Ian Whiting is eligible for benefits under three arrangements in the USA.
The first is a defined contribution arrangement, the IMI 401 k Plan.
In the period from 1 September 2010, when he was appointed as an executive director, to 31 December 2010, no contributions were made to this plan.
The second is a defined benefit arrangement, the Control Components Inc Employees Pension Plan.
His pension from this plan is payable from age 65 without further increase.
The third is also a defined benefit arrangement, the IMI Americas Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.
His pension from this plan is payable from age 65, subject to completion of 10 years service with the Group, without further increase.
On retirement Ian Whiting has the option of exchanging part of his pension to provide for a spouses pension payable on his death after retirement.
56 BOARD REPORTS BUSINESS OVERVIEW GROUP OPERATING REVIEW RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS BOARD REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Pension benefits for past service Martin Lamb and Roy Twite were previously active members of the defined benefit IMI Pension Fund.
Martin Lamb opted out with effect from 6 April 2006 and Roy Twite opted out with effect from 1 February 2007.
As a result they retain past pensionable service up to these dates and the value of this is shown in the table on page 59.
The nature of these benefits are more complicated than the pension benefits provided in respect of 2010, but the key elements are summarised below: The normal retirement age under the Fund is 60 for Martin Lamb and 62 for Roy Twite.
Martin Lamb may elect to retire from employment with IMI and receive a pension at any time after age 57 without any actuarial discount and Roy Twite may retire from employment with IMI any time after age 60 without actuarial discount.
On death after retirement, a dependants pension is provided equal to two-thirds of the members pension for Martin Lamb and 50% of the members pension for Roy Twite.
Should Martin Lamb die within the first five years of retirement, a lump sum is also paid equal to the balance of five years pension payments.
For Roy Twite, the dependants pension is increased to 100% of the members pension for the remainder of the five year period.
Pensions in payment, in excess of any guaranteed minimum pension, are increased each year in line with price inflation up to a maximum of 5% in respect of pension built up before 1 January 2006, and 2.5% in respect of pension built up after 1 January 2006.
Martin Lambs past pension benefits generally continue to be linked to final salary inflation averaged over the past three years and equivalent benefits to those provided for under the Fund rules immediately prior to closure are preserved in relation to ill-health retirement, death-in-service and early retirement at the Companys instance.
The difference between these benefits and those automatically provided under the Fund will be assessed as at 31 December of 2011 and each subsequent year end until death in service, retirement on ill-health grounds or retirement at the Companys instance and there will be a payment to the Fund to augment Fund benefits or a payment in lieu to Martin Lamb or his estate or by way of contribution to the ERP or another pension arrangement shortly after each year end until a final augmentation or payment is made following death in service or relevant early retirement event.
The policy regarding pension arrangements for new executive director appointments will be flexible to take account of the individual position, the cost of pension arrangements to the Company, including in particular the cost of defined benefits, and the alternative forms of pension provision.
However, the norm would be not to offer defined benefits to new executive directors.
Save as indicated below, the remainder of this report has been audited.
The auditors report is on page 65.
External appointments Executive directors may accept one external appointment with the consent of the Board, and are normally allowed to retain fees from external non-executive directorships.

2 The increase in the accrued pension during the year reflects the increase in pensionable earnings to 31 December 2010 for M J Lamb.
Under the IMI Pension Fund deferred pensions generally increase with inflation so the increase in the accrued pension over the year net of inflation represents the additional pension built up.
No allowance is made for the value of benefits that may be derived by the payment of additional voluntary contributions.
3 Or as at date of appointment as a director if later.
4 I W Whiting was appointed as a director on 1 September 2010 and the figures shown in the table relate to the period from 1 September 2010 to 31 December 2010.
Figures have been converted using exchange rates of 1: $1.55 as at 1 September 2010 and 1: $1.57 as at 31 December 2010.
As I W Whiting has been a director for less than a year, the increase in accrued pension net of annual inflation and the value of the increase in accrued pension net of annual inflation are not applicable.
The transfer values that would be payable from the IMI Pension Fund at the relevant date are also shown in the table, together with the transfer value at the end of the year of the increase in the accrued pension over the year net of inflation.
A transfer value shown is the estimated capital value of the future pension payments in retirement, determined by the Funds Trustee in accordance with the appropriate statutory requirements.
In respect of I W Whitings benefits under US pension arrangements, the transfer value quoted is based on the method and assumptions used by the Company to account for the costs associated with its US defined benefit pension schemes see note 19 to the financial statements on pages 104 to 110.
Under the method and assumptions used by the Company to account for the costs associated with its defined benefit pension schemes, the aggregate value of the accrued benefits as at 31 December 2010 for the executive directors was 8.96m 2009: 8.42m.
