2 The change in accrued pension during the year reflects that inflation over the period has been 4.6%, being the measure of RPI to September 2010.
3 Derek Andrew and David Thompsons pensions have increased over the year, but by less than the 4.6% inflation increase and so their change in accrued pension net of inflation is negative.
4 The Transfer Values at 2 October 2010 are calculated in accordance with the cash equivalent transfer value basis adopted by the Trustees on 16 August 2009, after taking advice from the Scheme Actuary.
5 From 1 May 2010 Directors were provided with the option of a 25% salary supplement as an alternative to continued membership of the Scheme.

The normal contribution rate for Directors retaining existing benefits therefore became 13.5%, except for Derek Andrew whose contribution rate to retain existing benefits is 6%, paid by way of salary sacrifice.
c On death before retirement a lump sum is payable equal to the Directors contributions including those made via salary sacrifice.
However, some or all of this lump sum may be used to provide a statutory minimum spouses pension.
On death after retirement the spouses pension payable is two thirds of the members pre-commutation pension for Derek Andrew and David Thompson, 60% of the members pre-commutation pension for Ralph Findlay and Alistair Darby and, in respect of Stephen Oliver 60% of his post 1 January 2002 service and 50% of his pre 1 January 2002 service.
