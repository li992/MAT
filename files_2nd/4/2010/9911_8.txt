Investment Companies Index as the comparator group.
If the Companys TSR performance is lower than the median of the comparator group, awards subject to the TSR condition will lapse.
The awards start to vest on a sliding scale if TSR performance is equal to or above the median of the comparator group, with full vesting only if the Companys TSR performance is in the upper decile of the comparator group.
TSR performance conditions changed from 2007 onwards such that for those later awards full vesting is dependent upon an upper quartile TSR performance.
The LTIP awards allocated to Miles Roberts lapsed upon his resignation.
This performance measure has been selected as it is consistent with the majority of LTIPs in the same sector and the Remuneration Committee wishes to encourage senior executives to give attention to medium-term as well as short-term returns to shareholders.
Fifty percent of the award is subject to an earnings per share EPS performance condition.
Awards subject to the EPS condition will lapse unless the Companys growth in EPS adjusted to exclude the effects of amortisation of intangible assets and exceptional items is at least three percentage points per annum above the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index RPI, at which level half the awards subject to the EPS condition will vest.
For performance above this level, awards will vest on a rising scale, with full vesting only if growth in EPS exceeds the increase in RPI by at least eight percentage points per annum for the 2007 awards and by at least five percentage points for the 2008 awards.
This performance measure was reviewed in 2009 and full vesting for the latest awards will be at RPI plus ten percentage points, with the threshold for awards adjusted upwards to RPI plus five percentage points.
The performance measure was reviewed again in 2010 and full vesting for the latest awards will be at RPI plus eight percentage points, with the threshold for awards adjusted to RPI plus four percentage points.
This performance measure has been selected because EPS is one of the key performance indicators used in the business and is a measure well understood by the senior executive team.
It is also something which they can directly inuence.
TSR and EPS performance are measured over the period of three consecutive financial years of the Company beginning with the year of grant of the award.
There will be no re-setting of the performance conditions.
