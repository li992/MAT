In accordance with JMPP rules, the company paid a matching contribution of 8,550 into his defined contribution account.
3 The disclosure regulations require the pension accrued to the end of the previous year to be adjusted for inflation.
In a period of negative inflation, this adjustment effectively reduces the previous years accrued pension.
For example, in the case of Mr Carson for whom there was no change in pensionable salary or service during the year, the increase in accrued pension is entirely due to the effect of negative inflation.
Inflation was -1.4% for the year to 30th September 2009 as prescribed by the Revaluation Order SI 2008 No.
3070 issued under the Pensions Schemes Act 1993.
4 The entitlement shown under Total accrued pension at 31st March 2010 is the pension which would be paid annually from normal retirement, based on pensionable service to 31st March 2010 except in the case of Messrs Carson and Sandford whose pensionable service ceased on 31st March 2006.
The pension would be subject to an actuarial reduction for each month that retirement precedes age 60.
5 The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the transfer value regulations.
No allowance has been made in the transfer values for any discretionary benefits that have been or may be awarded under JMEPS.
The transfer value in the United Kingdom Listing Authority Listing Rules is the value of the increase net of inflation in the accrued pension as at 31st March 2010.
The transfer values in the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 have been calculated at the start and the end of the year and, therefore, also take account of market movements.
6 Mr Pentz is a US citizen but became a member of JMEPS on 1st January 2006.
Prior to that he was a member of the Johnson Matthey Inc.
Salaried Employees Pension Plan a non-contributory defined benefit arrangement and a US savings plan 401k.
He also has benefits in a Senior Executive Retirement Plan.
The pension values reported above are the aggregate for his separate membership of the UK and US pension schemes and the Senior Executive Retirement Plan.
US entitlements have been converted to sterling by reference to exchange rates on 31st March 2009 and 31st March 2010.
Mr Pentzs US pension was fixed on 31st December 2005.
The sterling equivalent of it has fluctuated over the year as a result of exchange rate movements.
This is reflected in the transfer values.
7 Dr Hawker stepped down from the board on 21st July 2009 and his employment ceased on 31st July 2009.
He chose to draw his retirement benefits immediately with effect from 1st August 2009 and his pension was reduced appropriately to take account of early retirement.
Dr Hawkers pensionable service stopped on 31st March 2006 and the increase in pension is attributable only to an increase in basic salary.
The company made an additional payment into JMEPS of 205,860 on a defined contribution basis.
8 Mr Morgan stepped down from the board on 21st July 2009 and his employment ceased on 31st July 2009.
He has not drawn his retirement benefits, but holds a deferred pension in the scheme.
In lieu of a contractual bonus earned in 2008 09, the company made an additional payment into JMEPS of 50,250 on a defined contribution basis.
9 Any tax liability arising out of regulations under the Finance Act 2009 that may become chargeable on the additional payments for Dr Hawker and Mr Morgan is the responsibility of these individuals.
10 Mr Sheldrick retired from the board at his normal retirement date, age 60, on 7th September 2009 and payment of his pension started from that date.
As his pensionable service stopped on 31st March 2008, the increase in pension is attributable only to an increase in basic salary.
The Remuneration Report was approved by the Board of Directors on 2nd June 2010 and signed on its behalf by: Robert Walvis Chairman of the Management Development and Remuneration Committee 56 - Johnson Matthey
