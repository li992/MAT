The Company has in place formal shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors.
As such, all Executive Directors must attain a level of shares equivalent to at least 100% base salary within five years of 1 December 2008, or their date of appointment.
Although there is no formal shareholding requirement below Executive Director level, most Executive Committee members already hold shareholdings well in excess of this level in line with the Groups culture of encouraging share participation at all levels.
In particular, it is currently estimated that, in total, over 30% of the Companys share capital is held by Directors, Founders, the Employee Benefit Trusts, senior management and other employees.
