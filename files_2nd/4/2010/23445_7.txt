Remuneration and Nomination Committee The Remuneration and Nomination Committee comprises all the non-executive Directors of the Company and is chaired by Mr JP Williams.
The Board considers it appropriate, given the number of non-executive Directors, that all Directors should be members of the Committee.
The Committee met once in the year.
It was not considered necessary to recommend any changes to the existing fee arrangements at that meeting.
The basic Directors fee for each Director is 35,000 per annum with an additional fee of 115,000 per annum for the Chairman of the Company.
An additional fee of 6,000 per annum is payable to the Chairman of the Audit, the Valuations and the Remuneration and Nomination Committees.
Separate additional fees of 3,000 per annum are payable to the non-Chairman members of the Valuations Committee.
The Company has no employees.
Policy on Directors Remuneration The Companys policy is that remuneration of non-executive Directors should be fair and sufficient to enable Directors properly to oversee the affairs of the Company and should reflect the specific circumstances of the Company, the duties and responsibilities of the Directors and the value and amount of time committed to the Companys affairs.
It is intended that this policy will continue for the year ended 30 September 2011 and subsequent years.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible to receive bonuses, pension benefits, share options or other benefits.
The Remuneration and Nomination Committee relies mainly on general salary surveys in respect of its consideration of the level of Directors remuneration.
The total remuneration of the Directors is determined by the provisions of the Articles of Association and by shareholders resolutions.
Directors Service Contracts None of the Directors has a service contract with the Company.
No arrangements have been entered into between the Company and the Directors to entitle any of the Directors to compensation for loss of office.
Total Shareholder Return The Directors consider that, since the Company invests in a broad range of commercial sectors, the FTSE All-Share Index is the most appropriate index against which to compare the Companys performance.
