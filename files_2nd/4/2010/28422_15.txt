DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT The Directors Remuneration Report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee the Committee and has been approved by the Board.
Shareholders will be given the opportunity to approve the report at the Annual General Meeting on 19 May 2011.
This report has been drawn up in accordance with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008, the UK Listing Authority Listing Rules and the Code on Corporate Governance Practices in Appendix 14 of the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.

Prudential plc Annual Report 2010 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT 125 Disciplined capital allocation The Group has a rigorous focus on allocating capital to the geographies and products with the best returns and shortest payback opportunities.
Our objective is to create the highest possible sustainable returns for shareholders, as reected in our share price and dividends.
To align the interests of our executives with those of our shareholders and to reward them for delivering these returns, the Group Performance Share Plan is based on total shareholder return and only rewards participants if the Groups share price growth and dividends are superior to those provided by other international insurance organisations over a three-year period.
Proactive risk management Effectively managing risk across our operations is essential if the growth which we create is to provide shareholders with lasting value.
The Remuneration Committee is therefore mindful of the need for pay to reward the delivery of strong business results without encouraging inappropriate risk taking.
Given the longevity of the products which we offer, an important aspect of our remuneration policy has always been a focus on sustainable long-term performance.
We continue to achieve this in a number of ways including an emphasis on cash generation and preservation of capital in our annual bonus plan performance measures, the deferral of a proportion of the annual bonus into Company shares for three years and substantial shareholding guidelines for executives.
The Committee has and will continue to review the implications of emerging guidelines and regulations on our remuneration governance structures, policies and practices, and will implement any changes where appropriate.
I trust that you will endorse the policies outlined in our report.
