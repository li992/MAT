Directors Remuneration Report The directors present their report to shareholders on pages 21 to 28 regarding remuneration matters in respect of the year ended 31 December 2010.
Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee is responsible for setting the individual remuneration of the executive directors and other members of the Executive Committee within the framework of the remuneration policy described below, which is set by the Board.
The Directors who were members of the Committee during the year were Pat Chapman-Pincher Chairman of the Committee, Mike McTighe and John Grant.
For guidance, the Committee makes use of surveys of executive pay and knowledge of market rates.
The CEO and Director of HR also attended Remuneration Committee meetings during the year by invitation and provided advice to the Committee to enable it to reach informed decisions.
No director was present when their remuneration was being discussed.
The Committee was assisted in its consideration of remuneration matters by Kepler Associates who were appointed by the Committee.
Kepler Associates provided no other services to the Group in the year.
Pinsent Masons, legal advisers to the Company, also advised the Committee regarding certain equity incentive related issues.
Remuneration Policy The Board believes that it is necessary to ensure that the remuneration packages of the executive directors remain competitive in order to attract, retain and motivate executive directors and senior managers of a high calibre and to reward them for performance.
The policy is for a significant proportion of executive directors total remuneration to be capable of being earned from variable, performance-based incentives, through annual bonuses and share based incentives.
The objective of this policy is to provide rewards and incentives that reflect corporate and individual performance and align managements objectives directly with those of the Shareholders.
More than half of an executive directors remuneration is variable and is linked to corporate performance.
The Boards policy in relation to non-executive directors continues to be to pay fees that are competitive with the fees paid by comparable quoted companies.
Non-executive directors fees are determined by the Board as a whole within the limits set out in the Companys Articles of Association.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for performance bonuses or pension contributions and do not participate in the equity incentive plans.
Non-executive remuneration is generally reviewed annually.
Salary Basic salary for each executive director is determined by the Committee, taking into account the performance of the individual and information from independent sources on external market salary levels for comparable jobs with a view to salaries being set around the median to upper quartile level for comparable companies.
In setting senior executives salaries, the Committee also takes into account pay and employment conditions in the Group as a whole.
Salary is generally reviewed at the commencement of each financial year.
The Committee sought advice from remuneration consultants with regard to the salary review which took place in January 2011 and took into account the significantly increased turnover and international scale of the Group.
As a result of this review the annual salaries of the executive directors for 2011 were revised as follows: Neil Gaydon 500,000: Stuart Hall 325,000: David McKinney 315,000.
Performance Bonus The Company established a non-pensionable performance-related bonus plan for the executive directors and other key members of management for the year, which was based on the successful achievement of corporate and individual objectives.
The corporate objectives were linked to the key drivers of value creation for shareholders and the key measure therefore was the profitability of the Group for the full financial year.
Achievement of the 2010 bonus was dependent on the Groups pre-tax profits before certain exceptional items exceeding 80 million with the capacity to earn additional bonus increments upon achievement of higher profit targets up to a ceiling of 90 million.
In addition, a number of individual personal objectives were set for each director and manager, which were aligned with the objectives of the Group for the year.
The maximum bonus achievable by the executive directors in the event that all corporate and individual targets were met was 150% of basic annual salary with one third of any bonus outcome achieved being deferred into shares in the Company for a period of two years under the Group Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
The Committee retained a discretion to reduce the bonus otherwise payable by up to 20% based on their assessment of the management of the Companys cash position during the year.
The Committee, having regard to the performance during the period, determined to award maximum bonus to each of the executive directors under the 2010 annual performance bonus.
In addition, since 2009 the Committee has offered members of the Executive Committee including executive directors the opportunity to earn an exceptional bonus of up to 100% of annual salary, at the discretion of the 21 | Pace plc Annual Report 2010 R&A Front V3.
indd 23 17 03 2011 14:11 Committee, payable in deferred shares and only in the event of exceptional Group and individual performance.
The Committee intended that such bonus would be earned only for performance significantly in excess of that already rewarded through the annual bonus.
The Committee determined not to award any such exceptional bonus to members of the Executive Committee in respect of 2010.
In respect of the 2011 financial year, the Committee has reviewed the executive bonus structure with its remuneration advisers.
The outcome of this review is a revised bonus structure with the following key features:- the core of the current structure is to be maintained.
Targets will continue to be based primarily on the achievement of Group pre-tax profits targets with additional individual objectives aligned to Group strategy.
The Committee will retain a power to reduce bonus outcomes by 20% based on management of the Companys cash position: however, to improve transparency in respect of the current discretionary exceptional bonus opportunity, this feature will be replaced by specific additional performance objectives that, if achieved, can deliver additional bonus outcomes.
Achievement of the additional objectives can boost normal bonus outcomes achieved under the Group pre-tax profit targets and individual objectives described above by up to two-thirds 0.66, but only if a positive bonus outcome is first achieved under the normal Group pre-tax profits targets and individual objectives: potential maximum bonus outcomes will be capped at 225% of base salary reduced from 150% of base salary plus 100% exceptional bonus potential : the present pattern for deferral of bonuses will be maintained, with one-third of all bonus outcomes achieved up to 150% of base salary deferred into shares for two years, with deferral also applying on these terms to any bonus outcomes achieved between 150% and 225% of base salary.
Benefits in Kind Each executive director is entitled to benefits such as the provision of a fully expensed company car plus fuel or cash alternative, private medical insurance, permanent health insurance, life insurance and where applicable relocation assistance.
Pension Contributions In the year ending 31 December 2010, contributions were paid into the executive directors pension schemes at rates determined by the Board.
Contributions have continued to be paid during the current year at the rate of 15% of each directors basic salary.
The Group does not operate any defined benefit schemes.
Performance Share Plans Following the approval of shareholders at the 2009 AGM, a new Performance Share Plan PSP was introduced, with all Group employees including executive directors eligible to participate.
Under the PSP, employees receive a conditional right to receive shares for no cost, which will normally vest after 3 years subject to continued employment and the achievement of stretching performance conditions.
PSP awards will vest subject to the achievement of 3-year targets based on cumulative profit before tax PBT for the Group.
During the year awards made to all employees across the Group including executive directors were based on 3-year Group PBT.
The cumulative Group PBT targets that apply to the awards made in 2010 are set out in Note 4 to the directors share options table on page 27.
The Companys policy is that PSP awards will generally be satisfied using shares purchased in the market via the Pace Employee benefits share trust.
During the year the executive directors received PSP awards over shares worth 100% of their basic salary.
Cumulative PBT targets are proposed for 2011 also, with a range of 335 million 25% vesting up to 440 million full vesting.
For these purposes Group PBT will be adjusted to exclude the amortisation of other intangibles, exceptional items and other items that the Committee determines to be appropriate to ensure it reflects underlying long-term performance.
These PBT target figures will be re-stated in the 2011 Report and Accounts to reflect the switch to US dollar reporting.
The continued use of PBT targets for 2011 PSP awards is considered to be appropriate as it aligns the focus of Pace senior executives on a key measure of financial performance which is highly visible internally and externally and which is regularly monitored and reported.
Following the General Meeting of the Company held on 18 October 2010 shareholders approved the adoption of a new performance share plan, the International Performance Share Plan IPSP.
The IPSP follows closely the terms of the PSP: however executive directors may not participate.

indd 24 17 03 2011 14:11 Directors Remuneration Report continued Share Option Plans At present, the executive directors may participate in two share option plans: a standard HMRC approved all-employee sharesave plan: the Companys 2005 discretionary share option plans HMRC Approved and Unapproved plans.
In 2010, executive directors were granted sharesave options and also received option grants under the 2005 discretionary share option plans.
Details of the performance conditions applying to all outstanding share options held by the executive directors, including options granted in 2010, are set out in the footnotes to the directors share options table on page 27.
The maximum award of options to any employee pursuant to the HMRC Approved plan is 30,000.
The maximum award of options under the Unapproved plan to any employee in each year is 200% of salary or, in exceptional circumstances, as determined by the Committee, 400% of salary.
Option awards are targeted at the Companys most senior executives and are based on a fixed number of options related to an individuals performance contribution subject always to the discretion of the Committee to utilise other award criteria in exceptional circumstances.
Option awards vest subject to real EPS growth as noted on page 27.
The Committee believes EPS targets to be appropriate to enhance alignment of the senior executives with shareholder interests whilst still maintaining focus on profitability.
Minimum Shareholding Following the review of the Groups remuneration policies completed in February 2009 the Committee introduced individual shareholding target requirements for members of the Executive Committee including executive directors with a requirement subject to a discretion of the Committee for such executives to retain a portion of any net awards ie after tax and exercise cost of newly vested share-based incentives until the target shareholding level is reached.
Service Contracts Company policy is that in normal circumstances executive directors notice periods should not exceed 1 year.
Each of the executive directors has a service contract with the Company.

At the option of the Company, each agreement may be terminated forthwith subject to the Company paying a sum equivalent to 12 months salary, benefits and pension contributions.
The Remuneration Committee considers that compensation payments on termination of employment should depend on individual circumstances.
It is the Companys policy to honour its obligations with regard to directors service agreements and where the employment of a director is terminated in accordance with the aforementioned contractual process the Company will pay the sum specified in the relevant service agreement as payable or otherwise pay fair and reasonable compensation.
The service agreement of Neil Gaydon was entered into on 4 May 2006 and was most recently amended on 26 January 2011.
