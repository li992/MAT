During the year, the activities of the committee included a review of potential advisers, after which Towers Watson were appointed by the committee and undertook a review of executive remuneration.
The committees other responsibilities include: determining and agreeing with the board, within agreed terms of reference, the Groups policy for the remuneration of the executive directors and the individual remuneration packages for each executive director.
This includes basic salary, annual bonus, the level and terms of conditional awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan and the terms of performance conditions that apply to such benefits, pension rights and any compensation payments: making recommendations in relation to the remuneration of senior management including members of the executive committee: and liaising with the board in relation to the preparation of the boards annual report to shareholders on the Groups policy on the remuneration of executive directors and in particular the directors remuneration report, as required by the Companies Act 2006, the Combined Code on Corporate Governance 2008 and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
The committees terms of reference are published on the corporate website at www.
Given their diverse business experience, the independent non-executive directors who made up the committee in 2010 and the new members who joined the committee in 2011 offer a balanced view and international expertise in relation to remuneration matters for the Group.
60 ARM Holdings plc Annual Report 2010 Governance Remuneration Review 2010 The committee has access to independent professional advice from external advisers in the furtherance of its duties and makes use of such advice.
During 2010 after a review of potential advisers, Towers Watson were appointed by the committee and undertook a review of executive remuneration, including a detailed comparison of the composition of the remuneration packages for the executive directors and key senior managers against those offered by appropriate peer companies.
Their main conclusion was that the base salaries were below median relative to other companies of similar market capitalisation.
The amount of leverage was normal and total reward was constrained by the level of base salaries.
The maximum bonus under the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan DAB was below the market norm and it was recommended that this be increased from 125% to 150%.
This change was approved by the remuneration committee in December 2010 to apply to bonuses earned in relation to the 2011 financial year onwards.
This will bring maximum bonus for executive directors and executive committee members in line with the maximum bonus that can be achieved by the next level of management, who can also achieve a maximum bonus of 150%.
Base salary increase for 2010 For 2010 the average increase in base salaries for the executive directors was 3.3% and the average increase for the workforce as a whole was 3.58%.
Remuneration policy The remuneration committee, in its deliberations on remuneration policy for the Groups executive directors, seeks to give full consideration to the principles set out in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance 2008.
The committee is able to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and corporate governance issues when setting the remuneration of executive directors.
The committee also monitors developments in accounting for equity-based remuneration on an ongoing basis.
The Group operates a remuneration policy and framework for executive directors designed to ensure that it attracts and retains the best high quality management skills necessary to achieve a high level of corporate performance, in line with the best interests of shareholders.
This policy seeks to provide rewards and incentives for the remuneration of executive directors that reflect their performance and align with the objectives of the Group.
These comprise a mix of performancerelated and  remuneration.
The committee believes that a directors total remuneration should seek to recognise their worth in the external market and, to this end, obtains information from independently published remuneration surveys, benchmarks the total remuneration package and applies the following principles: base salaries are set by reference to the market median, as part of a total remuneration package which has the potential to be upper quartile: a significant amount i. e. more than 50% of total potential remuneration is performance-related: a significant element of performance-related remuneration is provided in the form of shares: elements of performance-related variable remuneration are subject to deferral: and the performance of divisional general managers is measured both at division and Group level.
Advisers In addition to the appointment of Towers Watson, other advisers who provided services during 2010 were: KPMG who provided general advice on remuneration and benefits, including tax advice for employees who are seconded overseas and they also worked on royalty audits: Linklaters who provided legal services in relation to equity plans and corporate matters: Monks who provided salary survey data: Deloitte who provided salary survey data, royalty audit services and tax training: and Kepler Associates who provided independent verification of TSR calculations for the Long Term Incentive Plan.
Advisers are generally appointed by Bill Parsons, the EVP, Human Resources and are subject to review by the committee.
The EVP, Human Resources also provided advice to the committee and to the Group in 2010.
Monks is an associate of the Groups external auditor and these services were approved by the audit committee in accordance with the procedure described in the Corporate Governance report.
The Chief Executive Officer and the EVP, Human Resources, normally attend for part of remuneration committee meetings.
No director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.
ARM Holdings plc Annual Report 2010 61 Governance Chairmans statement Corporate responsibility report Board of directors Directors report Corporate governance Remuneration report Shareholding guideline A shareholding guideline is in place for executive directors and certain senior managers, who are required to build up a holding of shares in the Company over a period of five years.
The shareholdings may include shares received through earlier grants under the Companys share option schemes and or the Long Term Incentive Plan and or the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan and, in the case of executive directors and members of the executive committee, the required holding is 100% of basic salary.
Incentive arrangements The remuneration committee aims to ensure that individuals are fairly rewarded for their contribution to the success of the Group.
There are four key incentive schemes in operation within the Group.
These are the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan DAB and Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP for executive directors and senior managers and the Employee Equity Plan and Annual Bonus Plan for all other employees.
These plans provide alignment between remuneration and the financial performance of the Group and strengthen retention of key employees through deferment of bonus.
Option grants to executive directors ceased in 2006 although the facility to grant options exists in exceptional circumstances and the move away from options to restricted shares for all employees reduces potential dilution and has simplified remuneration arrangements.
Since 2007, variable remuneration for executive directors and certain senior managers has consisted of two performance-related elements: annual bonus and a conditional award under the Long Term Incentive Plan.
Deferred Annual Bonus Plan DAB There is a strong variable element to executive directors remuneration and for 2010 a bonus of up to a maximum of 125% of base salary after application of a personal performance multiplier which flexes the payment by 0.75 to 1.25 could be earned through the DAB if all targets were met.
The strong performance of the Group in 2010 resulted in both of the two bonus targets being achieved, each of which was capable of triggering 50% of total bonus.
For 2010 the US dollar revenue target was $548.7 million against which revenue of $631.3 million was achieved.
The normalised operating profit NOP target range was from zero payout at 89.5 million up to 25% at 112.4 million and 50% at 120.0 million, all at the budget exchange rate of 1:US$1.65.
Actual currency adjusted NOP was 150.1 million.
These targets were set by the remuneration committee in December 2009 January 2010 against the background of the extremely difficult trading conditions that prevailed in 2009 and the considerable uncertainty that existed in relation to global economic conditions and trading prospects for the semiconductor industry as a whole.
It is to the credit of the executive team and all employees that these targets were exceeded in such a potentially difficult year.
The bonuses payable to each executive director in respect of performance during 2010 are shown later in this report and are all at 125% of base salary, half of which was compulsorily deferred into shares for three years.
Shares representing the deferred element of bonus earned in 2007 and awarded in 2008 vested in February 2011, with the maximum 2:1 ratio of matching shares being triggered.
The personal performance multiplier depends on the achievement of pre-determined objectives which are reviewed and approved by the committee each year.
These include key strategic objectives related to each directors role and responsibilities including compliance with the Management Charter which is designed to foster employee development, understanding of the overall vision and strategy of the Group and good governance.
There is compulsory deferral into shares of 50% of the bonus earned and an opportunity to earn an equity match of up to 2:1, subject to achievement of an EPS performance condition.
At the end of the three year deferral period the shares and any matching shares earned are satisfied first from treasury shares and then by newly issued shares.
The targets set by the committee for the DAB each year are intended to be stretching but motivational and average bonus paid to the executive directors over the past five years is 77.8% of salary with a range from 38.6% payout in 2007 to 125% in 2010 as shown below: Average % bonus paid over the past five years to executive directors 150 120 90 60 30 0 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 62 ARM Holdings plc Annual Report 2010 % of base salaries Governance Following the remuneration review conducted by Towers Watson and taking account of the relatively modest increases in base salary, the committee has taken the decision that the maximum potential bonus for 2011 onwards will increase to 150% of base salary after application of the personal performance multiplier.
This is regarded as fair taking account of the total remuneration packages available to the executive directors and the arrangements in place in peer group companies.
For 2011, the committee has decided to adopt the same bonus target arrangement so that 50% of bonus will be dependent on achieving a US dollar revenue target and 50% on achieving a currency adjusted NOP target, which the committee believes have been set at challenging but motivational levels.
At EPS growth equal to the increase in the Consumer Prices Index CPI plus 4% per annum, the deferred shares will be matched on a 0.3:1 basis, rising to 2:1 when EPS growth is in excess of CPI plus 12% per annum.
These targets are directly related to the Groups financial results and encourage achievement of the Groups short-term financial goals, while the deferral and matching elements encourage a longer term view of the success of the Group.
The deferred shares can be forfeited in the event of gross misconduct and the matching shares are subject to forfeiture for bad leavers.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Annual grants to executive directors are normally made at a level equivalent to base salary.
Conditional awards vest to the extent that the performance criteria are satisfied over a three-year performance period from 1 January of the year of award and no re-testing thereafter is possible.
The performance conditions are based on the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR when measured against that of two comparator groups each testing half of the shares comprised in the award.
The first index comprises UK companies across all sectors FTSE 350 and the second comprises predominantly US companies within the hi-tech sector FTSE Global Technology Index.
The committee approved the replacement of the FTSE Global Technology Index which ceased to exist at the end of February 2011 with the All World Technology Index for assessing TSR for LTIP awards made in 2009 and subsequently.
Towers Watson has confirmed that there is 99% correlation between the performance of the two indices.
The performance criteria provide the link to performance against an appropriate peer group.
For each comparator group, the number of shares that may vest may be up to a maximum of 200% of the relevant half of the shares comprised in the conditional award if the Companys TSR ranks in the upper decile, 50% of the relevant half of the shares will vest in the event of median performance and between median and upper decile performance vesting will increase on a straight-line basis.
Additional shares may vest to cover dividends paid by the Company during the performance period.
No shares will be received for below-median performance.
In addition, no shares will vest unless the committee is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group.
Former share option schemes The option grants to executive directors made up to 2006 remain available for exercise and vesting in accordance with the rules of the relevant schemes.
They are subject to performance conditions which led to partial vesting after three years based on real EPS growth and the remainder vests after seven years.
Any options issued to executive directors prior to their appointment to the board are not subject to performance conditions.
The performance conditions relating to these remaining option grants are set out in more detail in the table later in this report.
Pensions The Group does not operate its own pension scheme but makes payments into a Group personal pension plan, which is a money purchase scheme.
For executive directors, the normal rate of Group contribution is 10% of the executives basic salary plus additional amounts in accordance with the Groups salary sacrifice scheme.
Full details of Group contributions are set out in the directors emoluments table later in this report.
In response to impending changes in legislation, the committee has agreed that, to the extent that contributions cannot be made in a tax efficient way at the 10% of basic salary level, the difference will be paid as an additional cash allowance and subject to appropriate tax and other deductions.
ARM Holdings plc Annual Report 2010 63 Governance Chairmans statement Corporate responsibility report Board of directors Directors report Corporate governance Remuneration report Service agreements Executive directors have service contracts that may be terminated by either party on one years notice.
These agreements provide for each of the directors to provide services to the Group on a full-time basis and contain restrictive covenants for periods of three to six months following termination of employment relating to non-competition, non-solicitation of the Groups customers, non-dealing with customers and non-solicitation of the Groups suppliers and employees.
In addition, each service contract contains an express obligation of confidentiality in respect of the Groups trade secrets and confidential information and provides for the Group to own any intellectual property rights created by the directors in the course of their employment.
The dates of the service contracts of each person who served as an executive director during the financial year are as follows: Director Date Warren East 29 January 2001 Tim Score 1 March 2002 Tudor Brown 3 April 1996 Mike Inglis 17 July 2002 Mike Muller 31 January 1996 Simon Segars 4 January 2005 Where notice is served to terminate the appointment, whether by the Group or the executive director, the Group in its absolute discretion is entitled to terminate the appointment by paying to the executive director his salary in lieu of any required period of notice.
Non-executive directors During 2010, the Chairmen of the audit and remuneration committees each received a total fee of 47,500 per annum and the other non-executive directors each received a total fee of 42,000 per annum.
These fees were arrived at by reference to fees paid by other companies of similar size and complexity and reflected the amount of time non-executive directors were expected to devote to the Groups activities during the year.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is set by the executive directors and the term of appointment is three years which can be rolled forward for a further period of three years and is then subject to annual review.
Fees paid to non-executive directors are reviewed annually with effect from 1 January.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts, are not eligible to participate in bonus or share incentive arrangements and their service does not qualify for pension purposes or other benefits.
No element of their fees is performance-related.
