74 Directors remuneration report A note from the Remuneration Committee Land Securities Annual Report 2010 L ur t s Gr u L tr d London F and Sec i ie o p P C 5 S an WC2N 5A Dear shareholder, As a Board we strongly believe that the Companys remuneration policy should be aligned with, and sensitive to, shareholders interests.
The Remuneration Committee seeks to deliver that alignment by focusing management team incentives on successful delivery of strategy and appropriate returns for investors.
Over the past two years, Land Securities has been operating in very different market conditions to those prevailing prior to 2008.
The Remuneration Committee has been mindful to re ect the changed circumstances affecting the Company and its shareholders.
As a result, no salary increases or bonuses were awarded to the Executive Directors in respect of the financial year 2008 09 with the exception of Ian Ellis, the Chief Executive of Trillium, who received a bonus upon the sale of Trillium in January 2009.
In 2010, the Committee decided to increase the salaries of the Executive Directors by an average of 2% and resume the payment of bonuses, which are based principally on the delivery of outperformance against objective benchmarks such as the Investment Property Databank IPD.
Over the past 12 months we have changed the vesting conditions for grants under our Long-term Incentive Plan from June 2009 onwards.
The introduction of a relative Total Shareholder Return measure, alongside the existing measure which benchmarks performance against the IPD quarterly index, is designed to align executive incentives more closely with shareholders interests and returns.
We have an Additional Bonus Opportunity, which seeks to incentivise and reward signi cant outperformance of the IPD benchmark.
This year we introduced an additional control mechanism to address the position where a year of outperformance is followed by a year of material underperformance.
We are committed to operating with transparency.
In line with this commitment, the following section provides a concise question and answer section highlighting key principles, policies and actions from the year under review.
On p7879 we provide a full Directors remuneration report.

Policies p7881 From the Committees responsibilities to our remuneration policies and philosophy.
76 Directors remuneration report Q&A What were the Companys principles in terms of remuneration for Directors?
Our pay and rewards should attract the best people to the business and incentivise them to produce superior returns for our shareholders.
Therefore we believe we should reward people for achieving and exceeding Company targets.
This is why a substantial part of our Executive Directors reward is performance-related pay, with incentives to exceed industry benchmarks and to deliver relative Total Shareholder Return outperformance in comparison to our peer group.
We seek to align incentives with shareholders interests and to reward the Executive Directors for delivering on the Groups strategic objectives.
The Committee also took into consideration the output from a Remuneration Workshop held by the Board in November 2009.
The Committee is conscious of the fall in the value of shareholdings in the Company experienced over the past two years.
This loss of value was also experienced by the Executive Directors through their individual shareholdings and through the lower value of their deferred share and LTIP Matching Share awards.
There are three principal elements to the remuneration we provide: Salaries reflect an individuals consistent performance and contribution to the business, as defined and decided by the Committee.
We aim to pay salaries at a mid-market level.
The Committee takes account of salary levels and increases across the organisation, together with institutional shareholders concerns on the ratcheting of basic salaries.
Please see p79 for more details on basic salaries.
Annual bonuses reward performance according to a set of key performance indicators, aimed at ensuring the Company delivers on its key priorities for the year.
There is a bonus opportunity for Executive Directors of up to 100% of basic salary and, at the Remuneration Committees discretion, this can be increased to 130%.
There is also a bonus opportunity of up to 200% of basic salary for exceptional performance.
However, no Director may earn a bonus of more than 300% of basic salary in total.
Tables 56 and 57 on p86 set out the criteria for each type of bonus.
Long-term Incentive Plan rewards for Directors are aligned with our long-term business objectives and the level of value created for shareholders.
Please see p81 for more on long-term incentives.
What were the Executive Directors paid this year?
The Committee decided that the Executive Directors should not receive any pay increases during the financial year 2009 10.
The Committee has decided that their pay should be increased by an average amount of 2.0% to Table 46 take effect from 1 July 2010.
This was below the overall figure for salary increases across the Group of 2.4%.
It also What was the Executive Directors decided that it was appropriate to resume the payment of bonuses this year to reflect the improved performance remuneration for 2009 10?

Robert Noel received a bonus Note: annual bonuses comprise both the cash element and the element which will be deferred into the Companys shares for a period of three years.
amounting to 44% of annual salary as partial compensation for a bonus foregone at his previous employer.
25% of any annual bonus award and 50% of any additional bonus opportunity is deferred into the Companys shares for a period of three years.
How was share price performance factored into the Directors remuneration?
It was factored in through the Long-term Incentive Plan and also through awarding part of the annual bonuses in the form of deferred shares that vest after three years.
However, it is not considered best practice to make share price performance a major incentive.
This could encourage Directors to make decisions that bolster the share price in the short-term rather than decisions that benefit the Company and its shareholders in the long term.
In addition, all Executive Directors must, within five years of joining the Board, own shares with a value of at least 1.5 x basic salary and for the Chief Executive 2.0 x basic salary to ensure their interests are aligned with those of shareholders.

Emphasis is placed on delivering superior reward for achieving and exceeding the Groups business plan.
A substantial proportion of the Executive Directors remuneration is delivered through performance related pay.
Executive Directors have substantial incentives to outperform industry performance benchmarks.
A summary of the principal components of Executive Directors remuneration is set out below.
Chart 48 illustrates the balance between fixed and variable pay at the target and maximum performance levels, assuming maximum participation in the Long-term Incentive Plan LTIP.
This information reflects the policy that operated during the year under review and there was no change in the balance between fixed and Chart 48 variable pay during that period.
What was the balance of xed versus The Groups remuneration policy is reviewed regularly, along with the balance between fixed and variable pay, to ensure that it remains appropriate and recognises developments in corporate governance variable pay?
Performance targets are set to align with Group strategic objectives and Key performance Target indicators KPIs as outlined on p13.
Tables 56 and 57 show how these elements are aligned.
7 Changes to bonus arrangements and share incentive plans Maximum For LTIP grants made from June 2009, the Remuneration Committee decided to make some changes to vesting conditions to improve alignment of executive incentives with shareholder interests.
Previously, 0 20 40 60 80 100 EPS growth had governed the vesting of 50% of the LTIP grant.
However, following the sale of Trillium in Basic salary excluding pension contributions and benefits January 2009, the EPS measure became less relevant, and was replaced by a relative Total Shareholder Performance related bonus Return TSR measure.
Value of shares vesting Land Securities three-year TSR performance share price increase plus reinvested dividends will be compared against the TSR performance of an index of a comparator group of FTSE 350 Real Estate Companies, weighted based on their market cap at the beginning of the performance period.
If Land Securities TSR performance is below this index, this portion of the LTIP grant will lapse in full.
If Land Securities matches the index, 30% of this portion i. e. 15% of the overall grant will vest.
Full vesting will occur if Land Securities TSR beats the index by 4% per annum or more, with straight-line vesting in between these points.
Chart 49 shows the vesting range.
The Committee may amend the list of comparator companies in the Sector Index, and relative weightings, if circumstances make this necessary for example, as a result of takeovers or mergers of Chart 49 comparator companies or significant changes in the composition of the Group.
At 31 March 2010, the list of TSR Performance Condition comparator companies comprised: The British Land Company PLC, Hammerson plc, Liberty International PLC, SEGRO plc, Derwent London plc, Great Portland Estates plc, F&C Commercial Property Trust Limited, % of overall LTIP grant vesting Shaftesbury PLC, Daejan Holdings PLC, Helical Bar plc, and Big Yellow Group PLC.
Vesting conditions for the other half of the LTIP grant, based on ungeared Total Property Return TPR performance relative to an Investment Property Databank IPD benchmark, are unchanged.
50% In 2009 10 the Committee agreed to introduce a control mechanism to govern bonuses paid under the additional bonus opportunity to address the position where a year of outperformance is followed by a year of material underperformance see p80.
15% 8 Principles and policy on basic salaries 0% 4% Executive Directors receive a salary that reflects their responsibilities, experience and performance.
% p. a. above weighted index of comparator companies Salaries are reviewed annually with any changes taking place in July.
The review process includes the use of comparator information and reports from the Groups remuneration consultants.
The Groups policy is to set salary around the mid-market rate, but the Committee is mindful of the need to treat pay comparisons with caution to avoid an upward ratchet of remuneration levels with no corresponding improvement in performance.
The Committee also takes account of pay and employment conditions across the Group, especially when determining annual salary increases.
After taking account of market conditions, the Committee decided that the Executive Directors should receive salary increases averaging 2% to take effect from 1 July 2010.
The current salaries of the Executive Directors are as shown in Table 52.
9 Principles and policy on annual bonuses in 2009 10 During the year under review, the Executive Directors had individually tailored annual bonus performance targets that provided the potential to earn up to 300% of base salary.
Each of the Executive Directors have the same bonus potential, although their individual performance targets differ from Director to Director see Tables 56 and 57.
Robert Noel was not eligible to participate in the annual bonus opportunity or the Additional Bonus opportunity in respect of 2009 10.
The annual bonus opportunity was structured in two distinct parts: Bonus Opportunity: up to 100% of salary The performance targets that applied to this part of the Executive Directors annual bonus opportunity are set out in Table 56.
Land Securities Annual Report 2010 1127 Land Securities 54-90. indd 1127 Land Securities 54-90. indd 79 79 2 6 10 2 6 10 14:34:02 14:34:02 Directors remuneration report 80 The Committee calibrates the bonus targets so that the achievement of a maximum payout under this part of the bonus arrangements would represent performance in excess of the Group budget and individual targets.
25% of any bonus award is compulsorily deferred into the Companys shares for a period of three years and receives a Matching Award under the terms of the LTIP see below.
Executive Directors have also been eligible to participate in a discretionary bonus pool for all employees which, if applicable, is normally in the range of 5-30% of salary.
Discretionary bonus awards of up to 50% of salary may be granted in exceptional circumstances within the maximum of 130% of base salary for total annual bonus excluding the additional bonus for exceptional performance.
Such discretionary bonus payments are subject to an overall cap of 500,000 for payments to all Executive Directors in any one year.
It remains the Committees intention not to pay aggregate annual bonuses in excess of 300% of salary.
Additional Bonus Opportunity: up to 200% of salary This part of Executive Directors annual bonus opportunity is intended to reward exceptional performance and value creation for shareholders.
The performance targets that applied during 2009 10 are set out in Table 57.
Total Property Return was chosen as a performance measure for the investment portfolio element of the business because it is used both internally and externally within the property sector for measurement of relative performance.
The Committees objective in introducing the additional bonus was to encourage a striving for material outperformance every year.
Half of any bonus earned between 100% and 300% of salary is compulsorily deferred into the Companys shares for a total period of three years which is considered highly retentive.
Any deferral under this part of the annual bonus arrangements is not the subject of a matching award under the LTIP.
The Committee calibrated the bonus targets that applied to this part of the Executive Directors bonus opportunity so that the performance required was above that required for bonuses of up to 100% of salary.
To provide some context as to the challenging nature of the performance targets, the TPR conditions are based on more than 10 years of historic data and require TPR performance to fall broadly within the top 30th percentile of each relevant Investment Property Databank IPD performance benchmark if any additional bonus is to be earned.
Any payout for beating the IPD benchmark by more than 2% is conditional upon the relative performance in that year and the prior year exceeding the IPD benchmark.
This constitutes a backward-looking control measure against outperformance in the in-year period following a year of underperformance.
For example: In year one performance is 1% below the IPD benchmark In year two performance is 3% above the IPD benchmark Payout for year two is based on performance in that year as the aggregate performance over the two years is at least equal to the benchmark.
In 2009 10, the Committee decided to amend this control mechanism with this change taking effect from the 2010 11 financial year.
In future, no bonus payments will be made until the subsequent years outturn for TPR performance relative to the IPD benchmark becomes available and it becomes evident that the year of exceptional outperformance is not followed by a year of material underperformance.
A flowchart showing how any payments under the Additional Bonus Opportunity will be calculated is shown below.
The actual total bonus payouts, inclusive of the additional bonus opportunity described above, that were earned in respect of the financial year ended 31 March 2010 are set out in Table 59.
Chart 50 Additional Bonus Opportunity No additional No bonus payable Additional bonus payable 50% in cash 50% in shares deferred for two years Does TPR exceed IPD benchmark TPR exceeds in Year 1 by 2% IPD benchmark or more?

The LTIP replaced the share option scheme approved in 2002 and also replaced, from 2006 07, the performance share matching plan, also approved in 2002.
There is no retesting in relation to long-term incentives for Executive Directors.
The LTIP consists of the facility to make annual awards of Performance Shares and Matching Shares.
LTIP Performance Shares In the year under review, Executive Directors were eligible to receive conditional awards of shares of up to 100% of salary Table 60.
LTIP Matching Shares Matching share awards are linked to co-investment by participants in shares Table 60.
A Directors co-investment can be made through the deferral of an annual bonus award with the maximum permitted investment by this means of 25% of base salary.
Co-investment can also be made through the pledging of shares purchased in the market.
Such additional investment is permitted to bring the Directors total investment to 50% of base salary for this purpose the value of pledged shares is taken as the amount of gross salary that would have been required to fund the purchase of the shares.
Accordingly, Executive Directors are eligible to receive a matching award of shares under the LTIP which is made at a ratio of up to two for one on a gross to net tax basis up to 100 shares for every 25 purchased out of net income.
The maximum Matching Share award is over shares with a value of 100% of salary.
Awards of LTIP Performance Shares and Matching Shares are subject to the same performance conditions measured over three years.
In respect of LTIP and Matching Share awards granted in 2007 and 2008, half of any award will vest based on achieving increases in Normalised Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share NADEPS.
The other half will vest dependent on the Groups TPR equalling, or exceeding, IPD weighted indices that reflect the sector mix of Land Securities investment portfolio.
The targets: NADEPS target Growth of RPI 3% per annum 12.5% of the award vests: Growth of RPI 5% per annum 50% of the award vests: and Straight-line vesting occurs between these points.
TPR target Performance equal to the sector weighted IPD index 12.5% of the award vests Performance equal to the sector weighted IPD index plus 1% per annum 50% of the initial award vests Straight-line vesting occurs between these points.
In respect of awards made from June 2009 onwards, the NADEPS performance condition was replaced by a TSR measure, as explained on p79.
The vesting range for awards using the TSR measure remains the same as for awards which use the NADEPS performance measure.
The maximum number of shares which could potentially vest as a result of historic long-term incentive awards and the number of shares which vested in the financial year are shown in Table 60.
The Groups policy is to use market-purchased shares to satisfy the vesting of LTIP Performance and Matching Shares and for Deferred Share Awards.
Future awards are partially hedged through on-market share purchases by an Employee Benefit Trust which held 522,409 shares at 31 March 2010.

Vesting of share options was subject to performance tests and was dependent on growth in NADEPS exceeding RPI by at least 2.5% per annum.
Following the adoption of the LTIP in 2005 06, no further awards of share options have been made to the Executive Directors.
For grants made over the period 2000 to 2004, the Committee determined that the required level of increase in NADEPS was achieved and as a result the executive share options granted during that period are exercisable in full.
Directors options over ordinary shares are shown in Table 63.
2 Directors emoluments Table 59 sets out Directors emoluments for the year under review and the financial year ended 31 March 2009.

What are the Executive Directors salaries?
On 18 June 2009, it was announced that Mike Hussey would leave the Company by mutual agreement on 30 June 2009.
In accordance with the mitigation provisions agreed to by all Executive Directors in May From Current 1 July 2010 2005, he received a payment of 282,555 comprising six months annual salary, pension benefits at 25% of F W Salway 645,000 655,000 salary together with compensation for other miscellaneous benefits representing 5% of salary.
In addition M F Greenslade 414,000 425,000 it was agreed that six further monthly payments, subject to mitigation, of 47,092 would be paid from R J Akers 372,600 380,000 January 2010 in respect of salary, pension allowance and benefit allowance.
Also, under the terms of his R M Noel 400,000 408,000 contract, Mike Hussey received: Time pro-rated annual cash bonus for 2009 10 of 81,506 Time pro-rated award of deferred bonus shares amounting to 70,703 shares Vesting of LTIP and maturing share awards with a total value of 266,001.
Mike Hussey was considered to be a good leaver for the purposes of the Groups employee share scheme.
Accordingly, he was eligible to exercise share options granted under the Savings-related and Executive Share Option Schemes and to receive shares awarded under the deferred bonus plan, subject to the rules of the relevant plans and schemes in force.
Mike Hussey was also eligible to receive vested shares arising from awards of shares under the LTIP and matching share plan in respect of awards made in 2006 and 2007.
These awards were subject to attainment of the relevant performance conditions and were pro-rated to the next six-month anniversary from date of grant as specified by the rules of this plan.
The Committee determined attainment of the performance conditions and time pro-rating as follows: Performance Time Award pro-rating pro-rating Shares vested 2006 LTIP Award 92.5% 100% 20,092 2006 Matching Share Plan Award 92.5% 100% 18,625 2007 LTIP Award 50% 2 3rds 8,975 2007 Matching Share Plan Award 50% 2 3rds 9,048 2008 9 LTIP Award 0% 1 6th 0 All awards granted under the Companys Share Incentive Plans were made immediately available to Mike Hussey following the date of his leaving the Company, subject to deductions for PAYE, tax and National Insurance.
This was in accordance with the rules for good leavers under the relevant plans.

Upon joining the Company he was granted an award of shares which broadly matched the long-term incentive awards at his previous employer in terms of the timing of vesting of share awards.
In relation to quantum it was agreed that his awards granted in January 2010 would not be subject to performance conditions but the value would be scaled back to reflect assumptions in relation to the likelihood of vesting.
The awards granted to Robert Noel upon appointment were as follows: No.
of shares Date of vesting awarded 30 June 2010 34,000 30 June 2011 46,000 30 June 2012 80,000 In addition, it was agreed that he should be paid the sum of 175,000 as a cash bonus for 2009 10 as partial compensation for a bonus foregone at his previous employer.
He did not participate in the LTIP Matching Share Scheme in respect of the 2009 10 financial year.
3 Pensions The Company operates a contributory money purchase pension scheme which was introduced for all staff joining the Group from 1 January 1999.
Prior to the introduction of the contributory money purchase arrangement the Company provided pension benefits on a defined benefit basis.
Following a review of pension provision in light of the tax changes that came into effect from 1 April 2006, it was decided that Executive Directors would continue to be entitled to a pension benefit that is equivalent to 25% of their base salary.
Executive Directors have the flexibility to determine how this 25% of salary benefit is used, as follows: Pension contributions may be made into the Land Securities contributory money purchase scheme up to the personal level that is advised plus a cash contribution on the balance: 25% cash payment on base salary to invest outside Land Securities pension arrangements.
Richard Akers participates in a defined benefit pension scheme which was open to property management and administration staff until 31 December 1998.
This scheme is designed to provide, at normal retirement age, a pension of 1 60th of Pensionable Salary for each year of pensionable service.
The scheme also provides lump sum death-in-service benefits on death before normal retirement age of four times Pensionable Salary and pension provision for dependants of members.
Only basic salary is treated as Pensionable Salary.
The benefits provided to Richard Akers are based on a Pensionable Salary which is subject to the statutory earnings cap.

As a result, the unexpired term and the notice periods both from the Company and from the Executive Director are 12 months.
The contracts contain a provision that if an Executive Director is given notice to terminate their employment by the Company, they will be considered for a bonus in the usual way and the usual time following the relevant bonus year subject to a minimum bonus amount of 10% of basic salary, pro-rated to reflect the number of months of the bonus year prior to the service of notice of termination.
Any proposals for the early termination of the service agreements of Directors or senior executives are considered by the Committee.
The dates of appointment and the dates of the service agreements of the Executive Directors are in Table54.
The service agreements of the Executive Directors provide for phased payments of amounts payable on termination, in order to mitigate amounts potentially payable by the Company.
Bonus, LTIP, redundancy Table 54 and outplacement payments are considered by the Committee and are dependent on the circumstances When were the Executive Directors of leaving and the rules of the relevant bonus and incentive schemes.
The Company does not make any arrangements that guarantee pensions with limited or no abatement on severance or early retirement.
The Chairman and the other Non-executive Directors do not have service agreements with Date of Date of the Company.

6 Directors shareholdings The interests of the Directors in the shares of the Company as at 31 March 2010 are shown in Table 61.
There have been no changes in the shareholdings of the Directors between the end of the financial year and 18 May 2010, save that on 1 April 2010 Alison Carnwath and Martin Greenslade acquired 1,321 and 855 shares respectively under the Companys Scrip Dividend Plan.
No Director had any other interests in contracts or securities of Land Securities Group PLC or any of its subsidiary undertakings during the year.
7 Shareholding guidelines for Directors The Committee believes that it is important for a significant part of the compensation of each Executive Director to be tied to ownership of the Companys shares so that each Executive Directors interest in the growth and performance of the Company is closely aligned with the interests of our shareholders.
The Committee has, therefore, established share ownership guidelines for the Companys Executive Directors.
These guidelines require the Chief Executive to own shares with a value equal to twice his base salary and for other Executive Directors to own shares with a value equal to 1.5 times their base salary.
An Executive Director must normally satisfy the guidelines within five years of his date of appointment or the date of introduction of this requirement in order to qualify for future awards of long-term incentives.
In May 2007, the Committee determined that Francis Salway had met the revised share ownership guidelines and in May 2010 the Committee agreed that Martin Greenslade and Richard Akers had met the revised guidelines.
The Committee continues to monitor the Executive Directors progress against the guidelines on an annual basis.
In addition, Non-executive Directors are required to own shares with a value equal to their annual fees within three years of the date of their appointment.

The exercise of share options under the Groups Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all employees who have completed six months service with the Group, is satisfied by the allotment of newly issued shares.
At 31 March 2010, the total number of shares which could be allotted under this scheme was 522,049 shares.
This represents less than 0.07% of the issued share capital of the Company.
9 Pay of senior managers below Board level The Group currently employs 19 senior managers in positions below Board level.
None of these senior managers receives a salary which is higher than those paid to the Executive Directors and the structure of their remuneration package, including bonuses, is broadly consistent with that of Executive Directors.
The senior managers generally have a bonus potential of up to 80% of annual salary determined by a range of performance indicators.
In addition, they are eligible to participate in the discretionary bonus pool of up to 50% of salary.
Six of the senior managers, who are responsible for the areas which impact the most significantly on the results of the Group, will also be eligible from 2010 11 to participate in the additional bonus opportunity for the delivery of exceptional financial returns, as described above in this report, but at up to a maximum of 80% of annual salary.
During the year under review, bonuses for this group of employees ranged from 54% to 96% of salary, with an average bonus of 68% of salary.
In addition a small number of senior managers were paid retention bonuses in respect of the demerger of the Group proposed in 2007 and stopped in 2009.
Performance graphs As required by legislation covering the Directors remuneration report, Chart 55 illustrates the performance of the Company measured by total shareholder return share price growth plus dividends paid against a broad equity market index over a period of five years.
As the Company is a constituent of the FTSE All Share Real Estate sector this index is considered to be the most appropriate benchmark for the purposes of the graph.
The Committee also considered that it would be helpful to provide an additional line to illustrate performance compared with the FTSE 100 index over the previous five years of the Company see Chart 55.

The Increase in transfer value net of Directors contributions differs from the Transfer value of increase in accrued benefits in that it reflects changes in the transfer value assumptions and market conditions over the year less the Directors own contributions to the pension scheme.
The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the 2008 transfer value regulations.
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement in respect of qualifying service represents the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the liability in respect of the Directors pension benefits that they earned in respect of qualifying service.
They do not represent sums payable to individual Directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
Vesting of awards is dependent on the Companys growth in normalised adjusted EPS exceeding the growth in RPI by 2.5% per year.
