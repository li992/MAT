RIT CAPITAL PARTNERS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT 38 This report details the remuneration paid to the Companys Directors including the Chairman, Lord Rothschild, the Chief Operating Officer, Duncan Budge and the Investment Director, Mikael Breuer-Weil, for the year ended 31 March 2010.
AUDITED SECTIONS OF THE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT The following sections of the Report have been audited: the Directors remuneration table, the sections on the long-term incentive plan and pension contributions, and the executive Directors pension table.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REMUNERATION AND CONFLICTS COMMITTEE The remuneration packages of individual executive Directors were determined by the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee in the year ended 31 March 2010.
This Committee was dissolved on that date and, with effect from 1 April 2010, its remuneration responsibilities were assumed by the new Remuneration Committee.
Both committees are, or were, comprised of Charles Bailey Chairman, John Cornish, James Leigh-Pemberton and Michael Marks, all of whom are considered by the Board to be independent, nonexecutive Directors.
Lord Rothschild, Duncan Budge and Mikael Breuer-Weil liaise closely with the Committees, although they do not take part in any discussions relating to decisions on their own terms and conditions of employment.
Determination of the remuneration of the non-executive Directors, within the limits imposed by the Articles of Association, is the responsibility of the Board as a whole.
The Remuneration Committee is also responsible for the operation of the long-term incentive plan for executive Directors.
Remuneration Policy The Company complied in the year under review with the provisions relating to Remuneration Committees incorporated in the Combined Code as revised in 2008 the Code.
Until its division on 31 March 2010, the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee was responsible for setting executive remuneration at an appropriate level to attract, retain and motivate Directors of requisite calibre.
Any arrangements made to provide longer term incentives are intended to encourage and reward performance and to benefit shareholders, as well as to ensure RITs employees are adequately remunerated compared to its industry peers.
The Remuneration and Conflicts Committee compared remuneration packages of similar financial institutions to the Company and modelled its decisions on the median position of those institutions.
In setting policy and making decisions, the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee gave full consideration to the provisions on the design of performance-related remuneration set out in Schedule A of the Code.
The responsibilities in these areas were transferred to the newly formed Remuneration Committee with effect from 1 April 2010.

For the current year, to 31 March 2011.
Lord Rothschild received a salary supplement of 20% of his basic salary, amounting to 80,313 in the year ended 31 March 2010 31 March 2009: 80,313.
This is included in the other benefits figure disclosed above.
The supplement is equivalent to the value of his pension contributions foregone since his election to opt out from the Companys pension scheme following advice received ahead of the pension tax reforms that came into force on 6 April 2006.
The salary supplement shall continue to be paid at the same proportion to salary in future.
For similar reasons, Mr Budge elected for the Group to cease making contributions on his behalf into the defined benefit section of the RITCP Pension and Life Assurance Scheme, with effect from 6 April 2006.
From that date Mr Budge has received a salary supplement equivalent to 42% of his basic salary, or 124,014 for the year ended 31 March 2010 31 March 2009: 124,014.
The Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, has adopted an Executive Bonus Plan.
The Plan provides that each executive Director, and or such other participants as may be determined by the Remuneration Committee, shall be entitled to an annual bonus.
The amount payable under the Executive Bonus Plan is calculated by reference to the Companys three-year moving average outperformance in terms of increase in the net asset value per share, with dividends reinvested over the three most relevant total return indices.
The indices are currently the FTSE All-Share Total Return Index, the Investment Trust Net Assets Total Return Index ITNATR and the MSCI Total Return World Index expressed in Sterling.
The percentage of salary payable as a bonus rises on a straight line basis from 0% to 100%, if the average annual outperformance is between 0% and 7%.
Thereafter, the percentage of salary payable as a bonus to Lord Rothschild and Mr Budge rises from 100% in a straight line to the maximum bonus payable under the Plan of 125%, if the average annual outperformance is between 7% and 10%.
For the year to 31 March 2009, Mr Breuer-Weil, as Investment Director, received an annual bonus of twice the amount produced by the same calculation, so that his maximum bonus under the plan was 250% of annual salary.
RIT CAPITAL PARTNERS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT 40 The bonuses payable under the Plan to Lord Rothschild, Mr Budge and Mr Breuer-Weil in the year ended 31 March 2010 amounted to 86,442 31 March 2009: 278,246, 63,826 31 March 2009: 204,593 and 169,892 31 March 2009: 221,014 respectively.
These include adjustments to the bonuses for the year ended 31 March 2009, reflecting the finalisation of the ITNATR Index for that year in June 2009.
For the year to 31 March 2010, the Board, on the recommendation of the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee, determined that a further bonus of 72,526 should be paid to Mr Breuer-Weil in addition to the bonus as calculated under the Plan for the year to 31 March 2010, to reflect his responsibilities and performance during the year and to bring his overall bonus payment in line with the basis on which the bonuses were payable to other investment staff to reward their hard work, dedication and success through an extremely difficult period in investment markets.
In addition Lord Rothschild, Mr Breuer-Weil and Mr Budge all received a 1,000 bonus which was paid to the Groups employees in December 2009 31 March 2009: 1,000.
Long-term Incentive Plan The adoption of a Share Appreciation Rights plan the SAR Plan was last approved by shareholders on 17 July 2008.
Under the SAR Plan, participants are entitled to elect to receive a cash bonus.
The amount of the bonus will represent the increase, since the date of grant, in the Companys share price multiplied by the notional number of shares.
For directors of the Company and certain other senior executives, this is, however, conditional on any increase in the share price, plus dividends paid, exceeding the increase in the Retail Price Index plus 3% per annum for the three year period between the date of grant and the third anniversary thereof.
The performance condition is applied subject to the review of the Remuneration Committee and the Board of directors.
The performance condition applying to the SARs granted to directors on 15 March 2007 was tested on 15 March 2010.
The result was within 0.2% of the performance condition target.
The Board, on the recommendation of the Remuneration & Conflicts Committee, approved the vesting of 90% of the SARs granted in 2007 subject to the performance condition, as is permitted under the SAR Scheme Rules.
The remaining 10% of the SARs granted in 2007 lapsed unexercised.
This split of vested and lapsed SARs is reflected in the tables below.
As at 31 March 2010 the amount accrued in respect of the SAR Plan participations of the Companys executive Directors was 1,189,818 31 March 2009: 1,867,133.
The lowest closing price of the Companys shares during the year was 828p and the highest was 1,111p.
The following grants of SARs were made to the Companys executive Directors during the year.
All grants were made on 26 March 2010: Notional no.

RIT CAPITAL PARTNERS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2010 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT 42 Performance Graph In accordance with The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, a performance graph which measures the Companys total shareholder return calculated by reference to the Companys share price, including dividend reinvestment against that of a broad equity market index is shown below.
For this purpose the Committee considers that the MSCI Total Return World Index in Sterling, the FTSE AllShare Total Return Index and the Investment Trust Net Assets Total Return Index are the most suitable indices for comparative purposes.
The graph below therefore compares the Companys total shareholder return to that of these three indices over the last 5 years.

The terms and conditions of the Directors service contracts are detailed below and are reviewed as required.
Lord Rothschild, Duncan Budge and Mikael Breuer-Weil each have service agreements with J. Rothschild Capital Management Limited.
Lord Rothschilds service agreement is dated 29 April 1996, but was initially with an associated company and originally dated 20 October 1993.
The agreement can be terminated, inter alia, by either party giving the other not less than twelve months written notice.
It provides for benefits in kind in line with normal company practice, including pension provision, private health insurance and a company car.
The agreement is currently on a rolling one year basis.
The agreement does not specify compensation payable in the event of early termination.
Duncan Budges service agreement is dated 29 August 1996, but was originally with an associated company and dated 6 August 1985.
The agreement can be terminated, inter alia, by either party giving the other not less than twelve months written notice and will automatically terminate on his 60th birthday.
It provides for benefits in kind in line with normal company practice, including pension provision, life assurance, permanent health insurance, private health insurance and a company car.
Mikael Breuer-Weils service agreement is dated 9 December 2008.
It can be terminated, inter alia, by either party giving not less than twelve months written notice.
It provides for benefits in kind in line with normal company practice including pension provision, life assurance, permanent health insurance, private health insurance and a company car.
The agreement does not specify compensation in the event of early termination.
When considering the size of any proposed termination payment, the Committee would take into account a number of factors including the health, length of service, age and the performance of the relevant executive, including the duty to mitigate his own loss, with a broad aim to avoid rewarding poor performance while dealing fairly with cases where the departure is due to other reasons, such as illness.
Executive Directors External Non-executive Directorships Mr Budge is a non-executive director of The World Trust Fund, a Luxembourg incorporated investment company whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
RITCPs interests have been represented by Mr Budge, who is entitled to fees of 25,000 per annum in respect of his non-executive directorship.
These fees are retained by Mr Budge.
No other fees are paid to the executive Directors in respect of external non-executive directorships.
Termination Payments and Payments to Third Parties No payments were made to a Director of the Company for termination of employment nor were any payments made to third parties for Directors services during the year.
