Executive Share Option Plan The Company operated an executive share option scheme between 2001 and 2008 to provide longer-term incentives for executives and executive Directors.
From 2009, executive Directors received share-based awards under the PSP rather than grants under the option plan.
The right to exercise an option is subject to the growth performance of the Companys Basic Earnings per Share BEPS over a three year period in comparison to that of comparator companies, who comprise of UK, US and Canadian oil and gas service companies.
No shares are exercisable if the growth in BEPS does not exceed the rate of inflation by at least 3% per annum over the three year period.
The number of shares exercisable, expressed as a percentage, by a Director can range from nil if the Companys performance is below the median level, to 40% at the median level and up to 100% if the Companys performance is between the median and the upper quartile levels of the comparator group.
No further grants will be made under this share option plan.
Directors Shareholding Requirements In order to align the interests of the executive Directors with that of shareholders, each executive Director is required to build up and maintain a holding in the Companys shares with a market value equivalent to not less than one times their annual salary.
