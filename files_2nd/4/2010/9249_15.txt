Directors' remuneration reportfor the year to 31 December 2010 The Directors remuneration report sets out the Companys policy on the remuneration of executive and non-executive directors together with details of the directors remuneration and service contracts.
The Remuneration Committee met six times during the year.
The Committees remit is to ensure that the remuneration policy continues to attract and retain executives of the appropriate calibre and experience needed to manage the international complexity of Lairds operations.
Remuneration Committee key actions: consulted with key shareholders on the EPS target, vesting threshold and quantum for options awarded in 2010. reviewed independent remuneration consultants and appointed Deloitte LLP.
requested Deloitte LLP to conduct a review of base remuneration for the three executive directors and selected other senior executives involving benchmarking against comparable companies, including for the US-based Managing Director, against US companies.
determined that, at the request of the executive directors, their base salaries would not be increased but would be considered in July 2011. concluded, following the review by Deloitte, that the basic structure of salary, annual bonus and longer term share incentives provided an appropriate remuneration structure but certain changes to performance targets for the longer term share incentives were desirable and that changes should be implemented for grants to be made in 2011, after consultation with key shareholders.
identified a revised list of companies including six US corporations to be used as the comparator group for the total shareholder return TSR performance condition to provide greater correlation than the FTSE 250 to apply to the longer term share incentive grants to be made in 2011. agreed to amend the performance conditions for the 2011 awards under the Share Option Plan and the Long Term Incentive Plan, to include both underlying earnings per share EPS as well as TSR measures for both schemes and consulted with key shareholders during February 2011 on theproposals.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee, is responsible for recommending to the Board the Companys general policy on remuneration and in particular determining the remuneration packages of the Chairman and the executive directors, and the grant of all options and awards of shares.
The Chairman does not attend discussions on his own remuneration.
The Board, as a whole, is responsible for setting the remuneration of the .
The members of the Remuneration Committee are appointed by the Board and the membership is reviewed at least annually.
The Chairman of the Committee is appointed by the Board and cannot be the Chairman of the Board.
MrAJReading is the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
The other Committee Members are the Chairman, MrN J Keen, and SirChristopher Hum, Professor M J Kelly, MrAMRobb and DrWRSpivey, all independent non-executive directors.
The Board considers it essential that the Chairman of the Board be involved in setting remuneration policy and therefore MrKeen is a member of the Remuneration Committee.
MissAMDownie, the Company Secretary, acts as Secretary to the Committee.
The Chief Executive is given notice of all meetings and, at the request of the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, attends the meetings.
The Chief Executive may request that he attends and speaks at Committee meetings.

The written Terms of Reference of the Remuneration Committee are available on the Companys website and from the Company on request.
They will also be on display at the Annual General Meeting.
As mentioned above, during the year, the Remuneration Committee undertook a review of its remuneration consultants and appointed Deloitte LLP.
During the year, both Towers Watson, the previous remuneration consultant, and Deloitte LLP provided independent external professional advice.
Towers Watson also provide pension actuarial services to LairdPLC and to the Trustees of the Laird Pension Scheme and DeloitteLLP provide internal audit services to Laird PLC.
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that no conflict of interest exists in the provision of these services.
The Remuneration Committee has also sought the views of the Chief Executive, MrPJHill, during the year.
52 Laird PLC Remuneration Policy The Remuneration Committee has established a policy on the remuneration of executive directors and the Board has established a policy for the non-executive directors.
The policy for the executive directors is to structure the remuneration package so that no single aspect dominates.
Therefore there is a mixture of fixed remuneration and performance-related remuneration, with the latter split between annual bonuses with a range of diff erent measures and longer-term share incentives, which use more than one performance target.
Further details are set out below.
The Remuneration Committee believes that having an incentive-driven remuneration package promotes the alignment of interests of executive directors and shareholders.
That policy is based upon the following principles: the need to link remuneration to achieving strategic objectives and to sustainable long-term corporate success having due regard to environmental, social and governance issues and the overall risk profile of Laird: the reward opportunity off ered to executive directors should be suff iciently competitive to recruit and retain management of the appropriate calibre and experience: the need to provide a total compensation package which reflects the international complexity of Lairds operations: and to be mindful of Company performance and overall shareholder returns, and the implications of this for .
The Remuneration Committees policy on the remuneration of executive directors is regularly reviewed taking into account market practice, the individuals performance, the performance of Laird and other pay structures within Laird.
Executive Directors Remuneration The executive directors receive base salary, annual performance incentive awards up to a maximum percentage of base salary, pensions and other benefits, and long term performance awards which are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee.
On a regular basis, the Committee requests its independent consultants to undertake a benchmarking exercise on base pay, the most recent benchmarking exercise, completed in December 2010, covered all aspects of the remuneration package for the executive directors and other senior executives.
The previous benchmarking exercise was carried out in July 2008.
Benefits comprise the provision of a car or car allowance, life, disability and health insurance, participation in the annual performance incentive award scheme and membership of a pension scheme.
Neither performance incentive awards nor benefits in kind are pensionable.
Performance linked incentives are a key component of the total remuneration package.
Since 2003, the Remuneration Committee has granted options and awards under the Companys executive share option plan and Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
A summary of these arrangements is set out below.
The Committee believes that a combination of share option plans and the LTIP for senior executives is the most appropriate way of providing the incentive to create substantial improvement in the Companys performance in a way that aligns the interests of executives and shareholders.

Laird PLC 53 Directors' remuneration report continued for the year to 31 December 2010 In view of the challenging economic climate, executive directors salaries, at their request, have not been increased since 1July 2008 Mr Hill: 1 July 2007.
The Remuneration Committee agreed that a freeze in base salaries was appropriate.
The Remuneration Committee annually reviews salaries, the individuals and the Companys performance and salary levels for other company executives and has taken the pay and conditions of other employees of Laird into account, including any base salary increases awarded.
There were no increases in base salary in 2010 for employees in Lairds Head Off ice and other UK employees received an average increase of 1.4%.
The increases in Laird Technologies in 2010 for management level employees ranged from zero to 10% depending on several factors, including region.
Greater increases were awarded to certain individuals as a result of promotions or significant increases in the scale or geographic scope of their responsibilities.
Service Agreements Each of the executive directors has a service agreement.
Messrs Hill and Silvers service agreements are dated 8March 2004.
MrRapps service agreement is dated 31December 2004.
In line with the Companys policy, the executive directors service agreements are not for a fixed term and provide for twelve months written notice of termination from either party.
MrRapps service agreement is with Laird Technologies, Inc. and he has a separate letter dated 7March 2008 from the Company in respect of his appointment as an executive director.
In 2006, the terms of employment for the executive directors in the UK were amended to change the contractual retirement date from age 60 to age 65 to comply with the Employment Equality Age Regulations 2006 which came into force in the UK on 1October 2006.
The executives may still retire at age60 with their retirement benefits unchanged from the previous arrangements.
The Companys policy on termination is to comply with the contractual terms and conditions set out in the service agreement.
The Company may, at its election, make a payment in lieu of notice.
The payment would be calculated as the total of the directors base salary plus the value of his benefits, in each case by reference to the period of the unexpired notice oftermination.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts.
They are appointed under letters of appointment which provide for a review after an initial three year term.
After the initial three year term, the appointment is reviewed and, in the past, the appointment would be renewed for a further three year term.
However, due to the change in the UK Corporate Governance Code, which will apply for future accounting periods, requiring annual re-election of directors, it has been decided that the term of appointment for a non-executive director will now be one year after an initial three year term.
Messrs Reading and Robb, whose terms came up for review in September 2010 have therefore been re-appointed for one year terms, subject to annual review thereafter.
The appointment of a non-executive director is subject to termination if he ceases to be qualified to act as a director of the Company: if he resigns by written notice: or he is not re-elected under the Companys Articles of Association.
Dates of appointment are shown on pages 36 and 37.
Shareholding Guidelines Shareholding guidelines, under which executive directors will be expected to retain, as shares, all of the after-tax profit on the gains made on the vesting of LTIP awards and the exercise of existing or future executive share options, until they have acquired a shareholding equal in value to their base salaries, were introduced in 2003.
At 31December 2010, Messrs Hill, Silver and Rapp had an interest in shares equivalent to a multiple of 0.86 2009, 0.62, 1.94 2009, 1.41 and 0.39 2009, 0.28 of their base salaries respectively.
Outside Appointments The Board believes that there can be significant benefits, to both the Company and the individual, from executive directors accepting non-executive directorships of companies outside the Group.
The Board takes into account the likely time commitment for such appointments prior to approving them.
The executive directors are entitled to retain the fees for such appointments.
During the year, Mr Hill was a non-executive director of Meggitt plc until 31 March 2010 and a non-executive director of Cookson Group plc from 1February2010.
He was entitled to retain the fees of 11,250 2009, 45,000 from Meggitt plc and 36,667 from Cookson Group plc.
Mr Silver was a non-executive director of INVESCO Income Growth Trust plc during the year and he was entitled to retain fees of 21,000 2009, 21,000.
Pensions Mr Rapp, who is based in the USA, is a member of an employee managed defined contribution programme to which Laird Technologies, Inc. makes a 50% match of the members contributions up to 6% of gross earnings, subject to a cap.
The amount paid in by Laird Technologies in 2010 for MrRapp was 5,276.
In addition, Mr Rapp receives a taxable cash payment of 30% of base salary in lieu of any other pension contribution.
54 Laird PLC MessrsHill and Silver are members of a UK Group contributory defined benefits scheme.
The main benefits are: on pension retirement at age sixty, a maximum pension of two thirds final salary excluding bonuses and other benefits dependent on service: on death in retirement, a dependants pension of 60% of the members pension: on death in service, a lump sum of four times salary and a dependants pension of 20% of salary or 60% of the members expected pension, if higher.
Pensions in payment for Messrs Hill and Silver will increase by the lesser of the increase in the retail price index or 8.5% per annum compound.
Transfer values provided on leaving service do not include any allowances for discretionary benefits.
Mr Hills benefits in the defined benefits scheme are subject to an earnings cap.
They are supplemented by an unfunded arrangement to maintain the same level of benefits as if the earnings cap did not apply.
Since 1 July 2008, MrHill has received a taxable salary supplement of 40% of base salary in lieu of future accrual of the unfunded arrangement.
Following the introduction of the A Day legislation in April 2006, Mr Silvers pension has ceased to accrue within the defined benefits scheme.
In light of the Companys previous pension commitment to Mr Silver, he now receives a taxable salary supplement of 40% of base salary in lieu of future pension accrual under the pension scheme.
These payments in respect of Messrs Hill and Silver are expected to reduce future pension risks for the Company.
Payments in lieu of pension provision are excluded from the calculation of any bonus entitlements and share scheme awards and are not included in the calculations below.

Annual Performance Incentive Awards The maximum award, for exceptional performance, that could be earned for 2010 was 100% of base salary for the UK executive directors and 125% for Mr Rapp.
Target awards were 75% of base salary for the UK executive directors and 100% of base salary for Mr Rapp.
The award criteria established for 2010 were based on targets of: underlying profit before tax approximately 45% of the maximum : working capital metrics approximately 10% of the maximum : the achievement of criteria designed to assess and drive performance against a number of key, measurable strategic objectives for the Company, including those relating to environmental, safety and social and corporate responsibility issues approximately 20% of the maximum : and an additional 25% of the maximum being available to be awarded for exceptional performance.
The specific criteria used are not disclosed for reasons of commercial sensitivity, but include, inter alia, expansion of the customer base, market share gains, turnarounds in the profitability of certain businesses, and aggressive cost reduction targets.
The profit target was based on a combination of budgets and market estimates for the year.
Actual awards determined by the Remuneration Committee as a percentage of base salary in respect of 2010 for Messrs Hill and Silver were 55% each and for MrRapp75% 2009, 10% each.
These took into account the underlying financial performance and the strategic development of Laird and the achievement of measurable strategic objectives and reflected the achievement of greater than 50% of the targets.
Laird PLC 55 Directors' remuneration report continued for the year to 31 December 2010 The Remuneration Committee took into account that underlying profit before tax in 2010 was 52% higher than in 2009, and that operating cash conversion, after capital expenditure, in 2010 was strong at 89% notwithstanding the significant growth in profits in the year.
No awards were made for exceptional performance.
Share Plans The share incentive schemes currently operated by the Company for the executive directors are the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and the Executive Share Option Plans, which the Remuneration Committee believes are the most appropriate way of providing the incentive to create substantial improvement in the Companys continuing long-term performance in a way that aligns the interests of executives and shareholders.
Each time awards are made under the LTIP and the Executive Share Option Plans, the Committee carefully considers the performance measures to be used, including whether to use non-financial Key Performance Indicators.
For the awards made in 2010 it was concluded that the Total Shareholder Return TSR and underlying Earnings Per Share EPS were the most appropriate measures for aligning the objectives of executives with those of shareholders.
As advised last year, the Share Price Improvement Plan SPIP introduced in 2008 was cancelled in 2010.
The LTIP and Share Option Plans may use either market purchased shares or newly issued shares, provided that any newly issued shares count towards the overall dilution limit of 10% of the ordinary share capital in issue from time to time for allocations in respect of newly issued shares over a ten year period under these plans and all other share schemes operated by the Company.
a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP involves the award of shares which only vest after the achievement of demanding performance targets measured over three years.
Executive directors are eligible for annual awards of shares.
The maximum annual award value under the LTIP is one times base salary.
In setting the level of awards the Remuneration Committee takes into account options granted to executive directors under the 2003 Executive Share Option Plans in the same financial year.
Awards under the LTIP in 2003 to 2010 inclusive took the form of nil cost options or conditional awards in order to comply with US tax legislation, to be satisfied by shares from the Laird 1990 Employee Benefit Trust the Trust purchased in the market.
Further details on the Trust are on page60.
In 2009 the Remuneration Committee carefully considered the level of awards in the light of the Companys business performance and the then current share price level and the awards made equated to 41.7% of salary for Mr Hill: 41.9% for Mr Silver and 45.3% for Mr Rapp, compared with 100% of salary in previous years.
The level of awards in 2010 was considered by the Committee and the awards made to each director equated to 95% of base salary.
In deciding this, the Committee took into account the level of awards under the Executive Share Option Plan described below.
These awards should promote the interests of executives and shareholders in the delivery of above market growth in shareholder value in future years.
The awards made on 19 April 2010 were calculated with reference to a share price of 123.4p being the higher of the closing mid-market price on 16 April and 19 April 2010.
They will, apart from Mr Rapps awards, be exercisable between 19 April 2013 and 19 April 2015, to the extent to which the performance criteria are met.
In accordance with US requirements, MrRapps award will vest automatically on 19April 2013 if the performance criteria have been met.
In accordance with the rules of the LTIP, outstanding awards may become exercisable before their normal vesting date in the event of a change of control of the Company.
The amount charged to the income statement during the year in respect of the LTIPs granted to the executive directors was 541,000 2009, 551,000.
The fair value for accounting purposes was calculated as 41.6% of the face value of the awards made in 2010.
The extent to which awards granted under the LTIP in 2010 vest will be determined by reference to the Companys total shareholder return relative to FTSE 250 companies excluding investment trusts and the following targets will apply: Total Shareholder Return Amount of Award Vesting Performance Level % Upper Quartile Full vestng Median to Upper Quartile Pro rata between 30% and full vesting Below Median Nil 56 Laird PLC These performance conditions will be measured only over a single three year period.
There is no provision for retesting.
In addition, no awards will vest unless the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the Companys underlying financialperformance.
The LTIP awards made in 2008 lapsed at the end of 2010 as the performance criteria for total shareholder return to 31December 2010 was not met.
The awards made in 2007 lapsed, at the end of 2009, also as a result of the performance criteria not beingmet.
The directors interests in the LTIP are as follows: Vested Awards Exercised in Lapsed in 1.1.
15 354,143 Mr Rapps conditional awards vest automatically, in order to comply with US tax legislation.
b Share Options The executive directors have outstanding options under the 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme and the 2003 Executive Share Option Plan No.
The 1994 scheme was replaced by new share option schemes approved by shareholders at the 2003 Annual General Meeting.
Since May 2001 the basis for calculation of the maximum grant of options to executive directors and other employees is the equivalent of shares with a market value at the time of grant of up to one times base salary in any one year and up to two times base salary in special circumstances, such as the recruitment or promotion to a key management position.
The 2003 Executive Share Option Plans There are two plans which were approved by shareholders in 2003.
One plan permits the grant of options approved by Her Majestys Revenue and Customs to be made to individuals who may be eligible for capital gains tax relief on the exercise of options: otherwise both plans are identical in all material respects.
When granting options, the Remuneration Committee takes into account both the level of awards made to executive directors under the LTIP and the prevailing share price.
Laird PLC 57 Directors' remuneration report continued for the year to 31 December 2010 For the options awarded in 2003 to 2008 inclusive the performance criteria was the increase in earnings per share measured against the rate of UK retail price inflation plus a specified percentage per annum over a fixed three year period, as shown in the table below.
Applicable Performance Target: Tier of Option Grant Average Annual growth in earnings per share in excess of inflation Options granted 2003 to 2007 Options granted in 2008 Up to 0.5 x salary UK RPI 3% per annum UK RPI 5% per annum 0.5 x salary 1 x salary and above UK RPI 3% to 5% per annum applied UK RPI 5% to 7.5% per annum pro rata to the multiple of salary applied pro rata to the multiple of salary The Remuneration Committee considered that a consistent and real rate of growth in earnings per share is an appropriate performance target as it is a good guide to the underlying financial performance of Laird PLC.
However, due to the uncertain economic circumstances aff ecting the Companys performance in 2009, the Committee considered the basis for the earnings per share EPS targets and, after consultation with major shareholders, set the following specific underlying EPS performance targets: Applicable Performance Target: Level of vesting in 2012 2011 Earnings per share EPS Threshold 50% vesting 18.7 pence Full vesting 21.3 pence With a pro-rata vesting on a straight line basis where underlying EPS is between 18.7 pence and 21.3 pence.
The EPS figures were adjusted, from those set at the time of the grant, for the 2009 Rights Issue.
Based on the reported underlying EPS for 2009, of 9.6pence, to achieve the 2011 threshold requires EPS growth between 2009 and 2011 of 39.6% per annum and, for full vesting, EPS growth of 49.0% per annum, between 2009 and 2011.
The Remuneration Committee believes these are stretching targets.
In 2010, the Remuneration Committee after considering the performance criteria and threshold at which options would vest, agreed the following performance condition: Applicable Performance Target: Level of vesting in 2013 2012 Earnings per share EPS Threshold 30% vesting 16.6 pence Full vesting 21.3 pence With a pro-rata vesting on a straight line basis where underlying EPS is between 16.6 pence and 21.3 pence.
Based on the reported underlying EPS for 2010, of 11.8pence, to achieve the 2012 threshold requires EPS growth between 2010 and 2012 of 19% per annum and, for full vesting, EPS growth of 35% per annum, between 2010 and 2012.
The performance conditions under the Plan are based on the Companys earnings per share growth adjusted to exclude items which do not reflect the Companys underlying financial performance.
Underlying EPS and underlying profit are defined on pages 10 and 11.
The performance conditions are measured at the end of a three year period.
There is no provision for retesting and to the extent that the performance conditions have not been met, the options will lapse.
The rules of the 2003 Plan permit the waiver of performance criteria in certain limited circumstances, such as a change of control, death or retirement.
In accordance with the rules of the Plan, outstanding options may become exercisable before their normal exercise date in the event of a change of control of the Company.
58 Laird PLC The maximum level of awards under the 2003 Plan is normally one times base salary, however, the Remuneration Committee considers the level of awards in the light of the Companys business performance and the then current share price level when it decides on the number of share options to be awarded.
In 2010 the awards equated to 50% of base salary as the Remuneration Committee considered that the potential for future growth was higher and that these awards, together with awards under the LTIP described above, should incentivise executive directors in the delivery of above market growth in shareholder value in future years.
The amount charged to the income statement in respect of the share options granted to the executive directors was 34,000 2009, 68,000.
The fair value for accounting purposes was calculated at 35 per cent of the face value of grants made in 2010.
The share options granted in 2007 did not meet the performance criteria and have therefore lapsed.
The directors interests in options under the 2003 Executive Share Option No.
1 Plan in respect of new shares to be issued are shown in the table below: Granted Lapsed 1.1.
1994 Share Option Scheme Under the 1994 scheme options were granted over new shares to be issued at the time of exercise and also over existing shares.
The exercise of options under the 1994 scheme is dependent upon the attainment of performance criteria set by the Remuneration Committee.
The scheme permitted the grant of both approved and unapproved options.
Options were granted at the closing middle market price on the last dealing day prior to grant and are exercisable after three years but not more than ten years from the date of grant.
In 2006 the Committee reviewed the performance conditions and agreed that the earnings per share target for the grants made in 2002 the last year in which options were granted under this Scheme had been met and that there had been a significant and sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company.
The directors interests under the 1994 Share Option Scheme are as follows: Lapsed in 1.1.

During the year the share price was in the range 98.8p to 173.4p.
The Laird 1990 Employee Benefit Trust the Trust The Trust purchases and holds shares in Laird PLC to meet the requirements of share option awards and grants under the LTIP.
The Trust, which is financed by a loan of 3.7m from the Company, currently holds 1,037,070 ordinary shares which relate to the LTIP.
Currently there are no outstanding share options, other than those granted under the LTIP, to be satisfied by the Trust.
Whilst shares are held within the Trust, the voting rights in respect of those shares are exercisable by the trustee, in accordance with its fiduciary duties.
60 Laird PLC Non-executive Directors The Board as a whole is responsible for setting the remuneration of the non-executive directors.
Non-Executive Directors Lairds policy is to establish and maintain a body of non-executive directors with a breadth of international skills and experience that is relevant to Lairds global businesses.
In this context, it is the Boards policy for the non-executive directors to be paid a level of fee that reflects market conditions and is suff icient to attract individuals with appropriate knowledge and experience.
