Governance Directors Remuneration Report This report has been prepared in accordance with the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Although it is not a requirement of Jersey Company law to have the Directors Remuneration Report approved by shareholders, the Board believes that as a Company whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange it is important in terms of its corporate governance for it to do so.
Accordingly a resolution to approve this Report will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
This report has been divided into separate sections for: 1 information which is unaudited: and 2 information on which the Companys auditors have reported as having been properly prepared.
Unaudited Information Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee is responsible to the Board for 1 formulating and recommending to the Board remuneration policy and strategy for the Executive Directors and 2 reviewing individual remuneration packages of the Executive Directors, including terms and conditions of employment and any changes.
The Committee also reviews the general remuneration framework for the senior management of the Group and approves the operation of any Group share-based incentive schemes, including any Long-Term Incentive Plans LTIPs.
The Committees terms of reference are available on the Group website.
The membership of the Committee during 2010 was as follows, each of whom served for the whole year: Dr Pamela Kirby Chair of Committee Dr Brendan ONeill John Davis The Company Chairman, Derek Mapp, usually attends the meetings by invitation but is not present when matters relating to his own remuneration are discussed.
The number of meetings of the Committee during 2010 and individual attendance by its members are shown on page 34.
None of the members who served on the Committee during the year had any personal financial interest other than as a shareholder of the Company or conflicts of interests arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board.
The principal activities carried out by the Committee during 2010 were: r determination of Non-Executive Chairmans and Executive Directors remuneration: r determination of the Executive Directors bonuses for 2009 and bonus targets for 2011: r determination of the terms on which the Executive Directors would relocate to Switzerland: r LTIP awards: determination of performance conditions, vesting of the 2007 grant to Peter Rigby and new awards for both Executive Directors and senior management: r consideration and approval of the Remuneration Report for the 2009 Annual Report: r monitoring of senior management remuneration: r review and appointment of new remuneration consultants: and r consideration of the Group Defined Benefit Pension Schemes.
In determining the Executive Directors remuneration, the Committee consulted the Chairman about its proposals: no Executive Director played a part in any decision about his or her own remuneration.
Hewitt New Bridge Street Hewitt and Towers Watson provided advice to the Committee during the year.
Following a review, Towers Watson was formally appointed as advisers to the Committee in November 2010.
As Dr Brendan ONeill is a member of the Board of Towers Watson Inc, the holding Company of Towers Watson, he did not take part in the process of selecting advisers.
A statement regarding the Companys remuneration consultants can be found at www.
Neither Hewitt nor Towers Watson provide any other material services to the Group.

pdf 40 21 03 2011 17:33 Remuneration Policy The remuneration of the Executive Directors is designed to provide for a competitive compensation package which refl ects the Groups performance against fi financial objectives and personal performance criteria.
Incentives reward above-average performance and are designed to attract, motivate and retain high-calibre executives.
The performance assessment of the Executive Directors and the determination of their annual remuneration packages are undertaken by the Committee.
There are fi five elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors: r basic annual salary: r benefi ts: r annual bonus: r share incentives: and r relocation, retirement and life assurance benefi ts.
The Companys policy is that a clear majority of the maximum potential remuneration of the Executive Directors should be performance-related.
As described further below, Executive Directors may earn an annual bonus and benefit from participation in a performance-based LTIP.
For 2010, all of the bonus payable to the Executive Directors was based on earnings per share EPS performance.
Their 2011 bonus has been set on the same basis.
Vesting of LTIP awards granted prior to 2009 have been conditional upon EPS growth and subject to a total shareholder return TSR underpin.
LTIP awards granted after 2008 are subject solely to TSR performance as described below.
The chart and table below show the ratios of performancerelated remuneration to base salary and benefi ts of the Executive Directors paid or awarded in respect of the 2010 fi financial year with the LTIP award valued on the basis of other vesting at 36.7% of face value.
These arrangements for bonus and LTIP awards refl ect the Committees view that the best long-term interests of shareholders are achieved though incentivising the Executive Directors through a dual focus on EPS and TSR growth.
The Committee is able to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues when setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
In its judgment the remuneration policies for both Executive Directors and senior management do not raise environmental, social or governance operational risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
Senior management remuneration is set on a similar basis to the Executive Directors except often with lower basic salary and substantially lower LTIP elements but more variable bonus profi t share provision.
The latter is usually tied directly to the annual profi t performance of a business unit.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside of the Company provided that the Chairman determines that it is appropriate.
During 2010 Peter Rigby served as Non-Executive Chairman of Electric Word plc, for which he received and retained fees of 12,000.

pdf 41 21 03 2011 17:33 Governance Directors Remuneration Report continued Relocation Benefits As a result of the Companys redomicile to Switzerland in 2009, the Executive Directors have been relocated so as to be based at the Companys principal offices in Zug, Switzerland.
The Committee determined that the Company would meet the cost of relocation, and to provide an ongoing relocation benefits allowance on the basis that the ongoing arrangements would be broadly cost-neutral to the Company, taking into account estimated savings that the Company would be able to realise as the result of the relocation.
The main benefit provided from the allowance relates to the provision of housing in Switzerland.
The costs of the provision of these benefits is contained in the benefits in kind allowances column of the table of Directors Emoluments on page 44 of this Report.
Reporting Currency As the Executive Directors are now required to reside in Switzerland they have entered into new service contracts under which they are paid in Swiss Francs CHF.
As a result, for clarity of reporting, all monetary benefits receivable by the Executive Directors are set out in this report in CHF.
However, the remuneration of the Directors in the financial statements is set out in pounds Sterling, the Companys reporting currency.
Basic Salary For the purpose of the relocation to Switzerland, the Committee converted the existing 2010 Sterling salaries into Swiss Francs at the rate of CHF1.7:1, being the average exchange rate between the pound and the Swiss Franc during 2009, rounded to the nearest whole decimal point for administrative simplicity, as shown in the table below.
The basic salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed by the Committee prior to the beginning of each year and upon a change of position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers pay practices in the Group as a whole and makes reference to objective external research which gives current information on remuneration practices in appropriate comparator companies.
A review of the salaries of the Executive Directors was undertaken at the end of 2010 with the assistance of Towers Watson.
It included an analysis of benchmark data from a comparator Group of FTSE 51-150 companies excluding those in financial services.
Following its review, the Committee concluded that it was appropriate to increase the annual basic salaries of the Executive Directors with effect from 1 January 2011 by 3%, as set out below.
Thereafter paid in Swiss Francs.
2 Paid in pounds from 1 January 2010 to 25 March 2010.
Other Benefits Each of the Executive Directors receives a general benefit allowance of CHF42,500 per annum 25,000 up to the dates set out in the notes to the table above together with private medical insurance cover and permanent health insurance cover.
Annual and Deferred Bonus The Committee continues to consider adjusted diluted EPS to be the most suitable financial measurement on which to base annual incentives and align the interests of the Executive Directors with those of the Companys shareholders as this measurement of performance can be directly influenced by the performance of the Executive Directors and is a key driver in generating returns to shareholders.
For 2010 the maximum annual bonus was 125% of basic salary dependent upon achievement of a sliding scale of challenging diluted adjusted EPS targets which were set at levels to encourage and reward the delivery of excellent levels of performance.
Any award of bonus above 100% may only take the form of a conditional award of shares in the Company which will vest only if the Executive Director remains in employment throughout the deferral period of three years, subject to good leaver provisions.
The number of shares awarded will be determined by reference to the market value of the shares at the date concurrent awards under the LTIP are made.
Shares utilised for this purpose will be acquired by market purchase: newly issued shares will not be used.
Applying the sliding scale formula, a bonus of 107.9% of basic salary was awarded to each of Peter Rigby and Adam Walker for the 2010 financial year, reflecting a year of good financial performance.
40 Informa plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2010 INF2570 AR10 cover AW05.
pdf 42 21 03 2011 17:33 For 2011, the annual bonus will again be determined based on a sliding scale of diluted adjusted EPS performance, with the maximum opportunity increased to 150% of basic salary for appropriately stretching levels of performance.
If achieved, any award in excess of 100% of base salary may only take the form of a conditional award of shares in the Company, which will vest only if the Executive Director remains in employment throughout the deferral period of three years, subject to good leaver provisions.
Long-Term Incentive Plan Since 2006 Executive Directors have been invited to participate in the Companys LTIP, which had been introduced and approved by shareholders in 2005.
Awards were made in April 2007 and April 2008 at the same level to Peter Rigby and also to Adam Walker in April 2008, his first year in office.
Awards were made to the Executive Directors in both 2009 and 2010 of 150% of basic salary and it is intended that the same size of award be made to the Executive Directors in 2011.
2007 Awards 40.2% of the 2007 award made to Peter Rigby vested on 17March 2010 based on performance during the performance period.
Adjusted diluted EPS grew by an average of 9.62% and the Companys TSR was 27.7% over the three-year performance period, which led to 40.2% of the award vesting.
Further details on the 2007 vesting can be found on page 46.
2008 Awards The EPS-related performance conditions attaching to the LTIP awards made in 2008 had not been met as at 31December2010 and accordingly the 2008 LTIP awards will lapse in March 2011.
2009 Awards For the LTIP awards made in 2009 and 2010, the following performance conditions apply.
It is also intended that these performance conditions shall apply to awards to be made for 2011: r one half of the shares under an award will vest based on the Companys TSR performance ranked against the TSR performance of the constituents of the FTSE 350 index excluding investment trusts.
This half of an award shall vest at 20% at median ranking and 100% at upper quintile ranking.
Any ranking below median results in none of the award vesting: r one half of the shares under an award will vest based on the Companys TSR performance ranked against the TSR performance of the constituents of the FTSE All Share Media Index.
This half of an award will vest 20% at median ranking and 100% at upper quintile ranking.
Any ranking below median results in none of the award vesting: and r irrespective of the extent to which the TSR performance conditions have been met for the vesting of an award, an award will not vest unless a general financial underpin is satisfied.
If the Board is not satisfied that the underlying financial performance of the Company is reflective on the TSR performance conditions result, it will have the ability to scale back vesting to zero if it considers it appropriate to do so.
Use of TSR as a primary performance measure is considered the best way to align the longer-term interests of management and shareholders, with the approach also being the most transparent way of ensuring that executives are incentivised to, and rewarded for, the delivery of above market returns to shareholders.
In addition, operating a general financial underpin also seeks to ensure that a keen focus is maintained on the underlying financial performance of the business.
The shares awarded to participants of the LTIP grants are satisfied through the Informa Group Employee Share Trust, currently administered by Nautilus Trust Company Limited in Jersey.
All-Employee Share Plans From January 2006 the Executive Directors, along with all other UK employees, were eligible to participate in the Companys pre-existing Share Incentive Plan the pre-existing SIP, introduced and approved by shareholders in 2005.
A new Share Incentive Plan new SIP was approved by shareholders for its adoption pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement becoming effective on 30 June 2009 and approved by HM Revenue and Customs HMRC on 6 July 2009.
The terms of the new SIP are the same in all material aspects.
Both SIPs are HMRC Approved All-Employee Share Incentive Plans which offer UK employees the opportunity to purchase up to 1,500 of shares in the Company per year out of pre-tax salary.
Eligible employees can join the SIP provided they have completed six months service with the Company.
Following the relocation of both the Executive Directors to Switzerland, as overseas employees and in accordance with the rules of the SIP, neither of the Executive Directors is able to continue to participate in the plan.
Consequently, both Executive Directors have ceased to contribute to the SIP and so have ceased to acquire shares through the plan.
Shares previously acquired under the SIP prior to the Executive Directors relocation remain in the SIP.
Peter Rigby holds a total of 1,820 shares and Adam Walker 669 shares in the SIP.

pdf 43 21 03 2011 17:33 Governance Directors Remuneration Report continued All-Employee Share Plans continued The Company introduced a US Stock Purchase Plan SPP in 2008 which was approved by shareholders at the AGM in May 2008.
Eligible employees are invited to join the SPP on an ongoing basis once they have completed six months service with the Company.
The SPP provides a means by which the Groups US employees may purchase the Companys shares at a 15% discount to the market price.
No tax benefi t is available under the SPP.
Eligible US employees can purchase up to $2,940 of shares per year out of post-tax salary.
Shares in Informa held in the SPP at the time of the Scheme of Arrangement becoming eff ective on 30 June 2009 were exchanged for shares in the Company: accordingly no new SPP was introduced at this date.
Share Options The Committee decided in 2005 no longer to grant share options to Executive Directors.
Details of subsisting share options granted to Peter Rigby in 2004 and earlier are shown on page 46.
Existing grants were amended for the Rights Issue on 27May 2009 and rolled over to the Company pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement becoming eff ective in June 2009.
Share Ownership Guidelines Formal share ownership guidelines require the Executive Directors to build up, over a three-year period, a holding in the Companys shares equal to at least one and a half times annual basic salary.
Both Executive Directors met this requirement as at 31 December 2010.
Retirement and Life Assurance Benefits The Executive Directors are entitled to receive a contribution of 25% of basic salary toward their retirement arrangements.
The Company also provides life assurance cover providing for the payment of a lump sum in the event of the insureds death in service.
Until 21 March 2010, as Peter Rigby was neither an active member of any Group pension scheme nor eligible to make further tax effi cient pension contributions, instead the Company paid to him a monthly payment in lieu of pension contributions equal to 25% of basic salary after deducting the incremental National Insurance costs to the Company.
Since that date, as in Switzerland 25% of salary pension contributions which may be paid free of deductions are limited to a salary of CHF820,000, the excess is also payable in cash after deducting incremental Swiss employer social security costs.
Further details of these entitlements are shown on page 47.
Performance Graph The graph below shows the Companys performance, measured by TSR, compared with the performance of the FTSE All Share Media Index, also measured by TSR, in the fi five-year period ended 31 December 2010.
The FTSE All Share Media Index has been selected for this comparison because the Company is a constituent Company of that index.

pdf 44 21 03 2011 17:33 Directors Contracts At 31 December 2010 and in accordance with the Companys policy, each of the Executive Directors had service contracts with an indefinite term under which 12 months notice must be given by the Company or by the Director.
In March 2010, as a result of the relocation arrangements described above, the Executive Directors entered into new service contracts with the Company.
These contracts are under Swiss law but other than changes required to reflect local law and custom in Switzerland, the terms and conditions are essentially the same as those contained in their previous service contracts which had been entered into under English law.
There are no specific terms in relation to the service contracts concerning termination following a change of control or any special rules concerning equity awards following termination: the Executive Directors are subject to the same rules and awards under share schemes following a termination of employment as for all other participants of the relevant schemes.
In the event of early termination except for cause, their contracts provide for compensation equal to basic salary, benefits allowance and retirement benefit and in the case of Peter Rigby only, bonus for the notice period.
The Companys policy in respect of protection from exposure to the risk of payment in the event of termination of an Executive Directors contract due to poor performance is to ensure that in the event of a new Executive Director being appointed that no bonus is payable under the service contract in the event of the Company making a payment in lieu of notice of termination.
This policy was followed in relation to the service contract of Adam Walker.
Each of the Non-Executive Directors has specific terms of appointment, terminable by three months notice.
The dates of the Directors original contracts are shown in the table below, although the contracts have been amended from time to time by letter agreement as required, including to reflect the Groups redomicile and the relocation to Switzerland of the Executive Directors and to reflect changes to salary or fee levels.
The contracts of the Non-Executive Directors were novated on 24 June 2009 so as to be with Informa plc as the new holding Company of the Group.
However, the terms of the contracts remain the same.
The contracts, which include details of remuneration, are available for inspection at the registered office and principal office, and will be available for inspection at the AGM.
