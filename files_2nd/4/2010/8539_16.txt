ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 44 Governance Report on remuneration This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 the Act and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008, the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and the Combined Code with due account also taken of the provisions of the Corporate Governance Code.
As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on certain parts of the Directors remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Accounting Regulations.
This report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information The Remuneration Committee The members of the Remuneration Committee the Committee are the Groups four Non-executive Directors, Malcolm Wall Chairman, Michael Hartley, Iain Paterson and Neil England.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for: r recommending to the Board the remuneration and terms and conditions of employment of the Chairman who absents himself from discussions regarding his own remuneration, Executive Directors and key members of senior management: r measuring subsequent performance as a prelude to determining the Executive Directors and key managers total remuneration on behalf of the whole Board: and r granting awards under the ITE Groups Performance Share Plans and options under the various ITE Group Share Option Schemes outlined below.
During the year, the Committee consulted with Hewitt New Bridge Street for advice on executive remuneration and the operation of the various ITE Group share schemes.
Hewitt New Bridge Street has provided no other services to the Company.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available on the Companys corporate website.
Remuneration policy The Companys principal remuneration policy aim is to ensure that compensation offered is appropriate to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and staff with the ability and experience to deliver the Companys strategy and grow the business, having regard to the prevailing economic conditions and competition for such people in the markets in which the Company operates.
In formulating its policies the Committee has regard to and balances the following factors: a the remuneration packages offered to executives in companies competing in the same markets as the Company: b the remuneration practice in the markets in which the executive is principally based: c the need to align the interests of the executive with those of the shareholders: d the performance of the individual executive and of the Company as a whole: and e any amounts payable to executives in respect of services performed for the associates of the Company.
The Committee Chairman liaises with the Groups independent remuneration adviser and others to ensure that pay and employment conditions in the Group as a whole are taken into account in determining salary levels, benefits, pension provision, bonus payments and long-term incentive opportunity when framing the executive remuneration policy.
In line with the Association of British Insurers Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee will ensure that the incentive structure for Executive Directors and senior management will not raise environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
More generally, the Committee will ensure that the overall remuneration policy does not encourage inappropriate operational risk-taking.
In addition, the Committee regularly reviews the executive remuneration policy to ensure that it takes due account of market practice, best practice and the specific circumstances of the Company.
The remuneration packages of the executives comprise base salary and benefits, a performance-related bonus and longer-term sharebased incentive arrangements.
A significant proportion of Executive Directors remuneration is, therefore, performance related.
Policy criteria for various components Base salary Base salary levels are reviewed annually by the Committee taking into account each Executive Directors role, experience, performance and the markets in which they perform their duties.
The base salaries for Russell Taylor and Neil Jones, and the consultancy remuneration for Edward Strachan are regularly reviewed and are subject to benchmarking exercises against industry and sector comparators.
During the year under review, Russell Taylors base salary was increased to 380,000 p. a. from 1 February 2010, Edward Strachans base salary and consultancy fees to Kyzyl Tan Consultants Limited was increased to 380,000 p. a. from 1 April 2010, and Neil Jones base salary was increased to 220,000 p. a. from 1 October 2010.
Russell Taylors remuneration had not been increased since his appointment as CEO in May 2008 and Edward Strachans remuneration had not been increased since 1 October 2008.
Neil Jones remuneration was last reviewed on 1 November 2009.
Operating performance Overview and Divisional summary Governance Financial statements ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 45 The Committee believes that the Companys strong performance, the importance of Messrs Taylor and Strachan to the Companys success, and mindful that these rates of increase are broadly reflective of the salary increase throughout the Company, makes these increases appropriate.
Mr Jones salary has been independently benchmarked by Hewitt New Bridge Street.
Details of the Executive Directors base salaries for the year commencing 1 October 2010 are also set out under Directors service contracts on page 46 of this report.
Variable bonus The Executive Directors and certain senior management participate in performance-related annual bonus schemes Executive Bonus Plan, which recognise Company objectives to deliver growth of headline profit before tax.
For the financial year commencing 1 October 2010, Russell Taylors and Neil Jones maximum annual bonus opportunity provided under the Executive Bonus Plan will be 100% and 80% of base salary respectively.
Neil Jones maximum annual bonus potential has been increased from 65% to 80% to align him more closely to a market competitive rate.
Edward Strachans annual bonus opportunity through the Companys consultancy agreement with Kyzyl Tan Consultants Limited Kyzyl Tan is on a similar basis to the Executive Bonus Plan, and for the financial year commencing 1 October 2010 is capped at 100% of the Kyzyl Tan consultancy fee and his remuneration as a Director.
The maximum bonus potential for Mr Taylor, Mr Strachan and Mr Jones is split between financial targets 80% of potential and personal targets 20% of potential.
For the financial year ending 30 September 2010, a bonus equating to 100% of the maximum bonus opportunity will be paid to the Executive Directors under the Executive Bonus Plan, reflecting a year in which financial targets for headline profit before tax were exceeded together with the delivery of a number of the Groups strategic objectives.
Long-term incentives In recent years the Company has operated Performance Share Plans and Share Option Schemes as its share-based arrangements.
Performance Share Plans The Company has operated the ITE Group plc Employees Performance Share Plan 2004 and the ITE Group plc Key Contractors Performance Share Plan 2004.
Awards can be made to executives and senior management over shares worth up to 100% of base salary each year, and under the latter scheme to key individuals who are not Group employees.
Awards were granted in February 2010 to Executive Directors up to 100% of salary subject to aggregate three year headline earnings per share targets.
Further information regarding these targets can be found on page 48.
This performance condition was chosen by the Committee to incentivise management to deliver sustained headline earnings per share performance over the relevant three year period.
The targets are based upon a compound rate of growth in headline diluted earnings per share calculated to take account of the Companys biennial business cycle.
The 30% award target is based upon a 5.5% compound increase in diluted earnings per share, and the 100% award target is based upon a 11.5% compound increase in diluted headline earnings per share.
The targets are calculated for each of the three performance years, taking account of any material events which are not annually recurring and aggregated into an Aggregated headline diluted earnings per share target.
In line with past practice, it is proposed that awards for the year commenced 1 October 2010 be made to Executive Directors in January 2011, and that these be subject to aggregate three year headline diluted earnings per share targets as follows: below 40p, 0% of the award will vest: at 40p, 30% of the award will vest, and at 45p, 100% of the award will vest.
Between 30% and 100% vesting will be calculated on a straight line basis.
Shareholding guidelines Executive Directors are required to retain shares of a value equal to 25% of the after-tax gain made on the vesting of awards under the Plans, until they have built up a shareholding of a value equivalent to at least 100% of annual base salary.
Further details of Directors interests in the ordinary shares of the Company are set out on page 37 of this report.
Share option plans The Company has operated the ITE Group plc 2009 Discretionary Share Option Scheme.
It is not intended that the Executive Directors will participate in the 2009 Discretionary Share Option Scheme.
Pensions The Company offers a stakeholder pension to its employees but currently makes no Company contribution under this scheme.
Since his appointment as Chief Executive Officer in May 2008, the Company makes a contribution equal to 10% of Russell Taylors base salary to his personal pension scheme.
Directors service contracts Executive Directors Russell Taylor Chief Executive and Neil Jones Finance Director have UK contracts of employment which reflect market and best practice for senior management serving in the UK and have no fixed term.
Notice periods and base salary details for all Directors are outlined in the tables set out below.
Other than the contribution to Russell Taylors pension scheme described above, there are no contributions to pension schemes.
The standard terms provide for medical insurance and life insurance but provide for no other benefits in kind such as Company cars.
ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 46 Governance Report on remuneration continued In the event of early termination of an Executive Directors contract, it is the Committees policy that subject to the provisions of each contract the amount of compensation if any paid to the Executive Director will be determined by reference to the relevant circumstances that prevail at the time.
The Committees objective will be to avoid rewarding poor performance.
Furthermore, the Committee will take account of the Executive Directors duty to mitigate their loss.
Edward Strachans remuneration as a Director from 1 October 2010 is 37,000.
In addition, Edward Strachan is remunerated as a consultant through the Companys agreement with Kyzyl Tan.
This contract with Kyzyl Tan is due to expire on 31 March 2011 when it will be renewed, subject to renegotiation.
The base consultancy fee under this agreement for the year commencing 1 October 2010 is 343,000.
Kyzyl Tan is entitled to a bonus based upon the same targets and criteria as the Executive Bonus Scheme, which is capped at 100% of Kyzyl Tans base consultancy fee and Edward Strachans remuneration as a Director.
Under the Kyzyl Tan contract, Edward Strachan is required to reside in the markets where his management responsibilities are based and Kyzyl Tan is entitled to an annual living away from home allowance of up to $60,000 for its employee.
Consistent with market practice, there are no service contracts or other employment arrangements with any of the Executive Directors with fixed terms or notice periods in excess of one year or terms which would expose the Company to compensation payments in excess of one years total remuneration.
The dates of each contract, the relevant notice period and base salary for 2010-2011 are as follows: Notice Base salary Review Name Date of contract period 2010-2011 dates Russell Taylor 25 March 2003 12 months 380,000 February Neil Jones 3 November 2008 12 months 220,000 October Edward Strachan 30 June 2003 6 months 37,000 October Edward Strachan through Kyzyl Tan Consultants Ltd 25 November 2010 6 months 343,000 April Non-executive Directors The Chairman and Non-executive Directors are entitled to one months written notice to terminate their Letters of Appointment but no further rights to compensation payments on termination.
The effective dates of their Letters of Appointment are as follows: Iain Paterson, 27 May 2002: Michael Hartley, 20 October 2003: Malcolm Wall, 4 May 2006: and Neil England, 18 March 2008.
The Non-executive Directors fees were subject to an independent benchmarking exercise against relevant comparators, taking account of their time commitment and responsibilities.
Accordingly, the fees for the year commencing 1 October 2010 for Michael Hartley will be 43,500, for Malcolm Wall 43,500 and for Neil England 38,500.
Iain Patersons fees will be 123,000.
Executive Directors may accept outside appointments with the prior approval of the Board and provided only that these appointments do not prejudice the individuals ability to fulfill their duties at the Company.
Whether any related fees are retained by the individual or remitted to the Company will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 48 Governance Report on remuneration continued For the 2004 Employees and Key Contractors Performance Share Plans, the performance conditions to be met for the awards are as follows: Aggregated headline diluted Aggregated headline diluted Market price earnings per share for earnings per share to be Percentage of on date of Date of grant of awards three financial years ending equal to or have exceeded Targets awards that vest grant 11 January 2008 30 September 2010 29.8p Below 29.8p Nil 148p Following completion of 29.8p 30% the financial year ended Between 29.8p and Between 30% and 30 September 2010, this 33.4p 100% calculated on a condition has been met straight line basis in full.

1 For the Long-term PSP awards granted in June August 2009 that are exercisable from 31 December 2013 to 30 December 2019, there are two performance targets applying.
Half of the Award is subject to a Performance Target based on the Groups absolute earnings per share during the 2012 13 Financial Year as follows: EPS for the 2012 2013 Financial Year Percentage of one half of award that vests Below 14p Nil 14p 25% Between 14p and 17p Between 25% and 100% calculated on a straight line basis.
17p or more 100% The other half of the Award is subject to a Performance Target comparing the Companys Total Shareholder Return against the FTSE All-Share Media Sector between 1 June 2009 and 31 December 2013.
25% of this portion of the award vests if ITE is at the median, with full vesting for upper quartile performance.
Between median and upper quartile, an award vests on a straight line basis between 25% and 100% based on rankings plus interpolation between intermediate rankings.
The cost of all share awards charged to the profit and loss account for the year ended 30 September 2010 was 1.4 million 2009: 1.1 million.
The ITE share incentive plans operate within a standard 10% in ten year dilution limit.
This provision takes account of all potentially dilutive awards made by the Company under any of its share incentive plans.
This is because as with other London Stock Exchange companies the Company does not operate any form of share incentive on an all employee basis and therefore does not have an internal dilution limit of 5% in ten years for discretionary schemes.
The Committee continues to be of the view that this approach, which has been previously agreed with shareholders, remains appropriate and that, therefore, it would be inappropriate to introduce a dilution limit that relates to awards under discretionary executive schemes only.
However, the Committee will keep the dilutive impact of the share incentive schemes under regular view to ensure that the interests of shareholders are taken into account.
The maximum number of additional i. e. in addition to the existing 13,678,649 in issue new share issues possible under the ten year dilution limits in the option trust deeds is 11,153,321.
Additionally the Employees Share Trust ESOT can hold up to 5% of the Companys issued share capital against share awards.
