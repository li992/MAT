Premier Oil plc 2010 Annual Report and Financial Statements 40 Remuneration Report This report explains our remuneration policy for executive directors and senior executives and sets out payments made to executive directors in relation to the year under review.
The company rewards its executives in a variety of ways which are intended to ensure that remuneration is competitive and aligned with shareholders interests.
To this end, in addition to base salary and benefits there is an annual bonus paid on the achievement of annually set targets and share awards designed to reward long-term performance.
Under both the annual bonus and Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP a portion of any award is deferred and under the LTIP is dependent on further significant performance.
Details of the various schemes, which cover awards granted in previous years as well as the policy for those for 2011 are detailed in this report.
As the chart below shows, 100 invested in Premier Oil shares on 1 January 2006 would now be worth 293.10, a growth of 193.1 per cent.
This compares with growth of the FTSE All Share Oil & Gas Producers Index of 34.6 per cent over the same period and growth in the price of oil of 87.2 per cent.
The management team has demonstrated an ability to create substantial value for shareholders.
As a result, we are satisfied that they should be rewarded well for delivering this performance in 2010.

The Remuneration Committees key challenge in relation to future policy is to balance the incentivisation of the management team to create further shareholder value against the need to ensure that this does not put at risk the value created to date and the overall stability and sustainability of the business.
In this regard we believe we have balanced the remuneration policy appropriately, recognising the following factors: base salaries for executive directors are now broadly in line with our desired positioning of paying at around the median of our peer group, following adjustments this year and possibly a further adjustment to the Chief Executives salary next year: our annual bonus plan is based on a balanced scorecard of operational metrics.
The achievement of these metrics is carefully assessed each year by the Remuneration Committee, the result being that maximum bonuses have not been paid in the last five years.
Significant bonuses will continue to be subject to an element of share-based deferral: the most significant potential remuneration for all employees comes through the LTIP.
Under this share-based plan, performance is assessed over three years six years if the matching scheme is included, requiring both strong share price growth and relative stock market out-performance over the period.
To ensure that any potential for reward for failure is minimised and to optimise the link between reward and performance, this plan has certain safeguards.
In particular, the amount that executives may receive is subject to various caps and discretion to scale back awards based on broader factors beyond the precise performance targets set: and for 2011 we are further improving the risk profile of the package by adding a provision for clawback of incentive payments in certain situations and adding minimum shareholding guidelines for senior executives.
