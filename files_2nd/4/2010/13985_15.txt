This requires the Companys comparative performance to be at least the median compared to the Comparator Group at the end of the initial three year period from the granting of the LTIP reward.

Further provisions apply with relation to companies exiting the index or being divested to ensure consistency of approach and provide an objective measure.
Providing the total shareholder return performance condition as required above has been achieved, the LTIP shares will be released by the Committee dependent on the Company achieving an absolute level of earnings growth at the end of the three year performance period as measured by the following: 100% of the LTIP shares will be released providing the annual growth of EPS over the three year performance period exceeds 25% on average 25% of the LTIP shares will be released providing the annual growth of EPS over the three years performance period exceeds 10% on average There will be straight line vesting of the LTIP shares on EPS growth between these two points During 2010  independently reported that the performance criteria outlined above were exceeded, resulting in the maturing LTIP shares achieving full vesting.
