Due to local tax laws in Canada, shareholdings for Chris Weston include 54,898 notional deferred shares allocated for 2010 under the DMSS.
These shares will remain notional until the end of the three-year deferral period.
iii Matching shares held in the DMSS and shares held under the LTIS are provided separately in the table above and in more detail in their respective tables on pages 60 and 61.
From 2010, matching shares awarded under the DMSS and shares awarded under the LTIS have been structured as nil-cost options for all UK resident participants.
From 1 January 2010 to 24 February 2011, none of the Directors had any interests in the securities of the Companys subsidiary or associated undertakings.
Changes since 1 January 2011 During the period from 1 January to 24 February 2011, the only changes to the Directors interests in shares were in respect of shares acquired through the Share Incentive Plan: 113 shares in respect of Phil Bentley, Mark Hanafin, Nick Luff and Chris Weston and 114 shares in respect of Sam Laidlaw.

For the calculation of the matching shares, investment shares are grossed up to reflect the impact of income tax and employees National Insurance contributions NICs so that the deferred and investment shares are matched on the same basis.
The number of matching shares that will be released following the satisfaction of the performance condition will be increased to reflect the dividends that would have been paid during the three-year performance period, as if they had been paid on the normal dividend payment dates.
Dividends are paid on the deferred and investment shares to the participants on the normal dividend payment date.
iii DMSS conditional matching shares granted in April 2007 were subject to cumulative EP growth.
As at 31 December 2009, the Companys cumulative EP growth over the three-year performance period was 44% and as a result the conditional matching shares vested in full on a two for one basis.
Additional shares 26,933 for Phil Bentley, 40,376 for Sam Laidlaw, 25,176 for Nick Luff and 9,307 for Chris Weston were released to reflect the value of dividends that would have been paid on the matching shares during the three-year performance period.
On release, the deferred and matching shares were subject to income tax at the individuals marginal rate and employees NICs at the rate of 1%, based on the market value of the shares on 6 April 2010 296.89 pence being the lower of the two dealing days immediately prior to and after the date of vesting which was not a dealing day.
The income tax and NICs liability was satisfied by the sale of sufficient shares and accordingly, the Executive Directors only received the net number of shares following the sale along with the transfer of their investment shares, which to the extent retained, is reflected in the shareholdings as at 31 December 2010 on page 59. iv In 2008 the operation of DMSS was delayed due to the Executive Directors and other senior executives being subject to prolonged dealing restrictions under the Companys Share Dealing Code.
20% of the AIS paid in April 2008 was deferred automatically.
The investment in deferred and investment shares and the conditional award of matching shares were made on 13 October 2008, once the Company had ceased to be in a prohibited period.
v In 2009 40% of the AIS paid to Sam Laidlaw, and 30% for the other Executive Directors, was deferred automatically.
The investment in deferred shares and the conditional award of matching shares were made on 3 April 2009.
The voluntary element of the DMSS was delayed due to the Executive Directors and other senior executives being subject to dealing restrictions under the Companys Share Dealing Code.
The purchase of investment shares and the conditional award of matching shares were made on 26 May 2009, once the Company had ceased to be in a prohibited period.
vi In 2010 the award of matching shares were structured as nil-cost options for all UK resident participants.
In respect of Chris Weston, who is based in Toronto, no deferred shares were acquired.
Due to local tax laws, these must only be held as a notional entitlement.
In this respect, 54,898 shares are included above.

As at 31 December 2009, the Companys EPS growth had exceeded RPI by 39% and as a result 99.1% of the EPS shares allocated vested for the Executive Directors in post at the time of allocation Phil Bentley, Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff as a more stretching EPS target was set in respect of one nd quarter of the EPS shares.
For Chris Weston, 100% of EPS shares vested.
At the end of the performance period to 3 April 2010, the Company ranked 52 against the FTSE 100 comparator group as constituted at the start of the performance period and as a result zero TSR shares vested.
Consequently, overall 49.5% and 50% respectively of the original allocations were released on 4 April 2010. ii Additional shares were released to reflect the value of the dividends that would have been paid over the respective three-year period.
The total shares released were subject to income tax at the individuals marginal rate and employees National Insurance contributions NICs at the rate of 1%, based on the market value of the shares at the date of vesting.
The income tax and NICs liability was satisfied by the sale of sufficient shares and, accordingly, the Executive Directors only received the net number of shares following the sale, which, to the extent retained, is reflected in the shareholdings as at 31 December 2010 on page 59. iii 188,260 shares made in two equal tranches were awarded to Mark Hanafin under SLTIS as part of the terms of his appointment in 2008.
In accordance with the rules of the SLTIS there were no performance conditions attaching to the award other than continued employment with the Company.
The second tranche of 94,130 shares were released on 1 March 2010 and were subject to the same income tax, NICs and dividend treatment as set out in note ii above.
iv At the end of each performance period the Companys EPS and TSR performance will be assessed.
If, and to the extent that the performance conditions are met, the relevant number of shares will be released to the Executive Directors, at the Trustees discretion, as soon as practicable thereafter.
v In respect of LTIS awards made in 2010, these were structured as nil-cost options for all UK resident participants.

Mark Hanafin, Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff, who all joined the Company in recent years, are not members of any of Centricas pension schemes.
Centrica Pension Plan CPP The CPP is a funded, HMRC-registered, final salary, contributory occupational pension scheme.
Its rules have the following main features: normal retirement at age 62: right to an immediate, unreduced pension on leaving service after age 60 at own request with employer consent, or on leaving service at the Companys request after age 55: life assurance cover of four times pensionable earnings for death in service: spouses pension on death in service payable at the rate of 50% of the members prospective pension and, on death after retirement, half of the accrued pension.
Childrens pensions on death are also payable at 25% of the members prospective pension at normal retirement age: members contributions payable at the rate of 6% of pensionable earnings.
Contributions made by the Executive Directors who are also members of the Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme CUPS are payable at the rate of 6% of their total pensionable earnings above the scheme earnings cap: pension payable in the event of retirement due to ill health: pensions in payment and in deferment guaranteed to increase in line with the increase in the RPI a maximum of 6% applies to pension accrued after 6 April 2004 : and no discretionary practices are taken into account in calculating transfer values.
Centrica Unfunded Pension Scheme CUPS All registered scheme benefits are subject to HMRC guidelines.
As a result of the changes introduced by Centrica following the 2004 Finance Act, benefits at 6 April 2006 from the registered scheme, the CPP, could not exceed the Lifetime Allowance 1.8 million for the 2010 11 tax year after taking account of retained benefits from all other sources notified to Centrica at this time.
The CUPS provides any additional benefits in excess of the maximum amount that could be provided through the CPP on the members uncapped pensionable earnings.
The benefits that arise under CUPS are treated as being subject to the same rules that apply in respect of the registered portion of members benefits.
No individuals will receive benefits from Centrica which, when added to their retained benefits elsewhere at 6 April 2006, exceed two-thirds of their final pensionable earnings.
CUPS is unfunded but the benefits are secured by a charge over certain Centrica assets.
An appropriate provision in respect of the accrued value of these benefits has been made in the Companys Balance Sheet.
Pension benefits earned by Directors in the CPP and CUPS Accrued Accrued Transfer Transfer Transfer value of pension as at pension as at Increase in value as at value as at Difference in increase in accrued 31 December 31 December accrued pension 31 December 31 December Contributions transfer value pension excluding 2010 2009 less inflation 2010 2009 paid in 2010 less contributions inflation Phil Bentley 191,500 168,800 14,935 3,124,600 2,246,800 37,800 840,000 199,200 Chris Weston 102,500 87,300 11,184 1,352,500 876,600 30,450 445,450 116,700 Notes on information shown in the table i The accrued pension is that which would be paid annually on retirement at age 62, based on eligible service to, and pensionable earnings at, 31 December 2010.
The pension accrual rates for 2010 for Phil Bentley and Chris Weston were 2.65% and 2.22% of final pensionable earnings respectively.
ii The increase in accrued pension has been adjusted to exclude inflation by revaluing the accrued pension as at 31 December 2009 by the rate of inflation 4.6% and deducting this from the accrued pension as at 31 December 2010.
The rate of inflation used was 4.6%, the annual rate to 30 September 2010, the date used for pension increases under both the CPP and CUPS.
iii The change in the transfer value calculation basis was also introduced in August 2010.
Had the transfer value been calculated on the accrued pension at 31 December 2010 but using the calculation basis in force at 31 December 2009, the transfer value of the accrued pension would have amounted to 2,709,700 for Phil Bentley and 1,118,600 for Chris Weston.
The difference in the transfer value less contributions would have amounted to 425,100 for Phil Bentley and 211,550 for Chris Weston.
