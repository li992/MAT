Annual Report and Accounts 2010 | RSA | 55 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Membership of the Committee and attendees Members of the Committee have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the Committees decisions and they have no conflict of interest arising from cross Directorships.
Fees for serving as a Committee member and chairing Committees of the Board are described in the Non-Executive Directors section of this Report on pages 63 to 64.
The members and attendees of the Committee throughout the year, are summarised in the tables below.

Malcolm Le May was also a member of the Board Risk Committee during the year.
As a result, decision making on remuneration matters is consistent with the Groups risk profile, with risk being properly taken into account.
Advisers to the Committee In developing remuneration strategy during the year, the Committee obtained its principal advice from Towers Watson, who were appointed by the Committee.
In addition to providing independent advice to the Committee, Towers Watson provides broad reward and pensions advice to the Company.
Remuneration policy principles The Committees remuneration policy is consistent with the high performance culture across the Group.
The key principles which underpin the remuneration policy are that: Total remuneration is set at a level which enables the recruitment, retention and motivation of high quality executive talent There is a strong and visible link between remuneration and performance Executive remuneration and shareholder interests are strongly aligned.
This is reflected in the design of the LTIP which provides a co-investment opportunity The observation of existing share ownership guidelines further enhances the alignment of Executive Directors with those of shareholders interests Incentive arrangements are leveraged so that only exceptional performance attracts the highest levels of award A balance of short and long term performance is used, incorporating measures of financial performance, profitable growth, delivery of shareholder value and a robust assessment of personal contribution Remuneration policy and practice is transparent to shareholders Where relevant, there is consideration of environmental, governance and social risks when determining remuneration for Executive Directors and senior managers to ensure that positive and appropriate behaviours are reinforced.
The policies relating to each element of remuneration are set out in the remuneration policy summary table on page 57.
56 | RSA | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Remuneration policy summary Element of remuneration Policy Base salary Base salary is set with reference to equivalent roles in similar companies and the sustained performance of the executive.
Annual performance bonus Bonus payments are related to stretching performance targets and are capped at 180% of base salary.
For maximum bonuses to be achieved outstanding performance must be demonstrated.
Share based long term incentive To provide annual share awards to executives to ensure alignment with shareholder interests awards solely through the LTIP.
Other than in exceptional circumstances, no other discretionary share plan will be used to make awards.
Pension provision and other benefits Reasonable provision in line with arrangements made in similar companies will be made to allow executives to plan effectively for their eventual retirement.
Elements of remuneration Remuneration for Executive Directors in 2011 will consist of the four principal elements described in the table above, of which only base salary is pensionable: Remuneration Purpose Delivery Detail Base salary To reflect the market value Cash Reviewed annually, changes of the role and the skills, Monthly effective from 1 April experience and performance Pensionable.

Annual Report and Accounts 2010 | RSA | 57 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Base salary Base salaries for Executive Directors and members of the Executive Team are set on appointment with reference to market data.
To enable the Group to compete for the most talented executives, the Committee relates base salary levels to the median level for equivalent roles in similar companies facing similar levels of complexity and challenge in the UK and internationally.
In the UK, the comparator group most frequently used is a selected group of financial services companies within the FTSE 100.
The Committee also has regard to levels of base pay within European and international companies.
The Committee is alert to market concerns surrounding base pay increases and closely monitors basic pay and total remuneration for Executive Directors in light of both the market and individual and corporate performance.
The Committee also has regard to the levels of pay increases available for all employees as well as other elements of pay including short and long term variable remuneration.
The Committee is confident that the structures and processes in place for reviewing annual salary increases are robust.
2010 Pay review The review of base salaries for Executive Directors in 2010 indicated that there had been little, if any, movement in the level of base salaries paid to Executive Directors.
The Executive Directors requested that the Remuneration Committee did not consider increasing base salaries in 2010, and the Committee approved that request.
The current base salaries paid to each Executive Director are: Position Base salary Andy Haste Group CEO 955,500 George Culmer CFO 556,500 Simon Lee Chief Executive, International 428,400 The following table sets out the base salaries of UK based executives below Board level on a banded basis as at 31 December 2010.
No such executive received a base salary in excess of 415,000.
Base salary range Number of employees 250,001 and over 13 200,001 250,000 18 150,001 200,000 42 Annual performance bonus The Executive Directors and the Executive Team participate in an annual bonus plan.
If the stretching targets required to achieve on target level are achieved, Executive Directors receive a cash bonus of up to 60% of base salary and Deferred Shares as defined on page 60 worth up to 30% of base salary.
For outstanding performance, a cash bonus of up to 120% of base salary and Deferred Shares worth up to 60% of base salary are achievable.
The targets used for determining the amount of bonus payable are a combination of stretching business performance targets and the results of a structured assessment of each executives performance against detailed and specific personal objectives.
Financial targets in 2010 were measured against combined operating ratio COR and net written premium NWP targets which are the preferred measures for the Group.
COR is a key indicator which captures the underlying strength and performance of an insurance business.
COR targets account for three quarters of the financial targets.
NWP is an indicator of growth and accounts for one quarter of the financial targets.
To achieve focused incentivisation financial targets for each Executive Director are weighted towards the area of the business for which they have primary responsibility.
The financial targets that applied to the annual performance bonus in 2010 for Andy Haste and George Culmer were a combination of targets relating to the overall Group COR and NWP results and the COR results of the regional operating businesses.
The financial targets for Simon Lees annual performance bonus are weighted towards the International business while also retaining a target for the Group COR result as a whole.
58 | RSA | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Personal targets are reviewed and approved by the Committee early in the financial year.
The Group CEOs performance is assessed annually by the Chairman of the Board and members of the Committee.
The Group CEO carries out a similar assessment for each of his direct reports, subject to review and approval by the Committee in the case of Executive Directors.
Assessments also take account of appropriate leadership style and each executive receives a performance rating against the standard scale used at all levels in the business.
Bonuses paid to Executive Directors in respect of the performance year 2010 are included in the table of Directors emoluments on page 65.
The Committee is satisfied that the bonus payments made in respect of 2010 are appropriate given the COR and NWP results across the Group throughout 2010, and the contribution made by each Executive Director.
UK based executives who are members of the top 100 executives in the Group Top 100 participate in a bonus plan which is structured in the same way and measured using the same metrics as the plan described above.
For outstanding performance a cash bonus of up to 80% of base salary and Deferred Shares worth up to 33% of the cash bonus are achievable.
Executives are also offered the opportunity to voluntarily invest up to 33% of the cash element of their bonus into Deferred Shares.
In 2010 under the LTIP an award of Matching Shares as defined on page 60 was made on a pro rata basis to the Deferred Shares.
Matching Shares may vest subject to the performance conditions described on pages 60 and 61 of this Report.
The Committee reserves the right to reduce the permissible investment below this level.
However, the LTIP will continue to operate on the same terms in 2011.
Andy Haste George Culmer LTIP 59% LTIP 59% Salary 22% Salary 22% Bonus 19% Bonus 19% Simon Lee LTIP 63% Salary 19% Bonus 18% For the purposes of the charts above, the bonus value is based on the cash bonus plus the fair value of the compulsory Deferred Shares.
The LTIP value is based on the fair value of awards of Performance Shares as defined on page 60 and half of the maximum potential number of Matching Shares that may vest subject to performance relating to voluntary and compulsory Deferred Shares under the LTIP.
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 | RSA | 59 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Share based long term incentive awards Prior to the approval of the LTIP, two long term share incentive plans were in place: The 2004 Share Matching Plan, which was designed to operate for two years.
The final awards under this plan were made in 2005 The Executive Share Option Scheme 1999 ESOS.
Regular awards under the 1999 ESOS were discontinued from 2006 and the scheme expired in 2009.
A renewed Executive Share Option Scheme new ESOS was adopted by the Company and approved by shareholders at the 2009 AGM.
As with the 1999 ESOS, it is intended that the new plan will initially be used only in exceptional circumstances, such as executive recruitment.
Performance conditions will attach to all options granted under the new ESOS and will be determined by the Committee at the appropriate time.
To date no grants have been made under the new ESOS.
LTIP The primary long term incentive is the LTIP, the key features of which and associated policies are summarised in the sections below.
Awards under the LTIP will be funded through a combination of new issues and shares purchased in the market.
Conditional awards of Performance Shares Participants may receive a conditional award of shares with the grant level and performance condition determined by the Committee prior to each grant Performance Shares.
Executive Directors, members of the Executive Team and the Top 100 will be eligible for awards of Performance Shares.
In 2011, awards of Performance Shares to Executive Directors and the Executive Team will be limited to a maximum face value of 150% of base salary, other than in exceptional circumstances.
Account will be taken of personal performance in determining the scale of the award to each Executive Director and members of the Executive Team.
For executives below this level, awards are made based on a formula which relates the size of award to performance and potential, as measured through the annual performance appraisal process.
In any year, the face value of Performance Shares granted to any individual will be limited to 150% of base salary in normal circumstances subject to an overriding cap of 250% of base salary in exceptional circumstances such as an executive recruitment.
Performance Shares will vest after three years subject to performance conditions see below and provided the individual remains in employment with the Group other than in exceptional circumstances such as death or retirement at normal retirement age.
Deferred Shares As described in the annual performance bonus section on page 58 Executive Directors, members of the Executive Team and the Top 100 may be granted deferred share awards as part of the annual bonus compulsory Deferred Shares.
These Deferred Shares may not be withdrawn and will normally vest three years from the date of grant subject to continued employment with the Group.
In addition executives may invest an additional portion of bonus in Deferred Shares on a voluntary basis voluntary Deferred Shares.
Voluntary Deferred Shares are not at risk of forfeiture and may be withdrawn at any time but the right to Matching Shares would lapse on those Deferred Shares withdrawn.
Conditional awards of Matching Shares Executives may receive a conditional award of matching shares pro rata to the number of Deferred Shares held Matching Shares.
At threshold performance the matching ratio will be 0.625:1.
The maximum matching ratio for Matching Shares: Deferred Shares will be 2.5:1, calculated on the gross value of the bonus invested in Deferred Shares.
Details of the performance condition used are set out below.
Executive Directors, members of the Executive Team and the Top 100 will be eligible for awards of Matching Shares.
Matching Shares will vest after three years subject to performance conditions see below and provided the individual remains in employment with the Group other than in exceptional circumstances such as death or retirement at normal retirement age.
Performance conditions The Committee will determine the performance condition for each grant of Performance Shares and Matching Shares, with performance measured over a single period of three years with no provision to retest.
In 2011 grants of Performance Shares and Matching Shares related to compulsory Deferred Shares will be subject to a performance condition consisting of a combination of ROE and TSR targets.
ROE has been selected as the measure of financial performance as it is one of the key measures of overall business performance and is visible externally to shareholders.
60 | RSA | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The TSR performance condition has been designed to provide alignment between executive remuneration and shareholder interests and to ensure that an element of the package is linked directly to share price performance.
The comparator group has been selected to ensure that performance is compared fairly against a group of similar companies operating in a similar competitive environment.
The use of ROE and TSR in combination provides a balanced approach to the measurement of Company performance over the longer term.
As in 2010 ROE will be given greater prominence than relative TSR, to underline our commitment to improving the returns that we generate on our balance sheet.
The vesting of 70% of the LTIP awards will be based on reported ROE performance and 30% on relative TSR performance with the exception of Matching Shares attaching to voluntary Deferred Shares, the vesting of which will remain dependent solely on the ROE performance condition.
70% of the shares comprising the award will vest according to ROE performance.
For awards made in 2010, the ROE target range was 10% to 16%.
The range of ROE performance targets has varied from year to year, and for performance periods yet to conclude is summarised below: Year of grant Range start Range end 2008 12% 18% 2009 10% 16% 2010 10% 16% Range to be applied in 2011 10% 16% For awards made in 2010, the ROE performance scale is: Underlying average annual ROE Proportion of this part of the award vesting Below 10% 0% 10% 25% 16% 100% Between 10% and 16% Between 25% and 100% pro rata 30% of the shares comprising the award will vest according to TSR performance against a comparator group of UK and international financial services companies as shown below.
For awards made in 2010, the TSR performance scale is: Companys TSR performance Proportion of this part of the award vesting Below median 0% Median 25% Upper quintile Top 20% 100% Between median and upper quintile Between 25% and 100% pro rata Additionally, before any shares subject to the TSR condition vest, the Committee must be satisfied that the Companys TSR performance is reflective of underlying financial performance.
The TSR comparator group consists of the following companies: TSR comparator group Aegon Allianz AXA AVIVA Baloise Generali Legal & General Munich Re QBE Swiss Re Zurich Financial Services Annual Report and Accounts 2010 | RSA | 61 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED The Committee reviews, on an ongoing basis, the composition of the comparator group and will consider adding companies for future awards in the event that the number of constituent companies drops below an acceptable level.
The TSR condition is independently calculated and verified by the Committee for each award that vests.
The vesting of Matching Shares related to voluntary Deferred Shares will be determined solely by the ROE performance condition.
Dilution Dilution levels for all schemes are held strictly within the Association of British Insurers ABI limits.
The dilution levels compared to ABI limits as at 31 December 2010 were: ABI limit RSA dilution % 10% over 10 years for all share schemes 6.52 5% over 10 years for discretionary schemes 4.09 Share ownership guidelines Strengthened share ownership guidelines were introduced in 2004 for Executive Directors and members of the Executive Team.
The Group CEO is required to maintain a minimum shareholding in the Company equivalent to 200% of base salary.
The other Executive Directors have a target of 150% of base salary and other members of the Executive Team have a target of 75% of base salary.
In order to ensure that progress is made towards this target, executives are required to retain shares to a value of 50% of the net of tax gain under all executive schemes until the relevant guideline is attained.
This requirement will apply to awards under the LTIP and will continue to apply to awards under all existing long term incentive plans.
The following table shows the number of shares including voluntary Deferred Shares held under the LTIP and Matching Shares and Dividend Shares held under Sharebuild held by each Executive Director as at 31 December 2010 and the increase in shareholding over the year: Shares held Increase % Salary % Andy Haste 5,518,283 125.3 723 George Culmer 1,562,169 130.8 344 Simon Lee 943,294 29.8 270 Notes: Assuming share price of 125.2p the closing middle market price on the last dealing day of the year.
Pension provision and other benefits Andy Haste is a member of the SAL Pension Scheme SAL, a contributory defined benefit occupational pension scheme.
In 2010 the Group restructured the provision of defined benefit pensions for all UK based employees.
From 1 March 2010 Andy Hastes benefit accrual was reduced from 1 60th to 1 80th and was calculated with reference to a capped salary of 75,000.
Benefit accrued under the RSA Stakeholder Plan a defined contribution plan in respect of base salary from 75,000 up to the previous salary cap 123,600 for the tax year commencing 6 April 2009.
Participation in the RSA Stakeholder Plan will generate employer contributions worth 15% of base salary, subject to an employee contribution of 5% of base salary.
In addition to his benefits within SAL and the RSA Stakeholder Plan, Andy Haste receives an age related taxable cash allowance to enable him to make his own provision for retirement above the cap.
In 2011 he will be paid an allowance of 38% of base salary for this purpose.
George Culmer is a member of the RSA Stakeholder Plan.
In 2011, as in 2010, he will receive employer contributions worth 15% of base salary, subject to an employee contribution of 5% of base salary up to the HM Revenue and Customs annual allowance as applicable.
Additionally, George Culmer receives a taxable cash allowance of 15% of base salary, in order to bring his overall pension provision closer to the market median.
Simon Lee elected not to join a Group pension plan on appointment, and receives a taxable cash allowance of 17.5% of base salary instead.
In addition, the Executive Directors participate in a number of benefits available to other senior managers including life assurance at the rate of four times base salary together with a spouse dependant annuity, sickness and ill health early retirement benefits and private medical insurance.
They also have a choice between a company car and a monthly cash car allowance.
In common with other employees, the Executive Directors are eligible to participate in Sharesave and Sharebuild.
62 | RSA | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Service contracts The Committees policy on service contracts is that they should be subject to a maximum notice period of one year.
Generally, in the event of termination and in all cases of termination on performance grounds, the Committees policy would be to seek and apply mitigation.
None of the Executive Directors have current terms in their service contracts which allow them additional rights or payment in the event of a reconstruction or amalgamation of the Group.
Director Effective date of contract Notice period Andy Haste 2 April 2003 12 months George Culmer 1 May 2004 12 months Simon Lee 30 April 2003 12 months Andy Hastes service contract expires under normal circumstances in January 2024.
The service contracts for George Culmer and Simon Lee terminate under normal circumstances in October 2024 and March 2023 respectively.
External directorships Where appropriate, the Group encourages Directors and other senior managers to accept, subject to the approval of the Chairman and the Group CEO, an invitation to join the Board of another company in a non-executive capacity, recognising the value of such wider experience.
In these circumstances, they are permitted to retain any remuneration from the non-executive appointment.
For Executive Directors and other members of the Executive Team, external appointments are limited to one.
Andy Haste is a Non-Executive Director of ITV plc.
During the year he received a fee of 68,827 which he is permitted to retain.
Non-Executive Directors Under the Companys Articles, the remuneration paid to Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board, within limits set by shareholders.
Following a review during the year the base fee was revised from 1 October 2010 to 60,000 in order to align fees with current market rates.
This is the first increase to the base fee for Non-Executive Directors since 2005: 2010 2009 Base fee 60,000 45,000 Plus: Chairman of Group Audit Committee 20,000 20,000 Chairman of Remuneration Committee 12,500 12,500 Chairman of Investment Committee 12,500 12,500 Chairman of Board Risk Committee 12,500 12,500 Additional fee for sitting on one or more Committees in a capacity other than Chairman 5,000 5,000 Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to bonus payments or pension arrangements, nor do they participate in the Groups long term incentive plans.
The Committee determines the Chairmans remuneration.
The fee payable to John Napier in respect of his appointment as Chairman of the Board for 2010 was 400,000 per year and is subject to annual review by the Committee.
As with Executive Directors, the Chairman requested that his fee was not increased in 2010.
The appointment may be terminated by the Chairman on three months notice to the Company.
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 | RSA | 63 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts but each has a letter of appointment.
The letters of appointment all request a period of one months notice should the Non-Executive Director wish to resign.
Non-Executive Director Effective date of letter of appointment Edward Lea 10 July 2003 John Maxwell 10 July 2003 Noel Harwerth 30 March 2004 Malcolm Le May 30 March 2004 Johanna Waterous 20 May 2008 All Non-Executive Directors including the Chairman are subject to a three year rolling period of appointment in accordance with the Articles.
John Napiers initial letter of appointment was effective from 9 January 2003 and the term of his appointment was three years.
This was most recently extended on 15 February 2011 when it was extended beyond 31 December 2011 so that it continues until termination in accordance with his letter of appointment.
Historical TSR performance The graph below is included in the report of the Committee as a requirement of Schedule 8 to The Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Group Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008.
The graph shows the TSR of the Group with reference to the FTSE World Europe Non Life Insurance Index and the FTSE 100 Index.
The FTSE World Europe Non Life Insurance Index comprises the range of European insurance businesses which most closely match our competitor group, and the TSR comparator group selected for awards under the LTIP.
The FTSE 100 Index comprises the 100 most highly capitalised companies of the UK market.
TSR performance relative to the indices is shown over the five years from 31 December 2005 to 31 December 2010.
TSR reflects the change in value of ordinary shares in a company over time, as represented by the evolution of a notional initial investment of 100 in the shares and including any distribution of dividends.

The Listing Rules require the change in accrued pension to be shown excluding the effects of inflation and the transfer value of this increase.
These figures are shown in the notes below.
The accrued pension figures shown are the annual amounts of members pension payable from normal retirement age.
Increases to pensions when in payment are applied in accordance with the relevant scheme rules.
On the death of the member leaving a surviving spouse and or children, spouses and or childrens pensions are payable in accordance with scheme rules.
The benefits shown above in respect of Andy Haste relate to his membership of a defined benefit pension scheme up to the earnings cap for benefits accrued prior to 28 February 2010, and up to a cap of 75k for benefits accrued from 1 March 2010.
Andy Haste was a member of the defined contribution scheme for benefits between 75k and the earnings cap for the period from 1 March 2010.
For Andy Haste the increase in his accrued pension during the year, excluding the effects of inflation, was 1k p. a and the transfer value in respect of this less his contributions was 17k at 31 December 2010.
Andy Haste is required to contribute to the scheme and also has the option of paying Additional Voluntary Contributions AVCs.
Neither voluntary contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the table.
The transfer value of the accrued benefits represents the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of Andy Hastes pension benefits.
The transfer values do not represent sums payable or due to Andy Haste.

Long term incentive schemes Long term incentive scheme interests held during 2010 in respect of the ordinary shares of the Company are as follows: Share Matching Plan vested awards Dates by Share Share Share Share Share Share which awards awards awards awards awards awards qualifying held at granted vested exercised lapsed held at 31 conditions 1 January during during during during December must be 2010 the year the year the year the year 2010 fulfilled 1,2, 3 George Culmer Deferred Share 128,938128,938 Met awards Matching Share 386,814386,814 Met awards Notes: 1.
The market price of ordinary shares on 8 April 2005, the date on which the above Share Matching Plan awards were granted, was 81.25p.
Matching Share awards are capable of vesting in respect of a maximum of three times the number of Deferred Shares awarded, subject to the achievement of TSR targets over a single two year period.
TSR performance is measured relative to other companies specified by the Remuneration Committee.
For awards granted in 2004 and 2005, TSR was measured partly relative to FTSE 100 companies and partly relative to the following financial services comparator group companies: Aegon, Legal & General Group, Allianz Group, Old Mutual, AXA, Prudential, AVIVA, RAS, Generali and Zurich Financial Services Group.
For 50% of the Matching Share awards, where TSR is measured against the FTSE 100, full vesting will only occur at upper decile performance, vesting will occur in the ratio of shares under Matching Share awards to shares under Deferred Share awards of 2:1 at upper quartile performance and vesting in the ratio 1:1 will occur at median performance.
For the other 50% of the Matching Share awards, where TSR is measured against the financial services comparator group, full vesting will occur if TSR is highest in the comparator group, vesting in the ratio 2:1 will occur at upper quartile performance and vesting in the ratio 1:1 will occur at median performance.
Matching Share awards will not vest at below median performance.
For awards granted in 2005, the targets were measured over the period from 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2007.
The relevant TSR figures were averaged over the three months before the beginning and end of this performance period.
Additionally, no Matching Shares vest unless the Committee is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying performance of the Company over the performance period.
The aggregate gain on Share Matching Plan awards exercised during 2010 was 146k.
The market price of ordinary shares on 7 April 2010, the date on which long term incentive scheme interests were granted during the year, was 129.1p.
Deferred Shares are inclusive of voluntary Deferred Shares and compulsory Deferred Shares.
Voluntary Deferred Shares are purchased by Capita Trustees Limited on behalf of each participant using part of the net annual bonus paid to them and are held in trust for three years.
These Deferred Shares are not at risk of forfeiture and may be withdrawn from the trust at any time, but the related Matching Share awards would lapse if the voluntary Deferred Shares are withdrawn within three years of acquisition.
Compulsory Deferred Share awards are granted as part of the annual bonus.
These Deferred Shares will normally vest in three years from the date of grant subject to continuous employment with the Group.
Matching Shares are capable of vesting in respect of a maximum of 2.5 times the number of Deferred Shares awarded, subject to the achievement of performance conditions over a three year period.
For grants awarded in 2009 and 2010, 30% of the Matching Shares relating to compulsory Deferred Shares are subject to TSR performance relative to other companies specified by the Remuneration Committee.
For grants awarded in 2007 and 2008, 50% of the Matching Shares relating to compulsory Deferred Shares are subject to TSR performance relative to other companies specified by the Remuneration Committee and for awards granted in 2009 this was 30%.
Full vesting will only occur at upper quintile performance: at median performance 25% of the Matching Shares will vest.
Vesting will be on a straight line basis in between.
The remaining balance of the Matching Shares relating to compulsory Deferred Shares and all of the Matching Shares relating to voluntary Deferred Shares are subject to a ROE performance condition.
If underlying ROE over three years commencing in the year of grant is below 10% 12% for awards granted in 2008, no part of the award subject to ROE performance will vest.
If underlying ROE over three years is 10% 12% for awards granted in 2008, 25% of the award will vest.
If underlying average annual ROE over three years is 16% or higher 18% for awards granted in 2008, 100% of the awards will vest.
For the purpose of establishing the number of Matching Shares relating to voluntary Deferred Shares that may be awarded, the gross value of that part of the annual bonus payment that a participant elects to voluntarily defer is used.
Performance conditions relating to awards of Performance Shares are the same as those relating to compulsory Deferred Matching Shares for the relevant year of grant as described above.
The date by which qualifying conditions for LTIP awards must be met is as follows: Year of grant Date by which qualifying conditions must be fulfilled 2007 31.12.09 2008 31.12.10 2009 31.12.11 2010 31.12.12 6 The market price on the date of grant of awards 16 April 2007 was 164.6p, the market price on date of vesting of awards 8 March 2010 was 124.5p.
The aggregate value of share awards vested for Directors during the year under the long term incentive plan amounted to 3.3m.
Voluntary Deferred Shares which are shown in the table above are not included in this value.
No other Directors of the Company held long term incentive scheme interests during 2010.
