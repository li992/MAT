Remuneration report The Board presents the Remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2010.
Remuneration Committee The Board has delegated the determination of Executive Director remuneration to the Remuneration Committee the Committee.
The current members of the Committee are the independent Non-executive Directors Caroline Burton chairman, Kate Avery, Oliver Corbett, David Harrel, Kathryn Matthews and Mark Nicholls.
Kate Avery, Kathryn Matthews and Mark Nicholls joined the Committee on their appointment to the Board.
The Chairman and Chief Executive, at the invitation of the Committee, attend the meetings but are not present when their own remuneration is discussed.
The Committee met on five occasions in 2010 2009: five.
Details of attendance at meetings are shown on page 34.
Remuneration policy for Executive Directors The aim of the remuneration policy is to provide a competitive remuneration package, having regard to comparable companies in the financial sector, which is sufficient to attract and retain the quality of Director needed to manage and develop the Company successfully.
There has been considerable government and regulatory focus on remuneration in 2009 and 2010, particularly in the financial services industry.
This has provided an opportunity to review and update remuneration arrangements.
Following consultation with major shareholders in early 2010, the profit sharing scheme was revised to introduce an element of deferral with deferred awards invested in Rathbone shares.
The current Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP has now reached the end of its 10 year life and shareholder approval of a replacement LTIP will be sought at the AGM on 11 May 2011.
Remuneration packages The current remuneration package for an Executive Director has four main elements: Basic salary and benefits.
Remuneration packages are designed to have the following three key characteristics: To align the interests of the Directors with shareholders in generating long term shareholder value.
Participation in a LTIP and use of the total shareholder return performance condition Deferred profit share invested in Rathbone Brothers Plc shares To align remuneration practices with effective risk management.
Profit share rather than income based bonus Profits for these purposes are realised and in cash Deferred awards LTIP and partial deferral of profit share To motivate and retain key executives.
Directors are incentivised to increase the deferred share element of the profit share Deferred awards profit sharing scheme and LTIP Retention provisions and up to date, best practice contracts The Committee does not specifically take into account corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues when considering the remuneration of Executive Directors but it is satisfied that the incentive structure does not increase risks in these areas by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
The elements of remuneration packages are summarised below.
Basic salary and benefits An Executive Directors basic salary is determined by the Committee and any change implemented on 1 January of each year or when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers salaries throughout the Group as a whole and the information obtained on comparable companies in the financial sector.
In view of the trading conditions experienced in late 2008 and in 2009, Directors basic salaries were not increased on 1 January 2009 or on 1 January 2010.
With one exception, all Directors received a salary increase of approximately 4% with effect from 1 January 2011 which was in line with the average increase for all employees.
Ian Buckley received an increase of 7.8% to reflect significant additional responsibilities taken on during the year.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2010 38 Remuneration report Basic salary and benefits continued When setting salary levels, use is made of survey data and information provided by the advisers to the Committee.
The views of the Chairman and Chief Executive are also taken into consideration in respect of other Board positions.
In addition Rathbones provides a range of benefits including life, private medical and permanent health insurance.
The provision of company cars is being phased out as lease contracts end.
Profit share As explained in our 2009 financial statements, changes were made to the operation of this arrangement.
From 2010, awards to all Executive Directors are made from a pool of profits of 3 5% of Group profit before tax with an expectation that in a normal year the percentage would be around 4%.
The percentage for 2010 was 5% reflecting the strong performance in 2010.
The Committee has the discretion to adjust the calculation of Group profit before tax for the purposes of the profit share to ensure that it appropriately reflects underlying business performance.
For 2010, the Committee agreed that the exceptional FSCS levies of 3.6 million should be excluded from the calculation.
Awards to individual Directors are determined by the Committee following recommendations by the Chief Executive and Chairman.
They are calculated taking into account the performance of the Director, the results of the business for which the Director has responsibility where relevant and market data where this is available.
Awards are made in both cash one third and deferred shares two thirds with interim, on account awards payable during the financial year, and final awards made shortly after the announcement of the Groups results for the year.
The proportion paid in cash may be increased at the request of the participant but this will cause the overall award to be reduced such that the total will be reduced by a maximum of one-third if 100% of the award is taken in cash.
In 2010, all participants took the maximum award.
Individual awards are capped at 200% of basic salary.
No performance criteria are attached to the deferred share awards.
The Committees view is that share price movements reflect the performance of the business and therefore further performance conditions were not necessary.
Half of deferred share awards will lapse if a Director is a bad leaver.
Deferred shares will attract the monetary equivalent of declared dividends over the deferral period from the end of the financial year of the award.
Awards vest on the third anniversary of the financial year end at which point a nil paid option will be granted over the deferred share award including a further number of additional shares representing the value of dividends received and reinvested in relation to vested shares.
This option may be exercised within seven years of grant.
For 2010, a first interim deferred share award was made on 31 March 2010 and a second interim award on 6 September 2010.
The final award will be made following the announcement of the 2010 results.
Deferred share awards vest after three years 3 Benefits include the provision of a company car and medical insurance.
They also include the value of SIP matching shares awarded on a one for one basis to match partnership shares acquired up to a maximum of 1,500 per annum 4 During the year, retirement benefits accrued under money purchase schemes in relation to three directors 2009: three Equity incentives Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The current LTIP was approved by shareholders in 2000 and no awards may be made after November 2010.
It is therefore proposed to introduce a replacement LTIP with effect from 1 January 2011, subject to shareholder approval at the AGM.
Under the current LTIP arrangements, Executive Directors are provisionally awarded rights to acquire ordinary shares at the start of a three year plan cycle the provisional award.
The maximum value of a provisional award is 75% of a participants basic salary.
At the end of each plan cycle, the Companys performance is assessed against the performance targets for that cycle.
The extent to which the targets have been achieved determines the actual number of shares if any attributable to each participant the actual award.
The performance targets used to date have been a mixture of growth in earnings per share EPS and relative total shareholder return TSR measured against the FTSE All Share Index.
TSR is a measure of the overall return to shareholders.
It reflects both the change in the share price and dividends, assuming that they are reinvested.
Whilst the rules of the proposed new LTIP have been updated and revised to reflect current practice, the main features of the proposed plan, which are set out in detail in the Notice of the AGM, are broadly unchanged.
Awards are limited to 75% of salary other than in exceptional circumstances when the Committee consider that a 100% limit would be appropriate.
Whilst the EPS performance target is unchanged, the TSR performance target has been revised.
The TSR of the Company is compared with the FTSE All Share Total Return Index TRI with threshold vesting of 25% of the award if the Index is matched.
There is full vesting if the Rathbones TSR exceeds that of the Index by 10% in absolute rather than relative terms with straight line vesting between these two points.
The Committee consider that the combination of EPS and TSR is most appropriate as it ensures not only focus on a key financial driver via EPS, but also alignment of shareholder interests via TSR.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2010 40 Remuneration report Equity incentives continued If a participant ceases to be employed as an Executive Director by reason of retirement at normal retirement age or earlier with the Companys consent, ill-health, redundancy or death, or any other circumstances which the Committee deems to be appropriate, the award shall normally continue in effect and vest on the original date set for vesting but with the award based on the performance during the plan cycle as a whole but reduced pro rata to reflect the fact that the participant was not an Executive Director for the whole plan cycle.
In all other circumstances, any provisional award would lapse on cessation of employment.
Shares for both the profit sharing scheme and LTIP are held by The Rathbone Brothers Plc Settlement in Jersey.
On 31 December 2010, the trustee, Investec Trust Jersey Limited, held 112,693 Rathbone Brothers Plc ordinary shares 2009: 42,693 ordinary shares.
Dividend entitlements in respect of this holding have been waived and voting rights will not be exercised.

Basic EPS decreased from 76.54p in 2007 to 49.76p in 2010 and so no award was payable for this element of the plan.
2009 11 and 2010 12 plan cycles Details of the provisional awards for the 2009 11 and 2010 12 plan cycles are set out in table 5.
Rathbone Brothers Plc 41 Remuneration report Report and accounts 2010 Equity incentives continued 2011 13 plan cycle The 2011 13 awards are subject to shareholder approval of the plan at the AGM on 11 May 2011.
If approved, the awards will be treated as having been made on 1 March 2011 using the average share price in the 20 dealing days prior to that date.
Participation in the LTIP is conditional on the Director signing a new service agreement.
Were the maximum possible provisional awards to be made in shares to current and former Directors as shown in table 5, 285,149 ordinary shares 2009: 393,346 would be awarded, representing 0.7% 2009: 0.9% of the issued share capital at 31 December 2010.
In practice, awards under the LTIP are intended to be satisfied using market purchased shares held in trust.
Expected actual awards are difficult to predict with any accuracy.

The value of these awards when made was 75% of a participants basic salary.
The market value of shares at the date of the provisional award is the average mid-market price over the 20 dealing days prior to the start of the plan.
Actual awards for the 2008 10 plan will be made in March 2011.
The performance conditions for the 2007 09 plan were not satisfied and no award was therefore made in 2010 in respect of this plan.
Long term incentive arrangements for Peter Pearson Lund Peter Pearson Lund, who retired from the Board on 31 March 2010, participated in the Rathbone Unit Trust Management Limited deferred profit sharing plan rather than the LTIP.

This allows all employees to purchase shares in the Company and currently these are matched on a one for one basis by the Company.
Performance related SIP shares are also offered to employees if there is year on year EPS growth over the rate of inflation.
SIP shares are included in the table of Directors share interests on page 29.
Executive Directors may also participate in the Rathbones Savings Related Share Option Plan commonly known as a Save As You Earn or SAYE Plan on the same terms as all other employees.
Details of grants to Directors are shown in table 7.
It is anticipated that a further grant will be made in March 2011 following the announcement of the 2010 results.

Options granted after 21 June 2004 can be exercised if the earnings per share of the Group between the accounting period immediately prior to the option grant and the accounting period immediately prior to the third anniversary of grant has increased in percentage terms by more than the increase in the RPI plus 3% per annum or pro rata for any part thereof.
Option grants to a participant in a ten year rolling period are capped at four times remuneration.
There is no automatic waiving of performance conditions in the event of a change of control or the early termination of a participants employment.
Options may not normally be exercised before the third anniversary of the date of grant and expire on the tenth anniversary of grant.
Details of outstanding options at the start and end of the year together with details of options exercised during the year are set out in table 8.

Of that 15%, not more than 10% applies to shares allotted under share option schemes including the SAYE Plan and not more than 5% to shares allotted under both the LTIP and SIP.
It is proposed that at the AGM on 11 May 2011 the 15% limit will be reduced to 10%, in line with ABI guidelines.

Pension arrangements UK employees who joined Rathbones prior to 1 April 2002 were offered membership of the Rathbone 1987 Pension Scheme the Scheme.
The Scheme provides for members to retire at the age of 60 with a pension based on final pensionable salary.
Prior to 1 April 2006, the accrual rate was 1 60th for each year of membership.
With effect from 1 April 2006, employees were given the choice of either remaining on a 1 60th accrual rate but increasing their contribution rate from 5% to 6.5% at 1 April 2006 and to 8% from 1 January 2008 or switching to a 1 70th accrual rate for future pensionable service but continuing to contribute at 5%.
With effect from 1 July 2009, future service benefits are based on career average revalued earnings CARE with a normal retirement age of 65 rather than 60.
Details of the Companys contributions are set out in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.
Since 1 April 2002, new employees have been offered membership of a Group defined contribution plan, established with Scottish Widows.
In the case of certain Directors and senior staff, the Group contributes to their personal pension arrangements.
Paul Chavasse, Richard Lanyon, Andrew Morris and Richard Smeeton are members of the Scheme.
Ian Buckley, Andy Pomfret and Paul Stockton participate in the Scheme for death in service benefits only.
Ian Buckley and Andy Pomfret have arrangements under self-invested personal pension schemes whilst Paul Stockton is a member of the Group defined contribution plan.
Rathbones pays annual contributions of 11.5% of salary to those schemes, subject to HM Revenue and Customs maximum limits, where applicable.
The changes in pension entitlements arising in the financial year, required to be disclosed by the UK Listing Authority, are shown in table 10.
There have been no changes in the terms of Directors pension entitlements during the year.
There are no unfunded pension promises or similar arrangements for Directors.
The increases in transfer values are mainly due to changed assumptions for inflation, post-retirement discount rates and future mortality.
Following the introduction of the Governments simplification of the pension taxation regime on 6 April 2006 the Company has taken action, where required, to ensure that the pension arrangements for staff conform to the new regime.
Where possible, for all UK employees, death in service cover has been extended to age 65 for those that stay in service beyond age 60.

Pensions will increase at a rate of 5% per annum or the lesser of 5% per annum or the rise in the Retail Price Index if less for pension entitlement accrued after 1 April 2001 or for pension accrued under the Laurence Keen Scheme and being in excess of the Guaranteed Minimum Pension after early retirement subject to HM Revenue and Customs limits.
There is no undertaking or expectation for any other pension benefit to be arranged for any Director by the Company.
Service contracts for Executive Directors The Company has service contracts with its Executive Directors.
It is Company policy that such contracts should not normally contain notice periods of more than 12 months.
Details of the contracts of employment of Executive Directors serving during the year are as shown below: Table 11.

Payment in lieu of notice would include basic salary, pension contributions and benefits.
There are no provisions for the payment of liquidated damages or any statements in respect of the duty of mitigation.
Compensation payments will be determined on a case by case basis in the light of current market practice.
Compensation will include loss of salary and other contractual benefits but mitigation will be applied where appropriate.
In the event of entering into a termination agreement, the Board will take steps to impose a legal obligation on the Director to mitigate the loss incurred.
There are no clauses in contracts amending employment terms and conditions on a change of control.
Executive Directors contracts of service, which include details of remuneration, will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
Shareholdings New Executive Directors are encouraged to build up and maintain a shareholding at least equivalent to the value of one years basic salary within five years of taking up their appointment.
External appointments Executive Directors are encouraged to take on external appointments as non-executive directors, but are discouraged from holding more than one position in a major company.
Prior approval of any new appointment is required by the Board with fees generally being payable to the Company.
An exception is Ian Buckley, who was appointed to the board of NXT Plc now HiWave Technologies PLC prior to joining Rathbones.
He resigned from the NXT Plc board on 1 January 2011.
Following his appointment as a committee member of the Family Assurance Friendly Society on 14 December 2009, whilst he retains the fee paid of 27,350 per annum 2009: 27,350, his Rathbones salary has been reduced accordingly.
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee has appointed Deloitte LLP Deloitte as advisers to the Committee.
Deloitte attend at least one Remuneration Committee meeting per annum and advise on best practice and latest developments in senior executive remuneration.
Deloitte also provides occasional ad hoc advice, particularly on share scheme issues.
The appointment is reviewed annually.
The Committee is also assisted by the personnel department and by the Company Secretary.
