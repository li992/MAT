The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is a matter for the Chairman and the executive members of the Board.
The main responsibilities of the Committee are to: set and monitor performance criteria for any bonus arrangements operated by the Company and its Group ensuring that they represent achievable and motivating rewards for appropriate levels of performance and, where appropriate, are justifiable taking into account the Companys and Groups overall performance and the corresponding return on shareholders investment in the same period: recommend to the Board the policy for, and scope of, pension arrangements for the Executive Directors and other senior management taking into account the future liabilities of any recommendation and to detail precisely which elements of the remuneration packages are pensionable: review and approve the Companys share option and share award schemes including any long-term co-investment plans, approve proposed option grants or share awards to Directors or senior management, and to set or recommend performance criteria for share awards: and within the terms of the agreed policy, determine the total individual remuneration package for the Companys Chairman, Executive Directors, Company Secretary and other senior management including, where appropriate, bonuses, incentive payments and share options or other share awards.
The Committee members have no personal or financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Chief Executive is invited to attend meetings of the Committee but does not take part in the decision making of the Committee.
The Committee has access to external consultancy services on remuneration and sector issues.
Hewitt New Bridge Street Consultants were employed to assist, as required, only with matters relating to the Companys Performance Share Plan.

It is assumed that any dividends are re-invested.
Executive Directors remuneration The Groups remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages which ensure that Directors and senior managers are fairly and responsibly rewarded for their contributions.
The aim is to provide remuneration packages which are sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the quality required to achieve the Groups objectives and thereby enhance shareholder value.
The Committee takes account of the level of remuneration paid to Executive Directors and senior managers of comparable public companies and best practice standards.
It is the intention that this policy will continue to apply for 2011 and subsequent years subject to ongoing review as appropriate.
The main details of the Executive Directors Service Agreements relating to base salary, annual bonus, share plan awards, pensions and other benefits for 2010 are as set out below.
Service Agreements The Service Agreements for the Executive Directors are for no fixed term and may in normal circumstances be terminated by either party on giving six months notice.
The Company reserves the right and discretion to pay the Executive Directors in lieu of notice.
If the Company terminates the employment of an Executive Director by exercising its right to pay in lieu of notice, the Company is required to make a payment equal to the aggregate of basic salary and the cost to the Company of providing other contractual benefits which excludes bonus for the unexpired portion of the duration of any entitlement to notice.

In return for the payment of such a fixed sum, the Executive Director agrees to waive, release and discharge any entitlement to further or additional compensation of any kind whatsoever.
Date of contract Notice period James Menzies 29 11 06 Six months Mike Buck 29 11 06 Six months Nick Cooper 29 11 06 Six months Salary The annual base salaries of the Executive Directors for the year to 31 December 2010 were as follows: Salary s James Menzies 380,000 Mike Buck 280,000 Nick Cooper 280,000 The salary of each Executive Director is subject to regular review by the Remuneration Committee and such a review took place in December 2010.
During the review, a 4% salary increase for each Executive Director was agreed by the Remuneration Committee for the year to 31 December 2011.
When determining the salary of the Executive Directors the Committee takes into consideration: the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills, in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity, in particular the levels of base salary at those comparable companies within the FTSE Oil and Gas Producers sector and the Comparator Group: the performance of the individual Executive Director: the individual Executive Directors experience and responsibilities: and pay and conditions throughout the Company.
Bonus Each of the Executive Directors is eligible for a discretionary annual bonus up to a maximum of 100% of their base salary.
The bonus may only be payable to the extent that individual and corporate performance targets set by the Remuneration Committee are achieved in the relevant year.
Executive bonus levels are assessed on the level of the Companys performance against financial, operational and strategic targets.
These may include, but are not limited to: share price performance: reserves replacement: execution of planned exploration drilling programme: HSE performance: financial performance: and production growth.
Considering the above, the Remuneration Committee assessed that an award of 33% of the maximum bonus potential was appropriate when judging by the achievements of the executive team against the above priorities and when looking at a broader picture of the Companys performance over the period.
48 Corporate governance Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2010 Bonus continued The general targets for the annual bonus plan are reviewed and agreed by the Remuneration Committee each year to ensure that they are appropriate to the current position of the Company.
The Committee is in no doubt that, in the current economic environment, achieving substantial progress in these priority areas will continue to be extremely challenging.
Non-executive Directors do not participate in any bonus arrangements.
Pay and conditions across the Group Consideration has also been given to general pay and employment conditions across the Group.
The Group operates in a number of different countries and has many employees who perform a diverse range of jobs.
Therefore, although it is difficult to take into account pay and employment conditions across the Group specifically when setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors: all employees, including the Directors, are paid by reference to the market rate: consistently high performance is rewarded through a number of performance related bonus schemes across the Group: the Group offers internal promotion opportunities: the Group offers employment conditions which are commensurate with a UK listed company including high standards of health and safety and equal opportunity policies: the Group offers a range of benefits depending on employee location including pension, flexible benefits, paid annual leave and healthcare insurance: and the Company believes that share plans are important to align the interests of employees and shareholders.
Therefore, the Company offers the following employee share plans: the Performance Share Plan, open to Executive Directors and senior management: and the Deferred Share Plan as approved by the shareholders at the 2009 Annual General Meeting, open to all other employees.
The Remuneration Committee will continue to assess these and other matters, such as the prevailing market conditions, when determining levels of remuneration for Executive Directors.
Performance Share Plan In accordance with the Companys Performance Share Plan PSP and at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, all eligible employees including Executive Directors may be awarded Share Options in the Company, the vesting of which are subject to conditions as set out in this report Awards.
The Committee supervises the operation of the PSP including the levels of Awards made to employees and Executive Directors.
As approved by the shareholders at the 2009 Annual General Meeting, a new deferred bonus scheme replaced the PSP for certain employees but not Directors, recognising that the PSP continuing to apply to all employees was not appropriate.
The PSP remains the sole long-term incentive arrangement for all Executive Directors.
During the year, as approved by the shareholders at the 2010 Annual General Meeting, the individual limit in the PSP was increased.
The PSP was adopted when the Company listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2006.
When it was adopted, the PSP was structured so as to provide a competitive long-term incentive compared to other companies of a similar size Salamander initially listed within the FTSE Small Cap, and with the features conforming to prevailing market practice and best practice at that time.
49 Corporate governance Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2010 Remuneration report continued Performance Share Plan continued Until 2010, the PSP was operated in line with the policy set out on listing, namely: Awards were made annually to Executive Directors worth up to 100% of salary which is the maximum grant limit except where the Remuneration Committee deems it necessary to grant a higher award in specific circumstances.
Other senior management were also granted awards at a lower percentage of salary.
In 2009, the Remuneration Committee decided to amend its policy of granting Awards to the whole workforce, and limited participation in the PSP to senior executives: the vesting of Awards is subject to a relative total shareholder return TSR performance condition, comparing Salamanders TSR performance to that of a selected group of other listed Oil & Gas Exploration & Production companies, measured over three years: and 30% of Awards vest for median performance, and Awards vest in full for upper quartile performance with a sliding scale between the two points.
In 2010, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the operation of the PSP in the context of Salamander as a FTSE 250 constituent and concluded that, in order to remain competitive relative to the market, changes to its operation for 2010 and future years were required, namely, an increase in the individual limit in the PSP to 200% of salary p. a.
The increase in the PSP limit was for the following reasons: Whilst it may elect not to grant up to the maximum limit each year, the Remuneration Committee wishes to have the flexibility to do so in order to remain competitive relative to the market.
The Company is now significantly larger in relative market positioning than it was when it first listed.
Thus, it is now a member of the FTSE 250 whereas it listed as a member of the FTSE Small Cap, and needs to be able to attract executives competitively against companies of a similar size, as well as being able to reward and retain existing executives who have contributed towards this growth: and The Companys general reward policy is not excessive, with the Executive Directors salaries being set at around the lower quartile for FTSE 250 companies, and with the maximum bonus potential being 100% of salary.
Additionally, the Company does not have a history of paying maximum bonuses, and in respect of 2009 and 2010, despite very strong years, the average bonuses paid to the Executive Directors were 55% and 33%, respectively, of salary.
Therefore, in absolute terms, a 200% of salary Award level would not lead to excessive total remuneration relative to other FTSE 250 companies.
The basic requirement of measuring performance relative to a group of selected Oil & Gas Exploration & Production companies remains unchanged see below.
The PSP is intended to facilitate the retention and incentivisation of employees of the Group and to align their interests with those of shareholders by enabling employees, including Executive Directors, to receive shares in Salamander, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions and continued employment.
Accordingly, the Remuneration Committee believes that the PSP provides an appropriate degree of flexibility in the way in which a share based incentive arrangement can be operated by the Group, while giving due consideration to best and market practice.
Awards vest on or following the third anniversary of the date of grant once the Committee has determined the extent to which the applicable performance condition see below has been satisfied and provided the participant remains an employee with the Group.
Awards, once vested, will normally remain capable of exercise for a period of twelve months.
50 Corporate governance Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2010 Performance Share Plan continued Awards granted to all employees, including the Executive Directors, will vest based on Salamanders performance against an industry-specific peer group of companies drawn from the constituents of the FTSE 250, FTSE Small Cap and AIM listed companies in the Oil and Gas Producers sector with market capitalisations in excess of 100 million at or around the date of grant.
The comparator groups for the 2010 and 2009 awards were: 2010 Awards 2009 Awards Afren Ithaca Energy Afren JKX Oil & Gas Bankers Petroleum JKX Oil & Gas plc Cairn Energy Melrose Resources Bowleven Melrose Resources plc Circle Oil Premier Oil Cairn Energy Petroceltic Coastal Energy Providence Resources Coastal Energy Premier Oil Dana Petroleum ROC Oil Company Dana Petroleum plc Regal Petroleum Dragon Oil SOCO International Dragon Oil Serica Energy Emerald Energy Valiant Petroleum Enquest SOCO International Faroe Petroleum Venture Production Geopark Holdings Sterling Energy Geopark Holdings Gulf Keystone Tullow Oil Gulfsands Petroleum Gulfsands Petroleum Valiant Petroleum Hardy Oil & Gas Heritage Petroleum Heritage Oil Awards vest as follows in relation to Salamanders relative TSR performance over the performance period: if Salamander is ranked below median, none of the Award will vest: for a ranking position of median, 30% of the Award will vest: for a ranking position of upper quartile or better, full vesting 100% of the Award will occur: and for a ranking between median and upper quartile, there will be straight line vesting between 30% and 100%.
Hewitt New Bridge Street carried out a performance monitoring exercise in respect of the Awards made on 5 October 2007 under the terms of the Salamander Performance Share Plan.
Their calculations were carried out to 4 October 2010, the end of the performance period for these awards and therefore represented final results.
As noted above, these Awards were subject to a TSR performance condition relative to the 2010 comparator group over a performance period.
Based on Salamanders TSR and ranking being between median and upper quartile, the Awards vested at 91.79% of the number of Awards granted on 5 October 2007.
The market price on vesting of the Awards was 2.5289.
Details of the Directors interests further to the vesting of this Award are set out later in this Remuneration Report.
At 31 December 2010, a total of 4,305,854 Awards of options over ordinary shares representing 2.8% of the Companys issued share capital of 154,015,588 ordinary shares at the year-end were outstanding and granted to eligible employees including the Executive Directors.
Further information regarding Share Based Payments is included in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements.
Benefits Executive Directors receive a defined pension contribution or salary supplement in lieu of pension contributions equal to 15% of their salary, private medical cover and life assurance of up to four times salary.
51 Corporate governance Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2010 Remuneration report continued Non-executive Directors remuneration The Companys policy on Non-executive Directors remuneration is to set compensation at a level which is sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate high quality Non-executives and to be consistent with best practice standards.
Non-executive Directors may not participate in the Companys PSP or pension arrangements.
Each of the Non-executive Directors is entitled to reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in the course of their duties and to Directors and officers liability insurance cover.

However, participants who are granted nominal cost options under the PSP are required to pay the Company the nominal value of 0.10 for each share issued upon the exercise of the option.
2 The Committee considers the interests of shareholders when deciding on how the PSP is operated and ensures that no individual is granted excessive levels of Awards, taking into consideration the overall quantum and structure of that individuals compensation package.
In circumstances where the Committee considers it appropriate to do so, including the recruitment or retention of an employee or Executive Director, the Committee may exceed the normal 200% limit at its discretion.
3 The aggregate value of Awards granted in 2008 by the Committee to Mike Buck Chief Operating Officer was equivalent to 200% of his base annual salary, reflecting his increased operational responsibilities and contribution to the Groups performance.
4 The highest and lowest closing prices of the Companys shares during the year were 3.07 and 2.04 respectively.
The mid-market price of the Companys shares at 31 December 2010 was 2.69.
5 During 2010 Hewitt New Bridge Street carried out a performance monitoring exercise in respect of the Awards made on 5 October 2007 under the terms of the Salamander Energy Performance Share Plan.
These Awards were subject to a total shareholder return performance condition relative to a comparator group over a performance period and accordingly vested at 91.79% of the number of Awards granted on 5 October 2007.
The Executive Directors exercised the full Award vested, receiving ordinary shares after selling shares sufficient to cover the cost of the option price and tax resulting from the exercise of the vested Awards.
No other options lapsed or were exercised during the year.
