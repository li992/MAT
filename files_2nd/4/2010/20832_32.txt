As at 31 December 2010 the options held under these plans by executive directors, all of whom were directors throughout the year, and their changes during the year, are set out in the tables on the next two pages.
In addition each executive director was awarded 772 free shares in the SIP in April 2010 2009: 284.

The high and low closing market share prices during the year were 433.0p and 358.7p respectively 2009: 396.9p and 301.7p.
These calculations are before tax and are theoretical as most PSP and LTIP awards were not exercisable at the year end, and some may not meet their performance conditions in full.
3 The primary performance conditions of each of the grants of directors executive options included in the tables above related to TSR against a comparator group of companies, with a secondary condition that the Company had returned a satisfactory overall financial performance, both measured over a three year performance period.
They were not subject to re-testing and, to the extent that an individuals annual grant was over shares valued at over 50% of salary, the Companys TSR had to be upper quartile for the options to be exercised in full.
All of such options met their performance conditions in full at the end of the relevant periods.
4 Changes in directors entitlements during the year resulted from the grants during the year indicated in the table opposite and from the exercises set out in the second table above.
Performance conditions measurements of PSP and LTIP awards Measurements against PSP performance conditions were determined by the Committee in early 2010 and early 2011 respectively and are summarised below.
For each of the 2005 and 2006 awards the average return on net tangible assets over the ensuring five year period exceeded the threshold for maximum vesting of 20%.

In this case the primary performance condition was 100% met for the 2007 awards but for 2008 only partial vesting has been achieved, as Amlins TSR over the relevant three year period only outperformed the index by 15.5% compared with the maximum vesting threshold of 25% outperformance.

The only employee schemes under which either unissued or treasury shares are committed to be issued are the executive share option schemes, the Sharesave plans and the schedules to the PSP and LTIP applying to awards to participants in Continental Europe.
New shares were also issued in 2007 to the trustee of the Share Incentive Plan as SIP Free Shares but in subsequent years such shares were purchased in the market.
Shares awarded under the PSP and LTIP are intended to be satisfied from shares held, or to be purchased, by the Groups Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT unless overseas requirements dictate otherwise.
Grants of options over new and or treasury shares under any selective plan, after deducting any such options which have lapsed, are limited to 5% of the issued share capital in any 10 year period.
Grants over new treasury shares under any scheme are also limited to 10% over 10 years.
The percentages of the year end shares in issue, together with the equivalent percentages a year earlier, relating to each of these limits are shown in the table below.
