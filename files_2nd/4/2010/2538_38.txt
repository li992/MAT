gOveRnAnce diRectORs RemuneRAtiOn RepORt For the year ended 3 october 2010 The following is a report by the Remuneration Committee the committee, which has been approved by the board of Britvic plc for submission to shareholders.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008.
In addition, the committee has followed the principles of good governance set out in the Combined Code and has complied with the requirements of the UKLA Listing Rules.

In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, a resolution will be submitted to the AGM to approve the Directors Remuneration Report.
mEmBErshIp oF rEmunEratIon commIttEE During the year, the committee consisted wholly of independent Non-Executive Directors plus the company Chairman: Bob Ivell Chairman Michael Shallow Ben Gordon Gerald Corbett At the invitation of the Chairman of the committee, the Chief Executive Officer and Human Resources Director attend the meetings of the committee except when their own remuneration is under consideration.
Details of the attendance by Committee Members at committee meetings are shown in the Corporate Governance Report on page 37. composItIon anD tErms oF rEFErEncE The committees composition and terms of reference are in line with the Combined Code and are available on the companys website or on request from the Company Secretary.
While the Chairman of the board is a member of the Remuneration Committee, he is not present when his own remuneration is under discussion.
The committee meets not less than three times a year and has responsibility for: making recommendations to the board on the groups policy on the remuneration of the companys Chief Executive, Chairman, the Executive Directors and other members of the Executive Committee: determining, within agreed terms of reference, the remuneration of the Chairman and the specific remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors and other members of the Executive Committee, including pension rights, any compensation payments and benefits: and determining the level and extent to which awards should be made to the Executive Directors and other members of the Executive Committee under the companys employee share plans.
The committee also ensures compliance with the Combined Code in this respect and takes into consideration the wider pay and employment conditions of the employees across the company.
aDvIsors The committee has appointed an external consultant, Towers Watson, to provide advice on executive compensation issues and performancerelated remuneration.
The company is also advised by Towers Watson on other remuneration-related issues.
The following individuals also provided material advice or services to the committee during the year: Paul Moody Chief Executive : John Gibney Group Finance Director : Doug Frost Human Resources Director : and Michael Mountford Head of Compensation & Benefits.
rEmunEratIon oBjEctIvEs The principal objective of the remuneration policy is to provide market competitive levels of remuneration for the companys senior executives, including incentive arrangements that will reward successful execution of the companys short and long-term strategy.
The committee believes that this requires: the provision of mid-market base salaries and incentive levels for the sector, with appropriate leverage to reward sustained exceptional performance and support the future growth plans of the company: a reward structure that places appropriate emphasis on short-term operating performance and sustained longer-term performance: and competitive incentive arrangements that are underpinned by a balance of operational and long-term performance metrics to provide both a focus on business performance and alignment with returns to the companys shareholders.
rEmunEratIon polIcy anD componEnts oF rEmunEratIon The remuneration policy has been designed to provide market competitive remuneration relative to appropriate peer groups for base salary and incentive opportunity.
The table below outlines the purpose for and performance measures attaching to each element of the package.

The table below shows the current pay mix in place for Executive Directors under both target and maximum performance scenarios.

The committee believes the remuneration policy described above remains appropriate.
rEmunEratIon In practIcE Base salary Salaries are reviewed annually to take account of: individual performance contribution of each Executive Director: the annual salary review budget for the rest of the group: business performance: mid-market data for a peer group of UK-listed companies of similar revenue size and scope to the company: and mid-market data for the few relevant companies in the UK food and beverage sector.
Britvic plc Annual Report 2010 41 Directors Remuneration Report continued Taking into account last years pay freeze and the above factors, the committee has decided that salaries will increase as shown in the table below.

The committee seeks to ensure that variable pay is determined by relevant and stretching measures of performance that are consistent with the strategic objectives and risk profile of the company, in order to align appropriately directors interests with those of shareholders and to engender appropriate risk-based behaviour.
short-tErm IncEntIvE plan The committee has decided to maintain the same target and maximum bonus opportunity for Executive Directors in 2010 11 as applied in 2009 10.
Targets are approved by the committee at the beginning of the year and are aligned to internal targets and strategic business objectives for 2010 11.

The level of option grant and the performance conditions are determined and reviewed by the committee annually.
Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant to the extent that the performance conditions have been satisfied.
For 2010 11, the committee has decided to maintain the same focus on long-term EPS growth as applied in 2009 10 and believes the current performance range remains sufficiently stretching in the context of the current business outlook and growth strategy of the company.

The awards normally vest at the end of the three-year performance period, to the extent that the performance condition is achieved, and lapse to the extent it is not achieved.
For 2010 11, the committee has decided to maintain the focus on long-term relative TSR and ROIC.
The committee believes that maintaining the ROIC performance target provides closer alignment with underlying financial performance than relative TSR growth alone, as well as providing an appropriate balance with the EPS growth targets set under the Executive Share Option Plan.
In particular, the committee believes that ROIC directly aligns pay with an appropriate balance between future investment and capital spending plans and the need to maintain appropriate margins in an uncertain trading environment over the next few years.
Following a review of the calibration of the performance conditions relating to the PSP, the committee believes the TSR target used in previous years, and detailed below, remains appropriate.
The ROIC range for 2010 11 has been updated as shown in the table overleaf.

othEr sharE plans Executive Directors participate in the Britvic Share Incentive Plan, which is an all-employee tax approved share scheme open to GB based employees.
The Plan has 3 parts, all of which the directors participate in: Free share awards are made annually at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The value of the award is discretionary and the maximum is 3% of reckonable earnings, capped at 3,000.
Partnership shares are purchased by employees through payroll deductions of between 5 and 115 per pay period.
Matching shares are provided by the employee to individual purchasing partnership shares on a one for one basis up to a maximum of 75 per pay period.
sharE ownErshIp guIDElInEs To align the interests of Executive Directors and shareholders, share ownership guidelines are in place that require Executive Directors to acquire a shareholding equal to their annual salary within five years from IPO calculated at the IPO share price or from the point of joining Britvic calculated at the share price on the date of joining.
Until this holding is acquired, the Executive Directors may not sell any shares other than to finance the cost of exercising options and any tax liabilities arising from the vesting of long-term incentive plans, unless approved by the committee, for example, in cases of financial hardship.
Both Executive Directors have current share holdings considerably ahead of this requirement as shown in the Directors Shareholdings table on page 47. rEtIrEmEnt BEnEFIts The Executive Directors currently participate in the defined benefit section of the Britvic Pension Plan the Plan and also the Britvic Executive Top Up Scheme, the companys unfunded supplementary retirement benefits scheme.
The normal retirement age for Executive Directors is 60.
Bonus payouts and other incentive awards are not pensionable.
Following a review of pension funding, market trends in pension provision and the recent legislative changes to pension provision and the taxation of pension contributions, the company is in consultation with its employees regarding the closure of the defined benefits section of the Plan for future accruals from the start of the next tax year.
If implemented, from April 2011 the Executive Directors will be eligible to participate in the defined contribution section of the Plan to the extent that this is feasible under any new tax arrangements coming into force in April 2011.
The intended employee contribution rate is 5% of salary for the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director whilst the intended employer contribution rates are 25% of salary for the Group Finance Director and 28% of salary for the Chief Executive.
In the course of the year the committee intends to review pension arrangements to ensure that they remain appropriate taking into account changes to the taxation of pensions.
