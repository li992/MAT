120 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2010 Directors remuneration report Directors remuneration report Non-executive directors of Amoco Corporation Non-executive directors who were formerly non-executive directors of Amoco Corporation have residual entitlements under the Amoco NonEmployee Directors Restricted Stock Plan.
Directors were allocated restricted stock in remuneration for their service on the board of Amoco Corporation prior to its merger with BP in 1998.
On merger, interests in Amoco shares in the plan were converted into interests in BP ADSs.
The restricted stock will vest on the retirement of the non-executive director at the age of 70 or earlier at the discretion of the board.
Since the merger, no further entitlements have accrued to any director under the plan.
The residual interests, as interests in a long-term incentive scheme, are set out in the table below: Date on Interest in BP ADSs which director a b at 1 Jan 2010 reaches age 70 Director leaving the board in 2010 c E B Davis, Jr 4,490 5 August 2014 a No awards were granted and no awards lapsed during the year.
The awards were granted over Amoco stock prior to the merger but their notional weighted average market value at the date of grant applying the subsequent merger ratio of 0.66167 of a BP ADS for every Amoco share was $27.87 per BP ADS.
b For the purposes of the regulations, the date on which the director retires from the board at or after the age of 70 is the end of the qualifying period.
If the director retires prior to this date, the board may waive the restrictions.
