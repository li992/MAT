Section Four: Governance 4 elements of executive directors remuneration Base salary Policy 2010 and 2011 Lower quartile to median The Companys remuneration policy is to set the levels of base salary for the Executive Directors below the median to support a performance based culture.
When determining the base salary of the Executive Directors the Committee takes into consideration: the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity, in particular the lower quartile and median salary levels of those comparable companies within the pharmaceuticals industry andtheComparator Group: the performance of the individual executive director: the individual executive directors experience and responsibilities: and pay and conditions throughout the Group.
The Remuneration Committee has access to information on the pay and conditions of other employees in the Group when determining the remuneration packages for Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee actively considers the relationship between general changes to employees pay and conditions and any proposed changes in the remuneration packages for Executive Directors to ensure it can be sufficiently robust in its determinations in light of the position of the Company as a whole.
