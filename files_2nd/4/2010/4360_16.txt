the second condition is growth in earnings per share eps 12.5% of the option will vest at eps growth of rpi 3% p. a. nil below this : 50% will vest at rpi 5% p. a. : and pro rata between these points.
these performance conditions were chosen by the remuneration Committee in the light of institutional guidelines in order to incentivise the executives to increase shareholder value.
under the 2006 scheme, should the performance conditions not be met, re-testing is not permitted.
the status of both performance conditions on share options outstanding during the year is set out below.
since neither the tsr nor the eps condition for the options granted in november 2006 was met, all of those options granted to participating directors have now lapsed.

they are not normally exercisable before the third anniversary of the date of grant and, in all circumstances, lapse if not exercised within 10 years.
no directors options had their terms and conditions varied during the year.
after the date of approval of this report, the nil-cost options earned in the current year, explained on page 50, will be granted.
there were 5,557,567 options outstanding under all the schemes at the end of the year.
this represents 1.45% of the Companys total issued share capital excluding treasury shares.

pensions entitlements and cash allowances the group operates a two-tier defined benefit pension scheme for senior employees including most of the Companys executive directors, details of which are given on page 59. it is the Companys policy that annual bonuses, payments under the executive bonus scheme and benefits in kind are not pensionable.
prior to 6th april, 2006, the Committee reviewed in detail the impact of the pensions tax regime operating from that date.
it developed a new policy, designed to be neutral in terms of cost compared to existing expenditure on pensions.
this new policy incorporated the removal of the pensionable earnings cap for pension accruing after 6th april, 2006. individual executive directors were affected very differently by these changes and for some it was not tax-efficient to accrue further pension for service from 6th april, 2006. however, it is for individual directors to decide when to opt out of the scheme, in which case a cash allowance is paid.
Cash allowances paid in lieu of pensions are shown on page 49. under the prescribed transitional arrangements, their accrued pension at that date will remain linked to future increases in pensionable earnings and they will continue to be eligible for death in service benefits.
