40 | Alliance Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2010 As an investment company, our priority is to attract and retain investment professionals together with other Directors professionals with the appropriate levels of skill and experience to manage the business.
The salaries that we pay and the total compensation package are balanced to retain Remuneration and attract such individuals, and are structured to ensure that this represents good value to the shareholders by aligning these rewards to the long term success of the Company.
Our Executive Directors compensation packages are detailed on pages 41 to 45.
Variable pay comprises a significant element of potential earnings.
Other senior managers and all of our investment managers also have compensation packages comprising a basic salary set at a level which is competitive in the market and a variable pay element.
The variable pay element incorporates both annual and long-term performance measures.
Our investment managers are eligible for annual bonuses of up to 150% of salary based on achievement of annual performance targets, both for their own portfolio and the wider equity portfolio.
In addition, they are eligible for longterm incentives based on the three-year performance of their own portfolio and achievement by the Company of its corporate targets.
Other senior managers annual bonuses are based on performance against business and individual objectives during the year, with the long-term element based on corporate performance measures.
The Remuneration Committee aims to adopt an approach that supports the Trusts traditional low risk investment philosophy underpinned by the belief that consistent year on year median to upper quartile performance will, over time, translate into long-term upper quartile performance.
In setting the levels of remuneration for the Executive Directors the Remuneration Committee takes account of the levels of remuneration of other employees, particularly at senior level, within the Company.
The Executive Directors remuneration is, however, not set through any formulaic approach or multiple of any other employees engaged within the business.
The Committee has set out the following policies for the reward of its Executive Directors: Base salaries will be set at no more than the market median for jobs of a similar size and complexity.
Variable pay will form a significant proportion of the total package.
Total remuneration base salary plus annual and longterm incentives will reflect Company performance, with the goal of upper quartile remuneration for upper quartile performance.
Benefits will be no more than median.
Differential pension benefits will be taken into consideration in setting the total remuneration package The Companys primary objective is to generate capital growth over the medium to long term accompanied by a rising dividend for shareholders.
