Diageo Annual Report 2010 80 Directors remuneration report Governance Dear Shareholder 77 Diageo faced many tough challenges in the last fiscal year: an unprecedented global economic downturn, unusually volatile markets Board of directors and executive committee and weakening consumer confidence.
The restructuring programme announced in 2009, and the sharp focus on market share gains, innovation and geographic expansion will drive long term growth.
The fiscal 2010 results demonstrate the great resilience of our 80 Directors business, the strong and effective leadership of our management team and the terrific commitment of our global workforce.
remuneration The remuneration committee has striven to ensure that people at all levels are fairly rewarded for achieving their financial and report business targets and for strengthening the companys long term leadership position.
We have been alert to the danger of encouraging 93 short term measures and risk taking, which would be to the detriment of Diageos longer term interests.
Corporate governance report We believe that the remuneration outturn for the last fiscal year fairly and reasonably reflects managements success in dealing with the particularly difficult and volatile conditions in many of our business units and for achieving the impressive financial results 102 Directors described in detail in the Business review.
report Salaries for senior management were frozen in fiscal 2010, as the committee felt that was the responsible approach to take in the context of the economic climate at that time.
During fiscal 2010, the performance shares, which were due to vest in September 2009, lapsed in full upon failing the required total shareholder return TSR metric, and the same outcome will apply for the award due to vest in September 2010.
This outcome, in part, reflects the extreme currency volatility that has followed the global economic downturn and the impact of this on Diageos TSR measured in a common currency of US dollars.
Diageos strong TSR performance against the FTSE 100 can be seen in the graph on page 91 of this report.
The corresponding SESOP share option awards have fully vested upon exceeding the adjusted earnings per share measure.
The annual incentive plan award for 2010, detailed later in this report, reflects the companys resilient annual results, exceeding targets for both profit before exceptional items and tax and net sales, and significantly exceeding targets for free cash flow.
During the year ending 30 June 2011, the committee intends to undertake a review of the performance measures for the Performance Share Plan with a view to broadening the success factors against which management are incentivised and measured in order to enhance the alignment between reward and our medium term strategic goals.
An important factor in this is the extreme currency volatility, referred to above, resulting from the unprecedented devaluation of sterling against the US dollar and euro.
We will consult with our shareholders on any proposed changes to our remuneration plans.
The following report provides further explanation of the current remuneration arrangements and reward outcomes for the performance in the year ended 30 June 2010.
Finally, we plan to submit resolutions in respect of the renewal of two employee share plans for shareholder approval at the companys AGM in October 2010.
Details are included in the Notice of Meeting.
We look forward to receiving your support at the AGM in October 2010.
