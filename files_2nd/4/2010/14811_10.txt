Due to the corporate activity with National Express, in accordance with these rules the Group was restricted both in permitting awards to directors and certain others from vesting and from making new awards to directors and certain others while such activity was ongoing.

In light of the approach adopted for the 2008-09 bonus award, which was awarded wholly in deferred shares under the EPP, the Remuneration Committee considered it appropriate to bring forward the vesting date of the 2007 EPP Award to directors and certain others to permit vesting within the 2009 10 tax year, subject to the requirement for directors to retain the number of released EPP shares until the original due vesting date 28 June 2010.

Due to the corporate activity with National Express, in accordance with these rules the Group was restricted both in permitting awards from vesting and from making new awards while such activity was ongoing.
When that activity formally ceased on 29 October 2009, the Committee decided that vesting of the awards granted on 29 June 2006 should be further delayed until after the Groups interim results had been announced on 9 December 2009.
The LTIP awards granted on 28 June 2007 would in the normal course of events be due to vest on 28 June 2010.
The Remuneration Committee however considered it appropriate to bring forward the vesting date of the award to 31 March 2010, so as to permit vesting within the 2009 10 tax year.
To ensure that Executive Directors do not receive additional remuneration solely as a result of the early vesting, there will be a re-testing of the awards performance condition on the original due vesting date, and the Remuneration Committee will consider whether adjustments should be made if vesting on 28 June 2010 would have delivered a lower or different amount.
