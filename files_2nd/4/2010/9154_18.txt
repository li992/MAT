Overview of executive directors remuneration The remuneration package for executive directors consists of the following elements: salary: annual bonus under the King sher Incentive Scheme KIS including the deferred share award: the long-term incentive under the Performance Share Plan PSP : the Save As You Earn Option Scheme for all employees ShareSave : pension contributions: and non-cash bene ts.
The Committee considers that the total remuneration package links corporate and individual performance with an appropriate balance between shortand long-term elements, and xed and variable components.
Table 1 below shows the breakdown of the remuneration package into its main constituent elements and assumes maximum payment of annual bonus and maximum vesting of PSP deferred shares, the Companys long term incentive plan.

Fixed cash includes basic salary, whilst variable cash is the 67% of annual bonus paid in cash, and the share element includes the 33% of bonus deferred into shares, and the PSP.
The second pie chart shows the proportions of salary, KIS cash bonus and KIS and PSP deferred shares and indicates the total remuneration at risk.
Remuneration Elements split between Fixed & At Risk Elements cash and shares at Stretch of Remuneration at Stretch Fixed Fixed cash 25% 25% Shares At Risk 50% Variable cash 75% 25% Note: the xed elements in the pie charts above include pensions and bene ts.
The Committee believes that the targets set for the different elements of performance-related remuneration are both appropriate and demanding in the context of the business environment and the challenges with which the Group is faced.
The performance-related remuneration constitutes a substantial proportion of the remuneration package, and is at risk, being subject to achievement of performance hurdles, deferral periods during which the individual must remain employed, and uctuations in the market price of shares.
The maximum bonus payable under the KIS is made up of 133% of salary in cash and 67% in deferred forfeitable shares, and the maximum vesting under the PSP is 200% of salary in deferred forfeitable shares.
Accordingly, the maximum awards under the KIS and PSP result in 75% of total remuneration being performance-related.
Components of executive directors remuneration Details of each individual element of the remuneration package are given below.
Base salary Executive salaries are normally revised with effect from 1 August each year, taking into account the prevailing market and economic conditions, affordability, the level of increases awarded to staff generally and the individuals contribution.
In 2009 10 the executive directors requested that, in view of the uncertain economic climate, their annual salary review be deferred pending the outcome of Group trading.
This deferral matched the freeze placed on the basic salaries of the King sher Leadership Group and other senior managers in the Group.
As a consequence Ian Cheshire and Kevin OByrne did not receive an increase in their base salaries during the 2009 10 financial year.
Following the deferral of the pay review from 1 August 2009 to 31 January 2010, the Committee agreed that executive salaries will be reviewed on 31 January each year in future.
The annual base salaries of the executive directors as at 24 March 2010 are 816,000 for Ian Cheshire and 586,500 for Kevin OByrne.
Annual bonus The annual bonus is earned by the achievement of performance targets set by the Committee at the start of each financial year and is delivered under the King sher Incentive Scheme KIS.
The KIS comprises the King sher Cash Incentive Scheme 2003 KIS Cash scheme and the King sher Incentive Share Scheme 2003 KIS Share scheme.
Under these arrangements senior executives may receive a performance-related cash bonus under the KIS Cash scheme, and a contingent share award under the KIS Share scheme deferred shares, in the proportions of 67% of the bonuses earned being payable in cash, and the 33% balance paid in deferred shares.
The deferred shares are normally subject to a three-year holding period before they vest, with the shares being subject to forfeiture should the executive leave King sher during the holding period as a result of voluntary resignation or dismissal for cause.
Participants who are granted deferred shares under the KIS Share scheme are entitled to receive a dividend equivalent payment in the form of additional deferred shares, which is equal to the amount of dividends that would have been earned over the holding period.
These additional shares are subject to the original deferred shares vesting.

The maximum bonus payable is 200% of salary, which remains unchanged from last year.
The executive directors targets for the 2009 10 bonus were based on both corporate and individual objectives and were structured equally between financial and nonfinancial measures, as in the previous year.
In 2009 10, the Committee considered the potential for the global economic weakness to worsen and agreed the two financial measures for the year would be: reduction of Group net debt with the overall aim to achieve selfnancing in the year, and cash generation, together having 50% of the maximum bonus opportunity.
The nonfinancial measures were also amended to uplift the weighting on KPIs to 30% from 20% of the maximum bonus opportunity, and the corresponding reduction in the weighting of personal performance objectives from 30% to 20% of the maximum bonus opportunity.
Group Personal Measure Net Debt Cash ow Performance KPIs Weighting at maximum bonus 25% 25% 20% 30% The nonfinancial measures included corporate key performance indicators KPIs aligned to King shers seven steps to Delivering Value, plus additional targets addressing improvements in internal financial controls and employee engagement, and personal performance.
The outcomes achieved against each measure are summarised below.

The structure of the bonus plan for 2010 11 will remain broadly the same, although the only financial objective will be Group operating cash ow.
Long-term incentive The PSP remains the primary long-term incentive for the top senior executives, which offers a maximum award not exceeding 200% of base salary.
The plan runs over a period of three years and has performance hurdles requiring King shers TSR to exceed median level of TSR measured against the FTSE 100, and adjusted earnings per share EPS.
Relative TSR was considered to remain a valid benchmark as it measures the performance of executives in terms of delivery of shareholder return against that of other businesses.
The Committee chose the FTSE 100 as the comparator group because of the general lack of directly quoted home improvement businesses against which to compare the Companys TSR speci cally.
HNBS independently carries out the relevant TSR calculations for the Committee.
This relative measure is coupled with EPS as a driver for absolute performance.
The TSR and EPS performance targets for all PSP awards for the 2009 10 year were: TSR performance target EPS performance target Percentage of this Percentage of this part of the award 50% EPS at part of the award of performance the end of the of performance 50% TSR at the end of the Performance Period shares that will vest Performance Period shares that will vest Less than median plus 1 percentage point Nil Less than 15.9p Nil Median plus 1 percentage point 15.625% 15.9p 15.625% Between median plus 1 percentage point Straight-line vesting between Between 15.9p Straight-line vesting and upper quintile plus 1 percentage point 15.625% and 100% and 17.0p between 5.625% 50% Upper quintile plus 1 percentage point 100% 17.0p 50% Between 17.0p and 19.6p Straight-line vesting between 50% 100% 19.6p 100% Performance Shares receive a dividend roll-up calculated on the basis of a notional purchase of shares on each relevant ex-dividend date using that days closing mid-market price.
Shares used to satisfy awards under a plan are normally purchased in the market through an employee bene t trust.
Under the KIS Multiplier, awards made in 2006 to Ian Cheshire lapsed during the year as the TSR of the Company over the subsequent three years was below the median of the comparator group.

The details are shown in the section entitled Closed Incentive Plans on page 50.
Pension provision Ian Cheshire is a member of the main fide ned bene t funded arrangement, the King sher Pension Scheme, and subject to the scheme cap.
Following his appointment as Group Chief Executive, Ian Cheshire also receives a 30% Company contribution, on his salary above the pension cap, into fide ned contribution arrangements.
Kevin OByrne commenced after the fide ned bene t section had closed to new members and thus is a member of the fide ned contribution arrangements and receives a Company contribution of 20% of salary.
Share ownership guidelines The Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director are required to build a shareholding in the Company equivalent to 200% of base salary and 100% of base salary respectively.
Kevin OByrne has a five-year period from the date of his appointment as Group Finance Director, on 1 October 2008, to accumulate his threshold shareholding, whilst Ian Cheshire has five years from the date of his appointment as Group Chief Executive, on 24 January 2008, to increase his shareholding in order to meet the new threshold shareholding equal to 200% of base salary.
Shares which have not yet vested under long term incentive plans are not taken into account in applying this test.
Under the Companys formal share ownership guidelines, Ian Cheshire and Kevin OByrne are prohibited from selling shares obtained through the KIS Share scheme and long-term incentive plans including the PSP except to meet tax obligations until they meet this minimum holding.
The Committee believes that this requirement will ensure that executives acquire a signi cant personal interest in King sher shares, effectively aligning executives and shareholders interests and encouraging a long-term view of performance.
As at 29 January 2010, based on that days closing price of 212.3p, Ian Cheshires shareholding of 410,792 shares represented 109% of his basic salary of 800,000 his holding of 375,177 shares at 1 February 2009 represented 99.6% of his basic salary of 800,000 using the 29 January 2010 share price.
Kevin OByrnes shareholding of 112,994 shares represented 41.7% of his basic salary of 575,000 his holding of 112,994 shares at 1 February 2009 represented 41.7% of his basic salary of 575,000 using the 29 January 2010 share price.

These are plans that are now closed and under which no further awards will be made.
The full details of each can be found in previous annual reports.
The outstanding awards are as follows: Executive share options The last grants under the Executive Share Option Scheme were made on 17 April 2003.
The options vest from three to 10 years of the grant date subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition which generally requires the growth in the Companys EPS over a three-year period to have exceeded that of the Retail Price Index RPI plus 6%.
The criteria were set and approved by shareholders when the scheme was established in 1993 and were judged at the time to be appropriate criteria.
On exercise, only the cash equivalent to any gain will be paid and disclosed as remuneration at that time.
2 The performance conditions for all options have been met with the exception of the final grant made on 17 April 2003.
In the period 1 February 2009 to 30 January 2010, the highest and lowest market price for King sher shares was 247.2p and 118p respectively.
The market price at close of business on 30 January 2010 was 212.3p.
Multiplier awards relating to prior year KIS Share awards Bonuses paid under the KIS Shares scheme in April 2005 and 2006 were matched at a ratio of 0.4:1 by a conditional Multiplier award of shares.
Vesting of these awards is subject to the TSR performance of the Company against the constituents of the FTSE100 over the three-year period following the year for which the bonus was earned.
No vesting will occur at or below median performance.
25% of these shares will vest at above median performance, increasing on a straight-line basis to 100% at above upper quartile performance.
In addition, the Committee must also be satis ed that the TSR performance is re ective of underlying Company performance for such awards to vest.
