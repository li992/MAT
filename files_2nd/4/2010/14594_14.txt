Directors Remuneration Report Letter from Russell King, Chairman of the remuneration committee Dear Shareholder As the new chairman of the remuneration committee, I am pleased to present to you the 2010 Directors Remuneration Report of Spectris plc.
A policy of relating pay to the performance of Spectris continues to be a strong principle underlying your committees consideration of executive remuneration.
We aim to ensure that the company continues to attract, motivate and retain high calibre management to deliver the best possible performance for shareholders, commensurate with appropriate risk considerations.
The key elements of the executive directors remuneration arrangements are: base salary and total remuneration set at or modestly below the median of comparable UK quoted companies, subject to adjustment up or down to reflect the experience and performance of individual incumbents: on-target and maximum annual bonus of, respectively, 50% and 100% of salary, only payable on achievement of stretching profit and individual objectives, with any bonus in excess of 60% being applied to the purchase of Spectris shares until a two times base salary shareholding is achieved: Russell King annual awards under the companys performance share plan of up to 125% of salary, Chairman of the remuneration committee with vesting after three years based 50% upon Total Shareholder Return TSR relative to the FTSE 250 index and 50% upon earnings per share EPS growth.
This long-term incentive links individual reward to the continuing growth of the company, with vested share retention until a shareholding of two times base salary is achieved: benefits provided on a market competitive basis.
During 2010 the companys remuneration advisers, Hewitt New Bridge Street, conducted a benchmarking review of directors salaries and fees.
Spectris does not undertake benchmarking on an annual basis, the normal period being every two to three years as recently endorsed in NAPF guidelines.
However, the review scheduled for 1 January 2009 was deferred for two years as a result of the recession.
Salaries and fees for all directors were frozen as at 1 January 2009, a voluntary 7.7% salary cut was implemented for the second half of the year and no profit-related or individual bonuses were awarded.
As of 1 January 2010, salaries were increased by 2% across the board.
It has thus been five years since Hewitt New Bridge Street were last commissioned to undertake a review.
In the interim, the Spectris executive team has produced commendable results.
Adjusted profit before tax rose by 94% during 2010, producing maximum payment under this element of the annual bonus plan.
As can be seen from the TSR graph opposite, Spectris has also outperformed over the longer term.
100 invested in Spectris on 31 December 2005 would have been worth 240 at the end of 2010, compared to the 153 it would have been worth if invested in the FTSE 250 index.
The Hewitt New Bridge Street review concluded that, although the current remuneration structure remained appropriate, the fee payable to the Chairman and the salaries of the executive directors had fallen significantly below market median.
In particular, the Chief Executive had been appointed to his first CEO role in January 2006 on a below market salary with a view to this increasing as he became established, but due to the economic situation that realignment had to date not been possible.
Your committee therefore 42 Spectris plc Annual report and accounts 2010 Highlights Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Total shareholder return 260 Spectris plc 240 FTSE 250 excluding Investment Trusts 220 200 180 160 140 120 100 80 60 31 Dec 05 31 Dec 06 31 Dec 07 31 Dec 08 31 Dec 09 31 Dec 10 The graph above shows the value, at 31 December 2010, of 100 invested in Spectris plc on 31 December 2005 compared with the value of 100 invested in the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts over the same period.

We consider that compensation is now at a competitive level to the external market and that the balance between fixed and variable elements remains appropriate.
We will, however, keep remuneration packages under review to ensure that this remains the case.
I hope that you will support the advisory vote on the 2010 Directors Remuneration Report which will be put to the Annual General Meeting.
