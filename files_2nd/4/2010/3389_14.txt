Business overview Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 37 Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 October 2010 This report sets out the information required by the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008.
The Report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and describes how the Board has applied the principles and complied with the provisions relating to directors remuneration in the 2008 Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
As required by the Regulations, the Directors Remuneration Report will be submitted to shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting on 24 March 2011.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on certain parts of the Directors Remuneration Report and to state whether, in their opinion, those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Accounting Regulations.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for the audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION Remuneration Committee During the year under review the Remuneration Committee comprised: Mr I F R Much Committee Chairman Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss The Rt Hon Lord Freeman Mr P C F Hickson appointed 1 July 2010 The Committees principal responsibilities are: determining, agreeing with the Board and reviewing from time to time the overall policy for the remuneration of the Chairman, the executive directors, the Company Secretary and certain other senior executives in the Group, and their individual remuneration packages and any changes thereto: reviewing the market competitiveness of the remuneration policy and arrangements: overseeing salary levels and remuneration packages for the second and third tiers of management: approving the terms and conditions of employment, and any changes thereto, of the executive directors: approving any compensation payments for executive directors: approving the design of, and determining targets for, any performance-related pay schemes operated by the Group: reviewing the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and the Companys shareholders: providing oversight of potential remuneration-related risks arising across the Group: and overseeing any major changes in employee benefits structures across the Group.
With the exception of Mr Hickson whose remuneration is determined by the Committee, none of the Committee members has any personal financial interest in the matters reserved for the Committee nor do they have any conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships, and they are not involved in the day to day running of the Groups business.
Therefore, they are regarded by the Board as independent.
Mr Hickson does not participate in any discussions regarding his own remuneration.
The Committee met six times during the year.
The Chief Executive attends meetings by invitation but is not present during any discussions relating to his own remuneration.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Companys website or on request from the Company Secretary.
Advisers During the year the Committee received advice on remuneration and incentive plan related matters from Hewitt New Bridge Street.
The Company received no other services from Hewitt New Bridge Street or any other part of Hewitt Associates during the year.
The Committee also received advice from Odgers Berndtson on the remuneration package for the new Chairman during the recruitment process.
The Committee consults internally with the Chief Executive and the Company Secretary.
Remuneration policy for executive directors The Committees policy is to provide executive remuneration packages which are competitive, but not excessive, by reference to market rates across comparator companies, reflect the performance of the business against financial objectives, and which take into account the individual contribution and performance of each executive director.
Remuneration packages comprise the following elements: i base salary and benefits, including pensions: ii annual bonuses linked to the Groups financial performance and personal objectives: and iii awards of share-based incentives linked to the long term growth of the Group.
The Committee aims to align the interests of executive directors with those of shareholders, by ensuring that a significant proportion of remuneration is performance-related.
This is achieved through the performance-related elements of annual bonuses and share-based incentives.
Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2010 38 Corporate governance Directors Remuneration Report continued Key aspects of the remuneration arrangements for the executive directors and changes thereto during the year are summarised below.
Base salary: The Committee had been aware, for some time, that the salaries of the executive directors had not reflected the substantial growth in the Groups revenue, earnings, dividends and market capitalisation in recent years.
It had delayed addressing this anomaly during the initial stages of the economic downturn.
In early 2010, however, following a year of 33% growth in underlying earnings per share, it was evident that the Group was in a position to continue its strong growth in revenue and earnings.
The Committee therefore decided to review the executive directors salaries in the context of the outstanding Group performance and the need to maintain market competitive salary levels.
The Committee also took into account retention issues and the demand for talented executive management with a proven track record in the industry.
Against this background, base salaries for the executive directors were increased by just over 14% with effect from 1 April 2010.
Pension provision: The Committee agreed that with effect from 6 April 2010, the executive directors would cease to participate in the Groups defined benefit pension scheme, and would instead, for all future service, receive a salary supplement of 20% of base salary.
Whilst these levels of contributions have enhanced the short term fixed costs to the Company relative to the existing defined benefit pension arrangements, there is clearly an advantageous and offsetting transfer of investment risk to the individuals.
As a result of these two changes, the overall level of fixed pay for the executive directors was aligned more closely with the median of the market benchmarks used by the Committee benchmarks which take into account both market capitalisation and turnover, and which have therefore increased less for the Group than would have arisen if based solely on market capitalisation.
Annual bonus: Executive directors are now required to receive 40% of any bonus earned in the form of deferred shares an increase from 25% in 2009.
All other key aspects of the bonus scheme remain unchanged, save that in accordance with emerging good practice, clawback provisions have now been introduced into the bonus scheme, which will enable the Company to clawback deferred shares prior to vesting in the event of subsequent discovery of material misstatement of the Companys financial results for the financial year in respect of which the deferred shares were awarded.
Share awards: Following approval by the Groups shareholders of the increase in maximum award levels permissible under the Groups performance share plan at the March 2010 Annual General Meeting, share awards worth at grant up to 125% of base salary were granted to the executive directors during the year.
In accordance with current market norms, and as anticipated at the time of seeking approval for the increased award levels, the normal annual award limit will increase to 150% of base salary for the executive directors from 2011 onwards.
The Committee wishes to ensure that the executive directors are appropriately rewarded for exceptional performance and accordingly, the higher award levels will be subject to even more challenging earnings per share growth targets than those which were applied to the 125% awards made in 2010.
Further details are set out below.
Comparator groups The constituents of the sector-based comparator group utilised by the Committee for remuneration benchmarking purposes during the year were as follows: Charter International plc Melrose PLC Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Chloride Group PLC QinetiQ Group PLC Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Halma p. l. c. Rotork PLC VT Group plc IMI plc Spectris plc The Weir Group PLC Meggitt PLC The Committee also considered general comparator groups based on FTSE250 companies with a similar market capitalisation and turnover.
Base salaries and benefits The executive directors base salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee, and adjustments made, if appropriate, taking into account individual performance and comparable salary levels in the comparator groups set out above.
The Committee refers to published salary surveys and data provided by its remuneration advisers, Hewitt New Bridge Street, and also reviews the remuneration information presented in the annual reports of companies in the comparator groups.
The executive directors current base salaries are as follows: Dr D J Price 480,000 2009: 420,000 Mr P A Rayner 300,000 2009: 262,500 The executive directors base salaries will next be reviewed on 1 April 2011.
The Committee also considers and approves the base salaries for twenty two other senior executives, and reviews salaries for the next two tiers of management at each of the Groups businesses.
In addition, the Committee receives information on general pay levels across the Group.
The Committee therefore has due regard to salary levels across the Group in applying its remuneration policy.
The main taxable benefits for executive directors are fully-expensed company cars and private medical insurance.
Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2010 Business overview Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 39 Annual bonuses During the year under review, the Company operated an annual performance-related bonus plan for the executive directors, with key characteristics as follows: a maximum bonus potential for the executive directors of 100% of base salary: three quarters of the bonus potential linked to two separate financial performance conditions, namely earnings per share and cash flow with equal weighting.
The conditions, which are set by the Committee, take into account a number of factors including budget, market expectations, long term growth prospects and the previous years out-turn.
No bonus is payable for achievement of less than 90% of target, with bonuses being earned thereafter on a straight-line basis up to the maximum for 110% or better achievement of target: one quarter of the bonus potential may be achieved in connection with the satisfaction of personal objective criteria set at the beginning of the financial year.
These comprise a mixture of short term and longer term objectives linked to the delivery of the Companys strategic plan.
No part of this element of bonus is payable unless threshold performance of both the financial conditions described above is achieved.
The personal objectives set for the executive directors during the year were linked to the following strategic objectives: delivery of improvements in the Groups health, safety and environmental performance growth of the Groups order book, and development of key strategic growth opportunities implementation of the expansion plans for the International Division development of key new products and successful competitive strategies completion of new production facilities improved phasing of cashflow generation and management of working capital: 40% of any bonus payable is deferred as a conditional award of the Companys shares, with vesting subject to continued employment save in good leaver scenarios three years from the award of bonus: and the payment of any bonus remains ultimately at the discretion of the Committee.
The table below summarises the bonuses earned by the executive directors, as a percentage of base salary, in respect of the current and last years the figures in brackets are the maximum percentages that could have been achieved: 2010 2009 Bonus percentage received for: D J Price P A Rayner D J Price P A Rayner Earnings per share performance 17.78 37.5 17.78 37.5 35.63 37.5 35.63 37.5 Cash flow performance 24.03 37.5 24.03 37.5 37.5 37.5 37.5 37.5 Achievement of personal objectives 20.0 25.0 19.5 25.0 21.0 25.0 21.25 25.0 Total 61.81 100.0 61.31 100.0 94.13 100.0 94.38 100.0 The Committee continues to set highly challenging bonus targets for the achievement of maximum bonuses.
Despite the outstanding levels of EPS growth and returns to shareholders delivered by the Group in recent years, the executive directors have not received maximum bonuses in any of the last four years as evidenced by the chart below.
Year 2010 2009 2008 2007 1 Growth in underlying EPS 15% 33% 43% 56% Return to shareholders in year -5% 70% -23% 41% Executive D J Price P A Rayner D J Price P A Rayner D J Price P A Rayner D J Price P A Rayner Maximum bonus potential % of salary 100% 100% 60% 60% Bonus paid % of salary 61.81% 61.31% 94.13% 94.38% 52.1% 54.3% 46.1% 44.6% 1 Source: Statutory accounts for the years ended 31 October 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007 The basic structure of the bonus scheme will remain unchanged for the current financial year, namely with a maximum bonus potential of 100% of base salary, with 40% of any bonus satisfied by the award of deferred shares.
However, clawback provisions have now been introduced into the bonus scheme, which will enable the Company to clawback the deferred shares prior to vesting in the event of subsequent discovery of material misstatement of the Companys financial results for the financial year in respect of which the deferred shares were awarded.
Bonuses will continue to be determined by a mixture of earnings per share, cash flow and personal objectives.
Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2010 40 Corporate governance Directors Remuneration Report continued Long term incentives Performance share plan The Company operates the Chemring Group Performance Share Plan for the executive directors and other key members of the senior management team who influence the performance and prospects of the Group.
The key features of the plan are currently as follows: conditional awards can be made of the Companys shares worth no more than 150% of base salary each year under normal circumstances: awards will vest three years after grant subject to the extent to which a demanding performance condition has been achieved over a single three year performance period with no ability to re-test the performance condition.
The performance condition is based on the growth of the Companys earnings per share in excess of RPI over three consecutive financial years.
The Committee considers an earnings per share condition to most closely align the interests of participants with those of the Companys shareholders: the vesting schedules for awards granted to date are as follows: Total earnings per share growth per annum not compounded over three financial years Threshold vesting Full vesting Awards made prior to 23 January 2007 RPI 5% 33% vests RPI 15% Awards made on 24 January 2007 RPI 7.5% 33% vests RPI 20% Awards made on or after 23 January 2008 RPI 10% 25% vests RPI 30% RPI 10% 25% vests for awards RPI 25% for awards up to 100% of base salary up to 100% of base salary Awards made on or after 20 January 2010 RPI 25% for any additional RPI 30% for awards awards over 100% of base salary up to 125% of base salary For awards of up to 125% of base salary, 100% will vest at RPI 25%, with the additional 25% vesting on a straight-line basis between RPI 25% and RPI 30% No shares vest for growth below the threshold vesting target.
Vesting is calculated on a straight-line basis for growth between the threshold and full vesting targets: earnings per share is calculated on a fully diluted and normalised basis, as specified by the Committee prior to grant: and market purchase shares or new issue shares including treasury shares may be used to satisfy awards.
To the extent that new issue shares or treasury shares are used, these will count towards the usual share usage dilution limits 10% in ten years for all schemes and 5% in ten years for discretionary executive schemes.
Participation in the plan is extended at the discretion of the Committee to the executive directors and senior management of the Group, both in the UK and overseas.
The following awards were made under the plan during the year: Total number of Number of participants Date of award shares awarded receiving awards 20 January 2010 105,693 31 18 March 2010 5,115 2 Total 110,808 33 Details of the awards made to executive directors during the year are set out on pages 38 and 39.
Clawback provisions will apply to all awards under the plan from 2011 onwards, which will enable the Company to clawback awards prior to vesting in the event of subsequent discovery of material misstatement of the Companys financial results, and after having first clawed back any unvested deferred shares awarded as part of the annual bonus for the financial year in which the results were misstated.
In considering the performance condition for awards which will be made in 2011, the Committee has acknowledged the continuing strong prospects for the Group, whilst recognising that defence budgets around the world may still come under pressure in the next few years.
As a consequence, it is intended that the target for full vesting of awards worth up to 100% of salary will be maintained at RPI 25%.
Higher target growth of up to RPI 35% will be required for full vesting of any award made above the 100% of base salary limit.
This will continue the Committees policy of setting highly challenging performance targets, which align the interests of shareholders and the executive management, whilst rewarding the management in the event of outstanding performance.
The following vesting schedule will therefore apply for awards made in 2011: Total earnings per share growth per annum not compounded over three financial years Value of award that will vest Less than RPI 10% Nil RPI 10% 25% of base salary RPI 25% 100% of base salary RPI 25% up to RPI 35% 100% to 150% of base salary Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2010 Business overview Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 41 These targets remain among the most demanding performance criteria anywhere and reflect the Committees ongoing commitment to setting appropriately challenging targets for executives to pursue.
The Committee reviews, from time to time, the basis of the performance condition but continues to believe that the earnings per share metric mostly closely aligns the interests of executives and shareholders, and therefore remains an appropriate metric for the Group.
During the year under review, the Company purchased 126,880 2009: 78,301 treasury shares at a cost of 3.9 million for use in the plan.
100,011 shares were transferred from treasury to participants in the plan during the year on vesting of the awards made on 27 September 2006 and 24 January 2007.
The executive directors are expected to build-up, over a five year period following appointment, and maintain a shareholding in the Company equivalent to one years base salary.
Both of the executive directors currently hold shares significantly in excess of this requirement.
Other participants in the plan are expected to retain a shareholding equivalent to up to 50% of their base salary following vesting of the awards.
Other schemes The Company operates all-employee savings-related share schemes in the UK the Chemring Group 2008 Sharesave Plan and the USA the Chemring Group 2008 US Stock Purchase Plan.
There are no performance criteria for these arrangements, and options are issued to all participants in accordance with UK HM Revenue and Customs and US Internal Revenue Service regulations.
The Company complies with the dilution guidelines contained within Executive Remuneration ABI Guidelines on Policies and Practices.
At 31 October 2010, awards outstanding and issued under all share schemes during the previous ten years amounted to 2.98% of the ordinary share capital of the Company.
At 31 October 2010, awards outstanding and issued under executive share schemes during the previous ten years amounted to 2.65% of the ordinary share capital of the Company.
Performance graph The following graph shows a comparison of the Companys total shareholder return TSR over the last five financial years against a broad equity market index, as required by the Regulations.
The FTSE 250 Index has been selected by the Committee for this comparison because it provides the most appropriate measure of performance of listed companies of a similar size to the Company.
Total shareholder return Chemring Group PLC Source: Thomson Reuters FTSE 250 Index 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 31 Oct 05 31 Oct 06 31 Oct 07 31 Oct 08 31 Oct 09 31 Oct 10 This graph shows the value, by 31 October 2010, of 100 invested in Chemring Group PLC on 31 October 2005 compared with the value of 100 invested in the FTSE 250 Index.
The other points plotted are the values at intervening financial year ends.
Pensions Dr Price was a member of the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme the Staff Scheme until 6 April 2010.
This is an approved final salary scheme, which is contracted out of the State Second Pension, and which provides, at retirement, a pension of up to two-thirds of salary, subject to Inland Revenue limits.
The Staff Scheme also provides life assurance cover, dependants pensions and lump sum payments on death-in-service.
Members of the Staff Scheme are required to make monthly contributions to the scheme at the rate of 8% of pensionable salary.
Dr Prices pension under the Staff Scheme accrued at 1 80th of final pensionable salary for each year of membership, and he also accrued a cash lump sum at 3 80ths of final pensionable salary for each year of membership.
Dr Price was subject to an earnings cap equivalent to the cap applied by HM Revenue and Customs prior to April 2006 in respect of his membership of the Staff Scheme.
Mr Rayner was also a member of the Staff Scheme until 6 April 2010.
Mr Rayners benefits under the Staff Scheme accrued in an identical manner to that in which Dr Price accrued benefits, as set out above, save that Mr Rayner was not contracted out of the State Second Pension.
Mr Rayner was also subject to an earnings cap.
Both Dr Price and Mr Rayner have a normal retirement age of 65.
Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2010 Value 42 Corporate governance Directors Remuneration Report continued The Committee has previously referred to the fact that the pension arrangements for the executive directors under the Staff Scheme 1 80ths accrual rate only as far as the notional earnings cap were well below market norms, and as explained above, in recent years this was a contributory factor in the relatively low level of their overall fixed pay.
The Committee therefore agreed that with effect from 6 April 2010, the executive directors would cease to participate in the Staff Scheme, and would instead, for all future service, receive a salary supplement of 20% of base salary.
Service contracts Dr Price has a rolling service contract dated 4 April 2005.
This provides for termination by either party on twelve months notice.
The Company may however terminate without notice, and make a payment in lieu of notice equal to the sum of the salary due for the unexpired notice period plus the fair value of any contractual benefits.
Any such sum may be paid in instalments, and in these circumstances there is a requirement to mitigate loss.
Mr Rayner has a rolling service contract dated 27 August 1999.
The Company may however terminate without notice and make a payment in lieu of notice equal to the sum of twelve months salary plus the value of any contractual benefits.
There are no other provisions relating to compensation on early termination.
It is the Committees general policy that all new executive directors appointed in the future will have service contracts with the Company which are terminable on a maximum of twelve months notice.
The service contracts will contain provisions permitting the Company to make any termination payments by instalments, and will require directors to mitigate their loss in such circumstances.
Policy on outside appointments With the specific approval of the Board in each case, executive directors may accept external appointments as non-executive directors of other companies, provided that they do not detract from their responsibilities to the Group, and may retain any related fees paid to them.
Neither of the executive directors currently holds any such external appointments.
Non-executive directors Mr Hickson was appointed as a non-executive director on 1 July 2010, and as Chairman on 1 October 2010.
This followed an extensive and full external search by the Nomination Committee, chaired by the Senior Independent Director.
Mr Hicksons letter of appointment provides for a three year appointment at a fixed fee of 170,000 per annum.
The appointment may be terminated on six months notice by either party.
It is anticipated that Mr Hickson will devote four to five days each month to his role, subject to the overriding requirement that he allocates sufficient time to the role as is reasonably necessary for the proper performance of his duties.
Ahead of Mr Hicksons appointment as Chairman, both the Remuneration Committee and the Nomination Committee reviewed fee levels for Chairmen in comparable companies and consulted with advisers on the appropriate level of fees for the role.
Mr Scobie had a service contract with the Company which expired at the conclusion of the Companys Annual General Meeting in March 2010.
Whilst the Company undertook a search for his successor, his contract was extended on a rolling basis.
Mr Scobies remuneration under the contract, part of which was paid to his company for consultancy services, was 145,000 per annum.
Following his retirement as Chairman, the Board approved a payment of 50,000 to Mr Scobie, partly to reflect the fact that the Company did not make a payment in lieu of notice under Mr Scobies contract but principally in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the Group during his thirteen year tenure.
The other non-executive directors are all appointed for three year terms under letters of appointment covering, amongst other items, their terms of appointment and expected time commitment.
The appointments may be terminated earlier by and at the discretion of either party upon three months written notice.
The Rt Hon Lord Freeman is currently serving his second three year term as a non-executive director, which will expire on 25 May 2012.
Mr Evans current three year appointment as a non-executive director will terminate on 30 March 2012.
Mr Much and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss have both now served two three year terms, which expired on 30 November 2010 and 30 April 2010 respectively.
Their appointments were extended on a rolling basis pending the appointment of the new Chairman, to ensure a smooth transition.
They will be reviewed during the forthcoming year.
The basic fee payable to each of the four non-executive directors is 44,000 per annum.
The Rt Hon Lord Freeman and Mr Much each receive an additional fee of 8,000 per annum, in respect of their Chairmanship of the Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee respectively.
Mr Much also serves as the Senior Independent Director but he receives no additional fee for this role.
Fees for the non-executive directors are determined annually by the Board, having regard to the practice of other companies and the particular demands of the Group.
The Company provides private medical insurance for Mr Evans, Mr Hickson and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss, and their respective spouses.
The non-executive directors do not participate in the Companys pension, bonus or share-based incentive schemes.
However, Mr Evans does receive a pension from the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme, which he accrued during his former employment with the Company.
