Directors remuneration report Dear Shareholder In 2010 the Ladbrokes business underwent significant operational change.
The recruitment of a new Chief Executive with the ambition to restore Ladbrokes to a position of leadership within the industry led to a strategic review which included a restructuring of the management team to support the new business priorities.
In parallel the Remuneration Committee the Committee reviewed the remuneration arrangements across the organisation.
Our goal was to take a fresh look at the basis on which we set fixed and variable pay.
We wanted to ensure pay policy was aligned with Ladbrokes new strategic objectives and that a competitive base pay regime was complemented by performance pay that handsomely rewarded exceptional performance but did not over pay for average outcomes.
The result is a new pay framework in which annual cash potentials have been moderated: award levels under the annual bonus have been reduced: one third of the annual bonus must be deferred into shares for a period of three years and pension and company car costs have been contained.
We have kept performance share awards, but introduced lower levels of grants and required the Chief Executive to grade individual contributions to the strategic development of the Company when setting proposed award levels.
As time progresses we expect to see differentiation in grant levels whilst maintaining demanding vesting criteria based on relative Total Shareholder Return performance and stretching Earnings Per Share growth targets.
The centrepiece is the introduction of the one-off Ladbrokes Growth Plan.
Participants have to hold significant personal investments in Ladbrokes shares to qualify.
They receive up to four times that holding in matched shares but performance conditions are truly demanding.
Performance is measured over a five year period.
No shares vest until the share price reaches 2.00 at which only 25% of the shares are allocated.
Maximum vesting will only occur if a share price of 2.97 is achieved.
This creates real value for employees, but only if they have created between 400 million and 1.3 billion of shareholder value.
We are committed to transparent reporting of remuneration arrangements and do not believe the proposed arrangements raise environmental, social or governance issues or inadvertently motivate irresponsible behaviours.
Further details of all the changes to Ladbrokes remuneration arrangements are provided within this report.
The Committee appreciates all feedback from shareholders and hopes to receive your support at the forthcoming AGM.
Christopher J Rodrigues Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Remuneration Committee remit, composition and activities The Ladbrokes Board entrusts the Committee with the responsibility for remuneration policy in respect of the executive directors and senior executives.
In setting the remuneration for these groups, the Committee takes into account the pay and conditions of the wider workforce as a matter of course.

In forming the remuneration policy, the best practice provisions set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code have been followed and the Guidelines issued by the Association of British Insurers ABI and the National Association of Pension Funds NAPF have been noted.
During 2010 the Committee, amongst other items, considered the following: remuneration arrangements for the new Chief Executive: design and approval of the Ladbrokes Growth Plan: base salary and pension review for executive directors: and review of the structure, quantum and calibration of the annual bonus and performance share plans for 2011 onwards.
Remuneration policy The principles that guided the remuneration review were that the compensation arrangements should: be aligned with and support the business strategy: enable the Company to attract, retain and motivate key individuals: and be strongly aligned with shareholder value creation.

Remuneration mix In support of the remuneration philosophy, the mixture of fixed and variable reward is heavily weighted towards the performance related elements.
In particular, there is an emphasis on long term share based incentives i. e. the Performance Share Plan and Ladbrokes Growth Plan.
The mixture of fixed and variable remuneration is broken down as follows: at target performance 35% is fixed and 65% is variable remuneration: and at maximum performance 15% is fixed and 85% is variable remuneration.
For the purposes of the analysis above, fixed remuneration represents base salary but excludes pension or cash equivalent and benefits.
Variable remuneration represents annual bonus, Performance Share Plan and Ladbrokes Growth Plan awards on an annualised basis.
