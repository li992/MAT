DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Dear Shareholder During the year the Remuneration Committee has focused upon ensuring that in difficult economic conditions, executive and senior management remuneration remains aligned with the achievement of sustained performance for shareholders.
No salary increases were awarded in 2009 10 and no annual bonuses were paid in 2009 10.
Reflecting the difficulty in setting annual performance targets in this environment, the Remuneration Committee introduced a relative earnings measure in the annual bonus plan for 2009 10 to ensure that maximum bonus levels would only be achieved if both absolute earnings targets and relative earnings targets compared to the results of competitors were met in full.
In addition, an exceptional Restricted Share Plan award was made in 2009 to maintain executive focus on short-term actions that are expected to have longer-term benefits to the business.
During the year the Remuneration Committee kept under close review the performance of Burberry against the financial and total shareholder return targets in the annual bonus plan, the Restricted Share Plan and Exceptional Performance Share Plan.
The Remuneration Committee intend to keep this under review in 2010 11 given the need to ensure the retention and motivation of a valued, high-performing executive team, and to maintain a fair reward to both shareholders and employees.
The Remuneration Committee has recently agreed to the re-introduction of the grant of free share awards to all employees, whether based in the UK or overseas.
We believe that this will encourage share ownership as well as giving all employees a stake in the success of Burberry.
David Tyler Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Directors Remuneration Report This report has been prepared on behalf of the Board by the Remuneration Committee.
It has been prepared in accordance with the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 the Regulations issued under the Companies Act 2006 the Act and meets the relevant requirements of the Financial Services Authoritys Listing Rules.
The Remuneration Committee The following directors served as members of the Remuneration Committee the Committee throughout the financial year ending 31 March 2010: David Tyler Chairman Philip Bowman Ian Carter Stephanie George John Peace John Smith was appointed a member of the Committee on 2 February 2010.
The Committee is responsible for setting the remuneration of the executive directors and the Chairman of the Board and monitors the level and structure of senior executive pay.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is a matter for the Board as a whole.
No director is involved in any discussions as to his her own remuneration.
During the year under review, the Committee met four times.
Details of attendance at those meetings is set out in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 65 to 69.
At the invitation of the Committee, except where their own remuneration was being discussed, Angela Ahrendts Chief Executive Officer, Reg Sindall Executive Vice President Corporate Resources and Michael Mahony Senior Vice President Commercial Affairs and General Counsel attended Committee meetings during the period under review and provided advice that materially assisted the Committee.
The Committee has appointed Kepler Associates Kepler to assist with its considerations.
Kepler provide advice on the ongoing operation of employee and executive share plans together with advice on executive remuneration: they do not provide any other services to the Company.
In addition, advice has been provided during the year by Towers Watson.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Groups website www.
70 Burberry Group plc annual report 2009 10 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Remuneration policy The Committee believes the Groups remuneration should be competitive and strongly linked to performance, taking into account the global markets in which it operates.
The Groups remuneration policy is based on the following principles: Remuneration should be closely aligned with shareholders interests through thoughtful selection of performance measures, emphasis on variable pay and delivery of remuneration in shares, some of which are expected to be retained in accordance with the Groups shareholding policy The overall remuneration framework should provide a balance between short and long-term business objectives.
Variable pay for executive directors includes 1 an annual cash bonus based on profit before tax PBT, and 2 long-term share-based incentives linked primarily to increases in shareholder value and growth in profit.
Furthermore, the Burberry Co-Investment Plan the CoInvestment Plan encourages executive directors and other senior executives to invest their annual cash bonus into shares over a further three-year period Total remuneration should be sufficient to attract, motivate and retain exceptional talent within the global luxury brands sector.
Total remuneration for executive directors and other senior executives is therefore benchmarked against Burberrys main global competitors and comparable UK companies.
The Committee recognises that for each executive the relative importance of each of these benchmarks may be different.
Benefits are based on competitive market practice for each executive, depending on individual circumstances The Committee reviews the Groups remuneration policy on a regular basis, taking into account the performance and growth of the business and the global luxury goods sector.
The Committee also considers the Groups policy against regulatory developments, shareholder expectations and market practice.
During the year the Committee considered the key elements of remuneration policy for all employees worldwide, including the invitation to participate in the Sharesave Scheme and the reintroduction and grant of free shares awards.
Performance graph The following graph shows the Total Shareholder Return TSR for Burberry Group plc compared to the companies in the FTSE 100 Index assuming 100 was invested on 31 March 2005.
Burberry became a member of the FTSE 100 Index on 10 September 2009 and prior to that had a market capitalisation close to that of companies at the lower end of the FTSE 100 Index.
Value of 100 invested on 31 March 2005 Burberry FTSE 100 200 150 100 50 0 March 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Burberry Group plc annual report 2009 10 71 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Elements of remuneration Remuneration is structured such that for executive directors and other senior executives, performance-related elements represent the majority of total potential remuneration.
The Group implements its remuneration policy through the provision of the following elements: Base salary The Group aims to provide salaries which are competitive with those of comparable roles at global companies of a similar size and global reach within the luxury goods sector and to a lesser extent comparable UK companies.
These companies are representative of Burberrys competitors for executive talent.
When making salary determinations, the Committee takes into account not only competitive information but also each executives individual performance and overall contribution to the business during the year.
Annual bonus Each year the Committee sets bonus targets by reference to internal and external expectations.
Bonuses are currently based on profitability and performance against Group strategic and individual objectives and overall contribution to the business.
The Committee believes that linking incentives to profitability helps to reinforce the Groups strategy and long-term growth objectives.
Targets are rigorously calibrated by Kepler using benchmarks that include broker earnings estimates for Burberry and its competitors, targets for profitability consistent with median upper quartile shareholder returns, latest projections for the then current year, budget, strategic plan, long-term financial goals, etc.
Actual bonus awards are subject to the discretion of the Committee.
Share schemes and long-term incentive arrangements The Group has a number of share schemes and long-term incentive arrangements in place: The Burberry Co-Investment Plan the Co-Investment Plan The Burberry Exceptional Performance Share Plan the EPP The Burberry Senior Executive Restricted Share Plan 2004 the RSP The Burberry Executive Share Option Scheme 2002 the Executive Share Option Scheme The Burberry Approved Savings-Related Share Option Scheme the Sharesave Scheme Further information regarding these schemes can be found on pages 75 to 78 and also in note 26.

To facilitate this, executive directors and other senior executives may, at the invitation of the Committee, defer receipt of all or part of their annual bonus and invest it in Burberry shares, with up to a 2:1 match based on Group performance during the year.
The Matching Share awards do not vest for three years and are forfeited if the executive leaves due to resignation within that period.
To further link pay and performance, and to align remuneration with shareholders interests, the vesting of Matching Share awards granted after 31 March 2009 will be subject to the achievement of secondary performance conditions linked to growth in profit before tax.
No awards were made under the Co-Investment Plan during the financial year to 31 March 2010.
The interests of the executive directors in share awards granted under this scheme as at 31 March 2010 were as follows.
2 The Matching Share awards are awarded on a gross basis and are taxed at the point of exercise.
3 The market value of Burberry shares on the date of exercise 2 March 2010 was 637p.

Burberry Group plc annual report 2009 10 75 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED The Burberry Exceptional Performance Share Plan the EPP The EPP is a one-off long-term incentive plan introduced in 2007, the purpose of which was to incentivise senior management to achieve stretching goals and to help provide exceptional reward for exceptional performance.
Awards granted under the EPP are based 50% on relative Total Shareholder Return TSR performance and 50% on growth in profits over the three and four-year performance periods to 2010 and 2011.
Awards do not vest unless Burberrys TSR exceeds the median of the comparator group or growth in profit before tax PBT exceeds 50% over the four-year performance period to 2010 or 75% over the five-year performance period to 2011.
For the performance period to 2010, maximum vesting requires Burberrys TSR to outperform the median of its peers by at least 8% p. a. and would require PBT growth of at least 75%.
For the performance period to 2011, maximum vesting requires Burberrys TSR to outperform the median of its peers by at least 7% p. a. and would require PBT growth of at least 100%.
Of the shares which vest based on the achievement of the performance conditions, 50% vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant based on performance to 2010 and the remaining 50% vest on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant based on performance to 2011.
The TSR group for this award comprised Bulgari, Coach, Compagnie Financire Richemont, Este Lauder, Fossil, Geox, Herms International, Hugo Boss, Inditex, Liz Claiborne, Luxottica Group, LVMH Mot Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Nike, Nordstrom, Polo Ralph Lauren, PPR, Saks, Swatch, Tiffany & Co, and Tods.
The interests of the executive directors in ordinary shares subject to awards under this plan as at 31 March 2010 were as follows: 1 Number of ordinary shares Vesting period As at Lapsed Exercised As at Date of 31 March during the during the 31 March grant 2009 year year 2010 From To Expiry date Angela Ahrendts 26 07 2007 850,000 850,000 26 07 2010 26 07 2011 25 07 2012 Stacey Cartwright 26 07 2007 350,000 350,000 26 07 2010 26 07 2011 25 07 2012 1 Subject to performance testing The Burberry Senior Executive Restricted Share Plan 2004 the RSP Under the RSP which was introduced in 2004, executives may be awarded shares up to a maximum value of two times base salary.
The vesting of awards granted under the RSP is based 50% on Burberrys three-year Total Shareholder Return TSR relative to its peers and 50% on three-year growth in profit before tax PBT.
Awards granted between 2004 and 2007 vest in full only if Burberry achieves at least upper quartile TSR relative to its global peers and at least 15% per annum PBT growth.
A proportion of an award 12.5% may vest if TSR performance exceeds the median of the peer group or if PBT growth exceeds 5% per annum over three years.
Of the shares which meet the performance criteria, 50% vests after three years.
The remaining 50% vests in two equal tranches on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant.
Awards granted in 2009 will vest in full only if Burberry achieves at least upper quartile TSR relative to its global peers and at least 10% per annum PBT growth.
A proportion of an award 12.5% may vest if TSR performance exceeds the median of the peer group or if PBT growth exceeds 3% per annum over three years.
The Committee believes that these performance conditions were as challenging, given the significant changes in the economic environment, as those set when the RSP was adopted in 2004.
The Committee chose TSR relative to a group of Burberrys peers because it felt that this is an objective measure of the Groups success and aligns with shareholder interests.
Growth in PBT was chosen as it continues to be the primary measure used by management and the Committee believes strong growth in pre-tax profit is key to delivering superior shareholder returns.
The TSR group for awards granted in 2009 and 2007 comprised Bulgari, Coach, Compagnie Financire Richemont, Este Lauder, Fossil, Geox, Herms International, Hugo Boss, Inditex, Liz Claiborne, Luxottica Group, LVMH Mot Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Nike, Nordstrom, Polo Ralph Lauren, PPR, Saks, Swatch, Tiffany & Co, and Tods.
In 2006, the peer group included Christian Dior, IT Holding, Movado and Waterford Wedgewood, following review by the Committee, these companies were replaced by Geox, Inditex, Luxottica Group and Nike in 2007.
In 2004 and 2005, the peer group included Barneys New York, Neiman-Marcus and Tommy Hilfiger.
When those companies ceased to be listed, Estee Lauder, Fossil, Liz Claiborne and Nordstrom were added to the peer group in 2006.

Burberry Group plc annual report 2009 10 77 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED The Burberry Approved Savings-Related Share Option Scheme the Sharesave Scheme In order to encourage employee share ownership at all levels, the Group offers a Sharesave Scheme.
The Sharesave Scheme offers executive directors and eligible employees an opportunity to enter into a long-term savings contract to save a portion of their salary which can be used to purchase Burberry shares at up to a 20% discount to the market price at the date of invitation.
Where it is not possible to offer a Sharesave Scheme in countries due to regulatory issues, or where the number of employees based in that country would make its introduction financially unviable, the Group offers a cash-based scheme as an alternative.
The interests of the executive directors in options granted under the Sharesave Scheme are shown in the table below: Number of ordinary shares Exercise period As at Granted Lapsed Exercised As at Date of 31 March during the during the during the 31 March Exercise grant 2009 year year year 2010 price p From To 1 Angela Ahrendts 23 06 2006 2,667 2,667 350.5 01 09 2009 28 02 2010 2 Stacey Cartwright 23 06 2006 2,667 2,667 350.5 01 09 2009 28 02 2010 30 06 2009 2,827 2,827 321.0 01 09 2012 28 02 2013 1 The market value of Burberry shares on the date of exercise 8 December 2009 was 564p.

3 The market value of Burberry shares on the date of grant 30 June 2009 was 423p.
Dilution limits The Groups share schemes contain limits that govern the quantum of awards that may be granted and the amount of newly issued shares that may be used to satisfy such awards.
These limits are in line with the guidance of the Association of British Insurers in that no more than 10% of the Groups issued share capital may be allocated under the Groups relevant schemes over a rolling ten-year period.
Shareholding policy The Committee believes that share ownership provides an effective way to align the interests of executives with those of shareholders.
The Group introduced a Shareholding Policy in 2007.
Certain senior executives are expected to achieve an interest in Burberry shares equivalent to at least one times base salary over the five-year period to 2012.
Executives are expected to retain a proportion of the shares acquired on the exercise of options and awards until such guidelines are met.
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are expected to hold an interest in shares with a value equivalent to at least three times and one and a half times base salary respectively by 2012.
As at 31 March 2010, both the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have complied with the policy.
As part of the Groups Shareholding Policy, the Chairman and non-executive directors are expected to acquire shares with a market value of a minimum of 6,000 for each year of their appointment.
The Chairman and non-executive directors have complied with this policy.
Gains made by directors on share options and awards The table below shows notional gains made by individual directors from the exercise of share options and awards during the year to 31 March 2010.
The gains are calculated by reference to the market value of Burberrys shares on the date of exercise.
Number of ordinary shares Notional gain in the year to Exercised Retained as at 31 March 2010 during the year 31 March 2010 000 Angela Ahrendts 441,688 214,444 2,759 Stacey Cartwright 555,868 257,432 2,574 The changes to the personal tax regime in the United Kingdom in April 2010 created a significantly different tax position for the executive directors.
The Company therefore brought forward the vesting of certain share awards which vest in 2010 in respect of which no further performance tests needed to be satisfied.
The cost to the Company was minimal.
