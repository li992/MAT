Remuneration Report Members Richard Stone Chairman Geoff Unwin Stephen Pettit Jane Aikman Remuneration Committee Report The Committee makes recommendations to the Board on the framework for executive Directors and senior executives remuneration based on proposals formulated by the Chief Executive.
Responsibilities determining and agreeing with the Board the policy and framework for the remuneration of the Chief Executive, the executive Directors, the Company Secretary and such other members of the executive management as it is designated to consider: approving the design of, and determining targets for, any performance-related pay plans operated by the Company and agreeing the total annual payments made under such plans: reviewing the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and shareholders, and determining, each year, whether awards will be made, and if so, the overall amount of such awards, the individual awards to executive Directors and other senior executives and the performance targets to be set: and determining the policy for, and scope of, pension arrangements for each executive Director and other senior executives.
The Committee also monitors and considers, with the Chief Executive, the framework of remuneration for subsidiary chief executives and directors and ensures a consistent approach is applied.
The full terms of reference, which remain unchanged from the prior year, can be found on the Companys website or can be obtained from the Company Secretary.
Governance The Remuneration Committee, which meets at least twice per year, was in place throughout the financial year.
All members are independent in accordance with provision A.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest other than as shareholders, conflicts of interests arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board.
No Director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
In determining the Directors remuneration for the year, the Committee consults Andrew Williams Chief Executive on his proposals and relates the proposals to remuneration packages at comparable listed companies.
The Committee consults Watson Wyatt Limited regarding the structuring of executive remuneration packages and reviews other external published material.
Independent pension advice is provided to the Company by Lane, Clark & Peacock LLP.
During the year attendance by Committee members at meetings was as follows: Name Attendance Richard Stone Chairman 4 of 4 Geoff Unwin 4 of 4 Stephen Pettit 4 of 4 Jane Aikman 4 of 4 Activities During 2009 10, the Committee continued to review the Companys remuneration strategy such that executives remain appropriately incentivised to meet the Groups objectives in the prevailing economic conditions.
That strategy relies upon three key components which produce an appropriate balance between fixed and variable pay over the short and long term: setting salaries close to median levels: a performance related bonus scheme, as described below, tying bonuses to a weighted average increase in economic value added: and a long-term equity-based incentive with entry and exit performance hurdles.
Accordingly the Committee agreed that: executive base salaries for 2009 10 should be held at 2008 09 levels for the full year after an interim review of the Groups performance for the first six months of 2009 10: executive base salaries for 2010 11 should be increased by an average of 3.5%: the annual targets on the granting of performance shares were set appropriately: and the award of bonuses in respect of 2009 10 should only be based on objective measures and be related to the Companys performance.
The Committee has reviewed the Remuneration Report for 2009 10 and the Companys remuneration strategy, policy and details of executive remuneration follow.
On behalf on the Remuneration Committee Richard Stone Chairman 22 June 2010 Halma p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2010 57 Remuneration Report continued Report on Remuneration Strategy and Policy Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to directors remuneration in the Combined Code.
As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on certain parts of the Directors Remuneration Report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Accounting Regulations.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information Remuneration policy Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, retain and motivate executives of the high calibre needed to manage the Group successfully and align their interests with those of the shareholders by rewarding them for enhancing value to shareholders.
The performance measurement of the executive Directors and key members of senior management and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the Committee.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for executive Directors and senior management: Element Purpose Operation Salary To provide competitive fixed remuneration that Reviewed every 12 months.

ROTIC 50% targets over a three-year period.
Retain key individuals and align interests Maximum awards range from 100% to 140% with shareholders.
Pension To provide competitive post-retirement benefits.
Executives may participate in either a Group defined benefit pension plan, Group defined contribution pension plan or the US 401k money purchase arrangement.
Cash supplements in lieu of Company pension contributions are made to some individuals.
The Companys policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive Directors should be performancerelated.
As described below, executive Directors may earn annual bonus payments of up to 100% of their basic salary together with the benefits of participation in share plans which are subject to a maximum value, in the year of grant, of 140% of basic salary.
Each executive Director currently holds shares in the Company in excess of the guideline of one years salary.

The Chief Executive is responsible for assessing the performance of each senior executive taking account of the complexity of the operations under their control, their opportunities for advancement with the Group, their remuneration relative to other executives in the Group and their bonus earning potential.
He then formulates a remuneration proposal for the Committees consideration.
In deciding appropriate remuneration levels, the Committee also considers the Group as a whole and relies on objective external research which gives information on a comparator group of companies.
Basic salaries are reviewed in January February of each year with increases, if appropriate, taking effect from 1 April.
Executive Directors contracts of service which include details of remuneration will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
Annual bonus payments During the year the Committee carefully assessed existing incentive arrangements and determined that incentive levels are appropriately set.
The Committee establishes the economic value added EVA objectives that must be met for each financial year if a cash bonus is to be paid.
In setting appropriate bonus parameters the Committee has determined that bonuses of approximately 60% of salary are payable on the achievement of targeted levels of growth.
The maximum performance-related bonus that can be paid is 100% of basic annual salary.
Executive Director bonus payments for 2010 were 322,000 versus nil in the prior year reflecting progress achieved in prevailing economic conditions.
This performance-related bonus plan, which applies to executive Directors and Divisional Chief Executives, is reviewed annually by the Committee and approved by the Board.
In the case of a Divisional Chief Executive a bonus is earned if the profit of the Division for which he is responsible exceeds a target calculated from the profits of the three preceding financial years.
The profits calculated for this purpose regard each Division as a stand-alone group of companies charging it with the cost of capital it utilises including the cost of acquisitions.
For the Chief Executive and Finance Director, bonuses are calculated as above but based on Group profit exceeding a target calculated from the profits for the three preceding financial years after charging cost of capital, including the cost of acquisitions.
For 2009 10, a supplemental cash bonus of up to 15% of salary could be earned, subject to the 100% of salary cap for total bonus paid, dependent upon attainment of a Return on Capital Employed of 45% and Return on Sales improvement.
Transitional provisions exist for divisional restructuring to ensure Divisional Chief Executives remain appropriately incentivised.
Subsidiary directors participate in bonus arrangements similar to those established for senior executives.
Performance share plan The Directors have long believed that share plans are an excellent way to align the interests of senior management with those of shareholders and that share plans provide excellent motivation.
The Committee, recognising the need to assess and evaluate such incentives, adopted a performance share plan following shareholder approval at the 2005 annual general meeting: this Plan replaced the existing share option plans in respect of future share awards.
The Committee has responsibility for supervising the Plan and the grants under its terms.
The Committee believes that any incentive compensation awarded should be tied to the interests of the Companys shareholders and that the principal measure of those interests is total shareholder return.

Over the period indicated, the Companys total shareholder return was 194% compared to 165% for the FTSE 250 and 156% for the FTSE 350 Electronic & Electrical Equipment sector.
At the commencement of the five-year period depicted in the graph, the Halma p. l. c. ordinary share price was 161p and the total of dividends paid in the year ended 2 April 2005 was 6.33p per share.
The Halma p. l. c. ordinary share price at 3 April 2010 was 259p and the total of dividends paid in the year then ended was 8.09p per share.
The Plan contains provisions permitting share option grants, restricted share awards and performance share awards.
To date, the Committee has used the Plan only to award both approved and unapproved performance shares.
Halma p. l. c. 60 Annual Report & Accounts 2010 Directors Report Governance Share option plans The 1990, 1996 and 1999 share option plans all provided for the grant of two categories of option both of which are subject to performance criteria.
The exercise criteria for these three plans are noted in note 22 to the accounts.
No further grants may be made from these plans which have been replaced by the performance share plan approved by shareholders at the 2005 annual general meeting.
The granting of options was spread over the life of the Plan.
Dilution The total dilution effect under these various discretionary share plans is less than 5%.
The Company does not operate any long-term incentive plans other than the share plans described above.
No significant amendments are proposed to be made to the terms and conditions of any entitlement of a Director to share options or performance share awards.
Pension arrangements Except as noted below, the executive Directors participate in the appropriate section of the Halma Group Pension Plan.
This section is a funded final salary occupational pension plan registered with HM Revenue & Customs, which provides a maximum pension of two-thirds of final pensionable salary after 25 or more years service at normal pension age 60.
Up to 5 April 2006, final pensionable salary was the greatest salary of the last three complete tax years immediately before retirement or leaving service.
From 6 April 2006, final pensionable salary is capped at 7.5% of the Lifetime Allowance equating to 131,250 for the year ended 3 April 2010.
Bonuses and other fluctuating emoluments and benefits-in-kind are not pensionable nor subject to any pension accrued supplement.
The Plan also provides for life cover of three times salary, pensions in the event of early retirement through ill health and dependants pensions of one-half of the members prospective pension.
Early retirement pensions, currently possible from age 55 with the consent of the Company and the Trustees of the Plan, are subject to actuarial reduction.
Pensions in payment increase by 3% per annum for service up to 5 April 1997, by price inflation subject to a maximum of 5% through to 31 March 2007 and 3% thereafter.
Whilst pension benefits are accruing, executive Directors receive pension supplements to compensate them for the fact that their pension accrual entitlement under the Halma Group Pension Plan defined benefit arrangements is limited by a pensionable salary cap introduced from 6 April 2006.
The Company introduced a pensionable salary cap in order to address changes affecting the Plan made in the Pension Act 2006.
Without the introduction of such a cap, there would, effectively, have been no benefit limits.
This could have resulted in benefits in excess of prescribed levels with some individuals suffering penal rates of tax and potentially causing a limitation on the tax deductibility of employer contributions.
The Company obtained external advice regarding the changes to the Plan and executive pension arrangements and required each affected executive to obtain independent advice prior to implementing the changes.
These changes reduce the Plans future liabilities and their associated funding risk.
Prior to receiving pension payments, to the extent that an executives current salary exceeds the Plan salary cap, the Company compensates him at an annual rate of 26% of the excess.
In April 2006, Kevin Thompson chose to cease entirely future service accrual in the Halma Group Pension Plan in return for the pension supplement on his full salary.
Benefits-in-kind The executive Directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, principally use of a car and private medical insurance.
Directors contracts It is the Companys policy that executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of one years notice.
The details of the Directors contracts are summarised in the table below: Date of contract Notice period Andrew Williams April 2003 one year Kevin Thompson April 2003 one year Neil Quinn April 2003 one year Adam Meyers July 2008 one year In the event of early termination, no predetermined compensation is provided for in the Directors contracts.
Halma p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2010 61 Remuneration Report continued Non-executive Directors Unless otherwise indicated, all non-executive Directors have a specific three-year term of engagement which may be renewed for further three-year terms if both the Director and the Board agree.
Richard Stone, who is proposed for re-election in accordance with the Companys Articles, had his terms of engagement extended for a further third three-year term in 2006 in contemplation of attaining six years of service in January 2007.
Richard has expressed his willingness to continue as a Director past his ninth anniversary on the Board whilst overall non-executive Director succession planning is considered and finalised.
The remuneration of the Chairman and the non-executive Directors is determined by the Board based on independent surveys of fees paid to the Chairman and the non-executive Directors of similar companies.
The Chairman receives a basic fee and the non-executive Directors receive a basic fee supplemented by additional fees for membership and or chairmanship of the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
The contract in respect of Geoff Unwins services provides for termination, by either party, by giving not less than six months notice.
Richard Stone, Stephen Pettit and Jane Aikman have contracts in respect of their non-executive Director services which can be terminated, by either party, by giving not less than three months notice.
The Chairmans and the non-executive Directors fees have remained static for the past four years.
They were reviewed by the Board in October 2009 and April 2010, with increases to take effect from April 2010.
