The appointment of a non-executive director may be terminated without compensation if that director is not re-elected by shareholders or otherwise in accordance with the Companys articles of association.
The appointment of the nonexecutives is for a fixed term of one or three years, during which period the appointment may be terminated by the Board on notice, ranging from six to 12 months in the case of the Chairman of the Board.
There are no provisions on payment for early termination in their letters of appointment.
The Remuneration Committee reviews the contracts of executives on an annual basis to ensure they are in line with policy and market practice.
Executive directors are permitted, where appropriate and with Board approval, to take non-executive directorships with other organisations in order to broaden their knowledge and experience in other markets and countries.

The Board recognises the significant demands that are made on executive and non-executive directors and has therefore adopted a policy that no executive director should hold more than two directorships of other listed companies.
The Board encourages executive directors to limit other directorships to one listed company.
Except in exceptional circumstances where approved in advance by the Chairman of the Committee, if an executive director holds non-executive positions at more than one listed company then only the fees from one such company will be retained by the director.
No formal limit on other board appointments applies to non-executive directors under the policy but prior approval from the Chairman on behalf of the Board is required in the case of any new appointment.
In the case of the Chairman prior approval of the Nomination Committee is required on behalf of the Board.

There is no automatic entitlement to annual bonus or outstanding awards under share incentive plans.
Non-executive directors appointments may be terminated without compensation other than in respect of fees during the notice period.

CEO transitional arrangements Mr Walkers cessation as CEO As announced on 16 July 2010, Mr Walkers role as Chief Executive of the Group and executive responsibilities with all Group Companies ceased on 30 September 2010.
Mr Walker was asked to remain with the Company until 1 December 2010, and played a key role in ensuring a smooth transition of executive responsibilities over this period.
For the two-month period between the 2010 year end and 1 December 2010, Mr Walker was entitled to receive his monthly salary only, with corresponding pension and insurance benefits, but with no entitlement to participate in any bonus scheme over the period.
Outstanding PSP awards will continue in effect but where appropriate will be pro-rated to reflect service during the performance period and may then vest on their normal vesting dates, subject to assessment of performance conditions at the normal time.
The Sage Group plc 55 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Remuneration report continued Mr Berruyers appointment as CEO On 16 July 2010, the Company announced Mr Berruyers appointment as Chief Executive of Sage with effect from 1 October 2010.
Mr Berruyer has been appointed on a base salary of 700,000, and will participate in the bonus arrangements described in this report on the same basis as other executive directors.
His entitlement to benefits and pension are commensurate with other executive directors and he may apply a portion of the net proceeds from his pension entitlement to maintain participation in his home country social security system, at no additional cost to the Company.
Mr Berruyer will participate in the PSP under the same policy which applies to other executive directors from time to time.
For the year to 30 September 2011 only, he will receive a larger one-off PSP award subject to the same performance conditions as other participants.
The value of this core award will be 200% of salary, potentially leading to an award at 300% of salary if EPS and TSR conditions are all met in full over a three-year period which is within the shareholder approved limits under the PSP.
The Committee considers this appropriate as a one-off award in the context of appointment to the role of CEO and to provide a clear focus on the continued growth and performance of the business.
Mr Berruyer will receive a contribution from the Company towards relocation expenses and housing costs associated with his relocation to the UK at the Companys request.
4 Performance graph Total Shareholder Return TSR against FTSE 100 The Company is required to include a graph indicating its TSR performance that is, share price assuming reinvestment of any dividends over the last five years relative to a recognised equity index.
Accordingly the graph below shows the Companys performance relative to the FTSE 100.

The other points plotted are the values at intervening financial year ends.
The FTSE 100 Index is, in the opinion of the directors, the most appropriate index against which the TSR of the Company should be measured because of the comparable size of the companies which comprise that index.
TSR performance to 30 September 2010 for PSP awards made to date was as follows: 2008 awards TSR ranking of 10 out of 19 comparators 2009 awards TSR ranking of 9 out of 19 comparators 2010 awards TSR ranking of 10 out of 19 comparators The Sage Group plc 56 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Value Business review 01 Governance 36 Financial statements 63 5 Directors remuneration The information set out in sections 5.1 to 5.4 below has been subject to audit as required by part 3 of Schedule 8 of the Companies Act 2006.
5.1 Directors emoluments and compensation audited information The total salaries, fees and benefits paid to or receivable by each person who served as a director at any time during the year, appear below.
These include all payments for services as a director of the Company, its subsidiaries or otherwise in connection with the management of the Group and any other directorship he or she holds because of the Companys nomination.
The other elements of directors remuneration are referred to under the heading General remuneration policy above.
Awards under that plan, which are expected to be made in January 2011, over such number of shares whose market value is as close as possible to, but no greater than, the deferred bonus, will vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant.
In the event that a director ceases to be an employee of the Group for reasons other than death, retirement, redundancy, injury, ill-health or disability before the third anniversary of the date of grant, then the award will lapse unless the Remuneration Committee recommends otherwise.
The directors have no entitlement to the bonus deferred into an award of shares until it vests.
Full details of the award will be contained in the report for the year ending 30 September 2011.
2 Benefits in kind include the provision of car allowance, insurance and relocation costs.

In the table above an exchange rate of 1.15 1 ha s been adopted.
5.2 Directors share options audited information There are limits on the number of newly issued shares that can be used to satisfy awards under the Groups employee share schemes in any ten-year period.
The limits and the Groups current position against those limits as at 20 December 2010 the last practicable date prior to printing this document, are set out below: Limit Current position 7.5% of Groups share capital can be used for discretionary share schemes 5.82% 10% of Groups share capital can be used for all share schemes 6.42% The Company has satisfied and intends to satisfy all awards under the Performance Share Plan through the market purchase of shares.
If awards under the Performance Share Plan are removed from the calculations above then under discretionary share schemes the percentage becomes 3.78% and under all share schemes 4.38%.
The Sage Group plc 57 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Remuneration report continued Executive share options The Groups only current executive share option scheme is the ESOS.
In the year under review, executive directors did not receive grants under this scheme.
Option s granted to all directors of the Company and its operating subsidiaries throughout the Group under the ESOS that became exercisable on or after 23 February 2003 but before 6 January 2008 will normally be exercisable only if the percentage increase in the Companys EPS has exceeded the RPI by at least 3% each year in the three-year period since grant, i. e. by a total of 9%.
If that target is not met at the end of the three-year period, then those options will only be exercisable if EPS growth exceeds RPI by 12% over the four-year period following the date of grant.
In respect of options which became exercisable on or after 6 January 2008 the performance criteria for exercise are based on EPS growth measured over a fixed three-year period from the start of the financial year in which the grant is made.
30% of options will vest at the end of the period if the increase in EPS exceeds RPI by 15% an average of 5% per year and 100% of those options will vest at that time only if RPI is exceeded in that period by 27% an average of 9% per year.
Between those targets, options will vest on a straight-line basis.
If those targets are not met at the end of the three-year period, then no further retesting of the performance criteria will be undertaken and the options will lapse.
