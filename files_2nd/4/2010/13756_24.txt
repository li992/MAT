The price on the vesting date was 12.57 per share.

6 After the year end, the executive directors 2007 performance share awards were tested against the applicable TSR and EPS performance conditions.

The table below shows the final awards made before 2006 in respect of which matching share entitlements vested during the year ended 31 March 2010.
