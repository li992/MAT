Our governance | Chairmans introduction | Board of Directors | Directors Report | Remuneration Report | OUR GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT Introductory letter Dear Shareholder I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committees report on Directors remuneration for 2010.
During the year, the Committee carried out a comprehensive review of the Companys remuneration arrangements and is proposing some changes to the remuneration policy with effect from 2011.
Since the last detailed review in 2005, the business has grown significantly in terms of revenue and employee numbers, and now has a significant international presence across the entire lifecycle of major infrastructure assets.
Consistent with the changing nature of the business, the scope and complexity of senior executives roles within the Company has also changed.
While the Committee considers that the remuneration policy operated since 2005 has complemented the strategy effectively and rewarded executives fairly, the review concluded that a number of evolutionary changes should be made.
This is to ensure that the policy continues to provide a strong link between executives and shareholders interests through focussing on the outputs of the Companys strategy, namely sustainable profit growth and shareholder returns.
As part of the review, the Committee developed proposals for a new Performance Share Plan to replace the existing plan, which has reached the end of its five-year life.
In developing these proposed changes we have consulted with the Companys major institutional shareholders and their representative bodies.
The proposals are set out in this report and the resolutions, both to adopt this report and to seek shareholder approval for the new Performance Share Plan, will be put to the Annual General Meeting.
I hope you will support these proposals which the Remuneration Committee believes are in the interests of shareholders.
Yours sincerely Robert Walvis Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Annual report and accounts 2010 89 OUR GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT Introduction Incentive arrangements are structured so as to motivate participants This report has been prepared in accordance with Section 420 of the to deliver high standards of performance, without encouraging Companies Act 2006 the Act and Schedules 5 and 8 of the Large excessive risk-taking.

The 2010 remuneration review examined the of the Groups business and individual Directors.

Remuneration levels must be positioned such that they provide a competitive level of remuneration, to enable the recruitment and At the review in 2010, Duncan Magraths salary was increased from 360,000 to 385,000 and Andrew McNaughtons salary was increased retention of high calibre management.
It is vital that we continue to be able to attract, retain and motivate those individuals who can from 385,000 to 410,000.
These increases continue the process whereby the salaries for the more recent appointments to the Board lead the business so as to achieve its short and long-term goals.
To meet this objective we need to ensure that remuneration are progressively aligned over time with the other executive Directors and the external market.

The values indicated in the graph show the share price growth plus reinvested dividends from a 100-hypothetical holding of ordinary shares in Balfour Beatty plc and in the index, at the start of the period and have been calculated using 30 trading-day average values.
The detailed information about the Directors remuneration, set out below and on pages 94 to 99 has been audited by the Companys independent auditors, Deloitte LLP.
In practice, the basic salary paid to Andrew McNaughton has been reduced due to his participation in the Companys SMART Pensions salary sacrifice arrangement.
The 6,180 reduction in 2010 corresponds to his contributions to the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund, which are now met directly by the Company as part of this arrangement.
ii Ian Tyler, Duncan Magrath, Andrew McNaughton and Anthony Rabin received taxable cash supplements in lieu of pension provision on their salary above the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund specific earnings cap.
iii The performance target for annual bonus was profit before tax, exceptional items and amortisation of intangible assets profit.
The profit for the year ended 31 December 2010 resulted in a bonus of 55.7% of basic salary for each executive Director.
Two-thirds of this bonus is payable in cash and these are the amounts shown in the table above.
The remaining one-third is deferred in the form of ordinary shares in the Company which will be released to the Director on 31 March 2014, providing he is still employed by the Company at that time.
The number of shares comprising the deferred element will be determined based on the share price at the award date of 31 March 2011. iv Hubertus Krossa received a fee of 34,000 included above for his chairmanship of the supervisory board of Balfour Beatty Rail GmbH.

iii Robert Walvis was also interested at 31 December 2010 in 938 ordinary shares in Balfour Beatty plc held by the Craven Arms Investment Club, of which he is a member.
It is the Companys current intention that awards will be satisfied by shares purchased in the market.
ii For the awards in April 2008, April 2009 and April 2010, the performance periods are the three years ending 31 December 2010, 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2012 respectively.
50% of each award is subject to an EPS growth target.
The maximum number of shares subject to this performance condition will only vest if EPS growth exceeds the retail prices index RPI by 45% for the performance period for the April 2008 award, 39% for the April 2009 award and 36% for the April 2010 award.
If EPS growth exceeds RPI by 15% for the April 2008 award, 9% for the April 2009 award and 6% for the April 2010 award, then 25% of this part of the awards will vest.
For growth in EPS between these points, vesting will be on a pro-rata basis.
No shares will vest from this part of the award if EPS growth exceeds RPI by less than 15%, 9% or 6% as appropriate.
The other 50% of each award is subject to a total shareholder return TSR target under which the TSR of the Company is compared to that of a comparator group of similar listed companies at the start of the performance period.
The maximum number of shares subject to this performance condition will only vest if the Companys TSR is at the upper quartile of the comparator group.
If the Companys TSR is equal to that of the median of the comparator group then 25% of this part of the award will vest.
No shares from this part of the award will vest if the Companys TSR is below that of the median of the comparator group.
For TSR performance between median and upper quartile, vesting will be on a pro-rata basis.
There is no provision for re-testing of either of the performance conditions.
iii The average middle market price of ordinary shares in the Company for the three dealing dates before the award dates, which was used for calculating the number of awards granted, was 491.583p for the 2007 award, 449.17p for the 2008 award, 354p for the 2009 award and 302.63p for the 2010 award.
The closing middle market price of ordinary shares on the date of the awards was 490.75p, 450p, 352.25p and 302.8p respectively.
iv The performance period for the awards made in April 2008 was completed on 31 December 2010.
The growth in EPS for this period with adjustments in relation to the rights issue for EPS in 2007 and PPP asset disposals and the acquisition of Parsons Brinckerhoff for EPS in 2010 exceeded RPI by 19.75%, exceeding the RPI 15% required for threshold vesting.
The Companys TSR for this period ranked just below the median of the comparator group.
The combined effect of these performance measures is that 18.4% of each participants conditional award will vest on 15 April 2011.
Each participant will also receive shares in lieu of the dividends which would have been payable on the shares which vest.
v The performance period for the awards made in April 2007 was completed on 31 December 2009.
The growth in EPS for this period with adjustments in relation to the rights issue for EPS in 2006 and 2009 and for the acquisition of Parsons Brinckerhoff for EPS in 2009 exceeded RPI by more than 45%, the level required for maximum vesting.
The combined effect of these performance measures is that 50% of each participants conditional awards vested on 26 March 2010.
This date was brought forward from the original vesting date of 17 April 2010.
Ian Tyler, Duncan Magrath, Andrew McNaughton, Anthony Rabin and Peter Zinkin also received 9,347, 2,551, 3,990, 5,346 and 5,346 shares respectively in lieu of the dividends which would have been payable on the shares which vested.

Directors pensions Executive Directors participate in the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund.
The scheme provides for a pension at a normal retirement age of 62 for pension purposes and each Director pays an annual contribution equal to 5% of contributory salary except where, in the case of Andrew McNaughton, the Director participates in SMART Pensions as outlined in Note ii to the second table below.
The pension for a Director who can complete 20 or more years pensionable service at normal retirement age is targeted at two-thirds of final pensionable salary, subject to HMRC limits.
With effect from 6 April 2006, HMRC limits were changed with one of the changes being to no longer use the earnings cap when determining the maximum permissible benefits.
However, the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund has retained a Fund specific earnings cap for pension purposes.
The salaries of Duncan Magrath, Andrew McNaughton, Anthony Rabin and Ian Tyler were subject to the Fund specific earnings cap for pension purposes and details of the Companys contributions to additional arrangements for them are noted underneath the second table below.

iv On 1 January 2011, Peter Zinkin started to receive his pension benefits from the Defined Benefit section of the Fund, and became a contributing member of the Defined Contribution section.
The impact of this change will be incorporated in the 2011 Remuneration Report.
The table below sets out the transfer value at 31 December 2010 of each executive Directors accrued deferred pension at that date as well as the movement in that transfer value over the period.
The transfer values represent the cash equivalent values that would have been payable from the scheme had the Directors left service on the dates shown, and reflect the age of the Director, his period of membership of the scheme and his pensionable salary.
