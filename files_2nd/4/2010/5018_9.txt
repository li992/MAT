Introduction The Remuneration Committee has prepared this report in accordance with the requirements of Section 420 Companies Act 2006 and the Listing Rules.
The report and the Groups remuneration policy comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
An ordinary resolution to approve the report through a shareholder vote will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
The disclosures that the Groups auditors are required to audit within the Remuneration report are contained in the section headed Audited Information.
The auditors opinion is included in their report on page 36.
Non-audited information Remuneration committee and advisers During the year ended 3 July 2010, the Remuneration Committee was made up of four members, Marion Sears, Simon Emeny, Nick Wharton and Geoff Cooper.
Marion Sears, who is the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, chairs the committee and also acts as Secretary.
The committee determines the Executive Directors annual remuneration packages and provides guidance on the remuneration packages of members of senior management.
No Director determines their own pay.
Changes in policy during the year There have been no changes to remuneration policy during the year.
Executive remuneration policy The Remuneration Committees policy is to provide an executive remuneration structure that will attract, motivate and retain the high quality individuals who are essential for the successful development of the business over the long-term.
Executive remuneration aims to ensure that the Executive Directors are fairly rewarded for their success measured by the Groups performance and are incentivised to enhance value for shareholders on a continuing and long-term basis.
There are three main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors: base annual salary including benefits: annual bonus: and Long-Term Incentive Plan.
Two of these main elements are performance based, which means that there is significant emphasis in the Groups executive remuneration policy on its performance.
The Remuneration Committee oversees the two performance-based plans: an annual bonus plan and a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
In accordance with governance guidelines and the requirements of the Combined Code, the Remuneration Committee implemented these two performance based plans to ensure alignment of interests between shareholders and Executive Directors.
The annual bonus plan is short-term and provides cash rewards.
The LTIP is long-term and rewards are in the form of shares.
Base salary and benefits Prior to the beginning of each financial year the Remuneration Committee sets the base salaries of Executive Directors.
The committee examines the salaries of Directors in a comparator group of public companies and considers the operational scale and complexity of the role each Director performs.
It also reviews published research and surveys, and considers the wage increases across the Group as a whole.
The committee aims to set salaries at around the median level provided by similar companies.
In addition to base salary, the Executive Directors are entitled to benefits comprising a car allowance, a contribution to a personal pension, private medical insurance and life insurance.
Annual bonus The Group operates a discretionary annual cash bonus scheme.
Any bonus amounts determined to be payable are paid after the year-end results are finalised.
The Remuneration Committee has established bonus objectives that are principally financial but also include personal objectives for the year relevant to each Director.
The bonus payment for on target EPS is 24% of salary, subject to personal performance, and the maximum bonus payable for the year ended 3 July 2010 was 60% of salary.
Dunelm Group plc 24 Annual report and accounts 2010 Governance Remuneration report continued For the year ended 3 July 2010, EPS exceeded target.
After due consideration of job performance, the committee awarded an annual bonus to Will Adderley of 195,840 and to David Stead of 134,640.
Long-Term Incentive Plan Under the LTIP, Executive Directors are awarded nominal cost share options annually.
These awards will vest three years after date of grant, to the extent that the applicable performance target is met.
The Remuneration Committee has chosen growth in fully diluted EPS over each three-year performance period as the performance target for the awards under the LTIP.
The committee believes that this measure is closely aligned to the drivers of growth of the business, and that in the long-term, EPS performance will be reflected in shareholder value.
The committee is satisfied that capital expenditure controls exercised by the Board are sufficiently rigorous to avoid EPS accretion by means of ineffective investment of capital, and in any event reserves the right to adjust the target in the event of a major capital transaction.
The LTIP is structured as follows awards vest on a straight line basis between the threshold and maximum points : Compound annual growth in EPS Periods ending 2009, 2010 2011, 2012 Vesting percentage Threshold RPI 5% RPI 3% 25% Maximum RPI 20% RPI 12% 100% The committee decided to reduce the performance hurdle in respect of the schemes maturing in 2011 and 2012, recognising the challenging market conditions expected to result from global recession.
The committee meets after the results for each three-year performance period are available to determine the extent to which performance conditions have been satisfied.
Awards cannot be granted under discretionary schemes, including the LTIP, over Ordinary Shares in excess of 5% of the issued Ordinary Share capital in any rolling 10 year period.
Awards of Ordinary Shares worth 120% of base salary were made to Will Adderley and David Stead in March and September 2007, in September 2008 and in September 2009.
The March 2007 award was in respect of the three-year performance period to 4 July 2009, over which the compound annual growth in EPS was 14.8% 12.4% above RPI.
Accordingly, 62% of the conditional shares awarded in March 2007 vested in March 2010 and the entitlements were exercised by both Will Adderley 93,809 shares and David Stead 61,461 shares on 23 March 2010.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the Companys EPS record over the three year performance period which ended on 3 July 2010.
Reported EPS, grew at a compound annual rate of 30.1%.
This is 27.3% above RPI over the same period.
Accordingly, 100% of the September 2007 LTIP award will vest in September 2010, representing 190,130 shares in favour of Will Adderley and 127,792 shares in favour of David Stead.
Other share options The Group operates an all-employee SAYE scheme in which Executive Directors are also entitled to participate.
Non-executive remuneration policy Non-Executive Directors remuneration is determined by the Executive Directors.
The Non-Executive Directors do not receive bonuses or participate in any incentive plans.
They are paid annual fees which reflect additional responsibilities taken when chairing a committee of the Board.
All Non-Executives have letters of appointment, detailed in the table on page 25.
Dunelm Group plc 25 Annual report and accounts 2010 Service contracts In accordance with the Groups policy, the service contracts of the Executive Directors have no fixed term, the notice period for termination is 12 months from either party and payments on termination are restricted to a maximum of the value of salary for the notice period.
The Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment for an initial period of three years with a provision for termination of one months notice from either party, or three months notice from either party in the case of Geoff Cooper, the Chairman.
Unexpired Date of remaining Notice Initial contract term period Will Adderley 28.09.06 n a 12 months David Stead 15.09.03 n a 12 months Geoff Cooper 08.10.04 1 month 3 months Marion Sears 22.07.04 34 months 1 month Simon Emeny 25.06.07 33 months 1 month Nick Wharton 10.08.09 23 months 1 month Retirement plans The Remuneration Committee has decided not to use final salary pension plans as a way of remunerating its Executive Directors.
Instead the Group contributes to the Executive Directors personal pension plans.
The Remuneration Committee believes this is an efficient way to assist Executives to prepare for retirement.
When determining the mixture of fixed and performance based pay, the Remuneration Committee takes account of contributions to pension plans.
Performance graph The graph below shows the Groups performance since flotation, measured by total shareholder return, compared with the FTSE General Retail Index and the FTSE 250.

The shares traded in the range 202.5p to 438.4p during the year, and stood at 325.3p at 3 July 2010.
