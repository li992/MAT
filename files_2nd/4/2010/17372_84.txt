Policy on directors service contracts, notice periods, termination payments and external appointments The Companys policy is that contracts should be on a rolling basis and will not include either a fixed term or liquidated damages provisions.
Sir Martin Sorrells service contract may be terminated by the Company or by Sir Martin without, in either case, notice needing to be given a so-called contract at will.
This means that the Company may terminate Sir Martins service contract without the need to pay compensation for any notice period.

ESAs and Restricted Stock Awards held by executive directors All awards made under the Restricted Stock Plan are made on the basis of satisfaction of previous performance conditions and are subject to continuous employment until the vest date.
The table includes awards that vested during 2010, awards that remained outstanding during 2010 and, by way of additional information, awards that have been granted since 31 December 2010.
When actual performance falls between these positions, the match is calculated on a proportionate basis.

When actual performance is not exactly equal to a percentile in the table below, but is more than 50% and less than 90%, the percentage of Matching Shares will be determined on a straight-line basis between the relevant figures.
Awards granted in 2009 and 2010 Aggregate market Number of capitalisation percentile matching shares 90thpercentile 500% 80thpercentile 420% 70thpercentile 330% 60thpercentile 240% 50thpercentile 150% 40thpercentile 0% 30thpercentile 0% 20thpercentile 0% 10thpercentile 0% Bottom 0% Comparator Groups The comparator groups used for the awards under Renewed LEAP 2006, 2007, 2008 and LEAP III 2009, 2010 are shown in the following table.
Where a company that delists during a performance period has an undisturbed share price for less than 40% of that performance period, the Compensation Committee would usually exclude that company from the comparator group for the award in question.
Otherwise, the company would usually be deemed to be disposed of and the proceeds reinvested, in respect of LEAP III, in a market capitalisation weighted index, and in respect of Renewed LEAP in a nonmarket capitalisation weighted index, both of which track the TSR of the remaining comparator companies.
