incentive pay is adequate and affordable in lean periods, while remaining reasonable and aligned with market norms in times of strong performance.
87 Man Group plc Annual Report 2010 Incentives encourage behaviour focused on longer-term strategic performance.
Remuneration packages at Man Group include some, or all, of the following elements: salary, annual performance bonus, marketing incentives for funds under management raised and deferred share awards, as well as pension, medical insurance and other non-cash benefits.
We aim to balance remuneration for delivering operational results over the short-term with remuneration for creating sustained long-term value for shareholders.
A key mechanism for linking short and long-term performance is our bonus deferral arrangement.
Bonus awards are determined by the annual performance of the Group, the team and the individual.
A significant portion of the award for senior employees is deferred into Company shares, so that they build up a significant investment in Man Group shares, thereby encouraging them to think and act like long-term shareholders.
The deferral arrangement allows flexibility in the mix between shortand long-term focus as appropriate for employees at different levels in the Group.
In addition to the deferral of annual bonus, senior executives participate in a Performance Share Plan PSP and an Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS.
The PSP and ESOS are also subject to long-term performance conditions regarding the growth and returns of the Group.
All share awards are conditional and subject to forfeiture if an employee resigns or employment is terminated for poor performance or misconduct.
Our total remuneration is competitive against the talent markets from which we hire The sustainability of our business depends upon the long-term commitment of talented individuals of the very highest calibre in the alternative investment sector.
Our remuneration structure is key in this respect.
Therefore we aim to provide remuneration appropriate for the talented individuals in the markets in which we operate.
In understanding our remuneration policy, it is important to note that Man Group is in a unique situation.
There are few companies of comparable size in our sector and even fewer that are publicly quoted and subject to the same level of transparency and public scrutiny.
Benchmarking and formulaic remuneration approaches alone therefore fail to reflect the complexity of our business and the diversity of professional roles within our workforce.
Available market data is used to inform not override our recommendations to support the Group in creating sustained long-term value for shareholders.
Our remuneration programme must incorporate flexibility to use different performance measures within the various parts of the Group.
Consequently, while all incentive payments are determined and limited by the Groups performance, we maintain scope to distribute rewards to employees according to their individual and team contributions.
Summary Our approach is intended to be equitable and robust against variable business conditions and time-spans.
As performance measurement and remuneration design continue to evolve we will keep these principles under continuous review to ensure that we are aligned with best practice.
We remain open to continuing dialogue with our shareholders.
Overview of Employee Remuneration and Policy A summary of the total fixed and variable compensation costs for the Group for the last three years is given below.

88 Man Group plc Annual Report 2010 Remuneration Report continued The total compensation package includes base salary, benefits, an annual performance bonus, and share grants where appropriate.
The bonus award depends upon individual performance, risk management and the Company performance.
Key contributors and senior employees are also invited to participate in the Company share and fund product plans, enabling them to share directly in the success of the Company and investor products.
Employees can opt to participate in the all employee share plans, so they may also share in the success of Man Group over time.

Particular regard is paid to base salary levels within other leading companies in the financial services sector.
These comparisons are made with the assistance of independent remuneration surveys.
Benefits Core benefits are provided to all employees globally, and are driven by local regulations and market practice.
While benefits are specific to location, they generally include retirement, medical cover, life and sickness assurance and holiday benefits.
On top of this, we provide our employees with a range of additional benefits according to local market.
The Company also seeks to encourage employee share ownership as set out below.
Performance bonus The bonus pool is determined by the profitability of the business for the financial year after a charge on surplus capital.
The success of the business is therefore the direct driver of compensation levels.
Employees are measured against both business objectives and competencies, with performance reviews to assess the employees contribution and potential.
Business objectives include building the sustainable profitability of the Company and managing risk within the governance framework.
The purpose is to increase the effectiveness and potential of every Man employee by ensuring that individual objectives are aligned with overall business and department goals.
Senior employees also have part of their performance bonus mandatorily deferred in shares and funds with the proportion deferred increasing as total compensation increases with maximum deferral levels at 65% of variable compensation.
Awards are through the Man Group share plans to align them with the shareholders and the future performance of the Company.
Awards may also be made through fund based incentives to align employees with the interests of investors in Man funds.
Where applicable sales executives are eligible for marketing incentive based on funds under management raised.
Since 1 April 2009, marketing incentive arrangements have had the following features: 30% of marketing incentive is scored and depends on achievement of target redemption levels and personal objectives: Marketing incentive payments are made semi-annually: and Marketing incentive is deferred into Company shares in the Deferred Share Plan on a scale based on total compensation levels.
Management Committee remuneration for the financial year ended 31 March 2010 The Management Committee members who are not executive directors have had their remuneration policy assessed to ensure that senior management are appropriately incentivised to deliver the Companys strategic plan.
Base salaries have been frozen at the same level for the second year.
A significantly greater proportion of their remuneration has been delivered as long-term deferred awards.
Variable incentives are now structured such that 65% of the awards have been deferred into share or fund based incentive arrangements this year.
This aligns their interests with the long-term return to shareholders and with the interests of investors in Man funds.
Options with an exercise price 10% above the market price at grant premium priced options have also been awarded to incentivise sustained growth with the options exercisable between three and 10 years from the anniversary of grant.

We intend to the strategy of the Group and building sustainable profitability: to apply this approach within a framework which determines the the achievement of the Groups key financial targets: total compensation and then subsequently decide the split into the creation of long-term shareholder value: immediate cash and share-based awards subject to holding ongoing oversight of a robust risk management framework: restrictions and or service requirements.

They allow the Remuneration Committee not the elections of executive directors to dictate the mix of long-term, short-term, cash, sharebased, and  elements in pay.
They focus the executive directors on performance measures which are important value drivers for the Company in the current market context, with realistic, stretching but achievable targets.
92 Man Group plc Annual Report 2010 Remuneration Report continued Service contracts The Group has service contracts with its executive directors.
The service contracts do not have a fixed term but provide for termination on the expiry of not more than 12 months written notice by either party or at the end of the month during which Peter Clarke has attained the age of 60 and Kevin Hayes has attained the age of 65.
The effective dates of the service contracts are: Peter Clarke 1 April 1997 and Kevin Hayes 31 May 2007.
The service contracts contain no contractual entitlement to any fixed amount of bonus or right to participation in any of the Groups sharebased incentive plans, participation in which is at the Remuneration Committees discretion.
To protect the Groups business interests, executive directors service contracts contain covenants, which restrict the executives ability to solicit or deal with clients and also restricts their ability to solicit senior employees, to the extent permitted under the law of the relevant jurisdiction.
Under their service contracts, external appointments require Board consent.
The executive directors service contracts do not include any fixed provision for termination compensation except base salary and benefits for the notice period.
The treatment of share awards on termination is covered under the relevant shareholder approved plan rules.
The Remuneration Committee is mindful of the need to consider what compensation commitments, if any, are appropriate in the event of the termination of executive directors service contracts, bearing in mind the Groups legal obligations and the individuals ability to mitigate their loss.
The Remuneration Committee must approve in advance any proposed termination payments.
As stated in the Directors Report, the Company has purchased and maintained throughout the year directors and officers liability insurance in respect of itself and its directors.
Base salary Base salary ranges are established by reference to those prevailing in the employment market generally for executives of comparable status, responsibility and skills.
Particular regard is paid to base salary levels within other leading companies in the financial services sector and the need in many cases to secure the services of senior executives who have international experience and flexibility in job location.
These comparisons are made with the assistance of available independent remuneration surveys.
The previous and current base salaries for the Man Group executive directors are shown in the table below.
Peter Clarke Kevin Hayes Base Salary at 1 June 2009 $925,000 $625,000 Base Salary at 1 June 2010 $925,000 $625,000 The US dollar is the functional currency of the company and with effect from 1 June 2008 the directors salaries were set in US dollars.
Salaries were reviewed but no increase will be made at 1 June 2010.
Pension and benefit provision All executive directors are eligible to participate in the Groups pension arrangements generally operating in the jurisdiction in which they work.
Alternatively, the Group will, at the executive directors request and subject to applicable limits and regulations, make a contribution of up to 14% of pensionable base salary to an alternative arrangement nominated by the director.
Full information is provided in the Audited Remuneration Report.
Other benefits provided are set out below.
Provision Policy Private Medical Insurance Family private medical insurance is provided.
Life Assurance Provides a lump sum payment in event of death: this is set at four x base salary subject to a notional earnings cap of 123,600.
Permanent Health Insurance Insurance provides 50% of base salary less state benefits in the event of inability to carry on normal duties.
Holiday Pay 30 days paid holiday.
Other Benefits Flexible benefits are provided and can be purchased from base salary.
Annual performance bonus and deferral All executive directors and senior executives are eligible for an annual performance bonus, which is non-pensionable.
Although the Remuneration Committee does not consider it appropriate to establish any maximum percentage of base salary payable by way of performance bonus, total bonuses available across the Group for distribution to eligible employees including executive directors are determined by reference to the pre-tax profit after making certain adjustments, including a charge for the surplus capital held by the Group.
Performance bonuses for executive directors are discretionary.
In considering the appropriate level of bonus for each director, the Remuneration Committee considers: a Strategy assessment measured by the extent to which the individual has contributed towards achievement of Company strategic objectives: b Financial assessment measured by the extent to which the Group has achieved its financial targets: and c Qualitative assessment measured by the extent to which the individual has achieved their agreed personal objectives for the year.
93 Man Group plc Annual Report 2010 Long-term share-based incentive plans Executive directors are currently eligible to participate in the Performance Share Plan, and Executive Share Option Scheme, in each case at the Remuneration Committees discretion.
Both the Board and the Remuneration Committee believe that it is inappropriate to use short-term share price movements as a measure of management performance.
At this point in the business cycle, it is crucial to rebuild the Companys operating leverage and therefore, for awards granted from 2009, the Committee has decided to focus executives on a combination of growth and returns: specifically, cumulative three-year growth in net management fee income, and adjusted Return on Equity.
The Remuneration Committee is not aware of any listed companies of substantial size whose main business activities are comparable in nature and scale to that of Man Group, and accordingly the Remuneration Committee does not see any merit in trying to benchmark performance criteria against any other companies.
The Remuneration Committee sets performance conditions to achieve absolute returns, not relative returns, for its shareholders.
The following is a summary of the long-term share-based incentive plans that are operated by the Group.
Performance Share Plan 2006 PSP Award Level Each year, participants are eligible to receive awards of performance shares up to a maximum of 100% of base salary.
Additionally the PSP participants will receive PSP matching shares maximum of 1:1 match, gross of personal tax and social security liabilities for that part of their performance bonus which is deferred into Company shares and held for at least three years.
From this year onwards, for executive directors, the deferred amount is determined by the Remuneration Committee with a mandatory deferral for three years.
For 2009, the executive directors were awarded PSP shares equivalent to 100% of base salary.
In order to qualify for a matching award in 2009, the Directors invested 100% of the amount of their post tax annual performance bonus to take up the matching shares offered.
Additional Information Awards under the PSP are performance-related over a three year measurement period.
For all grants from July 2009 performance conditions are based on dual growth and returns performance described in the next section of this report.
For all grants to June 2008 there have been no changes made to the performance conditions, which continue to be based on the level of post-tax return on average shareholders funds Return on Equity achieved by the Group throughout that period.
No award will be transferred unless the Group maintains an average annual Return on Equity of at least 20% across the performance period.
For an average annual Return on Equity of 20%, 10% of the shares vest.
Award shares will be transferred at levels above this on a linear sliding scale.
Full benefits of an award can only be transferred when annual Return on Equity has averaged 30% or more.
These targets are considered by the Remuneration Committee to be both challenging and appropriate given the regulated nature of the Groups business.
After vesting according to performance over three years, PSP entitlements are subject to an additional one year restriction on transfer to participants dependent upon continued employment with the Group.
94 Man Group plc Annual Report 2010 Remuneration Report continued Executive Share Option Scheme 2001 ESOS Award Level Individual share option awards are subject to an annual cap of 200% of base salary, on a face value basis.
For 2009, the executive directors were awarded ESOS options equivalent to 200% of base salary.
Additional Information Options issued under the Scheme may normally only be exercised between three and 10 years from the date of grant and are subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions.
For all grants from July 2009 and onwards, performance conditions are based on dual growth and returns performance described in the next section of this report.
For all grants from June 2006 to June 2008 there have been no changes made to the performance conditions: 50% of each option will continue to vest if the Companys underlying earnings per share EPS growth in the single three year performance period matches or exceeds the growth in RPI plus 5% per annum, with the entire option vesting at RPI plus 10% per annum.
For all grants prior to June 2006, 50% of each option will vest if the Companys underlying earnings per share EPS growth matches or exceeds the growth in RPI plus 3% per annum, with the entire option vesting at RPI plus 6% per annum.
Performance criteria are calculated from the end of the financial year prior to the grant of option.
No re-testing of the EPS performance targets will take place for options granted since 2005.
Accordingly, if the targets attached to any option are not reached after three years, the option will lapse.
Long-term incentive plans performance conditions The performance conditions are measured on the performance achieved over a three-year performance period.
The shares and options subject to these performance conditions are set out in the Audited section of the Remuneration Report on pages 99 to 100.
From 2009 onwards a new approach will be applied to performance measurement, in which both PSP awards and ESOS awards will be subject to the same dual growth and returns performance measures.
Vesting is subject to achieving cumulative three-year net management fee income growth NMFIG and average three-year adjusted ROE AROE.
There is no vesting if there is negative AROE.
Vesting commences at 8% where there is positive AROE and NMFIG is 10% or above.
Vesting increases incrementally with full vesting achieved where i NMFIG is at least 30% and AROE is at least 10%: or ii NMFIG is at least 20% and AROE is at least 30% with incremental vesting between these thresholds.

The actual amount of remuneration awarded this year which is eventually received is subject to these conditions.
In respect of 2009 remuneration which is subject to performance conditions, based on subsequent performance, is likely to have a significantly reduced value.
The economic value of performance-based share grants is the face value at the time of grant, multiplied by a performance factor to represent the expected vesting of awards.
A binomial lattice valuation factor has been applied to the expected value of grants to estimate the economic value taking account of share price volatility and dividend yield.
The information provided in the 2009 Annual Report for share plans was the face value and did not take account of the impact of the performance conditions, share price volatility and dividend yield.

d B ase salary has been frozen at USD 925,000 for Peter Clarke and USD 625,000 for Kevin Hayes for the two years since 1 June 2008: the 2009 figure is for the year from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2009.
Share ownership requirements A shareholding requirement was introduced in May 2010 for executive directors.
The Chief Executive is required to maintain a shareholding of 200% of base salary.
The Finance Director is required to maintain a shareholding of 100% of base salary.
Vested PSP and ESOS can be taken into account in applying this test but unvested awards are not eligible for inclusion.
Executive directors are required to build up this shareholding on joining the Board or after a reduction in share price as share and option plan awards vest.
The executive directors meet these requirements.
Non-executive directors are encouraged to build a shareholding.
The shareholdings of directors are set out on page 101.
96 Man Group plc Annual Report 2010 Remuneration Report continued Man Group has always sought to facilitate significant share ownership by directors and senior management, principally through plans which encourage and assist the purchase of shares with their own funds or by way of bonus deferral.
The Board and employees worldwide together currently own an estimated 3.6% of the Companys share capital, either directly or through employee trusts established and funded for this purpose.
The Board alone directly holds 0.5% similar to last year of the issued capital.
The Employee Trusts are included in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Non-executive directors fees and terms of appointment The fees of the non-executive directors are determined by the Board within the limits agreed by shareholders and set out in the Articles of Association.
Non-executive directors receive a base fee for Board service and additional fees for Board Committee membership and other responsibilities as shown in the table below.
They do not participate in any share option or share incentive plans.
The Chairmans remuneration is recommended by the Remuneration Committee and approved by the Board.
Neither the Chairman nor the nonexecutive directors take part in discussions or vote on their own remuneration.
In May 2009 the Board reviewed and revised the membership of the principal Board Committees and the structure and level of non-executive director fees against the work load and responsibilities of those Committees and emerging best practice.
The Board has adopted, with effect from 1 August 2009, a fee structure based on differentiated membership of and remuneration for the Audit and Risk and Remuneration Committees as detailed below.
All non-executive directors are members of the Nomination Committee.
The non-executive directors and the Chairmans fees were reviewed in March 2010, but no changes were considered appropriate.
Structure of non-executive director fees Base non-executive director fee includes Nomination Committee membership Committee membership fees Audit & Risk Remuneration Senior Independent 2 Director 1 1 Member Chair Member Chair 65,000 15,000 15,000 10,000 15,000 10,000 1 In addition to the membership fee.
2 In addition to committee membership fees.
Non-executive directors have formal letters of appointment.
These do not contain any notice provisions or provision for compensation in the event of early termination.
The Chairman has a contract with the Company which provides that his appointment as Chairman is terminable on three months notice: there are no notice provisions relating to his appointment as a director.
The Boards policy is to appoint non-executive directors for an initial three year term, subject to retirement by rotation and reappointment by shareholders at the AGM, which may be followed by a further three years by mutual agreement.
Any further extension will be by exception and will be subject to rigorous review.
Any director serving for more than nine years is subject to annual retirement and reappointment by shareholders at the AGM.
The initial date of appointment of the non-executive directors to the Board, the start date of their current term of appointment and their fee levels are given in the following table.

Retirement benefits Retirement benefits accruing to Peter Clarke under a defined benefit pension scheme and contributions to money purchase schemes relating to other executive directors were as follows: Defined Benefit Scheme Transfer value at Increase in 31 March 2010 Increase in accrued of increase in Accrued accrued pension during accrued pension Transfer value Transfer value pension at 31 pension during the year net of during the year of accrued of accrued Increase in a b b March 2010 the year inflation net of pension at 31 pension at 31 transfer value c d e d d c 000 000 000 inflation March 2010 March 2009 over the year Age per annum per annum per annum 000 000 000 000 Peter Clarke 50 101 6 1 799 2,549 1,313 1,148 Notes: a Peter Clarke continues to be employed on a full-time basis as the Group Chief Executive.
However, in light of the statutory increase in minimum retirement age from 50 to 55 effective from 6 April 2010, for personal reasons, Peter Clarke has elected to draw his defined benefit pension from the Man Group plc Pension Fund the Fund with effect from 1 March 2010.
The accrued pension represents his accrued entitlement, calculated in accordance with the rules of the Fund.
Since the pension is being drawn prior to the normal retirement age of 60 in the Fund rules, an early retirement reduction factor of 28.75% has been applied, in accordance with the Fund rules.
The increase in the accrued pension over FY10 includes an amount in relation to the removal of a cap on the level of pensionable salary used to determine the pension benefit for service before April 2006.
Prior to April 2006, pensionable salary was limited to an earnings cap 105,600 for 2005 06.
This restriction was removed in April 2006 for all members of the Fund, subject to the member meeting 25% of the additional cost of providing the uncapped benefit for service before April 2006 through additional contributions.
Peter Clarke has made the necessary contributions under the rules of the Fund and is therefore entitled to this benefit.
There have been no other enhancements to the accrued pension.
Peter Clarke elected to take part of his pension as a cash lump sum of 531,747, as permitted by the Fund rules.
The accrued pension figure shown is before the reduction applied in exchange for the cash lump sum under the Fund rules.
Peter Clarke will not accrue any further benefits in the Man Group plc Pension Fund.
Future pension provision will be provided via an alternative pension arrangement into which the Company will contribute 14% of basic salary.
b T he increase in accrued pension figures compare the accrued pension as at 31 March 2009 payable from age 60 against the early retirement pension actually in payment as at 31 March 2010.
The early retirement pension was subject to an early retirement discount of 28.75%.
The increase in transfer value therefore reflects the fact that whilst the increase in pension amount is small, the 2009 pension amount was payable from age 60, but the 2010 pension is in payment from age 50 and so its value is proportionately higher.
c These figures have been adjusted so that they are net of directors contribution paid during the year, including a salary sacrifice waiver of pensionable base salary totalling 87,706. d The transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the relevant legislation using the approach set by the Trustees of the Fund.
The approach used by the Trustees to calculate transfer values was revised in July 2009, leading to higher transfer values going forwards.
e The transfer value figures at 31 March 2010 include the benefits paid to Peter Clarke between 1 March and 31 March 2010 including his cash lump sum.
They are calculated based on market conditions as at 31 March 2010.
