Directors Remuneration Report Directors Remuneration Report Introduction This is the Directors Remuneration Report of International Personal Finance plc the Company which has been prepared pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 420 of the Companies Act 2006 the Companies Act and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008.
In accordance with Section 439 of the Companies Act, a resolution to approve this Report will be proposed at the annual general meeting AGM of the Company to be held on 11 May 2011.
Unaudited information The following information, comprising details of the Remuneration Committee, the statement of the Companys policy on directors remuneration, the directors service agreements and the performance graph, is unaudited.
The Remuneration Committee Members From 1 January 2010 to 12 May 2010, the Committee consisted of Tony Hales and Nick Page under the chairmanship of Ray Miles.
On 12 May 2010 Ray Miles retired from the Board and so ceased to be Chairman of the Committee: on the same date Tony Hales became Chairman and John Lorimer became a member of the Committee.
Further details are set out in the report on the Remuneration Committee in the corporate governance statement.
Other matters Following a competitive tender held in October 2010, the Committee reappointed Kepler Associates Kepler as remuneration adviser.
Kepler is independent and does not provide any other services to the Group.
The Chief Executive Officer normally attends and speaks at meetings of the Committee other than when his own remuneration or any matter relating to him is being considered.
No director is involved in determining his her own remuneration.
The Company Secretary, Rosamond Marshall Smith, is Secretary to the Committee and attended the meetings of the Committee in 2010: as a solicitor she provides legal and technical support to the Committee.
The Human Resources Director Helen Thornton also attended most of the meetings of the Committee and provides advice to the Committee.
Statement of the Companys policy on directors remuneration Key principles of the remuneration policy The remuneration policy applied by the Committee: is cognisant of the need to attract, motivate and retain talent via remuneration at appropriate market levels: and recognises the need for prudence and effective risk management in its reward structures.
The remuneration policy is therefore founded on the following principles: target total remuneration reflecting effective performance will be around market median, based on an assessment of comparable positions from a cross-section of companies drawn from a combination of: relevant broad equity index, similar market capitalisation and broadly comparable sectoral profile: where performance has been demonstrated at a consistently high level, total remuneration above market median will be appropriate to attract and retain key talent: the fixed component of remuneration should be sufficient to allow for a fully flexible bonus plan: there will be no minimum bonus guarantees: flexible elements of total remuneration at executive director and senior management level are designed to ensure clear links to long-term performance, with suitably demanding targets aligned with the objective of creating sustainable shareholder value.
This means that a significant proportion of bonus will be deferred, and all sharebased incentives will be subject to an appropriate vesting period, as determined by the Remuneration Committee: www.
co. uk Directors Remuneration Report 77 Directors Remuneration Report continued no element of remuneration will be designed or applied in a way that is inconsistent with the Companys values and goals, or in a way that encourages the taking of inappropriate risk: and remuneration plans will be straightforward and easy to administer.
It is the Committees policy to consult with major shareholders before making significant changes.
Annual salary, benefits and fees As a result of the Chairman becoming non-executive in October 2008, his remuneration was reduced and his benefits were phased out over a period of time.
With effect from 1 January 2010, his remuneration was 150,000 a year.
His car was returned shortly before the end of the Companys lease in March 2010.
The executive directors remuneration consists of a basic salary, an annual bonus subject to performance conditions and with a deferred share element, participation in a long-term incentive plan and other benefits, including pension contributions.
Following a review of the provision of cars in the UK, the Committee has determined that company cars will not be replaced at the end of their leases and directors employees will receive a cash allowance instead.
Long-term disability cover under the Companys permanent health policy and medical cover is provided for the executive directors and their immediate families.
Benefits in kind are not pensionable.
The Committee normally reviews the executive directors remuneration annually with effect from 1 January.
For 2011 a review was carried out, taking into account market levels, individual performance and the absolute growth in the Company.
The Chief Executive Officers salary was increased by 6.7% to 480,000 and the Finance Directors salary was increased by 24% to 310,000.
However, in the latter case, this was offset by a reduction in pension contribution from 30% to 20% of basic salary.
The increase for the Finance Director reflected his continued performance in the role and the Committees intention to bring his salary broadly into line with the market.
In carrying out the review the Committee took into account the pay and employment conditions within the Group.
The fees for the non-executive directors are fixed by the Board and are designed both to recognise the responsibilities of non-executive directors and to attract individuals with the necessary skills and experience.
Their business expenses are reimbursed by the Company.
Following a review of market trends, the basic non-executive fee was increased from 45,000 to 50,000 a year with effect from 1 March 2010.
The Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee receives an additional 15,000 and the Senior Independent Director Chairman of the Remuneration Committee receives an additional 20,000 a year.
Bonuses An annual bonus is payable to the executive directors, subject to satisfaction of performance conditions which include, where applicable, appropriate environmental, social and governance matters.
During 2010 the executive directors were eligible for a bonus by reference to pre-tax profit and personal objectives, subject to a maximum of 100% of basic salary.
A maximum of 60% of basic salary is payable by reference to the amount of pre-tax profit for 2010 with a maximum of 40% payable by reference to personal objectives.
Awards for achievement of performance objectives will be expressed as a percentage of the award for profit and so will scale up or down according to the profit achievement.
No bonus is payable unless a minimum profit threshold is achieved.
The Chief Executive Officer had objectives relating to delivery of the budget and plan to 2014, achieving the necessary funding for the plan, strengthening and ensuring succession planning and three aspects of improving the business model.
The Finance Director had objectives relating to change management, strengthening internal financial resource, achieving the necessary funding for the plan and key projects to improve systems and procedures.
The Committee proposes a slight amendment to the balance of the performance conditions used to calculate the bonus.
For 2011 a balanced scorecard approach will be used whereby 50% of the bonus will be calculated on pre-tax profit performance and, subject always to a minimum profit threshold, the remaining 50% calculated against stretching performance objectives in the following areas: growth and development, culture and leadership, operational effectiveness, people, customer experience and brand and reputation.
78 International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Directors Remuneration Report For 2010 and subsequent years a new scheme was introduced for executive directors.
The bonus is payable partly in cash, and partly in deferred shares which will vest at the end of a three-year period, subject to the director not being dismissed for misconduct.
There are also provisions for clawback in the event of a restatement of the Companys accounts or material misjudgement of performance.
The Committee believes that this deferral into shares strengthens the alignment with shareholders interests.
Bonuses do not form part of pensionable earnings.
A similar scheme, at reduced opportunity levels, operates for the Senior Management Group and Group subsidiary directors.
A shareholder consultation is being carried out relating to a proposal to add a matching element.
Further details are set out below in the section: New policy on equity incentive schemes.
The Company in general meeting approved the International Personal Finance plc Deferred Share Plan the Deferred Share Plan for this purpose on 12 May 2010.
Equity incentive schemes In addition to the Deferred Share Plan, the Company currently operates three equity incentive schemes for directors and employees.
These are: The International Personal Finance plc Performance Share Plan the Performance Share Plan : The International Personal Finance plc Company Share Option Plan the CSOP, and The International Personal Finance plc Employee Savings-Related Share Option Scheme the SAYE Scheme.
The Performance Share Plan and the SAYE Scheme were put in place in June 2007 shortly before the demerger from Provident Financial plc PF on 16 July 2007 and were individually approved by the shareholders of PF.
The CSOP was approved by the Company in general meeting on 12 May 2010 and is designed to operate alongside the Performance Share Plan.
In addition, the Company operated The International Personal Finance plc Incentive Plan the Incentive Plan for the Chairman who was initially executive, the executive directors and some members of the Senior Management Group from the demerger until 16 July 2010 when all outstanding awards lapsed.
No further awards can be made under the Incentive Plan.
The Performance Share Plan Executive directors with effect from July 2010 and senior management all participate in this plan.
The policy is for annual awards of up to 100% and 75% of basic salary to be made to executive directors and senior managers respectively.
The awards, generally made as nil cost options over a specific number of shares, will vest after a three-year performance period with vesting determined by absolute TSR performance targets and by employment conditions.
No awards will vest if TSR growth is less than 30%.
33% of the award will vest if TSR growth is 30% and 100% will vest if TSR growth is 60%.
If growth in TSR is between 30% and 60%, vesting will be on a straight-line basis.
50% of vested awards will be released after the end of the performance period, with 50% deferred for an additional 12 months.
The Committee believes that absolute TSR is a simple and objective measure of shareholder value creation and appropriate for the Company, given the lack of comparable listed companies.
In addition to meeting the TSR target, for any shares to vest the Committee will need to satisfy itself that the absolute TSR performance is a fair reflection of performance, specifically with regard to the Companys TSR relative to the median TSR of the FTSE 250.
The CSOP The CSOP is an HM Revenue & Customs approved scheme.
The use of these options may enable part of a UK-based executives rewards from share plans to be received with relief from income tax and national insurance contributions within the thresholds permitted by HM Revenue & Customs, which allows options over shares with a value of 30,000 at the time of option grant to be held by an individual under the CSOP at any time.
Where an individual who receives CSOP share options also participates in an award made under the Performance Share Plan, the award under the Performance Share Plan is scaled back appropriately to reflect the grant of CSOP share options, and grants made under both plans have the same performance conditions for vesting.
co. uk Directors Remuneration Report 79 Directors Remuneration Report continued The SAYE Scheme The executive directors together with other UK Group employees may participate in the SAYE Scheme, which has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs.
Participants save a fixed sum each month for three or five years and may use these funds to purchase shares after three, five or seven years.
The exercise price is fixed at up to 20% below the market value of the shares at the date directors and employees are invited to participate in the scheme.
Up to 250 can be saved each month.
This scheme does not contain performance conditions as it is an HM Revenue & Customs approved scheme open to employees at all levels.
New policy on equity incentive schemes The Committee has carried out a review of the current equity incentive schemes, both as regards their operation and whether grant levels, performance criteria and vesting schedules remain appropriate to the Companys current circumstances and prospects.
As a result of this review it is proposed, subject to shareholder approval, to add a matching element to the Deferred Share Plan.
The match would be one-for-one for executive directors and one-forthree for the Senior Management Group.
Matching awards will only vest to the extent the performance condition is satisfied.
It is proposed to use growth in TSR on the same basis used for the Performance Share Plan.
Further details are contained in the Chairmans letter to shareholders that will accompany the Notice of AGM.
It is proposed that, if approved by shareholders, the first matching awards would be made in 2012.
Service agreements Executive directors service agreements provide for both the Company and the director to give one years notice.
No director has a service agreement containing a liquidated damages clause on termination: in the event of the termination of an agreement, the Company seeks mitigation of loss by the director concerned and aims to ensure that any payment made is the minimum which is commensurate with the Companys legal obligations.
Other directorships The Company will normally permit a full-time executive director to hold one non-executive directorship and to retain the fee from that appointment, subject to the prior approval of the Board.
No executive director currently holds such a position.
Shareholding policy Directors and senior managers are expected to acquire over a five-year period from 1 January 2011 or from appointment a beneficial shareholding as follows: Number Category of shares Chairman 45,000 Chief Executive Officer 250,000 Other executive directors 150,000 Non-executive directors 15,000 Senior Management Group 40,000 Other senior managers dependent on seniority 12,000 6,000 Senior management remuneration The Committee also determines the structure and level of pay of the Senior Management Group and Company Secretary.
Half of the Senior Management Group currently have salaries ranging from 145,000 to 150,000 and half have salaries ranging from 150,001 to 195,000.
Details of directors service agreements Re-election of directors At the AGM, all of the directors will be offering themselves for re-election.
80 International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Directors Remuneration Report Chairman Christopher Rodrigues has a letter of appointment with the Company dated 4 January 2010, terminable on three months notice from him or the Company.

Each of these service agreements is terminable upon one years notice from the relevant director or the Company and will automatically terminate when the relevant director reaches normal retirement age 65.
However, in the event that a director is not re-elected at an AGM of the Company, the agreement is automatically terminated and this is treated as a breach by the Company.

The initial three-year period may be extended.
The Company can terminate the appointment on three months notice.

Pensions and life assurance Background In order to provide continuity of benefits for employees, the Company established two pension schemes which broadly mirrored those operated by PF at the demerger date.
These are the International Personal Finance plc Pension Scheme the Pension Scheme and the International Personal Finance Stakeholder Pension Scheme the Stakeholder Scheme.
Since the demerger date, new employees have been eligible to join the Stakeholder Scheme.
One director had a defined contribution arrangement.
One director became a deferred member of the Pension Scheme in 2008 so that he does not accrue any further benefits but his benefits are increased to take account of inflation and then had a defined contribution arrangement.
Pensions review Following a consultation with members of the Pension Scheme, on 1 March 2010 the Pension Scheme was closed to future accrual and all the active members became deferred members.
They were offered membership of the Stakeholder Scheme with effect from 1 March.
It was also decided by the Committee that the standard rate of company contribution for any executive director should be 20% of basic salary, but that existing executive directors already receiving higher contributions should continue to do so unless and until it became appropriate to make a change.
Existing schemes The Pension Scheme is a defined benefit scheme with two sections: cash balance and final salary.
The Company will continue to fund the cash balance pension pot or final salary built up by members up to 28 February 2010.
Benefits will increase from 1 March 2010 until normal retirement date broadly in line with inflation up to a maximum of 5% a year.
The Stakeholder Scheme will continue to be managed by Legal & General Assurance Society Limited.
Employees contribute a minimum of 5% and the Company contributes a percentage of basic salary, depending on the employees seniority.
Chief Executive Officer John Harnett has a defined contribution personal pension arrangement.
He has life assurance benefit of four times salary at date of death.
The Company contributes 25% of his basic salary to his pension arrangements.
84 International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Directors Remuneration Report The Companys contributions in respect of John Harnett during 2010 including the cost of the life insurance amounted to 114,533.
Finance Director David Broadbent was a member of the final salary section of the Pension Scheme until 1 April 2006 when he began to accrue benefits as a member of the cash balance section.
He ceased to be a member of the cash balance section on 31 July 2008 and became a deferred member of the Pension Scheme.
Details of David Broadbents entitlements under both sections of the Pension Scheme are as follows: Final salary Accrued pension at 31 December 2010 13,020 Accrued pension at 31 December 2009 13,205 Increase in accrued pension during the year net of inflation Transfer value of net increase in accrual over period Transfer value of accrued pension at 31 December 2010 114,654 Transfer value of accrued pension at 31 December 2009 170,589 Total change in transfer value during the period net of directors contributions 55,935 Directors contributions in 2010 Cash Balance Accrued cash balance lump sum at 31 December 2010 92,817 Accrued cash balance lump sum at 31 December 2009 94,135 Increase in cash balance lump sum during the year net of inflation Transfer value at 31 December 2010 35,736 Transfer value at 31 December 2009 60,910 Total change in transfer value during the period net of directors contributions 25,174 Directors contributions in 2010 David Broadbent was age 42 at the end of the year.
David Broadbent now has a defined contribution personal pension arrangement.
In 2010 the Company contributed 30% of his basic salary to his pension arrangements.
The Companys contributions in respect of David Broadbent during 2010 including the cost of the life insurance amounted to 76,130.
For 2011, the Company will contribute 20% of his basic salary to his pension arrangements.
Other The former director Craig Shannon was a member of the Scheme from 1 March 2010.
The Companys contributions up to 6 August 2010 were 28,508.
He also received 46,399 as a pension supplement: of this, 38,000 was accrued in 2009 whilst the Company carried out a pensions review.
Compensation for a past director Craig Shannon ceased to be a director of the Company on 6 August 2010 and ceased to be an employee on 31 December 2010 the Termination Date.
Between 6 August and the Termination Date he was paid 120,769 in salary, 6,441 in car allowance, 23,057 in respect of pension contributions and he received non-cash benefits to the value of 2,713.
Following the Termination Date, pursuant to the compromise agreement made between the Company and Craig Shannon: he was paid 66,098 as compensation for loss of employment: he was paid 10,385 in accrued holiday pay in respect of 2010: www.
co. uk Directors Remuneration Report 85 Directors Remuneration Report continued he is being paid 174,078 as a payment in lieu of notice, payable in seven monthly instalments up until 15 July 2011 the Payment : and pension contributions are being made for him by the Company into the Stakeholder Scheme of 3,000 a month until 5 April 2011 and thereafter a further pension contribution of 44,030 will be made, payable in four instalments by the Company between 1 May and 31 August 2011 the Pension Payment.
He has the option to elect to take the 44,030 as a cash sum payable in four instalments.
If Craig Shannon obtains employment before 7 August 2011 the Payment and the Pension Payment will be reduced by reference to the gross amount of earnings from that employment.
The Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion to permit Craig Shannon to retain the award over 105,140 shares granted to him under the Performance Share Plan in December 2009.
The performance condition will be applied in the usual way in December 2012 but the number of shares which vest will be time prorated so that a maximum of 44% of the original award may vest.
He may exercise his award over half of any shares that vest within 12 months of December 2012 and over the remaining half within 12 months of December 2013.
Given that Craig Shannon was entitled to a years notice from the Company, the Committee considers that the compensation represented a fair settlement of the Companys contractual and statutory obligations and takes account of his duty to mitigate.
Approved by the Board on 2 March 2011.
