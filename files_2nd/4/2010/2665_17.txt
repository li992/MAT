The equity incentive opportunity provided under the Value Creation Plan has been set at the upper quartile against the comparators.
The rationale behind why the Remuneration Committee felt that this VCP was most appropriate is set out in the previous section and full details of the VCP are provided in this report on page 63.
indd 59 06 05 2011 04:48 PartyGaming Plc Annual Report 2010 PartyGaming Plc Annual Report 2010 Remuneration report 60 60 Long-term incentive plans for 2010 Plan: Executive Share Option Plan ESOP Eligibility: Executive Directors and Senior Managers only Introduced: 2007 Purpose: Focus participants on long-term financial growth Grants: Annual Annual award range: 45,000 to 250,000 Shares Maximum award: 200% of salary exceptional Strike price: Yes closing price day before grant Vesting: After three years Voting and dividend rights: None Source of Shares: New issue Performance condition: 2008 and 2009 awards subject to average Clean EPS growth being at least 15% per annum over the three-year period.
2010 awards adopted a sliding scale rather than cliff vesting, with the threshold for which 25% of an award would vest, set at 5% Clean EPS growth of 5% per annum, rising on a straightline basis to 100% vesting for growth of 15% per annum.
Status: In accordance with the rules performance of all outstanding awards measured to date of EGM.
All awards failed to satisfy the performance condition and all so awards lapsed.
No new awards to be granted.
Plan: Performance Share Plan PSP Eligibility: Executive Directors and Senior Managers only Introduced: 2007 Purpose: Focus participants on long-term external performance relative to peers Grants: Annual Annual award range: 45,000 to 250,000 shares Maximum award: 300% of salary exceptional Strike price: No Vesting: After three years Voting and dividend rights: None Source of Shares: New issue or Employee Trust Performance condition: Three-year TSR performance relative to a peer group.
For 2008 and 2009 awards peer group was 888 Holdings, bwin, Cryptologic, Ladbrokes, Paddy Power, Sportingbet, Unibet and William Hill.
For 2010 half of an award vested dependent on the TSR performance against the TSR performance of the FTSE 250 excluding investment companies and the vesting of the balance of the award was dependent on the TSR performance against a comparator group of 888 Holdings, 32Red, bwin, Betsson, Cryptologic, Gigamedia, Paddy Power, Playtech, Rank Group, Scientific Games, Sportingbet and Unibet.
For all awards the threshold level of performance, for which 25% of an award would vest requires the Companys TSR to equal the median of the comparator group, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting if the Companys TSR exceeds the median by 10% per annum over the threeyear period equivalent to upper quartile performance.
The Remuneration Committee also has to be satisfied that actual performance over the three-year period is a genuine reflection of the Companys performance.
Status: March 2008 awards performance period 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2010 outperformed peer group by 10.8% per annum so will vest 100%.
For awards made subsequently, the Remuneration Committee, as disclosed in the Prospectus and Circular, has exercised its discretionary powers and measured the TSR performance condition up to the date of the EGM to determine the number of shares capable of vesting.
Vesting will still occur on the original vesting dates and is subject to continued employment.
This approach was adopted because i the treatment is consistent with the ESOP, ii post merger the VCP and BBP are the appropriate plans for driving performance and iii it is an equitable arrangement for all stakeholders, as it rewards participants for performance up to the merger, but retains the original vesting dates.
These awards will vest as follows: October 2008 awards: TSR outperformance of 4.1% determining that 55.5% of each award will vest on 30 September 2011.

The first award was granted on 10 October 2008 at a strike price of 155 pence per share and the performance period runs from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2011.
The second award was granted on 9 April 2009 and the performance period runs from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011.
2 This award was made on 5 March 2010 and the applicable performance period runs from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2012.
3 The future vesting of these awards is conditional on the participant continuing to be employed by the Company on the relevant vesting dates and the relevant performance conditions being satisfied, save that in the event that employment ceases before vesting owing to factors such as injury, disability or ill health, then unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions, a proportion of an award may vest.
In the event of a change of control of the Company or a scheme of arrangement, depending on the circumstances, the ESOP rules allow for pro-rated vesting subject to the extent the performance condition has been satisfied or for the award to be exchanged for an equivalent award granted by the acquiring company.
Subsequent to the year-end, in accordance with the ESOP rules, the performance conditions of all outstanding ESOP awards was measured to 28 January 2011, the date on which Shareholders approved the merger with bwin.
The Remuneration Committee concluded that the performance conditions had not been satisfied and all outstanding awards lapsed on 22 February 2011.
4 This amount is made up of two awards.
The first award was made on 10 October 2008 over 645,100 Shares and the TSR performance period runs from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2011.
The second award was made on 9 April 2009 over 125,000 Shares and the TSR performance period runs from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011.
5 This award was made on 9 April 2010 and the applicable performance period runs from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2012.
6 As described on page 56 of this report, the Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion in relation to the bwin merger transaction and measured the performance conditions of all three outstanding awards to 28 January 2011, the date of the Companys EGM to approve the merger with bwin.
The Remuneration Committee has concluded that the October 2008 has partly satisfied its performance condition and 55.5% of the total award 358,030 Shares will vest on 30 September 2011.
In addition, the April 2009 performance condition has been satisfied to its maximum potential and therefore 125,000 Shares of that award will vest on 31 March 2012 respectively.
The 2010 award failed to satisfy its performance condition and will lapse in its entirety on the merger taking effect.
7 This award was made on 30 June 2008.
This award is split into two tranches: Tranche 1 vested 100,000 Shares on grant, 200,000 Shares on 30 June 2009, 62,500 Shares on 30 September 2009 and 62,500 Shares on 31 December 2009.
375,000 Shares vest every quarter in six lots of 62,500 Shares beginning on 31 March 2010 and ending on 30 June 2011.
200,000 Shares vest in 4 lots of 50,000 Shares between 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2012, with the first quarterly vesting on 30 September 2011.
The total number of Shares vesting under Tranche 1 is 1,000,000 Shares.
Tranche 2 vests 100,000 Shares in 4 quarterly lots of 25,000 Shares between 30 June 2010 and 30 June 2011, with the first quarterly vesting on 30 September 2010.
Between 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2012 100,000 Shares will vest in 4 quarterly tranches of 25,000 Shares commencing with the first vesting on 30 September 2011.
Finally, between 30 June 2012 and 30 June 2013 300,000 Shares will vest in 4 quarterly amounts of 75,000 Shares commencing with the first vesting on 30 September 2012.
The total number of Shares vesting under Tranche 2 is 500,000 Shares.
The future vesting of this award is conditional on the participants continued employment by the Company on the relevant vesting dates, save as described as follows.
In the event of the termination of his employment by the Company for cause, he will be entitled to exercise the award only in respect of the Shares which have vested as at the date the notice of resignation or termination is given notice date.
If employment is terminated by the Company for any reason other than for cause then, subject to the participant entering into a written waiver and release of all claims against the Group relating to his employment or its termination, he will also be entitled to exercise his option in respect of the Shares which would have vested under Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 in the 12 months following the notice date.
In the event of the participants resignation then the Tranche 1 and 2 Shares vest on the same basis as if the Company had terminated his employment without cause.
On a change of control of the Company the participant shall be entitled to vest all outstanding Tranche 1 and 2 Shares.
This option is unaffected by the merger.
The Combined Code on Corporate Governance recommends that performance-related elements of remuneration should form a significant proportion of the total remuneration package of executive directors.
Whilst this award forms a significant part of the CEOs remuneration package, the Remuneration Committee was of the view that a performance condition would detract from the attraction and retention capabilities of the award and it was necessary to make the award on these terms in order to secure the CEOs service over an initial five-year term.
All other awards granted to the CEO provide for vesting to be conditional on the satisfaction of stretching performance conditions.
The Combined Code also recommends that executive share options should not be offered at a discount.
This award has been granted at nil-cost on issue and exercise.
At the time the award was made the Remuneration Committee was of the view that such terms were necessary in order for the Company to either secure or retain his long-term service.
8 This amount is made up of three awards.
The first award was granted on 11 May 2007 over 88,360 Shares with a strike price of 457.50 pence and a performance period that ran from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2009.
The Remuneration Committee determined in 2010, in conjunction with the Boards approval of the Companys 2009 annual financial statements, that the Clean EPS performance condition attaching to this first award had been met.
This award therefore vested on 25 February 2010, but will lapse if not exercised before completion of the merger with bwin.
The second award was made on 6 March 2008 over 171,402 Shares with a strike price of 250.00 pence and the performance period runs from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2010.
The third award was made on 9 April 2009 with a strike price of 227.00 pence and the performance period runs from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011.

The first award was granted on 6 March 2008 over 171,402 Shares and the TSR performance period runs from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2010.
Subsequent to the year-end the Remuneration Committee determined that the TSR performance condition had been met to its maximum potential and therefore all the Shares will vest under this award on 31 March 2011.
The second award was made on 9 April 2009 over 337,500 Shares and the performance period runs from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011.
11 This award was made on 9 April 2010 and the performance period runs from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2012.
12 As described on page 56 of this report, the Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion in relation to the bwin merger transaction and measured the performance conditions of the April 2009 and April 2010 awards to 28 January 2011, the date of the Companys EGM to approve the merger with bwin.
The Remuneration concluded that the April 2009 awards performance condition had been satisfied to its maximum potential and therefore subject to the merger taking effect, 337,500 Shares will vest on 31 March 2012.
13 These Shares relate to three awards made on 6 April 2005, 29 December 2006 and 9 April 2009.
The first two awards finished vesting on 31 December 2008.
The third award vests in four lots of 50,000 Shares on 31 December 2009, 31 December 2010, 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2012.
Unvested Shares vest on a change of control.
In the event of the participants resignation or the termination of his employment by the Company for cause, he will be entitled to exercise the award only in respect of the Shares which have vested as at the date the notice of resignation or termination is given notice date.
If employment is terminated by the Company for any reason other than for cause then, subject to the participant entering into a written waiver and release of all claims against the Group relating to his employment or its termination, he will also be entitled to exercise the award in respect of the Shares which would have vested in the 12 months following the notice date.
In the event of a change of control of the Company, all unvested Shares will vest.

party Rollover Option Plan In addition to the four new share plans described above the Company is also introducing the bwin.
party Rollover Option Plan ROP.
The purpose of the ROP is to effect the grant of rollover options over bwin.
party Shares to replace unexercised options granted under the two bwin fair market value option plans.
On the day the merger takes effect the bwin options over bwin shares will be rolled into equivalent options under the ROP over bwin.
party Shares on terms which reflect the same exchange ratio as applies to bwin shareholders.
The ROP generally replicates the commercial terms of the bwin option plans, save that the exercise price will be expressed in pounds sterling and not euros.
There are bwin options over approximately 2.8 million bwin shares and so applying the merger share exchange ratio of 12.23 bwin.
party Shares for each bwin share, all options under the two bwin option plans will be rolled over into an aggregate of approximately 35.0 million shares under the ROP.
party Shares will be issued to satisfy exercised ROP awards, however, these bwin.
party Shares will not count towards the Companys 10% dilution limit.
indd 65 06 05 2011 04:48 PartyGaming Plc Annual Report 2010 PartyGaming Plc Annual Report 2010 Remuneration report 66 66 The Employee Benefit Trust In April 2005 the Companys Principal Shareholders established the PartyGaming Plc Shares Trust the Employee Trust.
In June 2005 at the time of the IPO, the Principal Shareholders effectively gifted 22.4 million Shares to the Employee Trust 224 million Shares prior to the 10 for 1 share consolidation carried out in May 2008.
On 29 December 2006, following the passing of the UIGEA, certain Principal Shareholders gifted a further 4 million Shares 40 million Shares prior to the consolidation to the Employee Trust as part of a key employee retention programme.
These Shares have been used to satisfy the exercise of awards made under the Nil-Cost Plan.
As a result, to date the exercise of options awarded under the Nil-Cost Plan Nil-Cost Options has not been dilutive to those Shareholders or Depositary Interest Holders investing in PartyGaming from the IPO.
Despite Nil-Cost Option exercises using these Shares not having a cash impact on the Company, International Financial Reporting Standards require the fair value of the Nil-Cost Options to be amortised through the statement of comprehensive income over their vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the Shares that will eventually vest.
Following the acquisition of Cashcade in 2009, the Company granted Nil-Cost Options to a small number of key Cashcade employees for the purpose of securing their retention beyond the two-year acquisition earn-out.
As the Employee Trust did not have sufficient unallocated Shares to provide for these awards, the Company gifted sufficient funds to the Employee Trust to purchase 1 million existing Shares in the market, which it carried out on 21 October 2009.
Consequently, the acquisition of these Shares has had a cash impact on the Company.
The Company may in the future make further such donations to the Employee Trust if the Board deems such action to be in the best interests of the Company.
As at 28 February 2011, the Trust held 3,994,588 Shares, all of which have been allocated to existing Nil-Cost Share Options.
The Trusts trustee has waived all dividend and voting rights attaching to the Shares in the Trust.
