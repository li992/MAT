25% of the TSR part vests if the Company is ranked median, rising until 100% vests if the Company is ranked in the upper quartile.
The threshold at which 25% vests and maximum targets are 16.5p and 19.0p for EPS and 11.5% and 12.5% for ROACE.
The vesting of each award granted in 2009 is split 80% based on the Companys TSR compared to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Industrial Goods and Services Supersector, and 20% based on the average ROACE.
The threshold at which 25% vests and maximum targets are 10.3% and 11.5% for ROACE.
Mr Thorne stepped down from the Board on 4 May 2010 and his employment terminated on 18 May 2010.
The performance conditions attached to the award granted in 2008 were not met as at 18 May 2010.
Accordingly, the award has lapsed.
The performance conditions for the 2009 award were tested by reference to 18 May 2010.
100% of the TSR element will vest on 24 June 2010, subject to a time pro-rata reduction to reflect the unexpired portion of the performance period at cessation.
Accordingly, 34.9% of the TSR element will vest and so 216,753 shares will be released to Mr Thorne on 24 June 2010.
The performance conditions for the ROACE element were not met and accordingly that element of the award has lapsed.
In accordance with the rules of the PSP 7,152.84 will be paid on the same date in respect of the time pro-rated dividends earned since the award was made.
P DIRECTORS INTERESTS IN SHARE OPTIONS AUDITABLE Following shareholder approval of the PSP in September 2008, the Executive Share Option Scheme ceased to be operated, the last award having been made in 2007.
Directors interests in share options over ordinary shares are as follows: Options Options held at Options Options Options held at Dates 30 April granted exercised lapsed 30 April Exercise price from which Executive Director 2009 during year during year during year 2010 p exercisable Expiry date A D Thorne 243,979 243,979 135.23 26 Jul 05 25 Jul 12 241,245 241,245 149.22 31 Jul 06 30 Jul 13 207,500 207,500 159.00 2 Aug 08 1 Aug 15 239,050 239,050 149.00 1 Aug 09 31 Jul 16 155,600 155,600 240.00 31 Jul 10 30 Jul 17 All of the above options were granted for nil consideration.
The market price of the ordinary shares at 30 April 2010 was 135.2p and the range during the year was 58p to 143p.
Aggregate gains made by Directors on exercise of share options in the year were nil 2008 09: nil.
There is no retest facility for options granted since 2004.
For these share options to become exercisable, the growth in the Companys normalised EPS must match or exceed the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index plus an average of 3% per annum over three years.
During the transition to IFRS, the Committee ensured that a consistent basis was used to measure earnings per share performance.
Options granted in 2002, 2003 and 2005 became exercisable when they passed their respective performance conditions in 2008 and options granted in 2006 became exercisable when they passed their performance conditions in 2009.
Based on EPS performance to 30 April 2010, the options granted in 2007 will fail their performance conditions and therefore will lapse.
For this purpose, the EPS growth is based on adjusted EPS as disclosed in the Annual Report, except that the Committee may adjust this figure in exceptional circumstances where this is appropriate.
The verification of the calculation of EPS growth has been performed by Hewitt New Bridge Street, in their capacity as advisers to the Committee.
The performance condition attached to Mr Thornes share options granted in 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2006 was met and accordingly these options will remain exercisable until 18 November 2010.
Performance in relation to the options granted in 2007 will be tested following the publication of the 2009 10 results.
It is expected that these performance conditions will not be met.
Accordingly, the award will lapse immediately.

If the Companys TSR is ranked at the upper quartile of the group or higher, the full award will vest reducing on a straight-line basis to 30% of the award vesting for median performance.
None of the award vests for below median performance.
TSR performance is measured over a single period of three financial years starting with the year in which the award is made.
In addition to the TSR condition, no awards will vest, irrespective of TSR performance, unless the Companys EPS growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index over the three-year period.
For this purpose, following the introduction of IFRS, the EPS growth will be based on adjusted EPS as disclosed in the Annual Report, except that the Committee may adjust this figure in exceptional circumstances where this is appropriate.
The calculation of TSR performance is performed by Hewitt New Bridge Street, in their capacity as advisers to the Committee.
The awards made under the LTIP in 2006 lapsed during the year as the performance conditions were not met.
Based on performance to 30 April 2010, the awards made under the LTIP in 2007 also lapsed as the performance conditions were not met.

The Committee made this award, in exceptional circumstances, to facilitate the recruitment of Mr Dryden as the new Group Finance Director.
The number of shares awarded was determined by reference to the value of the entitlement to shares he forfeited under his previous arrangements.
The first tranche vested on 1 March 2009, as reported in the 2009 accounts, and the second tranche vested on 1 March 2010 and 38,504 shares were transferred to Mr Dryden on 9 March 2010 allowing time for the market to assimilate the Interim Management Statement.
At the same time, Mr Dryden sold 15,820 of the acquired shares at a price of 125.4p per share in order to pay the income tax, NIC and dealing expenses due following the vesting.
In normal circumstances, the remaining shares will vest on 1 March 2011, as shown in the table above, subject only to Mr Drydens continued employment with the Company.
This date corresponds to the date when Mr Drydens arrangements in his previous employment would have vested.

U DIRECTORS PENSION ENTITLEMENTS AUDITABLE Mr Thorne was a member of the defined benefit scheme provided by the Group during the year, with death in service cover.
His pension entitlement and corresponding transfer values increased as follows: Transfer value of Increase in Total net increase in Transfer value of Transfer value of Total change in Gross increase in accrued pension accrued pension accrual over period accrued pension accrued pension value during period accrued pension net of inflation at 31 March 2010 net of Directors at 31 March 2010 at 30 April 2009 net of Directors 1 2 3 contribution 4 5 6 contribution 7 Name of Director A D Thorne 28,860 28,860 173,908 707,639 4,468,967 3,148,759 1,304,038 Pension accruals shown are the amounts which would be paid annually on retirement, based on service to the end of the period.
Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the Group Pension Scheme Trustees method and assumptions for the calculation of Cash Equivalent Transfer Values.
The value of net increase 4 represents the incremental value to the Director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption that service terminated at 31 March 2010.
It is based on the accrued pension increase 2 after deducting the Directors contribution.
The change in transfer value 7 includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and Directors, such as stock market movements.
It is calculated after deducting the Directors contribution.
Mr Thorne commenced receipt of these benefits on 31 March 2010 and so figures have been provided at that date.
Mr Thorne elected to receive a lump sum of 1,246,609 in lieu of part of his pension entitlement.
The accrued pension 3 is prior to commutation and shows the gross pension and the figures in columns 2 and 4 are based on this.
The transfer value 5 in the table allows for the lump sum payment.
If allowance is excluded, in accordance with Companies Act Regulations, the value reduces to 3,222,358 and the change in value becomes 57,429.
