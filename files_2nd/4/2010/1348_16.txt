EPS for the purpose of the awards was based on the profit before tax, exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangibles less a notional 30% tax charge for awards made for years up to 2006 7.
Thereafter awards have been based on EPS computed using the same profit definition less the actual tax charge included in the accounts.
The Remuneration Committee considers it most appropriate to measure TSR performance relative to the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts rather than a specific comparator group of companies because there are few direct comparators to the Company listed in London and because the Company is a FTSE 250 company.
Following consultation with the Companys major shareholders in 2008, the Committee reintroduced a TSR performance target for its 2008 9 PSP awards in addition to an EPS target.
Given the cyclical nature of our business the Committee intends to vary the proportion of the performance criteria represented by EPS and TSR over the cycle between 50% 50%, 75% 25% and 25% 75%.
For the forthcoming 2010 11 PSP awards, the Committee intends that vesting will be based 50% on TSR and 50% on EPS.
