Exercise of share options In the period under review options over 320,510 new subscription shares and 1,057,095 shares held by the Groups ESOP were exercised.
In order that the number of shares required by the ESOP to satisfy share awards be reduced, the Group agreed with employees that the number of shares acquired on the exercise of those options be reduced.
To ensure that employees were not disadvantaged by the reduction, the exercise prices applied on the exercise of the options were correspondingly reduced.
The options exercised during the year by the directors, in accordance with this agreement and on the original basis, were as follows: Original Reduced Original Reduced Date of Type of number of number of exercise exercise Market Gain Director exercise option shares shares price price value 000s Michael Slade 09.06.09 Purchase 500,000 269,000 150.0p 1p 325.0p 973 500,000 973 Gerald Kaye 09.06.09 Purchase 347,095 183,000 153.3p 1p 325.0p 663 347,095 663 Matthew Bonning-Snook 09.06.09 Purchase 210,000 113,000 150.0p 1p 325.0p 407 210,000 407 Jack Pitman 30.03.10 Subscription 299,310 n a 141.5p n a 336.1p 582 30.03.10 Subscription 21,200 n a 141.5p n a 336.1p 41 320,510 623 The market price of the ordinary shares at 31 March 2010 was 337.9p 2009: 287.5p.
This market price varied between 293.5p and 404.1p during the year.
The gains on exercise of share options by Michael Slade, Gerald Kaye and Matthew Bonning-Snook include a cash bonus of 20p per 1p share in accordance with the matter referred to under special dividend below.
Helical Bar 10 V24 AW 17 6 10 12:58 Page 47 directors remuneration report Helical Bar plc Report & accounts 2010 Special dividend In order to compensate option holders for the payment of a special dividend or a distribution of capital, the Board has, under the terms of the Helical Bar 1999 Share Option Scheme the Scheme, the authority to adjust the number of shares subject to option or the exercise price of those options.
The Group is unable to increase the number of shares under option in sufficient quantity to satisfy the requirement to compensate option holders for the special dividend of 100p paid in April 2002.
An adjustment to the exercise price of the existing options would 47 result in an increased national insurance cost to the Group.
Accordingly, the Board has considered alternative ways of compensating option holders and, as a result, the Group compensates holders of options at the time the special dividend was declared, on the dates they exercise their options by 20p per 1p share previously 100p per 5p share, equivalent to the special dividend.
In the year under review compensation of 211,000 was paid following the exercise of options over 1,057,095 1p shares.
Performance share plan At the 2004 Annual General Meeting the Group received approval for the adoption of a Performance Share Plan PSP.
General The operation of the PSP is supervised by the Committee.
The PSP is capable of delivering shares to an executive after a period of not less than three years, other than in exceptional circumstances and with the approval of the Committee, subject to meeting pre-specified performance targets.
Eligibility All employees of the Group and its subsidiaries including directors who are required to devote substantially the whole of their working time to the business of the Group who are not under notice nor within six months of any contractual retirement ages will be eligible to receive invitations to participate in the PSP at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Grant of awards Awards may be made within the six weeks following approval at a general meeting, the announcement by the Group of its results for any period, or the removal of any statutory or regulatory restriction which had previously prevented an award being granted or any other times considered by the Remuneration Committee to be exceptional.
No awards may be made more than ten years after the adoption of the PSP by the Group.
The Committee, advised by Hewitt New Bridge Street, reviewed the operation of the PSP during the year and it was agreed that no changes should be made.
An award consists of the right to acquire shares in the Group for either no payment or payment of a nominal sum.
Awards are neither transferable nor pensionable.
Limit on individual participation No awards may be granted over shares in any financial year whose value is greater than three times an employees annual rate of salary.
Exercise of awards Other than in exceptional circumstances, an award will vest no earlier than the third anniversary of its grant to the extent that the applicable performance conditions see below have been satisfied and the participant is still employed by the Group.
Once exercisable, awards will then remain capable of exercise for a period of normally no more than six months.
The Remuneration Committee has set demanding performance conditions for the vesting of shares.
There are two performance conditions, one based on absolute growth in the Groups net asset value per share and the other based on the gross ungeared total property return per share relative to other property funds as determined by IPD but excluding those funds worth less than 50m at the start of the three year period.
Performance will be measured over the three years following grant.
Participants will not normally be permitted to sell shares received through the PSP, other than to meet taxation and national insurance contributions liabilities, until they own shares to the value of 2 x salary for directors and 1 x salary for other executives.
For the growth in net asset value, the fully diluted triple net net asset value as at the start of the financial year in which a grant takes place will be compared to the value three years later having added back dividends.
Helical Bar 10 V24 AW 17 6 10 12:58 Page 48 directors remuneration report Helical Bar plc Report & accounts 2010 Applicable conditions a Absolute net asset value per share having added back dividends condition Annual compound increase after three years % of award vesting 15% p. a. or more 66.7 48 Between 7.5% p. a. and 15% p. a.
Zero If UK inflation RPI is higher than 3% per annum over the three year period then the required compound increases will be raised by the excess over the 3% per annum average.
b Total property return v IPD property funds condition Ranking after three years % of award vesting Upper quartile or above 33.3 Between median and upper quartile Pro rata between 3.3 and 33.3 Median 3.3 Less than median Zero Provided the net asset value per share having added back dividends increases over the three year period.
Share awards will lapse where the gross return falls below the IPD median and where the growth in triple net asset value is below 7.5% per annum over the three year period.
No share awards vest if the triple asset value falls over the three year period.
Alignment with shareholders interests The Remuneration Committee has analysed the potential gains that may be made by executives directors and those below Board level through the PSP and other incentive arrangements currently in place.
It has concluded that the share of the increase in the value of the Group measured as the increase in the net asset value plus cash returned as dividends to shareholders that could accrue to all executives through the Groups long and short-term incentive and bonus plans excluding gains on share options granted before December 2002 at the point at which the maximum awards vest might be of the order of 20%.
At this point, in absolute terms, the Group will have increased its triple net asset value by at least 15% per annum with the Groups relative performance placing it in the top quartile of IPD, over the three year period.
Vesting of Awards During the year the performance conditions relating to the third award, granted on 4 July 2006, were considered.
The three year performance period to 31 March 2009 showed that the net asset value per share, calculated in accordance with the terms of the PSP, had increased by 2.9% p. a.
During this three year period the total return of Helicals property portfolio, as determined by IPD, had increased by 5.5% p. a. compared to the upper quartile of the IPD Benchmark which had reduced by 5.9% p. a.
Therefore, although the net asset value performance criteria was not met, the IPD comparison performance criteria was met.
Accordingly, one third of the third award of shares vested and 482,061 shares, after deduction of shares sold to pay income tax, were transferred to award holders on 9 July 2009.
The value of the shares on that date which were attributable to the directors is included in the table of the Remuneration of Directors on page 50.
PSP awards granted in 2007 and 2008 to Michael Brown, who resigned from the Board on 4 June 2009, were cancelled on his resignation.
