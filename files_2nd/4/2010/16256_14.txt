The Bonus Investment Plan BIP was operated in 2010 and enables part of participants annual bonus to be deferred into UBM shares, which must be held for three years.
The plan also provides the opportunity to earn matching shares based on performance against stretching targets.
The Committee reviewed the performance conditions to be used in 2010 and felt that, given the degree of uncertainty in the economy and the resulting difficulty in calibrating three-year earnings targets, relative outperformance against peers was the most appropriate way to ensure that reward outcomes are a true reflection of increases in shareholder value.
Accordingly for 2010 the Committee adopted the same TSR based performance condition for the BIP as was used for the PSP.
