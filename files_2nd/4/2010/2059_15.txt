b Bonus figures for 2009 represent amounts payable in cash under the AIS in respect of the 2009 incentive year which were paid in March 2010.
Bonus figures for 2010 represent amounts due under the AIS for the 2010 incentive year which Executive Directors may receive in cash.
Martin Houston elected to voluntarily defer all of his AIS up to 100% of base salary under the Voluntary Bonus Deferral Plan.
Accordingly the amount of 535 000 will be delivered to him in March 2011 as an award over shares in BGGroup under that plan.
c The Deferred Bonus figures represent the bonus amounts in excess of 100% of base salary which are automatically deferred into awards over BGGroup shares.
Amounts for 2010 represent the face value of shares over which awards which will be granted in March 2011, and those for 2009, the value of awards which were granted in March 2010.
Awards made under the Deferred Bonus Plan will normally vest three years after the date of the award, and are subject to forfeiture on cessation of employment and in certain other specified circumstances.

Martin Houston accrues pension at the rate of 1 60 of his final 12 months salary for each year of pensionable service.
As is the case for all other UK employees who became pension scheme members before 6 April 2006, none of the Directors can be paid an immediate pension before age 60 on a non-actuarially reduced basis unless they have attained age 55 and completed ten years service with the Group including pensionable service transferred from previous employment and the Company expressly agrees to payment on an unreduced basis, or they are over the age of 50 and have been made redundant, or in the event of incapacity.

Change of control As described on page 65, the Executive Directors service contracts contain change of control provisions.
For the purposes of these provisions, a change of control is deemed to occur if the Company becomes a subsidiary of another company: or if 50% ormore of the voting rights of the Company or the right to appoint or remove the majority of the Board of the Company become vested in any individual or body or group of individuals or bodies acting in concert: or if all or substantially all of the business, assets and undertakings of the Company become owned by any person, firm or company other than a subsidiary or associated company.
A change of control is also deemed tooccur if the whole of the issued capital of BG Energy Holdings Limited or a substantial part of the undertaking of that Company including its subsidiaries is transferred to another company, unless that transferee company is a subsidiary of the Company, or a company ultimately owned bysubstantially the same shareholders as are the ultimate owners of the Company.
However, a change of control does not occur if and only if through a process of reconstruction the Company becomes a subsidiary of another company owned by substantially the same shareholders as are the shareholders of the Company.
The Executive Directors service contracts provide that any payments made pursuant to these provisions will be made, less any deductions the employer is required to make.
Any such payments shall be in full and final settlement of any claims the Executive Director may have against the employer or any associated company arising out of the termination of employment, except for any personal injury claim, any claim in respect of accrued pension rights, or statutory employment protection claims.
Non-Executive Directors The Board aims to recruit Non-Executive Directors of a high calibre, with broad commercial, international or other relevant experience.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed by the Board on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee.
Their appointment is for an initial term of three years, subject to election by shareholders at the first annual general meeting following their appointment and annual re-election thereafter.
The terms of engagement of the Non-Executive Directors are set out in a letter of appointment.
The basic annual fee paid to Non-Executive Directors increased from 75 000 to 77 500 on 1 July 2010.
Additional fees are also payable, for example, for membership of, or chairing, a Committee of the Board and acting as Senior Independent Director.
The current remuneration policy for Non-Executive Directors requires that fees are reviewed every two years, taking into account time commitment, competition for high-quality non-executive directors and market movements.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Companys share schemes, incentive schemes or pension schemes.
To facilitate the alignment of the interests of the Non-Executive Directors with those of shareholders, the Group has put in place a Non-Executive Directors share purchase programme through which Non-Executive Directors may elect to invest a proportion of their fees, net of tax and on a regular basis, to acquire BGGroup shares on the open market.
The first deductions were made under this programme in January 2010.
Chairman Sir Robert Wilson was initially appointed as Chairman with effect from 1 January 2004.
He was first re-appointed for a three-year term with effect from 1 January 2007 and following due consideration was re-appointed with effect from 1 January 2010, at which point his fee was increased to 700 000 per annum.
In line with the Non-Executive Directors, SirRobert Wilsons re-appointment is for a three-year term, subject to annual re-election by shareholders at the annual general meeting, and there is no notice period and no provision for payment in the event of early termination.
Sir Robert Wilsons fee was raised with effect from 1 January 2011 to 725 000 and is next subject to review on 1January 2012.
