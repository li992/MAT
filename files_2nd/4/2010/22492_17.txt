Directors Deferred Share Awards and LTIP Awards The deferred share award forms part of the annual performance related award and consists of the right for an executive to call for shares in the company from the employee benefit trust, at nil cost, together with a cash amount representing accrued notional dividends thereon.
If the executive leaves employment in certain circumstances prior to 1 August immediately preceding the vesting date those entitlements will lapse.
Following vesting, these shares may be called for at any time up to the seventh anniversary of grant.
The value of the awards is charged to the groups income statement in the year to which the award relates for deferred share awards, and spread over the vesting period for LTIP awards.
As a result of this performance testing, the minimum 5% real EPS growth target covering two thirds of the award was not met whilst the TSR performance was between the median and top 20% of the comparator group, warranting the vesting of 90.22% of the shares subject to this part of the award.
Accordingly some 70% of the original 2006 award shares lapsed during the year.
