Medium Term Incentive payments in respect of 2009 10 The Committee believes that any incentive compensation awarded should be tied to the interests of the Companys shareholders and that the principal measure of those interests is shareholder value.
The key variable element of the remuneration package in 2009 10 is the MTIS, reapproved by the shareholders in 2003.
Historically, in May each year, individuals were awarded a notional share in any investments made in that financial year a vintage.
Payments from the MTIS are calculated by reference to the individuals notional share of the realised gains on investments and rolled up interest in each vintage.
Payments can only be made if a performance condition relating to annual compound growth in earnings per share is met.
The current and previous targets are shown below.
