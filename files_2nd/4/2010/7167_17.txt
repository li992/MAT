Other conditional share awards The following table sets out the interests of Mr A R Cox in a Restricted Share Award.
Details of this award are set out in the footnote below.
A Restricted Share Award equivalent to the market value of 600,000 was awarded to Mr A R Cox on joining the Company.
Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions summarised below, the award vests in three tranches over the first three years of Mr Coxs employment, starting from 1 July 2007.
One sixth of the award vests each year subject to continuing employment and one sixth vests each year if the Group PBT growth exceeds RPI 3% measured from the 30 June 2007 base year.
On 3 September 2009, the second tranche of shares partially vested and the vested portion was released to Mr Cox.
The first criterion continued employment was met but the second Group PBT growth was not.
Consequently, only one sixth of the second tranche vested.
The market price per share on the grant date was 160.25 pence and at the date of vesting was 98.2 pence.
On 26 March 2010, Mr Cox waived that element of the final tranche that related to continuing employment 64,516 shares, which was replaced by a vested special award over the same number of shares subject to the same restrictions.
Mr Cox settled the tax and national insurance due from his own funds calculated by reference to the market value of the shares on the special award date of 108.8 pence.
Includes the 64,516 vested special award shares that remain subject to forfeiture if the continued employment condition is not met see note 2.
In addition, Mr Cox has 64,516 vested special award shares see notes 2 and 3.

Cumulative EPS is the consolidated fully-diluted earnings per share of the Company calculated in accordance with IAS 33 for each financial year cumulative over the performance period.
Goodwill impairments arising from acquisitions prior to 30 June 2006 are excluded from the EPS calculation.

The Remuneration Committee may make adjustments to the calculations of Cumulative EPS, Cumulative Economic Profit and Cumulative Cash Conversion, including taking account of unusual or non-recurring items that do not reflect underlying performance.

For the purpose of ranking the performance of Hays shares against a sector group of comparator companies, TSR for each company is the difference between the average market values in Sterling terms of a notional shareholding in that company on all dealing days for the three-month periods to 20 June 2009 and 30 June 2012 divided by the average market values in Sterling terms of a notional shareholding in that company on all dealing days for the three-month period to 30 June 2009.
The TSR for Hays shares is ranked against the respective TSR performances of Adecco SA, Kelly Services Inc, Manpower Inc, Michael Page International Plc, MPS Group, Inc, Randstad Holdings NV, Robert Half International Inc, Robert Walters Plc, SThree plc and USG People NV.
Vesting will be subject to satisfactory financial performance over the performance period as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
