Remuneration report Remuneration report Introduction The approach to remuneration policy has been similar to that taken in previous years.
The objective has been to keep remuneration at a sufficient level to retain and motivate the high quality of Directors and senior managers at Ultra whilst being mindful of median remuneration levels for companies of a similar size and market capitalisation.
The mix between fixed and variable remuneration for executive Directors has not been materially changed from 2009 since the existing mix is felt by the Remuneration Committee to offer sufficient incentive to continue to deliver the excellent financial performances that the Group has achieved since flotation while neither encouraging nor rewarding inappropriate risk-taking.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 the Act and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups Accounts & Reports Regulations 2008.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to Directors remuneration in the Code.
As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the AGM of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Groups shareholders on certain parts of this report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the relevant legislation.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION The Remuneration Committee the Committee Role The remit of the Committee is to make recommendations to the Board on the framework of senior executive remuneration and to determine annually the individual salaries, annual bonuses payable if any, share based incentive awards and other terms and conditions of employment of the executive Directors.
The Committee is also required to monitor and make recommendations regarding the level of remuneration for senior managers reporting to the executive Directors.
The full terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Groups website.
Composition Chris Bailey was the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee during 2010.
Sir Robert Walmsley and Ian Griffiths, both independent non-executive Directors, were the other Committee members.
David Garbett-Edwards acted as secretary to the Committee.
Julian Blogh and Douglas Caster also normally attend Committee meetings except where matters directly relating to their own remuneration are discussed, although they are not formal Committee members.
Advice Wholly independent advice on executive remuneration and share schemes is received from Hewitt New Bridge Street, a trading name of Aon Hewitt Ltd whose ultimate parent company is Aon Corporation.
Pensions advisory services were also provided to the Committee and the Group by Aon Hewitt Ltd. During 2010 insurance broking services were provided to the Group by other subsidiaries of Aon Corporation which the Committee believes in no way prejudices Hewitt New Bridge Streets position as the Committees independent advisers.
Hewitt New Bridge Street is appointed by the Committee and, during the year, provided the Company with advice on the operation of the Companys LTIP and other share schemes and with remuneration benchmarking services.
In addition, the Committee consults Douglas Caster, Chief Executive, with regard to the remuneration and benefits packages offered to executive Directors and senior executives during the year, except in relation to his own remuneration and benefits package.
This is determined by the Committee, which meets without him for this purpose.

Introduction Remuneration report continued Executive Directors Linkage between remuneration, corporate objectives and shareholder interests The Groups remuneration policy is to reward senior management competitively, enabling the Group to recruit, motivate and retain executives of high calibre, whilst avoiding making excessive remuneration payments.
The remuneration of senior managers is aligned with corporate objectives and the interests of shareholders in the same manner as that of the executive Directors.
As is outlined below, base salary levels are set by reference to the salaries paid in companies of a similar turnover and market capitalisation.
The linkages between the three elements of the executive Directors remuneration packages with the Groups objectives and the interests of shareholders are outlined below: Element of remuneration Objective Timescale Performance metric Base Salary Aims to attract and retain key Continuous Delivery against key personal executives objectives Reflects the individuals role within Reflect individual role and the Group and their experience responsibilities Annual Bonus Provides focus on delivering 12 months Based on annual targets for two exceeding annual budget of the Groups KPIs: operating cash flow and operating profit Rewards and helps retain key executives and is aligned to the Groups risk profile Long Term Rewards longer-term value 3 years Relative Total Shareholder Incentive Plan creation.
Incentivises the Returns based on a delivery of above market Total representative comparator Shareholder Returns group from the FTSE 350 Provides a focus on delivery of the Groups strategic plan Helps to reward and retain key executives When setting base salaries and the other elements of remuneration for the executive Directors, regard is given to remuneration practices across the Group as a whole in order to ensure that a coherent structure applies.
Input is sought from the Chief Executive and the Group Human Resources Director to this effect.
Salaries The executive Directors salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee and take effect from 1 January.
Hewitt New Bridge Street : 1 A business-specific group comprising 15 companies drawn from Ultras 2010 LTIP comparator group which is shown on page 52, with similar market capitalisations to that of Ultra: and 2 A general group comprising 40 companies from across all market sectors with similar market capitalisation and turnover to that of Ultra.
In addition to the analysis presented by Hewitt New Bridge Street, the Committee uses published salary surveys and information available in the annual reports of similar companies as sources of salary information.
Specific factors taken into account by the Committee when determining each executive Directors base salary are: the median level of base salary for a similar position within the benchmark comparator groups outlined above: the individual Directors performance: his responsibilities: and the relative levels of pay and employment conditions across the Group.
The executive Directors salaries have been reviewed by the Committee which has determined that the following levels should be implemented with effect from 1st January 2011: 2011 Salary 2010 Salary % Increase 000 000 % 1 Chief Executive 279 270 3.5 2 Chief Operating Officer 290 280 3.5 Finance Director 290 278 4.3 Marketing Director 243 235 3.5 1 Douglas Caster reduced his working hours to the equivalent of a three day week with effect from 1 May 2010.
The salary shown is an annual equivalent on this basis.
2 Rakesh Sharmas salary was increased from 260,000 per annum to 280,000 per annum with effect from 1 May 2010 following his appointment to the Board.
These salary increase rates are reflective of the salary increases made to high performing Group employees.
50 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Remuneration report continued Annual bonus scheme Bonus payments in 2010 were based upon the achievement of operating profit and cash flow targets.
These targets are derived from the annual budgets approved by the Board but adjusted where appropriate to provide an appropriate degree of stretch challenge and an incentive to outperform.
Operating profit and cash flow are two of the Key Performance Indicators by which the Group is managed.
Please refer to pages 10 to 11 for details.
The maximum bonus for executive Directors was 100% of base salary.
In 2010 the bonus targets set by the Committee were a maximum of 25% of salary subject to the achievement of a 99.6m profit before tax and profit on fair value movements on derivatives and amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition, and a maximum of 75% of salary subject to achieving an operating cash flow of 144.8m after capitalised development costs, capital expenditure and purchase of long-term incentive plan shares.
The maximum cash target was set at a level significantly ahead of both the internal budget and historical profit to cash conversion rates.
This was to incentivise management to focus on the tight management of working capital in order to optimise the conversion of operating profit into operating cash flow.
The actual results for the year led to an aggregate bonus pay-out of 46.3%, of which 25% of salary was due to the profit before tax target being met in full and the balance was linked to part achievement against the cash flow target.
The pay-out was below the maximum because the cash performance did not reach the maximum level when adjusted to recognise the uneven phasing of the monthly cash flows during the year.
The structure of the bonus schemes for 2011 will follow the same structure as for 2010 with a maximum of 25% of salary being payable for the achievement of an agreed profit target, and a maximum of 75% being payable for achievement of an agreed operating cash flow target.
The relevant targets are determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Directors Long-Term Incentive Plan and Employee Share Option Plans The Group operates the following three live discretionary share incentive plans which were all approved in 2007: the 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan 2007 LTIP : the 2007 Company Share Option Plan 2007 CSOP : and the 2007 Executive Share Option Scheme 2007 ESOS.
2007 LTIP The sole form of equity-based long-term incentive for executive Directors is the 2007 LTIP.
They do not receive awards under the 2007 CSOP or 2007 ESOS schemes, which provide incentives for less senior employees.
Under the 2007 LTIP, conditional awards of shares are made annually to executive Directors and selected other senior executives.
These awards normally vest three years after grant, subject to continued employment and the extent to which a performance condition has been met.
It is the Committees normal policy to grant annual LTIP awards to executive Directors over shares worth 100% of salary.
However, in certain exceptional circumstances the Committee may make awards of up to 150% of salary.
It is the opinion of the Committee that the LTIP scheme has helped to motivate senior executives to drive sustained above-market long-term growth in Ultras profits and to generate excellent returns for shareholders as a result.
At the 2008 Annual General Meeting shareholders approved a change to the methodology for all awards made under the 2007 LTIP.
As explained in previous Annual Reports, this change was made for technical reasons due to the problems with measuring relative EPS performance in the transition to IFRS, permitting the Group to replace its relative EPS target with a relative total shareholder return TSR condition.
It is currently intended that relative TSR will now apply to all new awards made under the 2007 LTIP going forward, as well as to the 2007 awards made under the 2007 LTIP.
The Committee believes that the use of relative TSR has a number of advantages.
The most significant of these is that it provides a clear measure of the Groups share price performance plus dividend yield, when compared to the performance of similar companies.
Therefore relative TSR provides a clear indication of the Groups performance with reference to its key corporate objective of delivering above market average increases in shareholder value.
Other advantages include: aligning the performance objectives of the executive Directors more closely with the interests of the shareholders: being an entirely objective measure of relative performance: reflecting the practice most commonly used by other quoted companies: and reducing the complexity and cost of calculating the vesting result.
Introduction Remuneration report continued Detailed structure of TSR performance condition Under the TSR performance condition, TSR is based upon a comparison of the Groups average share price plus reinvested dividends during the quarter immediately prior to the start of the measurement period and its average share price plus reinvested dividends during the last quarter of the three year measurement period.
The resulting TSR will be compared with that achieved by a representative comparator group of companies.
The vesting rules under the 2007 LTIP are as follows: Ultras rank within the comparator group Percentage of award that vests Below median 0% Median 20% Upper quartile 100% Between median and upper quartile Pro-rata between 20% and 100% The Committee reviews the comparator group annually and makes such adjustments as it sees fit for example, to take account of companies which delist during the year.
The comparator groups for measuring relative TSR for the awards made in 2008, 2009 and 2010 were as follows: 2008 group Alba Filtronic Rolls-Royce Vitec Group BAE Systems Halma Rotork Volex Group Charter Hampson Industries Senior VT Group Chemring Group Laird Group Smiths Group Whatman Chloride Group Meggitt Spectris Zetex Cobham Oxford Instruments Spirax-Sarco Engineering Dialight Psion TT Electronics Domino Printing Sciences Renishaw UMECO 2009 group Alba Domino Printing Sciences Psion Spectris BAE Systems Filtronic QinetiQ Spirax-Sarco Engineering Charter Halma Renishaw TT Electronics Chemring Group Hampson Industries Rolls-Royce UMECO Chloride Group Laird Group Rotork Vitec Group Cobham Meggitt Senior Volex Group Dialight Oxford Instruments Smiths Group VT Group 2010 group ARM Holdings Domino Printing Sciences QinetiQ Spirax-Sarco Engineering Babcock International Halma Renishaw Spirent Communications BAE Systems Hampson Industries Rolls-Royce TT Electronics Charter Laird Group Rotork UMECO Chemring Group Logica Senior VT Group Chloride Group Meggitt Serco Group Vitec Group Cobham Oxford Instruments Smiths Group WS Atkins Dialight Psion Spectris During 2010 Chloride Group and VT Group delisted and were removed from the comparator group for the awards that are to be made in 2011.
The list of remaining companies has been reviewed and it has been agreed that these are sufficient to form the comparator group for 2011: ARM Holdings Halma Renishaw Spirent Communications Babcock International Hampson Industries Rolls-Royce TT Electronics BAE Systems Laird Group Rotork UMECO Charter Logica Senior Vitec Group Chemring Group Meggitt Serco Group WS Atkins Cobham Oxford Instruments Smiths Group Dialight Psion Spectris Domino Printing Sciences QinetiQ Spirax-Sarco Engineering 52 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Remuneration report continued Detailed structure of TSR performance condition continued In addition to the main TSR condition, an underpin will apply to LTIP awards requiring average annual growth in headline EPS growth of 7% over the relevant performance period.
In the event that this underpin is not met over a specific three-year LTIP measurement period, the level of vesting will automatically fall to zero.
Headline EPS will be defined as earnings per share after adjustments to exclude gains or losses on financial instruments and the amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition.
The extent to which awards vest will be verified independently by a third party.
All-Employee Share Plans The executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the Groups Inland Revenue approved All-Employee Share Ownership Plan AESOP and the Savings Related Share Option Scheme on the same terms as other employees.
Under the AESOP, employees in the UK are offered the opportunity to buy shares up to the value of 1,500 per annum from pre-tax salary.
Shares are then held in trust on behalf of employees until the maturity date or until they leave the Group.
Under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, reintroduced during 2007, employees are entitled to save up to 1,200 per annum from net pay towards the purchase of options to buy Ultra shares after a period of either three or five years, depending upon the employees choice.
Senior Executive share ownership guidelines To increase the alignment of interests between senior executives and shareholders, the Committee has introduced a share ownership guideline under which all executive Directors will be encouraged to retain at least 50% of the post-tax shares they acquire on the vesting of LTIP awards until a holding equivalent to 100% of base salary is achieved.
Pre-existing shareholdings will be taken into account.

Introduction Remuneration report continued Directors service contracts The executive Directors service contracts have no fixed term and a notice period of one year, which the Committee considers appropriately reflects both current market practice and the balance between the interests of the Group and each executive Director.
In the event of early termination, it is the Committees policy that the amount of compensation paid to executive Directors will be considered in the light of all the relevant circumstances, subject to the overriding conditions that: the Committees aim will be to avoid rewarding poor performance: the duty of the relevant executive Director to mitigate his loss will be taken into account: and no compensation payment can normally exceed one years salary and benefits.
The following table provides more information on each executive Directors service contract: Name Date of contract Notice period D. Caster 25 September 1996 12 months P. Dean 1 January 2009 12 months A. Hamment 1 July 2000 12 months 1 R. Sharma 1 May 1999 6 months 1 Rakesh Sharma will receive a new service contract on his appointment to the position of Chief Executive, the terms of which will reflect the approach outlined above.
No executive Directors have provisions in their contracts for compensation on early termination other than for the notice period.
Non-executive Directors remuneration The Chairmans remuneration is set by the Committee which meets without him for this purpose.
The remaining nonexecutive Directors fees are set by a committee comprising the executive Directors.
In all cases, the fee levels are based upon published surveys, taking account of individual responsibilities.
Chris Bailey was Chairman of the Audit and Remuneration Committees during 2010 and received additional fees as a result.
Non-executive Directors fees have been reviewed for 2011 with reference to data regarding fee levels currently earned by the Directors of similar companies, selected on the basis of turnover and market capitalisation.
It has been determined that the non-executive Directors fees for 2011 will be: 2011 Fees 2010 Fees 000 000 Base fee Chairman 175 166 Non-executive Directors 43 41 Supplements Chairman of the Audit Committee 5 5 Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 5 5 Service contracts Details of service contracts for non-executive Directors are as follows: Name Date of contract Notice period C.

Walmsley 31 January 2011 Nil The non-executive Directors have fixed twelve-month contracts with no notice period.
There are no provisions in their contracts for compensation on early termination.
Directors pension entitlements The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme for current executive Directors, except Paul Dean who participates in a defined contribution plan.
A pension equal to two-thirds of salary at retirement is provided at the normal retirement age of 63 years.
Where pensionable service is less than 20 years, the pension is calculated at one-thirtieth of the retirement salary for each year of service.
With the Groups consent, executive Directors may retire from age 50.
After age 58, Group consent to early retirement is not required.
Pensions are reduced in the event of early retirement.
Directors can elect for death-in-service cover in a range from one to six times annual earnings.
In the event of death-in-service, a spouses pension of 33% of pensionable earnings is payable, together with an allowance for dependent children up to a maximum of 33% of pensionable earnings where relevant.
On the death of a retired Director, a spouses pension of 50% of the Directors pension is payable.
Once the pension is in payment, the part of the Directors pension above the Guaranteed Minimum Pension will be increased each year in line with the increase in the retail price index, capped at 7.5% for service prior to 1 April 2008 and at 5% thereafter, above which increases are at the Trustees and the Groups discretion.
