During the year, the Remuneration Committee received external advice from Deloitte & Touche LLP and Mercer Limited.
In addition, employees of the Group, who provided material advice or services to the Committee during the year were Stephen Benad Company Secretary and Barry Hoffman HR Director.
The Committee considers comparative practice in the European technology sector, FTSE techMARK 100 companies and FTSE 250 companies.
Remuneration policy The Committee reviews and determines, on behalf of the Board, the overall remuneration policy of the Executive Directors, Chairman and with advice from the CEO, the senior executives.
No individual is involved in deciding his own remuneration.
The Executive Directors make recommendations for approval by the Board concerning the fees for Non-Executive Directors that reflect the time, commitment and responsibilities of their roles.
The Companys remuneration policy is designed to reward Executive Directors with remuneration arrangements that are competitive, but not excessive and which further align the interests of the Directors and shareholders.
The policy is designed to ensure that a significant proportion of the total remuneration is dependent upon the Groups financial performance: over the fiscal year as well as over extended periods and that the remuneration policy is aligned to the Groups risk profile.
These objectives are achieved through a combination of base salary and benefits, performance related annual bonuses, a defined contribution pension scheme and share incentive schemes.
The Committee considers, when reviewing the remuneration of the Executive Directors and other senior executives, the wider remuneration levels of all employees of the Group.
The Committee reviews the average base salary increases applied across the Group when base salary increases of the Executive Directors and other senior executives are considered.
Remuneration The main elements of Executive Directors Remuneration for 2010 are shown below, with the 2011 elements detailed on page 36.
Fixed Performance based Element Basic salary Bonus Performance Share Plan Maximum CEO: Finance Director: 100% of base salary award: 100% of 75% of base salary base salary Maximum Uplift 115% 86.25% Purpose: Reflects competitive salary levels Rewards the delivery of Group Improved motivation for senior and takes account of personal operational performance and executives to contribute to growth contribution and performance.
and profitability and better align the Companys incentive arrangements with shareholders interests.
80 per cent of the maximum bonus EPS growth, relative to RPI.
standard: potential based on achievement of specific Group annual financial performance targets, with the balance based on personal objectives approved by the Remuneration Committee each year.
For the personal objective component to be payable, Group budgeted profit must be achieved.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 35 Directors remuneration report continued Basic salary and benefits Each Executive Directors salary is reviewed annually, in order to ensure that the basic salary and benefits remain appropriate.
During the review, the Committee considers various factors including performance and relevant market practices on pay, as well as conditions affecting the Group generally.
For 2010, the Board as a whole, agreed that no Executive Director would receive a base salary increase during the year, but that a study be undertaken at the end of the year to review the total reward levels and incentive structures.
At the end of 2010, Mercer Limited was engaged by the Remuneration Committee to perform a total remuneration benchmarking exercise.
This study highlighted a misalignment of the CEO and Finance Directors total earnings, compared to the FTSE250 comparator group.
The Remuneration Committee agreed that it was preferable to address this misalignment by adjusting both base salaries and bonus opportunity, rather than base salary alone.
It was agreed that for 2011, the CEOs base salary would be increased from 475,000 to 500,000 and the Finance Directors base salary would be increased from 300,000 to 315,000.
The Executive Directors receive benefits in line with those offered to employees throughout the Group, including the provision of a car allowance, life insurance, personal accident insurance and the opportunity to participate in the Groups Save as You Earn scheme SAYE, as well as participation in the flexible benefits scheme MyBenefits.
Performance-related bonus scheme The Executive Directors participate in an annual performance-related bonus scheme and in 2010, for the role of CEO, this had a maximum bonus opportunity of 100 per cent of base salary.
For the role of Finance Director, the maximum bonus opportunity was 75 per cent of base salary.
The level of bonus payable is dependent on the achievement of Group financial performance targets and specific personal objectives.
Regarding the award for 2010, up to 80 per cent of the maximum bonus potential was linked to the financial performance of the Group against pre-agreed targets.
The balance 20 per cent of the maximum bonus potential was related to the achievement of specific personal objectives agreed with each Director, for the year, by the Chairman or CEO, as appropriate, and approved by the Committee.
In order for the personal objective element of the bonus to be achieved, the Group budgeted profit target had to have been reached.
In addition, from 2010, it was possible to exceed the maximum bonus opportunity, subject to an overachievement on the PBT element of the bonus targets, on a straight-line basis, up to a maximum bonus uplift of 115 per cent of base salary for the role of CEO and 86.25 per cent for the role of Finance Director.
For 2010, Mike Norris earned 467,875 2009: 413,250, representing 86.0 per cent of the maximum and Tony Conophy earned 221,630 2009: 189,000, representing 98.50 per cent of the maximum.
Pension The Executive Directors participate in the Computacenter Pension Scheme, a defined contribution salary sacrifice scheme, under which a maximum annual Company contribution of 5,850 per employee is payable, based on basic salary.
For the year 2010, the CEO and Finance Director received the maximum annual Company contribution of 5,850.
The scheme also allows employees to make additional salary sacrifices, which the Company may contribute to the scheme, on their behalf.
Share incentive schemes Share incentive schemes are considered to be an important part of the executive remuneration policy, designed to support management retention and motivation, whilst aligning senior managements interests with those of shareholders.
The details of the historical grants and associated performance conditions are set out in the table of Directors interests in share options on page 39.
Performance Share Plan annual awards The Performance Share Plan 2005 PSP is the Companys primary long-term incentive scheme for Executive Directors and senior employees.
The Committee approves grants under this scheme, once a year, although further grants may be made in appropriate circumstances.
For 2010, the Committee agreed that awards made to the Executive Directors would be at one times base salary.
Annual awards under this plan are subject to performance conditions, as detailed below: For 2010, the PSP performance target was based on the Groups annual adjusted earnings per share EPS growth in relation to the retail price index RPI and measured over a three-year period.
This arrangement applies throughout the Group, except in France, where in accordance with local market practice, a two-year measurement period applies, with a further condition that the shares are held for an additional two-year holding period, in order to gain favourable tax treatment.
One quarter of the shares will vest if cumulative annual EPS growth equals RPI plus 3 per cent per annum.
Awarded shares will vest in full if cumulative annual EPS growth equals or exceeds RPI plus 7.5 per cent per annum.
If cumulative annual growth in EPS is between 3 per cent and 7.5 per cent per annum above RPI, shares awarded will vest on a straight line basis.
No share awards will vest if cumulative annual EPS growth is less than RPI plus 3 per cent per annum.
There will be no retesting of the performance condition and any awarded shares that do not vest will automatically lapse.
EPS has been chosen as a performance measure as it is widely used and is considered a transparent yardstick.
EPS is calculated on a pre-exceptional, diluted basis.
36 Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Share incentive schemes continued Performance Share Plan annual awards The Committee reviewed the performance criteria to ensure that these remain sufficiently challenging in light of market expectations and in comparison to market practice.
It was agreed that the performance conditions for the annual grant made in 2010, would remain the same.
The Committee have recommended certain changes to the award limit and performance conditions to the Performance Share Plan PSP for grants made from 2011 onwards.
For those changes which require it, shareholder approval will be sought at the AGM to be held on 13 May 2011.
The proposed changes to the PSP are set out in detail in the Notice of Meeting 2011.
Share options The Company also operates the Computacenter Employee Share Option Scheme 2007 the scheme.
As the PSP is the primary long-term incentive scheme, the Committee intends that the scheme be used only in exceptional circumstances.
No grants were made to employees or Directors, under this scheme, during 2010.
The Executive Directors have historically been awarded share options under the Companys previous share option schemes and details of these grants can be found in the table of Directors interests in share options on page 39.
The maximum number of options that can be awarded under the scheme will remain three times base salary, although this can be exceeded in exceptional circumstances.
Where grants are made to Executive Directors, it is current policy to grant a maximum of 1.25 times base salary.
Should grants be made under the scheme in 2011, any applicable performance conditions will be subject to review by the Committee, taking account of prevailing market conditions, Group plans and objectives.
There is currently no intention to make grants under this scheme.
Dilution limits The Company uses a mixture of both new issue and market purchase shares to satisfy awards under the option, PSP and SAYE schemes.
In line with best practice, the use of new issue or treasury shares to satisfy awards made under all share schemes, is restricted to 10 per cent in any ten-year rolling period, with a further restriction for discretionary schemes of 5 per cent in the same period.
As at the year-end, the potential dilution from awards under all share plans was approximately 5.41 per cent and the potential dilution from awards under the discretionary schemes was approximately 1.87 per cent.
Minimum shareholding The Committee believes that it is beneficial for Executive Directors and certain members of the senior management team to build up and retain a shareholding in the Company.
With effect from 2011, executives will be required to build up, over a five year period, and maintain a shareholding under the Share Ownership Guidelines, until such time as the following minimum level of qualifying interest is reached: Group 1 Group CEO 2 x base salary Group 2 Group Finance Director 1 x base salary Executives within the remit of the Remuneration Committee Executives within the Group Executive Committee Group 3 Senior Country, Functional or Other Executives 0.5 x base salary Directors contracts Contract letter Unexpired term Notice of appointment months as at period Director start date Expiry date 10 March 2011 months Executive Mike Norris 23.04.1998 n a none specified 12 Tony Conophy 23.04.1998 n a none specified 12 Non-Executive Greg Lock 01.07.2008 2011 AGM 2 3 Philip Hulme 05.05.2009 2012 AGM 14 3 Ian Lewis 15.06.2009 2012 AGM 14 3 Peter Ogden 05.05.2009 2012 AGM 14 3 John Ormerod 31.10.2009 2012 AGM 14 3 Brian McBride 10.01.2011 2014 AGM 38 3 Calculated as at 9 March 2011, assuming that future Annual General Meetings will be held in May each year, and further assuming re-election where required to retire at earlier Annual General Meetings in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association.
