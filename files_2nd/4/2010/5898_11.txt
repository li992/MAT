Board Remuneration Report The Board submits its report on directors remuneration.
A resolution will be put to shareholders at the Companys AGM inviting them to approve this Report.
Details of the Remuneration Committees responsibilities are given on page 23.
Members of the Remuneration Committee The members of the Remuneration Committee during the year were David Campbell Chairman, Colin Cooke, David Buttfield and Alan Wood with effect from 1 April 2010.
John Sheldrick also joined the Remuneration Committee with effect from 1 September 2010.
During the year, the Remuneration Committee took advice from Hewitt New Bridge Street and Mercer.
Neither company, nor Aon Corporation, the ultimate parent of Hewitt New Bridge Street, provided any other services to the Company.
Remuneration policy Executive directors The Companys policy on remuneration is to attract, retain and motivate executives with the qualities, experience and skills necessary to operate and develop the Companys businesses and promote the long-term growth and stability of the Group.
It is also designed to align the interests of the executives with those of the shareholders by rewarding them for enhancing shareholder value and for performing at the highest level.
Benefit packages awarded to executives are intended to be competitive and comprise a mix of performance related and non-performance related remuneration designed to incentivise them, but not to detract from the goals of corporate governance.
The Remuneration Committee takes account of pay and conditions including base salary increases and bonus opportunity and payouts elsewhere in the Group, including that of senior management, when arriving at the remuneration package for the executive directors.
Executive directors are encouraged to build and maintain a meaningful shareholding in the Company to be achieved by the retention of shares vesting under the long-term incentive arrangements and the purchase of shares in the market.
This helps ensure that their interests are aligned with those of shareholders.
Both executive directors currently hold significant shareholdings as detailed on page 36.
"It is the Committees current intention to continue to reward the executive directors with an annual performance related bonus plan linked to earnings per share ""EPS"" and a Performance Share Plan PSP, details of which are given on pages 32 and 33 respectively."
The primary performance condition used in the PSP is relative Total Shareholder Return TSR, using a bespoke peer group comprising companies from the FTSE All Share Industrial Engineering Sector and the General Industrial and Electronic & Electrical Equipment Sectors PSP Peer Group.
The Committee considers that TSR, which comprises of, inter alia, dividend yield and share price movement in comparison with the PSP Peer Group, remains a good measure of long-term performance as it aligns the interests of executives with shareholders and recognises market conditions in the Groups industrial sector.
In addition to TSR, the Committee intends to introduce a performance element relating to underlying EPS growth in the Company, details of which are given on page 33.
This EPS element is aligned to the Companys strategy of increasing market share and underlying earnings and, being measured over a three year period, it encourages focus on longer-term profitable growth.
The targeted composition of each executive directors remuneration is as follows: Non-performance related Performance related Mark Abrahams 50% 50% Richard Perry 50% 50% Chairman and non-executive directors The Chairman and non-executive directors are usually appointed for fixed three year terms, with provision for additional fixed term appointments as deemed appropriate and in the best interests of the Company.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board as a whole with individuals absenting themselves from discussions relating directly to their own remuneration, having regard to the packages awarded by other UK listed companies of similar size and complexity.
Increases of RPI have been awarded to non-executive directors for the year from 1 September 2010.
No increase has been awarded to the Chairman as his appointment is on a fee arrangement which is fixed for the duration of the contract.
The non-executive directors do not participate in any of the Groups bonus or share incentive schemes, nor do they accrue any pension entitlement.
Directors service contracts The executive directors have rolling 12 month contracts.
In addition, the Company has agreed to the payment of a prescribed sum equivalent to 12 months salary and contractual benefits if there is a change of control or termination of their contracts by the Company other than for cause.
F E N N E R P L C A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 0 3 1 Board Remuneration Report continued The service contracts do not contain any provision for compensation on early termination other than the notice period and the provision noted above.
The Committee will seek to mitigate the cost to the Company whilst dealing fairly with each individual case.
The details of the service contracts in relation to the executive directors and letters of appointment in relation to the Chairman and non-executive directors are as follows: Date of most Unexpired term at Notice recent contract 31 August 2010 period Executive directors Mark Abrahams 27 August 2004 - 1 year Richard Perry 27 August 2004 - 1 year Non-executive directors Colin Cooke 24 September 2008 4 months 1 year David Buttfield 11 September 2008 4 months 1 year David Campbell 11 September 2008 14 months 1 year Alan Wood 1 April 2010 31 months 1 year John Sheldrick 1 September 2010 36 months 1 year Colin Cookes services are provided by way of an agreement between the Company, Steels Management Limited and Colin Cooke.
His current service agreement runs until the AGM 2011 but will be extended until Mark Abrahams takes up the post of non-executive Chairman.
David Buttfield will retire from the Board at the conclusion of the AGM 2011.
David Campbell is serving a second three year term from 1 November 2008.
External appointments The Company recognises that its executive directors are likely to be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies and that such appointments can broaden experience and knowledge which may benefit the Company.
Therefore, executive directors may, subject to approval by the Board and providing there is no conflict of interest, be allowed to accept appointments as a non-executive director of other companies and are normally allowed to retain the fees paid from such appointments.
Currently, the Chief Executive Officer, Mark Abrahams, is the non-executive Chairman of Inditherm plc and retained fees of 35,000 in relation to Inditherm plcs year ended 31 December 2009.
Mark Abrahams is also a non-executive director of The Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust and retains fees of up to 10,000 per annum.
The Group Finance Director, Richard Perry, is a non-executive director of Scapa Group plc and retained fees of 38,000 in relation to Scapa Group plcs year ended 31 March 2010.
Remuneration components for executive directors The major components of the executive directors remuneration are as follows: Basic annual salary and benefits The basic annual salary is subject to an annual review which takes into account the performance of the Group, the individual and salary trends in comparable companies.
In addition, a car allowance, healthcare insurance and other benefits are available in line with normal corporate practice.
Pay was frozen in 2009 for the Board and members of the Executive Committee for the year to 31 August 2010.
Increases have been awarded from 1 September 2010 in recognition of, and reward for, the significantly improved performance and profitability of the Group in the year under review.
This followed on from what had been a difficult trading year in 2008 09 but one in which the Group managed the downturn extremely proficiently and professionally, demonstrating strong leadership skills and strategic dexterity.
The executive directors received an increase of 7% from 1 September 2010, resulting in their base salaries rising to 390,000 Mark Abrahams and 235,000 Richard Perry.
Notwithstanding these increases, these salaries remain below the median of comparable companies.
The Remuneration Committee takes account of the pay levels of senior management of the Fenner Group when establishing the executive directors remuneration.
Annual performance related bonus Performance related cash bonuses are reviewed annually.
EPS targets aligned to shareholder expectations are set which must be achieved before the target bonus is payable.
No bonus is payable unless EPS grows compared to the prior year.
The target bonus for achievement of the EPS target is 35% of basic annual salary and the maximum potential payment for the annual bonus is 70% 70% in year under review of basic annual salary, excluding benefits in kind and pension contributions.
The maximum bonus opportunity of 70% of salary remains below the median of comparable benchmarks.
For the year to 31 August 2011, the maximum bonus potential will continue to be capped at 70% of salary with payment dependent upon EPS targets being met: 35% of salary will be payable for target performance.
3 2 F E N N E R P L C A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 0 Performance Share Plan The PSP is the sole long-term incentive vehicle for executives and is designed to encourage its participants to deliver sustained long-term above market returns to shareholders.
Rewards under the PSP are linked to the Company's performance against demanding targets over three year periods Performance Periods.
A conditional award of ordinary shares is based on a percentage of the participant's annual basic salary up to a permitted maximum of 150%.
However, the current grant policy is to make awards of 70% of salary, which is below the median of comparable benchmarks.
The performance measurement for each of the Performance Periods to date has been the Company's TSR which is compared with the TSR of the PSP Peer Group.
After consultation with major shareholders and with the assistance of Hewitt New Bridge Street, it is intended that the Plan Cycle which will commence in November 2010 in relation to PSP awards made at that time and subsequent Plan Cycles will include an EPS measure alongside the current TSR measure.
EPS will account for 33% of the final allocation on vesting.
The EPS performance target will be set against underlying EPS growth in the Company measured over the three years from the end of the financial year preceding the year in which the award is made.
Target EPS growth over the Plan Cycle period commencing in November 2010 would be 25%.
No portion of this element of award will vest if underlying EPS growth falls below 25%, 25% of this element of the award will vest if EPS growth is 25% and 100% will vest if EPS growth reaches 40%, with vesting being linear between 25% and 100%.
The PSP Peer Group is described on page 33.
The Remuneration Committee selected the PSP Peer Group as it believed it to be the most appropriate group against which the TSR of the Company should be measured because it is a group of businesses similar in nature to the Company and which represents alternative investment options for our shareholders.
100% of the award linked to TSR performance may vest only if the Company's performance places it within the top 10% of the companies in the PSP Peer Group and 25% of the award linked to TSR will vest at the median: between the median and the top 10%, awards will vest on a straight-line basis with interpolation between rankings.
No awards linked to TSR will vest if the Company's ranking is below the median.
In addition, no award will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that the Companys TSR performance reflects its underlying financial performance.
The Committee obtains appropriate third party confirmation of the extent to which the PSP targets are met.
The form and operation of the PSP will be regularly reviewed to ensure that it takes due account of changes in market practice and standards of good governance whilst also being aligned to the Companys strategic goals.
The performance chart below illustrates the Companys TSR over the past five years compared to the TSR performance of the FTSE All Share Industrial Engineering Index and the FTSE 250 Index.
Total Shareholder Return FTSE All Fenner FTSE 250 Share Industrial Date PLC Index Engineering Index 31 August 2005 100 100 100 31 August 2006 148 127 129 31 August 2007 173 153 171 31 August 2008 172 131 173 31 August 2009 99 127 158 31 August 2010 173 145 245 Fenner PLC FTSE All Share Industrial Engineering Index FTSE 250 Index Dilution Limits Fenner share plans comply with the current ABI Guidelines on headroom which provide that overall dilution under all plans should not exceed 10% over a 10 year period in relation to the Companys issued share capital, with a further limitation on 5% in any 10 year period on executive plans.
Assuming none of the outstanding awards lapse and will be exercised and having included all exercised awards, as at 31 August 2010, the Company has utilised 2.24% of the 10% in 10 years limit and 2.24% of the 5% in 10 years limit.
F E N N E R P L C A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 0 3 3 Board Remuneration Report continued Pensions The executive directors participate in the defined benefit section of the Fenner Pension Scheme, an Inland Revenue approved mixed benefits scheme, on the same terms as other senior executives.
The Scheme provides for a maximum pension of two-thirds of remuneration at or near retirement age of 62.
In addition, the executive directors receive a Pension Allowance under the terms of their Service Agreement.
These payments enable them to enhance their pension provision up to two-thirds of remuneration, rather than being aligned to the notional Inland Revenue earnings cap that existed prior to the implementation of the Finance Act 2004.
The executive directors have full discretion in how they choose to invest the Pension Allowance payments.
The following sections of the Board Remuneration Report are audited.

By an agreement between the Company, Steels Management Limited and Colin Cooke dated 24 June 1993, as amended by subsequent supplemental agreements between the same parties, the last one being dated 24 September 2008, Steels Management Limited agreed to provide the services of Colin Cooke as a non-executive director and Chairman of the Company until the 2011 AGM.
Steels Management Limited may at any time terminate the agreement by giving 12 months notice in writing to the Company.
During the year ended 31 August 2010, 125,100 2009 125,100, including a 5,100 car allowance, was payable under this agreement.
No remuneration was paid directly to Colin Cooke, nor were any pension contributions paid on his account.
Alan Woods fee represents the period from 1 April 2010 to 31 August 2010.
John Sheldricks annual fee from 1 September 2010 is 42,500.
The non-executive directors do not participate in any Company pension scheme, nor do they receive any benefits in kind.
The executive directors emoluments exclude the Pension Allowance which is outlined on page 35.
On 1 March 2009, the entire Board voluntarily agreed to a conditional waiver of emoluments equivalent to 10% of basic salary or fees: these emoluments were repaid in full in March 2010.
These amounts have not been included in the emoluments above.
Other than stated above, the Board did not waive any emoluments in respect of the year ended 31 August 2010, reflecting the outstanding performance delivered over the relevant period.
Pensions Details of the pension benefits to which each of the executive directors is entitled are as follows: Accrued Increase in Accrued Transfer Transfer Increase in entitlement accrued entitlement value at value at transfer value 31 August entitlement 31 August 31 August 31 August less directors 2009 over the year 2010 2009 2010 contributions Mark Abrahams 59,200 3,100 62,300 846,600 967,300 120,700 Richard Perry 61,800 4,100 65,900 1,049,800 1,233,800 174,100 3 4 F E N N E R P L C A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 0 Additional information as required by the Listing Rules: Transfer value of additional accrued benefits Additional accrued benefits earned in year earned in year less directors contributions Mark Abrahams 3,100 43,900 Richard Perry 4,100 60,300 The accrued pension entitlement is the amount that the director would be paid annually on retirement based on service to 31 August 2010.
The Listing Rules require the increase in this amount to be disclosed excluding inflation.
The benefits do not allow for any retained benefits which the directors may have relating to previous employment.
The pension benefits exclude any additional pension purchased by additional voluntary contributions.
The increase in the accrued entitlement is the difference between the accrued entitlement at 31 August 2010 and the accrued entitlement at 31 August 2009.
The pension benefits are based on the directors pensionable salaries which are limited to the schemes permitted maximum currently 123,600 per annum.
The transfer values as at 31 August 2010 have been calculated in line with the Trustees transfer value basis which was effective from 1 October 2008.
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of the directors pension benefits.
They do not represent sums payable to individual directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The transfer value of the increase in accrued benefits, required by the Listing Rules, discloses the current value of the increase in accrued benefits that the director has earned in the period whereas the change in his transfer value, required by the Companies Act 2006, discloses the absolute increase or decrease in his transfer value and includes the change in value of the accrued benefits that results from market volatility affecting the transfer value at the beginning of the period, as well as the additional value earned in the year.
Until 5 April 2006, the Company made contributions to FURBS in respect of the executive directors.
From 6 April 2006, payments to the executive directors have been converted to a Pension Allowance under the terms of their Service Agreements.
This approach involves lower costs to the Company than would be incurred if a two-thirds salary pension promise was provided.
The total amounts paid by the Company were as follows: 2010 2009 Mark Abrahams 255,712 246,375 Richard Perry 151,589 146,300 F E N N E R P L C A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 0 3 5 Board Remuneration Report continued Interests in shares The interests of the directors in the 25p ordinary shares of the Company were as follows: 31 August 2010 1 September 2009 Number Number Mark Abrahams 601,290 601,290 Richard Perry 503,841 499,762 Colin Cooke 272,308 222,308 David Buttfield 48,618 18,618 David Campbell 9,690 9,690 Alan Wood appointed 1 April 2010 - - John Sheldrick appointed 1 September 2010 - - All directors interests are beneficially held.
There have been no other changes in the interests set out above between 31 August 2010 and 10 November 2010.
Share schemes None of the directors held any share options during the year.
The outstanding awards to executive directors under the PSP are as follows: Conditional Conditional End of award Conditional award Performance 1 September award in Shares Shares 31 August Value Period & Award 2009 the year awarded lapsed 2010 awarded Determination Allocation Date Number Number Number Number Number Date Mark Abrahams 20 February 2007 97,720 -- 97,720 - - 19 February 2010 12 February 2008 93,238 -- - 93,238 - 11 February 2011 19 November 2008 312,347 -- - 312,347 - 18 November 2011 18 November 2009 - 139,892 -- 139,892 - 17 November 2012 Richard Perry 20 February 2007 59,284 -- 59,284 - - 19 February 2010 12 February 2008 55,943 -- - 55,943 - 11 February 2011 19 November 2008 188,264 -- - 188,264 - 18 November 2011 18 November 2009 - 84,318 -- 84,318 - 17 November 2012 Total of awards in year -- Performance Period ends 31 August 2010 but the award will not vest before 11 February 2011.
Performance Period ends 31 August 2011 but the award will not vest before 18 November 2011.
Performance Period ends 31 August 2012 but the award will not vest before 17 November 2012.
The performance criteria attached to the conditional award of shares made on 18 November 2009 relate to the TSR of the Company which is compared with the TSR of the PSP Peer Group.
There have been no variations in the terms and conditions of scheme interests during the year.
The 1st PSP Plan Cycle that ended on 19 February 2010 was independently evaluated and resulted in a nil award.
The market value as defined in the Rules of the Plan of an ordinary share of the Company at the beginning of the Plan Cycle was 226.8p, at the end of the Plan Cycle was 192.0p and at 18 November 2009 for the 4th PSP was 184.5p.
3 6 F E N N E R P L C A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 0 The performance chart on page 33, which shows the relative TSR of the Company against the FTSE All Share Industrial Engineering Index and the FTSE 250 Index, gives an indication of whether each PSP Performance Period will achieve the performance criteria, based upon the share price at 31 August 2010.
Given the nature of the performance calculation, it could be misleading to indicate a likely outcome for future share awards.
Movements in share price during the year The market price of the Companys shares at the end of the financial year was 203.7p and the range of market prices during the year was between 115.75p and 234.6p.
