The LTIP has two elements, a conditional award of Performance Shares and an award of Matching Shares linked to investment by the executive in the Companys shares.
For awards made in 2007 and the years prior, performance conditions were based on the Companys total shareholder return over a three year period beginning on the first day of the first financial year in which the award was made.
From 2008, 50 per cent of shares awarded are dependent on TSR performance with the other 50 per cent dependent on an adjusted basic EPS growth target.
