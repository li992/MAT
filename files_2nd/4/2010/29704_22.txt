NeitherHewitt New Bridge Street nor any other part of Aon Corporation provided other services to the Company during the year.
The Committee meets at least twice a year and during the year under review it met formally twice, in April and December 2010.
Both meetings were attended by Mr Finlay and Mr Raeburn.
In addition, the subcommittee of the Remuneration Committee, comprising the Chairman of the Committee and the Company Secretary, met in April 2010 to effect a proposal for the granting of awards under the Performance Share Plan PSP.
In addition, a number of informal meetings of the Committee took place during the year.

Approved the change to Lynn Fordhams remuneration package.
Approved the granting of awards under the PSP.

Approved the arrangements in connection with the departure of senior employees from the Group.
Both SVGA and SVGIM have separate Boards with independent directors and separate remuneration committees.
The SVG Capital Remuneration Committee sets parameters and principles for the salary increases, discretionary bonuses and long-term incentive plans for these subsidiaries which are consistent with effective risk management.
Accordingly, the subsidiary remuneration committees, operating under specified delegated limits of authority from the main Board, met during the year to determine increases in salary and discretionary bonuses for all executives below main Board level.
A summary of these were presented to the SVG Capital Remuneration Committee for its approval.
A summary of the terms of reference of the Committee are set out on page 40.
A copy of the full terms of reference of the Committee is available for inspection at the Companys registered office during normal business hours.
Policy on the remuneration of executive Directors The Committees aim is to ensure that remuneration packages should attract, retain and motivate senior executives including executive Directors while avoiding paying more than is necessary for this purpose and not encouraging excessive risk taking.
At31December 2010, Lynn Fordham was the only executive Director of the Company.
The Committees policy is that the fixed elements of remuneration should be sufficient to allow the Company to be competitive against other companies with which the Company competes for executive talent.
The majority of the remuneration package should be performance-related so that it is linked to the returns created for shareholders and the total cost is sufficiently flexible to reflect changes in business performance.
The variable element comprises a balance between short-term and long-term performance through the Companys annual bonus and the performance share plan.
In order to help mitigate risk and ensure that overall rewards are not excessive, incentive levels are capped at a level that encourages out-performance and allows the Company to deliver competitive levels of remuneration without encouraging undue risk taking.
Corporate information SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2010 34 Remuneration report Basic salary Salaries are reviewed annually with changes becoming effective in April each year.
TheCommittee decides on the increases awarded to the executive Directors and is consulted on increases for all employees of the business.
The Committee considers Group performance, individual performance and pay and employment conditions of employees of the Group in reaching any decisions.
The Committee considered the pay awards and other employment conditions of employees of the Group before approving the paypackages of any executive Directors.
Inaddition, relevant compensation surveys are reviewed.
No executive Director of the Company is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.
Lynn Fordhams salary was increased in April 2010 from 340,000 to 350,000.
With a view of maintaining cost control within SVGA, senior management there are not receiving salary increases.
In light of this, Lynn Fordhams salary will not be increased in April 2011.
Annual bonus Annual bonuses are intended to reward achievement of Group and personal objectives.
Bonuses are non-pensionable and discretionary.
The Committee sets the performance targets for the annual bonus plan at the beginning of the financial year.
The targets are chosen to reflect the successful implementation of the business plan and strategies agreed by the Board and may be adjusted to take account of risk.
The normal maximum annual bonus for an executive Director has been set at 200% of salary, although, this cap can be exceeded in exceptional circumstances.
The Committee believes that capping bonuses at this level enables the Company to provide competitive levels of remuneration while ensuring that executives are not incentivised to take inappropriate risks.
The bonus awarded to Lynn Fordham in respect of her performance in the year to December 2010 amounted to 455,000.
This reflects the key performance parameters for Lynn Fordham of implementing the financing strategy, developing investment policy, building relationships with stakeholders, and expanding the Companys investor base.
The overall bonus earned was above the on-target level reflecting the Committees assessment that the bonus targets were fully met and that Lynn Fordham had performed well during the year.
Long-term incentives Lynn Fordham and selected employees of the SVG Group are eligible to participate in the Performance Share Plan PSP at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The Committee believes that participation in long-term incentives ensures that a significant part of executives potential remuneration is tied to the returns received by shareholders over the longer term through the use of performance conditions linked to the Groups strategy and through exposure to the Groups share price.
This provides alignment between executives and shareholders and, because vesting of awards takes place three or four years after grant, provides an element of lock-in and encourages a focus on performance that is sustainable in the longer term.
PSP awards are made annually, as this enables executives to build up a series of overlapping awards, which the Committee believes ismore retentive than larger one-off awards.
The PSP enables awards of conditional free shares or nil or nominal cost options to be made.
Award levels are determined by reference to the level of salary and bonus earned in the previous year as this provides a link toindividual performance.
The maximum that can be awarded in any financial year is 200% of base salary and bonus.
For the purposes of calculating these limits the maximum amount of bonus which may be used is capped at 300% of base salary and thevalue of an award shall be calculated and, if necessary, adjusted to take into account any employers secondary National Insurance contributions or overseas equivalent that may have been transferred to the award holder.
In practice, the cap on the amount of bonus that may be included in the calculation of awardsis unlikely to be reached as the normal maximum annual bonus of 200% of salary can only be exceeded in exceptional circumstances.
In order to ensure that long-term incentives provide alignment with shareholders the Committee sets performance conditions that reward executives for delivering absolute growth in the value of the Group.
The performance conditions used for the 2010 awards are the same as those for the 2009 awards and consist of i the average growth in the Companys undiluted Net Asset Value per Share NAV over a four-year period and ii the Companys average annual compound total shareholder return TSR over a three-year period, with each determining the vesting of 50% of the award.
NAV-based awards will normally vest on the fourth anniversary of the award being granted provided that the award holder is a Director or employee within the SVG Group on that date and to the extent that the NAV performance condition has been satisfied.
If average annual growth in NAV over the performance period is less than 7% per annum, none of this part of the award will vest.
If average annual growth in NAV over the performance period is 15% per annum or more, all of this part of the award will vest.
For NAV growth between these two points, between 0% and 100% of this part of the award will vest on a pro-rata basis.
TSR based awards will normally vest on the third anniversary of the award being granted provided that the award holder is a Director or employee within the SVG Group on that date and to the extent that the TSR performance condition has been satisfied.
Ifaverage annual compound TSR over the performance period is less than 10% per annum, none of this part of the award will vest.
Ifaverage annual compound TSR over the performance period is 20% per annum or more, all of this part of the award will vest.
For TSR performance that is between these two points between 0% and 100% of this part of the award will vest on a pro-rata basis.
The Remuneration Committee believes that TSR and growth in NAV are appropriate measures of long-term performance for a business focused on delivering superior levels of NAV growth and returns to shareholders.
In setting the performance targets for the 2010 awards the Remuneration Committee took account of the current shareholder expectations of future performance for the Company.
The PSP replaced the 2001 ESOP following the 2007 AGM.
However, whilst the Committee does not intend to make SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2010 35 further grants under the ESOP it has been retained for use in exceptional circumstances such as for the recruitment and retention of senior staff or to reward exceptional performance.
Any grant of options under the ESOP will count toward the individual limits under the PSP and appropriately demanding performance conditions will be set at the time of grant.
In addition, the Company introduced a SIP at the 2007 AGM.
The SIP is a tax approved all-employee share plan with standard features.
No awards have been made under the SIP.
Benefits Benefits in kind which are not pensionable relate to the provision of health insurance and life assurance cover.
Private health insurance is offered to all employees who have the option to cover their partners and dependent children.
In addition, all employees are entitled to a contribution to their pension plans.
