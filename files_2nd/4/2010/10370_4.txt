Directors remuneration report Corporate governance Financial statements Dear Shareholder I am pleased to present the report by the Remuneration Committee on Directors remuneration for the year to 31 May 2010.
This past year has been one of progress for Misys: developing new solutions and services: growing revenue: and significantly improving profit.
Misys continues to execute well against the multiyear turnaround plan.
The economic climate has been one of the most difficult in modern history.
Our challenge has been to attract and retain talented people to help us execute our turnaround plan and to meet the aspiration of being leaders in the markets that we serve.
This ambition is closely aligned with the interests of shareholders and guides our remuneration strategy.
We implemented changes to our remuneration strategy in 2008 09 which have served us well and provide a robust framework for executive remuneration, enabling us to continue to attract and retain the best people despite the challenging business environment.
As well as considering current practices the Remuneration Committee continues to monitor how well incentive awards made in previous years align with the Companys performance.
The Committee is confident that there has been and remains a strong link between performance and reward.
In 2009 10 there were no changes to our remuneration policies or incentive schemes.
Awards made to senior management were consistent with those made in the previous year.
In line with the majority of our employees, the Chief Executive and Executive Vice Presidents EVPs did not receive an increase in basic salary, reflecting the current economic climate.
The Remuneration Committee considers that there is an appropriate balance between fixed and variable compensation.
The remuneration strategy agreed in 2008 09 provides share awards linked to the delivery of stretching medium-term revenue and operating profit goals, which complement the longer term earnings per share growth targets in the long-term share incentive plans.
The Remuneration Committee believes that aligning rewards with performance builds shareholder value.
I hope that you are able to support the policies set out in this Report at the AGM on 29 September 2010.
