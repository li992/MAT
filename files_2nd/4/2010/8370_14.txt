Share Awards The first proposed amendment is to the performance conditions Deferred Bonus Share Plan for the performance-related share awards.
The only long-term incentive plan in use in 2010 has been the Intertek Deferred Bonus Share Plan the Plan.
The purposes of In our consideration of share plan incentives in 2010 we reviewed this Plan are the reward and retention of senior executives and key the performance criteria for Matching Share awards, taking full specialists and the alignment of their interests with shareholders account of the economy and business climate at the time of the by linking rewards to Interteks share price performance.

Awards of Matching of underlying performance which, in general, we expect to be Shares are linked to awards of Deferred Shares, and for the determined by reference to EPS growth.
Executive Directors and IOC are granted at the maximum ratio of two Matching Shares for every Deferred Share.

For each cycle the Committee will determine a threshold level of EPS growth and an upper vesting target for EPS growth.
