For certain other Unless otherwise noted, the disclosures in the Directors remuneration senior executives the maximum level will rise to up to 100%.
The first three year cycle of the LTIP concluded at end 2010.
The LTIP is intended to focus and incentivise the Executive Directors and an extended team of some 35 key senior managers and at the same time to function in support of retention.
For Executive Directors the targets are based 75% on growth in adjusted earnings per share and 25% on TSR performance relative to an industry peer group.
The targets for the first cycle were set at end 2007, before the economic downturn.
As we reported last year, it was clear from early in 2009 that the EPS targets could not be achieved in the changed environment and we decided that these targets should not be adjusted.
However I am pleased to report 46 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2010 Governance Directors remuneration report continued that TSR performance relative to the peer group has earned a payment The Remuneration Committee has agreed to a special incentive to J for this cycle.

He will also, under this arrangement, forego his entitlement under 2011 performance.
The Committee believes that a significant award in the 2009-11 and 2010-12 cycles of the LTIP.
This incentive will be cycle 2 would be beneficial with respect to retention over a period that payable following completion of the sale.

com 47 : 1b Remuneration policy Each year, the Committee reviews the remuneration policy for executive directors and other key senior executive managers, taking into account both the external market and the companys strategic objectives over the short and the medium term.
The Committee reviews the level of rewards that are offered by other companies, including those within comparable sectors and geography as well as those of comparable size and complexity in other sectors.
Given that the Group operates in specialised and international markets, regard is also given to remuneration of peers within the same industry sector.
As noted above, one of the Committees key objectives is to align the remuneration of executive directors with the long-term strategy of the Group and with maximising shareholder value.
In order to do this, remuneration packages comprise fixed and variable performance related elements.
The Committee monitors the participation of senior executives in the Groups short-term and long-term incentive arrangements and reviews the levels of compensation for internal equity and external competitiveness.

Long-term incentives Long-term incentives play an important role in the retention and motivation of executive directors and senior executives, consistent with our goal of maximising shareholder value.
In this respect the Group has put in place a number of long-term incentive schemes.
Details of the schemes follow in section 3c, but the table below summarises the schemes: Long-term incentive Description LTIS Introduced in 2005 for executive directors and around 35 senior executives, the LTIS provided incentives for performance over a three-year period to 31 December 2007.
The final awards under this scheme vested in March 2010.
LTIP Introduced in 2007 for executive directors and around 35 senior executives, this is a replacement for the LTIS above and is designed to provide incentives for three-year rolling performance cycles commencing 1 January 2008.
LTRP Introduced in 2003, the LTRP is designed to align rewards to financial performance and results in the awarding of Wood Group par value options to participants.
Since the introduction of the LTIS and LTIP this scheme has primarily been aimed at a group of around 390 employees in the layer below those participating in the LTIP.
ESOS Established in 2002, the ESOS provide for the grant of options to executive directors, senior executives and other employees.
There are currently around 580 participants across the Group.
No awards have been made to executive directors since 2005.
