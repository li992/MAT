Ferrexpo plc 53 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Incentive Plans A substantial proportion of Executive Directors remuneration is based on performance via the Long-Term and Short-Term Incentive Plans described below.
Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP aims to motivate participants to deliver appropriate longer-term returns to shareholders.
Short-Term Incentive Plan STIP aims to focus management efforts on delivery of annual business priorities, based on a scorecard of key performance indicators relating to both Company and individual performance.
The Board intends to continue to operate the LTIP and STIP for the Executive Directors and senior executives in 2011 while keeping under review their motivational effectiveness.
Long-Term Incentive Plan The LTIP framework was approved by shareholders at the 2008 Annual General Meeting.
The LTIP provides for annual awards of performance shares and options up to an aggregate limit of 200% of salary in normal circumstances.
Initial awards were made in 2008 on the basis of the same number of shares to participants at the same level in the organisation.
Further awards were made in 2009 and 2010 to broadly the same participants, on a similar basis.
None of the awards granted in 2009 or 2010 exceeded 100% of salary.
These awards are in the form of performance shares which vest according to the extent to which Ferrexpos three year total shareholder return TSR matches or outperforms that of a comparator index see below.
The Remuneration Committee has chosen relative TSR as the primary long-term incentive measure as it considers this to be the most objective external measure of the Companys success.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the constituents of the comparator index and their weightings prior to the grant of 2009 LTIP awards and increased the weighting on the focused iron ore miners from 30% to 40% and reduced the weighting on the single commodity emerging market miners commensurately.
The resulting comparator index for 2009 and 2010 awards is based 50% on the median TSR of global diversified mining companies, 40% on the median TSR of smaller focused iron ore miners and 10% on the median TSR of selected other single commodity emerging market miners, as illustrated below.
Aggregate Index component Constituents weighting Global diversified miners 10% each 50% Vale Rio Tinto BHP Billiton Xstrata Anglo American Focused iron ore miners 10% each 40% Cliffs Natural Resources Kumba Iron Ore Fortescue Metals Group Mount Gibson Iron Single commodity emerging market miners 10% 0.5% each African Rainbow Minerals Industrias Penoles Alcoa Katanga Mining Alumina Kazakhmys Aluminum Corp of China KGHM Polska Miedz Antofagasta Lundin Mining Boliden Norilsk ENRC OZ Minerals Eramet Peabody Energy First Quantum Minerals Teck Cominco Freeport McMoRan Vedanta Resources TSR is calculated on a common currency basis to ensure that comparisons with international comparators listed overseas are fair.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to review the comparator index if any of the constituent companies are affected by corporate events such as mergers and acquisitions.
The Remuneration Committee also reviews the constituents and their weightings prior to the start of each LTIP cycle to ensure they remain appropriate.
The Committee anticipates increasing the number of focused iron ore miners in the comparator index for 2011 LTIP awards.
Ferrexpo plc 54 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Remuneration Report continued No performance shares will vest if Ferrexpos TSR underperforms the Proposed 2011 LTIP awards comparator index.
20% will vest if Ferrexpos TSR is equal to The Remuneration Committee intends to operate the LTIP framework Index TSR: full vesting will occur only if Ferrexpos TSR exceeds the in 2011 in the same manner as in 2010.
However, as intimated in the Index by at least 8% p. a. : there will be straight-line pro rata vesting in 2009 Remuneration Report, the Committee has looked at ways to between those points.
In addition, for any shares to vest, the improve the comparison of the management long-term incentive in Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the recorded TSR is relation to potential short-term share price movements in Ferrexpos a fair reflection of Ferrexpos underlying business performance.
The share price or the share price of comparator companies.
After vesting parameters are illustrated below: consulting the principal shareholders of Ferrexpo in the summer of 2010, the Remuneration Committee determined that it would extend the TSR share-price averaging period from three to six months to Ferrexpo 3-year TSR help eliminate this potential short-erm variability.
% of vesting award 100 This change will be implemented for LTIP awards to be made in 2011.
The TSR performance requirements for threshold and full vesting will remain unchanged.
Existing 2009 and 2010 LTIP cycles will continue to employ three-month share price averaging.
80 LTIP: share ownership guidelines The Committee has agreed that, with effect from 2010, Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee should, in line 60 with the growing practice among FTSE 250 companies, be encouraged to build up a holding of shares of equivalent value to a years salary in the case of Executive Directors or six months salary for other members of the Executive Committee.
Executives will be 40 encouraged to retain their vested LTIP shares on an after-tax basis until the applicable guideline is achieved.
Short-Term Incentive Plan 20 A Short-Term Incentive Plan STIP is in place which applies to the members of the Executive Committee, excluding Mr Zhevago.
This STIP is a discretionary annual bonus scheme.
For 2010 the maximum 0 STIP opportunity for members of the Executive Committee ranged from 75% to 150% of salary.
Key Performance Indicators KPIs for 2010 were set for each Dividends will accrue on performance shares over the vesting period, member of the Executive Committee and were weighted to reflect the and be paid on shares that vest.
In the event of a change of control, contribution of each executive to the achievement of that KPI.
In awards will be pro-rated for time and performance.
The relation to the Chief Financial Officer the Committee retained a broad Remuneration Committee will retain discretion to vary this treatment if discretion, taking into account both corporate and personal it deems it to be in shareholders interests to do so.
2008 LTIP award vesting Financial and Operational KPIs during the year related to financial From 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2010, Ferrexpos TSR performance, production output, corporate social responsibility performance was 23.9% and Index TSR was 0.5%.

outperformance of 7.2% p. a. of Index TSR resulted in 92% of 2008 LTIP awards vesting for TSR.
The Remuneration Committee has Taking into account these results and also his individual performance, considered the Companys overall performance and determined that the Remuneration Committee awarded the Chief Financial Officer an the recorded TSR outperformance was a fair reflection of Ferrexpos STIP award of 150% of salary.
The actual outcome for the other underlying performance over the performance period and therefore members of the Executive Committee ranged from 57% to 97% of determined, in accordance with the rules of the plan that 92% of the salary.
For 2011, financial KPIs have been set and will be adjusted throughout the period to take account of market and input cost price developments as appropriate to the extent that these are not under the direct control of management.
