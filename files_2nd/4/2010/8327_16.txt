The Committee established a group of 40 comparator companies ranked FTSE 25-90, for salary comparison purposes, at October 2009, but excluded those engaged in financial services, mining, oil exploration and property development.
In determining the salaries and benefits of the Executive Directors, the Committee had regard to the treatment of staff and management generally within the Group, to ensure that an appropriate balance was maintained.
Balanced and performance related: The remuneration of the Executive Directors incorporated both fixed and variable elements.
Fixed elements including salary, pension and benefits were provided as part of a competitive employment package.
Variable elements were based upon the achievement of specific and measurable shared and individual performance objectives over both the short and long-term that aligned the Executives rewards with the creation of value for shareholders.
Shareholder aligned: Remuneration packages included significant opportunities to acquire, and obligations to retain, International Power shares, consistent with our strategy of building a strong share ownership culture.
All Executive Directors, with the exception of the CEO, had a requirement to hold shares equivalent to 100% of their salary.
The requirement for the CEO is 150%.
As at 31 December 2010, all Executive Directors fulfilled this requirement.

Annual bonus During 2010 International Powers Executive Directors were eligible to participate in an annual performance bonus plan, which was awarded for the achievement of stretching individual and collective, financial and non-financial targets over the financial year.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for all Executive Directors was 100% of base salary.
The target level of payout for each of the financial measures was set at 67% of the maximum and this became payable upon achieving budgeted levels of performance.
The table over the page sets out for each Executive Director their performance measures, which reflected the extent to which the Remuneration Committee believed they were both relevant to the Executive Directors role and open to influence by the individual.
The Committee undertook a review into whether the most appropriate measures were used for the Executive Directors bonus arrangements.
These measures 98 International Power Annual Report 2010 Directors remuneration report of EPS, free cash flow and PFO were the KPIs used to monitor the financial performance of the business.
In addition, the CEO, CFO and all Regional Directors had a personal, non-financial objective relating to health, safety and the environment.
The Remuneration Committee always maintained discretion to ensure that bonus awards were appropriate in the context of both the economic environment and the Companys performance.
Bonus payments for 2010 for the Executive Directors were on the whole higher than in 2009.
This reflected Group EPS and free cash flow results that were above the target level, as shown below, and excellent free cash flow performance in the regions.

The Chairman of the GDF SUEZ Group will, at his discretion, multiply the bonus awarded by a factor between 1.0 and 1.1.
The multiplication is applied by the same factor to all top executives within the GDF SUEZ Group.
Directors aggregate remuneration table page 105 Share Plans for Executive Directors Performance Share Plan Eligibility for conditional awards Under the International Power 2002 Performance Share Plan PSP, Executive Directors were eligible annually for the following conditional award of shares: the equivalent of 200% of base salary for the CEO the equivalent of 150% of base salary for the other Executive Directors Performance conditions Awards made conditionally under this Plan vest subject to a performance assessment at the end of a three-year performance period, against the targets put in place at the commencement of each cycle.
Awards made conditionally between 2002 and 2005 inclusive incorporated a single performance condition that reflected EPS.
For awards made since 2006, the performance conditions reflected both an EPS target and a relative TSR performance measure.
The link to EPS, at 50% of the potential value to participants, ensured vesting was aligned with a key underlying performance measure as presented in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
The use of TSR, also weighted at 50%, provided a market-based measure when assessing performance.
Given that the principal performance measures for the Companys share plans were based on EPS performance and TSR, the Committee reserved the right to also take into account, and adjust appropriately for, the enhancement effects of any purchase and subsequent cancellation of shares, or placing of shares into treasury, by the Company.
Before releasing any award in respect of the TSR element, the Remuneration Committee also sought to satisfy itself that the Groups TSR performance was a genuine reflection of the true underlying performance of the Group.
For the conditional awards made in 2006 and 2007, the TSR performance condition was measured against companies in the FTSE 51-100.
Following a review in 2007, in respect of the awards made conditionally in 2008 to 2010, the comparator group comprised FTSE 41-80 companies.
GovernanCe 99 Benefits on vesting The method of calculating an Executive Directors entitlement to shares upon vesting was as follows: In respect of the TSR element, 25% of the maximum vested for median TSR performance and the maximum vested for upper quartile performance.
In respect of the EPS element, 25% of the maximum vested for performance at the threshold target established by the Remuneration Committee and the maximum vested when the stretch target was achieved.
Straight-line pro-rating was applied for performance between the threshold and maximum data points for both the TSR and EPS elements.
Performance Share Plan awards The specific performance and vesting arrangements for all conditional PSP awards made between 2007 and 2010 are set out in the following table: Date of award Performance Threshold performance Maximum performance Vesting rate period condition condition 12 March 2007 1 January 2007 12.5% of the award if EPS 50% of the award if EPS Vesting pro-rated for EPS to 31 December performance for the year ended performance for the year ended performance between these 2009 31 December 2009 was not less 31 December 2009 was equal two points.

100 International Power Annual Report 2010 Directors remuneration report Treatment of outstanding Performance Share Plan awards on Combination In December 2010, participants in the International Power plc 2002 PSP were offered the opportunity to cancel their existing PSP awards in return for a cash payment from the Company subject to Closing.
The Remuneration Committee reached the decision to cash out the awards on the basis that it is generally accepted that on a change of control PSP awards would vest to participants however, due to the structure of the transaction, the Combination did not technically trigger the change of control mechanism.
The amount of the cash payment reflects the extent to which PSP awards would have vested if the Combination had been a change of control event for the purposes of the PSP.
The relevant performance conditions were calculated up to the end of December 2010.
For the 2008 awards the performance period had completed and so the award was allowed to cash out fully in accordance with the performance conditions so that participants were not disadvantaged by the fall in share price following payment of the special dividend EPS conditions were met fully however, the Companys TSR ranking was below the median so consequently 50.0% of the entire award was allowed to vest.
For the 2009 and 2010 awards the level of vesting according to performance was reduced on a time basis to the end of January 2011 to reflect the fact that Closing occurred before the end of the applicable performance periods.

The number of restricted share awards that will be conditionally awarded to each PSP participant following the Preliminary Results was based on PSP performance up to the end of December 2010, pro-rated for time to the end of the year following Closing, less the number of share awards to which the above cash payment relates.
The number of shares will also be adjusted so that participants will not be disadvantaged by the payment of the special dividend.
The restricted share awards will vest at the end of 2011 or earlier in certain good leaver circumstances.

The cash values awarded to Tony Concannon and Ranald Spiers were 317,724 and 290,201 respectively in relation to the 2009 PSP and 220,567 and 211,011 respectively in relation to the 2010 PSP.
2 Bruce Levy resigned on 3 February 2011 and therefore received a cash award instead of shares.
The cash values awarded to Bruce Levy were 488,575 in relation to the 2009 PSP and 312,648 in relation to the 2010 PSP.
GovernanCe 101 Executive Share Option Plans Eligibility for awards During 2010 International Power operated a range of Approved, Unapproved and Global Executive Share Option Plans for the benefit of senior management and other employees.
With effect from 1 January 2006, the Executive Directors have not been eligible to participate in new awards under any of the Companys Executive Share Option Schemes.
Performance conditions In respect of all awards made to the Executive Directors under the Approved, Unapproved and Global Executive Share Option Plans, the performance conditions were based exclusively on EPS growth.
No re-testing has been permitted in respect of any share option grant.
Given that the principal performance measures for the Companys Share Option Plans were based on growth in EPS, the Committee reserved the right to take into account, and adjust appropriately for, the enhancement effects of any purchase and subsequent cancellation of shares, or placing of shares into treasury, by the Company.
Executive Share Options still subject to exercise The following table comprises a summary of the performance periods and performance conditions relating to those Executive Share Option grants made under International Power Executive Share Option Plans which may still be exercised by one or more of the Executive Directors.
Date of award Performance Performance conditions and vesting rate period 3 October 2000 1 January 2001 These options were fully exercisable, as average annual growth in normalised earnings per International Power to 31 December Ordinary Share for the financial reporting period ended on 31 December 2000 to the reporting period ended on 2003 31 December 2003 exceeded 7%.
22 March 2001 1 January 2001 These options were fully exercisable, as average annual growth in normalised earnings per International Power to 31 December Ordinary Share for the financial reporting period ended on 31 December 2000 to the reporting period ended on 2003 31 December 2003 exceeded 7%.
24 May 2002 1 January 2002 These options would have been exercisable if average annual EPS growth over the performance period had equalled to 31 December or exceeded RPI 4%.
Whilst the performance condition was not achieved, the options may still be exercised on 2004 grounds of ill health retirement or redundancy only.
11 March 2005 1 January 2005 These options became fully exercisable from 11 March 2008 as EPS performance for the year ended 31 December to 31 December 2007 was 27.1p, which exceeded the maximum performance condition of 14.5p.
The threshold performance 2007 condition was 13.7p.

The cash allowance comprised the balance of 33% of salary which was the limit that the Committee had established to provide all pension benefits less the employer contribution.
The pension arrangements for Tony Concannon and Steve Riley were also provided through the Senior Section of the International Power Group of the ESPS, but they were not restricted by the HMRC earnings cap as they joined the scheme prior to 1 June 1989.
