Details of the LTIP and PSP, including performance conditions, are described in section II b ii of this report.
In 2008, under the Retention and Recruitment plan, a limited number of senior executives below Board level received an award of Reward Shares whereby no performance conditions applied, but, other than in the event of death or change of control, shares will only be released in the event that the relevant individuals remain with the Group for a three year period.
The Reward Shares were considered necessary to ensure that those executives key to delivering the targets were appropriately incentivised and locked in to the Company for three years.
The awards have been adjusted for the Rights Issue which is detailed in section II b v of this report.
The quantum of shares awarded was calculated using the mid-market value of the shares on 6 June 2007, the date on which John Browett accepted the offer of employment with the Group.
The one-off award of shares was made in compensation of the significant value of share awards and bonus entitlement John Browett was forfeiting upon joining the Company.
2 The release of these shares, in most circumstances, is dependent on John Browett remaining in employment until the vesting date, 6 December 2010.
These shares may vest on an earlier date in certain circumstances.
3 The award was made prior to Nicholas Cadbury joining the Board.
The status of the provisional awards under the LTIP and PSP are reviewed regularly and as at the last review in June 2010, the status of the awards as at the date of this report is as follows: Period in which provisional award made Status Award if status maintained 2008 09 TSR below median No award 2009 10 TSR above Index 27% Full vesting Vesting of the 2007 08 LTIP award was dependent on the Companys TSR performance relative to the constituents of the FTSE 100 Index over the three financial years ended 3 May 2008, 2 May 2009 and 1 May 2010.
These conditions were not met over the relevant performance periods and the award has subsequently lapsed.
The one-off LTIP award made to John Browett upon joining the Group is not subject to any performance conditions.
