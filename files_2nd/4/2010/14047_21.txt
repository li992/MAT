Section 4 Remuneration Report Introduction The following report details the remuneration policy and the actual remuneration of the Directors of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2010.
In preparing this report, consideration has been given to the disclosure requirements of the 2008 Combined Code and of the Companies Act 2006.
A resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting on 9 May 2011.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee consists solely of independent Non-Executive Directors.
It is chaired by Leonard V. Broese van Groenou and through 2010 comprised Margaret Ford, David Richardson and Tom Corcoran.
Margaret Ford and Tom Corcoran retired from the Board along with the Committees of Serco Group plc on 31 December 2010.
The Chairman of the Company and the Executive Directors may attend meetings of the Committee at its discretion and as appropriate.
They are not in attendance when their own remuneration arrangements are discussed.
The Committee met four times during the year.
The terms of reference of the Committee, a copy of which can be found on the Groups website, are reviewed annually to ensure that they meet best practice.
Details of the Directors attendance at the Committee meetings can be found in the Corporate Governance Report on page 82.
The Committee determines the overall remuneration policy for senior management and the individual remuneration of the Chairman and the Executive Directors.
This includes base salary, bonus, long-term incentives, pensions, benets and terms of employment including those terms on which service may be terminated.
Advisors to the Remuneration Committee The Committee has been advised by Towers Watson originally appointed in May 2008.
They have provided advice to the Committee throughout the year on the overall remuneration policy and philosophy.
Consulting services have also been provided to the Group by Towers Watson in relation to retirement benets and pay data.
In this regard the Committee is satisfied that any potential conicts are appropriately managed.
The Committee has also carefully reviewed the voluntary code of conduct in relation to executive consulting in the UK.
Fees paid to Towers Watson during the period totalled 122,000, the majority of which related to services provided for executive remuneration.
During the year the Committee considered and approved the terms of engagement and remuneration of the advisors.
The Group Human Resources Director, Geoff Lloyd, also provides advice and guidance to the Committee.
Remuneration policy In 2008 the Committee carried out a comprehensive triennial review of executive remuneration and of the principles which form the basis of the Companys remuneration policy.
As a result of the review, changes were made to both the structure and the levels of remuneration for the Executive Directors.
These were detailed in the 2009 Annual Review and Accounts.
During 2011 a further triennial review will be carried out and any changes will be set out in detail in next years report.
Sercos remuneration policy adopts the following principles which are that executive remuneration should: O Support Sercos long-term future growth, strategy and values: O Align the financial interests of executives and shareholders: O Provide market competitive reward opportunities for performance in line with expectations and deliver significant financial rewards for sustained out-performance: O Enable Serco to recruit and retain the best in all our chosen markets: O Be based on a clear rationale which participants, shareholders and other stakeholders are able to understand and support.
In setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors, in particular the non-financial objectives relating to the annual bonus scheme, the Remuneration Committee is able to consider corporate performance on safety, environmental, social and corporate governance matters.
The Committee retains discretion to reduce bonuses or the vesting of awards under the share plans if performance in these areas is unsatisfactory.
92 Serco Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 6HUFR $5$ S LQGG The elements of remuneration Composition The remuneration package for Executive Directors consists of base salary, annual bonus, long-term share-based incentives, pension and other benets.
The Groups policy is to ensure that a significant proportion of the package is related to performance.
The relative proportions of the performance-related and xed elements of remuneration excluding pension and other benets for Executive Directors - assuming on-target remuneration - is shown below.
Remuneration for Chief Executive Remuneration for Finance Director 41% 34% 39% 37% 25% 24% Base salary Performance-related annual bonus Performance-related long-term incentives expected value Base salary The Committees policy is to set the base salaries of the Executive Directors so as to ensure that total target remuneration is competitive.
Base salaries are normally reviewed annually.
The Committee takes note of relative pay and employment conditions within the comparator group and the Company when determining salaries.
The Committee is satisfied that the size prole of the companies in Towers Watsons database is representative of the companies in the FTSE 51 to 130.
It also believes that it is important that the same sources of market data are used across the Company to ensure consistency.
The Committee considered carefully whether base salaries for Christopher Hyman and Andrew Jenner should be increased in 2010, having particular regard to the following: O Sercos continuing strong performance in 2009 and 2010 including its growth in international markets, since salaries were last increased with effect from September 2008.
In 2009 earnings per share increased by 30.6% and in the first half of 2010 by 19.9%: O the strong personal contribution of both individuals towards the creation of value for shareholders: O the current difficult economic environment: O relative salary levels in the comparator group: O the increased scope of the role of the Finance Director resulting from an internal reorganisation that means he is now also responsible for the Groups operational efficiency agenda.
A comprehensive explanation of the business performance during the year has been provided in the Our performance section on pages 16 to 79.
With effect from 1 September 2010, the salaries of the Executive Directors were increased to 700,000 and 412,500 respectively, an increase of 8.5% in both cases.
To ensure that pay and conditions across the Group are taken into account when making decisions on Executive Directors pay, the Remuneration Committee was briefed about the overall decisions on base salaries and pay bill increases for Sercos Executive Committee and employees across the Group.
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the principles and considerations that were applied to Executive Directors are, as far as possible, applied to all employees.
Pay levels are designed to be competitive, fair and to reect the skills and performance of individual employees.
Individual pay increases in excess of those granted to the Executive Directors were awarded to various employees for reasons including promotion and increased scope of role.
The impact of these increases on the competitive market position of total remuneration including pension is to maintain the competitive position established at the time of the last triennial review.
Serco Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 93 6HUFR $5$ S LQGG Section 4 Remuneration Report Annual bonus Bonus is earned on the basis of achievement of a mix of financial and non-financial objectives which are weighted 80% and 20% respectively.
Payment for target performance is at 75% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 65% of base salary for the Finance Director.
Financial measures are based on the Serco Group results and the non-financial measures are individually set.
The three financial measures for 2010 were based on turnover, adjusted profit before tax and amortisation, and cash conversion.
These measures reect the growth and margin improvement strategies of the business.
The standards of performance set are designed to be stretching.
The non-financial goals set for 2010 assessed performance against a number of strategically important objectives for each individual.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity is 150% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 130% of base salary for the Finance Director.
On the basis of Sercos performance in 2010, annual awards of 136.8% and 117.52% of salary have been determined.
The Executive Directors delivered a financial performance that exceeded each of the quantitative targets.
Sercos financial performance for the year is described in more detail in the Our performance section starting on page 16.
The Executive Directors also delivered strongly against their personal objectives to implement the Groups strategy, introduce new management structures and ensure performance of key contracts.
Further, the new Chairman was inducted into the business during the period.
The bonus objectives for 2011 have been set on a similar basis.
Annual bonuses are not pensionable.
Share-based remuneration Long-term share incentives are awarded to Executive Directors under the Serco Group plc Deferred Bonus Plan DBP and the Serco Group plc Performance Share Plan PSP.
All grants and awards are made pursuant to the rules of the applicable plans and in accordance with the Model Code and policies in relation to the treatment of leavers have been adopted.
The measurement of the performance targets is undertaken by Mercer for the DBP and the PSP, and in relation to the Earnings Per Share EPS element of the targets, is audited by Deloitte LLP.
The conditions relating to the plans are detailed below.
Deferred Bonus Plan Executive Directors can elect to defer, for three financial years, up to 50% of the bonus earned by purchasing shares in the Company pursuant to the terms of the DBP.
The shares purchased will be matched by the Company if stretching performance targets are met.
The two performance measures are independent and each determines the vesting of half of the matching shares.
The measures are TSR compared to the companies in the FTSE 51 to 130 excluding investment trusts and EPS growth.
Relative TSR and EPS growth carry equal weight in respect of the matching shares awarded under the DBP.
The structure for vesting is the same for both measures.
TSR element: O No matching shares will be awarded if the Group does not meet or exceed the median TSR of the comparator group O An award of matching shares of one half of the gross value of the bonus deferred will vest for median or threshold performance O An award of matching shares with a value of two times the gross value of the deferred bonus vest for upper quartile or superior performance at the top end of the range.
EPS element: O If the annual compound growth in EPS does not meet 9% threshold then no matching shares will vest O If compound growth in EPS is at 9% threshold then 25% of this part of the matching award will vest O For compound growth in EPS of between 9% threshold and 14% maximum then this part of the award will vest on a straight line basis to 100%.
For the award made under the DBP and the PSP in 2009, the structure for vesting for the first year of the performance period is annual growth in EPS of 13% at threshold to 19% at maximum.
The denition of EPS is basic EPS excluding material acquisitions, disposals, currency movements and before amortisation of acquired intangibles.
The Committee has discretion to vary the proportion of awards that vest under the DBP to ensure that the outcomes are fair and appropriately reect the underlying financial performance of the Group.
In 2010 both the Chief Executive and the Finance Director elected to defer 50% of their earned bonus into the DBP.
94 Serco Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 6HUFR $5$ S LQGG Performance Share Plan The PSP awards granted to the Executive Directors are calculated at a face value on grant of 200% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 175% of base salary for the Finance Director.
The shares will normally only vest at the end of a three-year period, if the Executive Directors are still in employment with Serco and two performance measures have been met.
The two measures, which are independent, are TSR compared to the companies in the FTSE 51 to 130 excluding investment trusts and EPS growth.
Relative TSR performance determines the vesting of 70% of the shares and EPS growth the remainder.
Greater weight has been placed on relative TSR to underscore the importance of longer term alignment with shareholders interests.
The shares will vest in full only if Sercos performance is upper quartile or, in the case of EPS growth, superior and at the top end of the range.
Median or threshold performance will trigger the vesting of 25% of the award.
Performance between median threshold and upper quartile superior will be on a straight-line basis.
Dividends will be reinvested and distributed under both plans only in respect of shares that vest at the end of the performance period.
The Committee has discretion to vary the proportion of awards that vest under the Plans, to ensure that the outcomes are fair and appropriately reect the underlying financial performance of the Group.
The Committee considered the ongoing appropriateness of relative TSR and EPS as the performance measures for long-term share-based plans and agreed that no changes should be made at this point in time.
This will be reviewed once again as part of the triennial review for executive remuneration which, as referenced above, will commence in 2011.
Prior to 2009 share-based incentive awards were made under the Serco Group plc 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and the Serco Group plc 2005 Executive Option Plan EOP : the conditions relating to these plans are detailed below.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP awards granted to Executive Directors were calculated at 100% of salary at the time of grant.
The vesting of awards depends on the Groups TSR measured relative to the top 250 companies in the FTSE, as ranked by market capitalisation, excluding those in certain sectors such as oil and gas and financial services.
The Committee has discretion to vary the proportion of awards that vest if it considers that the TSR performance measure does not appropriately reect the underlying financial performance of the Group.
The final award under this plan completed its performance period on 31 December 2010, the Groups TSR performance relative to its comparator group was between median and upper quartile, and therefore 68.77% of the awards will vest.
There is no re-testing under the LTIP.
Executive Option Plan EOP Options granted under the EOP may be exercised after the third anniversary of grant, depending upon the achievement of a financial performance target over three years.
The options are granted at market value and awards made to Executive Directors were based on 100% of salary as at the 31 December prior to grant.
Achievement of the performance is measured by reference to the Groups EPS performance relative to the Retail Price Index RPI over the three-year performance period.
The vesting of the grants is based on the following schedule: O If the level of EPS growth is less than RPI 5% per annum, none of the options may be exercised O If the level of EPS growth is equal to RPI 5% per annum, 40% of the options may be exercised O If the level of EPS growth is equal to RPI 10% per annum, all of the options may be exercised O For an EPS growth of between RPI 5% and RPI 10% per annum, a proportion of the options between 40% and 100% may be exercised.
For the final option grant under this plan which completed its performance period on 31 December 2010, the Groups EPS growth was 22.73% per annum over the three-year performance period which resulted in all options vesting.
The level at which maximum vesting would occur was 12.69% per annum.
Sharesave Scheme The Group operates a Sharesave Scheme.
No performance conditions are attached to options granted under the Scheme as it is an allemployee scheme.
Options granted to Scheme participants are normally set at a discount of 10% to the market value of shares at grant.
None of the Directors participate in the Sharesave Scheme.
Serco Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 95 6HUFR $5$ S LQGG Section 4 Remuneration Report Share ownership policy The share ownership requirement for the Chief Executive is two times base salary and one times base salary for the Finance Director.
Executive Directors are required to retain in shares 50% of the net value of any performance shares or options exercised until they satisfy the shareholding requirement.
At the end of the year, by reference to the share price at that date, Executive Directors share ownership levels were as follows: Ordinary shareholding at Ordinary shareholding at 31 December 2010 555.5p 31 December 2009 530p o No.

The Executive Directors participate in the Serco Pension and Life Assurance Scheme SPLAS.
This is a funded, dened benefit scheme, which provides for a target pension of two-thirds of pensionable salary following a full career.
Members contribute to the scheme at rates varying according to the section of the scheme.
From 1 January 2007 Serco also introduced SMART whereby all members were given the option to have their pension contributions paid by salary sacrifice.
Under this arrangement the member makes no normal pension contributions, Serco makes additional contributions to SPLAS equal to those that the member would otherwise have made and the members contractual pay is reduced by the amount of these contributions.
Both Christopher Hyman and Andrew Jenner opted to have their contributions paid by SMART.
Kevin Beestons pension benets accrued prior to 6 April 2006 exceeded the new Lifetime Allowance, which came into force at that date, and he opted to cease paying contributions and accruing benets in the pension scheme after 6 April 2006.
Kevin Beeston retired at the conclusion of the Companys 2010 AGM on 11 May 2010.
Christopher Hyman opted to cease accruing benets in the pension scheme after 1 April 2010 and Andrew Jenner has opted to cease accrual after 31 December 2010.
Since 1 April 2010 Christopher Hyman has been in receipt of a cash allowance equal to 33% of his base salary in lieu of further pension provision.
From 1 January 2011 Andrew Jenner will also receive a cash allowance equal to 33% of his base salary in lieu of pension provision.
The Executive Directors remain entitled to lump sum and widows pension benets should they die before retirement and while still employed by Serco.
The Executive Directors receive a range of other benets which comprise 25 days holiday per year, a car, private medical insurance, private health insurance, life cover, an annual allowance for independent financial advice, and voluntary health checks every two years.
Service contracts and compensation Each Executive Director has a rolling service contract and these contracts will be available for inspection prior to the start of and after the Companys annual general meeting.
The service contracts have a notice period of 12 months.
The Company reserves the right to make a payment in lieu of notice.
In addition, where a Director leaves the Company following a change of control, whether or not he is dismissed or he elects to leave on notice, he will be entitled to receive a payment equivalent to up to one years remuneration.
The service contracts do not provide for termination payments to be made in any other circumstances.
There have been no payments made during the year in relation to compensation for loss of ofce.

Awards made are calculated at 100% of salary at the time of grant.
The TSR performance condition is measured relative to the top 250 companies in the FTSE, as ranked by market capitalisation, excluding those in certain sectors which are not comparable with the Group.
No awards were granted or lapsed during the period.
The performance conditions attached to the awards which vested on 31 December 2009 achieved performance between upper quartile and upper decile resulting in 195.42% of the award vesting.
On 31 December 2010 the performance conditions attached to the awards made on 12 November 2007 were satisfied.
Performance between median and upper quartile was achieved resulting in 68.77% of the award vesting.
Awards held by Kevin Beeston relate to his tenure as an Executive Director prior to September 2007.
The aggregate of the total theoretical gains on options exercised by Directors during 2010 amounted to 4.19 million.
This is calculated by reference to the difference between the closing mid-market price of the shares on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the options, disregarding whether such shares were sold or retained on exercise, and is stated before tax.
Of the 742,595 options exercised, 103,042 shares were retained.
The final award to Executive Directors under this plan was made in February 2008.
The extent to which an award will vest is measured by reference to the Groups Earnings Per Share EPS performance relative to the Retail Price Index RPI over the three-year performance period.
For those options marked with an approximately 14.67% 13.50% for prior year grants of the options granted under the Plan represent supplementary options, granted for the sole purpose of compensating participants for agreeing to bear the Companys liability to employers National Insurance Contributions upon the exercise of the underlying Plan awards.
These options can only be exercised in conjunction with and to the extent of the underlying option.
No payment was made for the grant of the awards.
Grants of options under the EOP are calculated at 100% of salary at the time of grant.
The market price of the Companys ordinary shares at the close of business on 31 December 2010 was 555.5p and the range during the year to 31 December 2010 was 493.9p to 651p.
No grants were made during the year.
For options granted which completed their performance period on 31 December 2010, the Groups EPS growth was 22.73% per annum over the three-year performance period which resulted in 100% options vesting.
The aggregate of the total theoretical gains on options exercised by Directors during 2010 amounted to 0.2 million.
The 139,322 options exercised, were all sold.

The TSR level shown at 31 December each year is the average of the closing daily TSR levels for the 30-day period up to and including that date.
The Companys TSR is compared to that of the FTSE 100 Index, which is a broad equity market index of which it is a constituent.
As detailed earlier, TSR is dened as the return shareholders would receive if they held a notional number of shares, and received dividends on those shares over a period of time.

The Directors receive pension and life assurance benets consistent with those provided by other leading companies.
The details of the dened benefit schemes operated by the Group are set out in the note on page 143.
In the event of death in service, the Serco Supplementary Death benefit Scheme provides for a lump sum payment.
The accrued pension benets of all Directors under the Serco Pension and Life Assurance Scheme, which is a dened benefit scheme, are as follows: Transfer Transfer Gross Increase value of value of Increase increase in accrued Value of accrued accrued Directors in transfer in accrued pension increase Total benets at benets at contributions value during pension during the in accrual accrued 31 December 31 December for the the year during year, net over the pension at 2010 2009 year 4 the year of ination year year end 1 2 3 1 - 2 - 3 5 6 7 8 p. a. p. a. p. a. Kevin Beeston 3,659,422 3,564,341 - 95,081 8,000 - - 287,460 Christopher Hyman 1,744,001 1,702,542 - 41,459 14,536 9,626 134,386 121,268 Andrew Jenner 929,133 857,573 - 71,560 14,893 12,141 148,113 74,730 Notes: a The total accrued pension shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement, based on pensionable service to the end of this year for Andrew Jenner, or to the date of ceasing accrual in the scheme for Kevin Beeston and Christopher Hyman.
The increase in accrued pension during the year is shown both as a gross increase and excluding any increase in respect of ination.
b The increase in the accrued pension of Andrew Jenner allows for both the increase in his final pensionable salary over the year and for the accrual of a further years pensionable service as a result of a further years active membership of the scheme.
c The increase in accrued pension for Christopher Hyman allows for the increase in his final pensionable salary and the accrual of an extra three months pensionable service until 1 April 2010 when he ceased accruing benets in the scheme.
d With effect from 1 April 2010 Christopher Hyman opted to receive a cash alternative equal to 33% of his base pay excluding bonuses in lieu of any further pension provision.
Christopher remains entitled to lump sum and widows pension benets should he die before retirement and whilst employed by Serco.
e The pension of Kevin Beeston increased in line with ination until his retirement from the Board at the conclusion of the Companys AGM on 11 May 2010.
The increase net of ination shown in 6 is therefore zero.
f Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the current transfer value regulations.
The assumptions to be used for calculating transfer values have been reviewed by the Trustees during the year and updated to reect changes in long term expectations for ination and improvements in life expectancy.
The net impact of these changes has resulted in lower transfer values than would have applied with the previous assumptions.
However, market movements over the year have acted to increase transfer values.
The difference between the transfer values at the beginning and end of the year, shown in 4, includes not only the effect of the increase in accrual and salaries and changes in the transfer value assumptions, but also the effect of uctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and the Directors, such as stock market movements.
g The value of the net increase in accrual represents the incremental value to the Director of his service during the year or the date the Director left the scheme.
In the case of Andrew Jenner the value of the net increase is calculated on the assumption that his service terminated at the year end.
It is based on the increase in the accrued pension, net of ination based on the increase in Retail Prices Index.
h The transfer values disclosed do not represent the sum paid or payable to the individual Director.
Instead, they represent a potential liability of the pension scheme.
i Both Directors who were active members of the scheme have opted to have their contributions paid by the Company under a salary sacrifice arrangement and hence no contributions were paid by the Directors during the year.
j Kevin Beeston left Serco employment and ceased being a Director on 11 May 2010.
His total accrued pension is his deferred pension at that date.
k Andrew Jenner ceased to be a member of the pension scheme with effect from 31 December 2010, opting to receive a cash alternative equal to 33% of his base pay excluding bonuses in lieu of any further pension provision.
Andrew remains entitled to lump sum and widows pension benets should he die before retirement and whilst employed by Serco.
