Unlike the Share Matching Plan, which had no performance targets, additional matching shares under the MCIP are earned only to the extent that stretching performance targets are met.
Following our review of 2010 performance the Committee has decided to replace trade working capital improvement with underlying sales growth as one of the three main performance indicators for the annual bonus in 2011.
This more closely aligns these indicators with our long-term strategic goals.
Nonetheless, we will continue to monitor a wider range of performance indicators to ensure that annual bonus outcomes for Unilevers Executive Directors and senior managers continue to reflect fairly the performance of the business and their individual contribution.
