68 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT INTRODUCTION This report has been prepared in accordance with Regulation 11 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 the Regulations.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
In preparing this report, the Company has also taken into account the Principles and Guidelines on Remuneration issued by the Association of British Insurers and the voting guidelines issued by the National Association of Pension Funds, as well as individual voting guidelines published by the Companys institutional investors.
The Companys auditors are required to report to Cairns shareholders on the auditable parts of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, those parts have been properly prepared in accordance with the Regulations and the Companies Act 2006.
In light of this requirement, and in order to present the information in a form that is as accessible as possible to shareholders, the report has been split into two main sections the first containing information which is unaudited and the second containing information which is audited.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION Overview of the Remuneration Committee and its policies Purpose and role of the Remuneration Committee The remuneration committee determines and agrees with the Board the overall remuneration policy for the executive directors and the members of the Companys senior management.
Within the terms of the agreed policy, the committee is also responsible for: t determining the total individual remuneration package for each executive director: t determining the level of awards made under the Companys long-term incentive plans and share option plans and the performance conditions which are to apply: t determining bonuses payable under the Companys annual cash bonus scheme: t determining the vesting of awards under the Companys long-term incentive plans and exercise of share options: and t determining the policy for pension arrangements, service agreements and termination payments for executive directors.
In designing the remuneration structures of the executive directors, the committee takes into account pay policies within the Group as a whole.
In this regard, the committee reviews and approves the overall remuneration levels of employees beneath senior management level it does not review individual remuneration amounts for such employees.
Cairns remuneration committee operates within written terms of reference agreed by the Board.
These are reviewed periodically to ensure that the remuneration committee remains up to date with best practices appropriate to Cairn, its strategy and the business environment in which it operates.
The terms of reference of the remuneration committee are available on the Companys website.
Members of the Remuneration Committee The members of the remuneration committee during the year were as follows: t Dr James Buckee chairman : t Todd Hunt: t Norman Murray: t Iain McLaren joined the committee on 20 May 2010 : and t Mark Tyndall retired as a non-executive director and member of the committee on 20 May 2010.
All of the current members of the committee are independent non-executive directors.
The Chief Executive is not a member of the remuneration committee but may attend its meetings by invitation and is consulted in respect of certain of its proposals although the Chief Executive is not consulted or involved in any discussions in respect of his own remuneration.
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee As and when the remuneration committee deems appropriate, it takes external advice on remuneration from a number of sources.
The committee periodically consults with Hewitt New Bridge Street an independent executive compensation consultancy appointed by the committee on various aspects of the directors remuneration packages.
In addition, the Companys legal advisers Shepherd and Wedderburn LLP and auditors Ernst & Young LLP provide ongoing assistance to the committee in respect of the Companys long-term incentive plans and share option schemes.
Advice obtained from Ernst & Young LLP is purely in relation to their independent verification of the Companys achievement against performance conditions applicable to the Companys long-term incentive plans and share option schemes.
Remuneration policy overview Cairns policy on executive directors remuneration for the current year and subsequent financial years is that the overall remuneration package should be sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate high-quality individuals capable of achieving the Groups objectives and thereby enhancing shareholder value.
The package is designed to support the Groups business strategy and to provide an appropriate incentive to maximise individual and corporate performance, whilst ensuring that overall rewards are market competitive.
The overall package is generally weighted more towards variable pay and, in relation to the variable pay element, the package is weighted more towards long-term performance through the award of long-term incentives.
There have been no changes to the Companys remuneration policy and practices during 2010 other than the implementation of an all-employee share incentive plan, which is described on page 79.
Directors and Governance Directors and Governance Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010 69 Overview Business Review Directors and Governance Financial Statements Additional Information DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued 1.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION continued Explanation of the components of executive directors remuneration Each executive directors remuneration package currently consists of basic salary, benefits, annual performance related bonuses, a long-term incentive plan, a defined contribution pension if appropriate and life assurance of four times basic annual salary.
Executive directors are also eligible to participate in the Companys all-employee share incentive plan.
Elements of package Purpose Basic salary To recognise market value of the role and of the individuals skills, experience and performance Annual cash bonus T o drive and reward the annual performance of individuals, the CEC and the Company against corporate objectives and KPIs Long term incentives To drive and reward the delivery of a sustained long-term Total Shareholder Return performance aligned to the interests of shareholders Pension provision To provide a competitive defined contribution to the individuals pension arrangements All employee Share Incentive Plan T o reward all employees for Company performance and encourage employee share ownership aligned to the interests of shareholders Other benefits To provide a competitive, cost-effective benefits package Basic salary and benefits Basic salary is reviewed annually by the remuneration committee and any changes take effect from 1 January each year.
In deciding appropriate levels, the committee periodically utilises objective benchmarking, which gives up-to-date information on remuneration practice within a comparator group of similar companies within the sector.
Following the most recent detailed benchmarking review carried out by Hewitt New Bridge Street consultants in early 2010, the basic salaries of the executive directors for the year 2010 were 600,000 for Sir Bill Gammell, 420,000 for Dr Mike Watts and 360,000 for each of Malcolm Thoms, Phil Tracy, Jann Brown and Simon Thomson.
The executive directors salaries for the year 2011 have been increased by approximately 4% to 625,000 for Sir Bill Gammell, 435,000 for Dr Mike Watts and 375,000 for each of Malcolm Thoms, Phil Tracy, Jann Brown and Simon Thomson.
This is in line with the increase awarded to all other employees.
Benefits available to the executive directors comprise a company car, permanent health insurance, private health insurance and death in service benefit.
Further details of the salary and benefits of each of the executive directors are also set out in the remuneration table on page 76.
Annual cash bonus scheme Cairns annual cash bonus scheme applies to all employees and executive directors.
For all participants, bonuses under the scheme are based on individual and Company performance measures.
Individual performance is measured through the Companys performance management system.
Company performance measures are based on annually defined key performance indicators KPIs.
The KPIs for 2010 encompassed various portfolio growth and operational performance targets, the majority of which were met.
Cairn is not wholly driven by financial KPIs our focus is on the safe execution of proposed work programmes, maximising the value of our portfolio and maintaining financial and commercial discipline.
In addition to the above, the bonus award to the executive directors is currently subject to two further performance measures, being performance against annually defined corporate objectives for the CEC and also Cairn India KPIs the latter replaced the reserve replacement performance measure used in relation to the 2009 cash bonus award.
The Cairn India KPIs comprised various operational targets in relation to HSE, operational excellence, project execution excellence, crude oil sales, stakeholder management, exploration, systems enhancements, technical skills, business planning and business improvement initiatives.
The CECs corporate objectives for 2010 are commercially sensitive and are therefore excluded from this report, as are the 2011 corporate objectives.
For 2010, this resulted in one quarter of each executive directors award being determined by individual performance, one quarter by Company performance against the annually defined KPIs referred to above, one quarter by performance against the CECs corporate objectives, and one quarter by performance against Cairn India KPIs.
The choice of these measures, and their respective weightings, reflects the remuneration committees belief that any short-term incentive compensation should be tied both to the overall performance of the Company and to those areas of its business that each individual can directly influence.
The maximum level of bonus award for the executive directors and other senior executives for 2010 was up to 100% of salary.
None of the executive directors received the maximum amount payable.
The actual bonuses awarded to the executive directors for performance in 2010 are shown in the remuneration table on page 76.
The bonus cap for all other employees for 2010 was between 25% and 40%.
The remuneration committee has the discretion to award bonuses in addition to those payable under the annual cash bonus scheme in recognition of particular efforts or achievements by employees, including executive directors.
No bonuses of this kind were awarded to executive directors during 2010.
A similar structure with equivalent maximum bonus potentials will operate in 2011.

UNAUDITED INFORMATION continued Explanation of the components of executive directors remuneration continued Long-term incentives introduction In order to encourage executive directors and other selected senior employees to deliver superior levels of long-term performance for the benefit of shareholders, the Companys policy since 1999 has been to provide these individuals with share incentives under a long-term incentive plan.
The current arrangement is the Cairn Energy PLC Long Term Incentive Plan 2009 2009 LTIP, which was approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 19 May 2009.
During the year, executive directors also held outstanding awards under the following historic share incentive arrangements operated by the Company: t The Cairn Energy PLC Long Term Incentive Plan 2006 2006 LTIP.
t The Cairn Energy PLC Replacement Long Term Incentive Plan Replacement LTIP.
Summaries of the 2009 LTIP, 2006 LTIP and Replacement LTIP are provided below.
2009 LTIP The 2009 LTIP enables executive directors and selected senior employees excluding those employed by the Cairn India Group to be granted conditional awards over ordinary shares, the vesting of which is normally dependent on both continued employment with the Group and the extent to which pre-determined performance conditions are met over a specified period of three years.
The scheme is intended to incentivise the participants to create shareholder value whilst retaining due focus on the underlying financial performance of the Group and to align their interests more closely with those of shareholders.
The value of ordinary shares awarded to a participant under the 2009 LTIP in any financial year is subject to a limit of 300% of his her basic salary although a 400% of salary limit can be applied to an individual by the remuneration committee in exceptional circumstances.
On the vesting of an award under the 2009 LTIP, only 50% of the ordinary shares to which the holder has become entitled are released to him her immediately, with the remaining 50% normally being released after a further period of one year.
No amounts due under the 2009 LTIP are recognised as remuneration until the award has vested and the ordinary shares released.
The first awards under the 2009 LTIP were made on 29 May 2009 to the executive directors and a selection of the Companys senior managers.
A further award was made to the executive directors on 26 March 2010.
Details of the awards granted to the executive directors are set out on page 77.
Pages 79 and 80 contain a summary of the performance conditions that will determine the extent to which the above awards vest at the end of the applicable performance period.
For awards made in future years, the remuneration committee will review, and may amend, the performance conditions used for this arrangement in order to ensure they remain appropriate, challenging and in line with best practice investor guidelines.
2006 LTIP The 2006 LTIP was approved by shareholders at the EGM held on 17 November 2006, conditional on the flotation of Cairn India becoming effective, which occurred on 9 January 2007.
Following the adoption of the 2009 LTIP, no further awards have been or will be granted under the 2006 LTIP.
The date of grant of the last award under the 2006 LTIP was 7 July 2008.
The 2006 LTIP enabled executive directors and selected senior employees to be granted conditional awards over two separate pools of notional units, the first relating to Cairn India Cairn India Units and the second relating to the Capricorn Group Capricorn Units together, Units.
As explained in last years directors remuneration report, significant issues were identified by the remuneration committee in relation to one aspect of the 2006 LTIPs operation, namely the mechanism for valuing Capricorn Units.
As a result, all participants in this arrangement who held awards over Capricorn Units Capricorn Awards were, during 2009, invited to surrender those rights in exchange for the grant of Converted Awards over ordinary shares in the Company pursuant to the Replacement LTIP further details of which are provided below, with the number of ordinary shares subject to each such Converted Award being calculated by reference to an implied valuation of the Capricorn Group derived from the 2009 farm-in to its Greenland assets by PETRONAS.
On the basis that each of these individuals accepted this invitation, there are no outstanding Capricorn Awards under the 2006 LTIP.
The above conversion process did not, however, apply to outstanding awards over Cairn India Units Cairn India Awards.
As a result, these awards which are held by the executive directors and a number of senior managers continued to subsist on their original terms.
The extent to which a Cairn India Award vests is dependent on continued employment within the Group and the extent to which pre-determined performance conditions relating to Cairn India are met over a specified period.
Following the vesting of a Cairn India Award, the participant becomes entitled to such number of ordinary shares in the Company as have a market value equal to the aggregate price of the vested Units.
For the purposes of the 2006 LTIP, the price of a Cairn India Unit on any day is equal to the price of a Cairn India share, as quoted on the BSE and the NSE of India.
Only 50% of these ordinary shares are transferred to the participant immediately.
The remaining 50% are normally withheld for a further year.
Information in relation to the Cairn India Awards held by the executive directors, together with details of those awards that vested during 2010, are set out on pages 77 and 78.
A summary of the applicable performance conditions is provided on pages 80 and 81.

UNAUDITED INFORMATION continued Explanation of the components of executive directors remuneration continued Replacement LTIP The Replacement LTIP was approved by shareholders at the EGM on 21 December 2009 and, as explained above, has been used to grant Converted Awards over ordinary shares to those participants in the 2006 LTIP who accepted the invitation to surrender their Capricorn Awards.
These Converted Awards were granted on 22 December 2009.
Converted Awards comprise conditional rights to acquire ordinary shares, the vesting of which is normally dependent both on continued employment with the Group and on the extent to which pre-determined performance conditions are met over a specified period of three years.
The form of these performance conditions, and the period over which they are measured, mirrors those that applied to the replaced Capricorn Awards.
On the vesting of a Converted Award, any ordinary shares to which the holder becomes entitled are normally subject to an extended holding period during which they cannot be sold save to meet tax liabilities arising on vesting.
This period will generally last until 9 January 2013.
Where a participant ceases employment with the Group during this holding period his her unreleased ordinary shares will normally be forfeit for no consideration.
Exceptions to this general forfeiture principle are at the remuneration committees discretion but will usually be limited to good leaver circumstances.
In addition, if prior to the end of the holding period, events occur which cause the remuneration committee to consider that the implied value of the Capricorn Group used as part of the conversion process see above was materially overstated as at the date on which the conversion took place, then a proportion of a participants unreleased ordinary shares may be forfeited for no consideration.
In these circumstances, the number of ordinary shares to be forfeited will be decided by the remuneration committee on such fair and equitable basis as it may determine at the relevant time.
Information in relation to the Converted Awards held by executive directors, together with details of those awards that vested during 2010, are set out on pages 77 to 79.
A summary of the applicable performance conditions is provided on pages 81 and 82.
No awards were granted under the Replacement LTIP during 2010 and no further awards will be granted pursuant to this arrangement in the future.
Pension arrangements The Company operates a defined contribution group personal pension plan in the UK.
The scheme is non-contributory and all UK permanent employees are eligible to participate.
The Company contributes 10% of basic annual salary 15% in respect of senior executives on behalf of all qualifying employees.
The Company also has a pension committee which meets on a regular basis to assess the performance and suitability of the Companys pension arrangements.
Dr Mike Watts and Jann Brown are members of the Company plan and, during the year, both received a contribution equal to 15% of their respective annual basic salaries.
Simon Thomson and Malcolm Thoms both have an individual personal pension plan and, during the year, received a contribution from the Company equal to 15% of their respective annual basic salaries.
During the year, Sir Bill Gammell and Phil Tracy both received an amount equivalent to 15% of their respective annual basic salaries in the form of additional salary, as their pension arrangements are fully funded.
Further details of the contributions made by the Company in respect of each executive director are set out in the remuneration table on page 76.
The Company is also the principal employer for a Small Self-Administered Scheme.
Sir Bill Gammell is the sole member of this scheme.
The Company is not contractually obliged to make any contributions into this scheme on behalf of Sir Bill Gammell and did not do so during the year.
All employee share schemes Share Incentive Plan 2010 In order to encourage increased levels of long-term share ownership amongst its general employee population, the Company launched an HM Revenue & Customs approved share incentive plan SIP in April 2010.
The SIP provides eligible employees, including the executive directors, with the following benefits: t Partnership shares employees can authorise deductions of up to 1,500 per tax year from pre-tax salary, which are then used to acquire ordinary shares on their behalf.
t Matching shares the Company can award further free shares to all participants who acquire partnership shares on the basis of up to two matching shares for every one partnership share purchased.
For the tax year 2010 2011, the Company awarded two matching shares for every one partnership share purchased and intends to continue using this award ratio for the tax year 2011 2012. t Free shares employees can be given up to 3,000 worth of ordinary shares free in each tax year.
The first award of free shares to employees, including the executive directors, was made on 24 May 2010.
As the SIP is an all-employee arrangement, no performance conditions are imposed in relation to any matching or free shares awarded pursuant to its terms.

The Company does not have a policy regarding executive shareholding requirements.
Share option schemes for other employees Introduction The Company currently operates the following share option schemes for employees below senior management level.
t 2009 Approved Share Option Plan 2009 Approved Option Plan t 2009 Unapproved Share Option Plan 2009 Unapproved Option Plan t Replacement Share Option Plan Replacement Option Plan t 2003 Approved Share Option Plan 2003 Option Plan t 2002 Unapproved Share Option Plan 2002 Option Plan t 1996 Second Share Option Scheme 1996 Option Scheme Brief summaries of these arrangements are set out below.
It should, however, be noted that none of the Companys executive directors participate in any of the above schemes and it is not intended that options will be granted to them under these arrangements in the future.
2009 Approved Option Plan and 2009 Unapproved Option Plan The 2009 Approved Option Plan and the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan, both of which were approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 19 May 2009, are used to grant market value options to less senior employees of the Group excluding those employed by the Cairn India Group.
The principal difference between these two arrangements is that the approval of HM Revenue & Customs was sought and obtained for the 2009 Approved Option Plan, whereas no such approval was sought in relation to the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan.
Options granted under the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan and 2009 Approved Option Plan are normally exercisable between three and 10 years following their grant but only if and to the extent that specified performance conditions have been satisfied.
The value of ordinary shares over which options may be granted to a participant under the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan and 2009 Approved Option Plan in any financial year is subject to a limit of 200% of his her basic salary although a 300% of salary limit can be applied to an individual by the remuneration committee in exceptional circumstances.
The first options under the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan and 2009 Approved Option Plan were granted on 29 May 2009, with further awards being made to selected employees during 2010.
A summary of the performance conditions that will determine the extent to which these options vest at the end of the applicable performance period is provided on page 82.
Replacement Option Plan The Replacement Option Plan, which was approved by shareholders at the EGM on 21 December 2009, was introduced to facilitate the conversion of certain options that had previously been granted by the Company under the Cairn Energy PLC Share Option Plan 2006 2006 Plan.
The 2006 Plan was established by the Company at the same time as the 2006 LTIP described above.
It was designed to enable selected employees to be granted options over Capricorn Units i. e. notional units of value relating to the Capricorn Group.
However, due to the same technical issues highlighted above in relation to the 2009 LTIP, the holders of these options over Capricorn Units were, during 2009, invited to surrender their rights in exchange for the grant of Converted Options over ordinary shares in the Company pursuant to the Replacement Option Plan.
All participants in the 2006 Plan subsequently accepted this conversion invitation and were granted their Converted Options on 22 December 2009.
As a result, there are no outstanding options over Capricorn Units under the 2006 Plan.
Converted Options granted under the Replacement Option Plan comprise conditional rights to acquire ordinary shares for a specified price, the vesting of which is normally dependent on both continued employment with the Group and the extent to which pre-determined performance conditions are met over a specified period of three years.
The form of these performance conditions, and the period over which they are measured, are intended to mirror those that applied to the options over Capricorn Units that have been replaced.

No options were granted under the Replacement Option Plan during 2010 and no further awards will be granted pursuant to this arrangement in the future.
1996 Option Scheme, 2002 Option Plan and 2003 Option Plan The 1996 Option Scheme, 2002 Option Plan and 2003 Option Plan all of which have subsequently been superseded were formerly used by the Company to grant options to a broad selection of employees in the Group.
Although a number of options granted under these plans currently subsist, no further awards will be granted pursuant to their terms.
A summary of the performance conditions that must be satisfied before awards under these plans can be exercised is provided on page 83.
Cairn India schemes As part of the arrangements surrounding its flotation, Cairn India established its own share option schemes pursuant to which options to acquire its shares can be granted.
These arrangements have been or will be used to grant options over Cairn India shares to selected employees and executive directors of Cairn India and its various subsidiary undertakings.
Dilution of share capital pursuant to share plans In any 10-year rolling period, the number of ordinary shares which may be issued in connection with the Companys discretionary share plans cannot exceed 5% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital.
In addition, in any ten-year rolling period, the number of ordinary shares which may be issued in connection with all the Companys employee share schemes whether discretionary or otherwise cannot exceed 10% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital.
It should also be noted that all shares acquired by or awarded to participants under the SIP are existing ordinary shares purchased in the market.
As a result, the SIP does not involve the issue of new shares or the transfer of treasury shares.
Non-executive directors The remuneration of each of the non-executive directors other than the Chairman is determined by the executive members of the Board and the Chairman within limits set out in the Articles of Association and having taken independent advice on appropriate levels.
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the remuneration committee in his absence, again based on independent advice.
In all cases, the fees are designed to attract experienced individuals and reflect the increased responsibilities of the role of the Chairman and other non-executive directors.
Non-executive directors cannot participate in any of the Companys long-term incentive arrangements and are not entitled to a bonus or pension contributions.
The non-executive directors fees for 2010 are set out in full in the remuneration table on page 76.
The non-executive directors fees for 2011 were increased by 4% and are 213,000 for Norman Murray and 66,000 for each of the other non-executive directors.
In addition to this, an annual fee of 10,000 is payable to each of Iain McLaren and Dr James Buckee for their roles as chairman of the audit and remuneration committee respectively.
Service contracts letters of appointment The Companys policy is for all executive directors to have contracts of service which can be terminated either by the director concerned or by the Company on giving 12 months notice of termination.
In the event of termination by the Company other than as a result of a change of control, the executive directors would be entitled to loss of salary, benefits and pension contributions for the notice periods.
Depending on the circumstances of termination, the executive directors may be entitled, or the remuneration committee may exercise its discretion to allow the executive director, to retain a proportion of his or her outstanding awards under long-term incentive arrangements but only to the extent that any applicable performance conditions have been met.
The committees policy on early termination is to emphasise the duty of the terminated party to mitigate any loss caused by the early termination to the fullest extent practicable.
On a change of control of the Company resulting in the termination of a directors employment, each of the directors is entitled to compensation of a sum equal to his her annual basic salary as at the date of termination of employment.
Each of the non-executive directors has a letter of appointment in terms of which he is appointed for a fixed three-year period, subject to the Companys Articles of Association, which provide for retirement by rotation at least once every three years.
The letters of appointment set out the time commitment expected by the Company and can be terminated with immediate effect by either the director concerned or the Company.
The Board is satisfied that each of the non-executive directors commits sufficient time to fulfil his her duties as a director of the Company.
None of the non-executive directors has any conflict of interest which has not been disclosed to the Board in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association.
The executive directors service contracts and non-executive directors letters of appointment are available for inspection on request and will be available for inspection before and during the AGM to be held on 19 May 2011.

As explained on pages 70 and 71, the above Converted Awards were granted to the executive directors in consideration for the surrender of their outstanding Capricorn Awards granted under the 2006 LTIP.
Each of the Converted Awards will ordinarily vest on or shortly after the expiry of the applicable performance period, but only to the extent that the performance conditions described on pages 81 and 82 of this report are satisfied.

Awards vesting during the year overview On 8 January 2010, the three-year performance period applicable to certain awards granted under the 2006 LTIP and Replacement LTIP came to an end.
Shortly thereafter, the remuneration committee determined that the relevant performance conditions see pages 80 to 82 for full details had been met to the following extent: t in the case of the Cairn India Awards granted under the 2006 LTIP, Cairn Indias Total Shareholder Return TSR performance over the period was ranked between median and upper decile in the applicable comparator group resulting in a vesting of approximately 80% of the Cairn India Units over which the awards subsisted: and t in the case of the Converted Awards granted under the Replacement LTIP, the Companys TSR performance over the period was i ranked above upper decile in the applicable comparator group: and ii in excess of 150%.
The 1.33 multiplier contained within the rules of the Replacement LTIP was therefore applied in full, resulting in a vesting of 133% of the ordinary shares over which the awards subsisted.
The calculations used to determine these vesting percentages were carried out by Cairn and independently verified by Ernst & Young LLP.
Details of LTIP awards which vested during 2010 pursuant to the 2006 LTIP and Replacement LTIP are given in the tables below.

In accordance with the rules of the 2006 LTIP, 50% of the ordinary shares in respect of which the above Cairn India Awards vested were released to the executive directors immediately.
The remaining 50% of the ordinary shares have been withheld by the trustee of the Companys employee benefit trust the Trustee and will normally be released on the first anniversary of vesting.

Following the above vesting, a total of 2,247,126 ordinary shares acquired by the executive directors were sold on their behalf to fund the tax and national insurance liabilities arising on vesting.
The balance of the ordinary shares acquired are subject to an extended holding period during which they will be held by the Trustee as nominee for each of the individuals.
This holding period, during which the ordinary shares cannot be sold and may be forfeited in certain specified circumstances, will normally expire on 9 January 2013.
Overview of share incentive plan performance conditions Introduction The vesting of each award and option granted under the Companys various share incentive plans is conditional on the achievement of performance conditions determined by the remuneration committee at the relevant date of grant.
Set out below is a summary of the conditions applicable to awards and options that were outstanding during the year.
In the case of the Companys long-term incentive plans being the arrangements in which the executive directors participate, the conditions principally relate to the TSR performance of the Company.
These TSR measures were selected by the remuneration committee on the basis that they improve shareholder alignment and are consistent with the Companys objective of delivering long-term value to shareholders.
On the expiry of the performance period applicable to an award or option, the calculations necessary to determine the extent to which the relevant conditions have been satisfied are subject to independent verification by Ernst & Young LLP.
2009 LTIP In the case of all outstanding awards granted under the 2009 LTIP, the extent to which they vest will be determined by comparing the TSR of the Company over a three year performance period with the TSR of a share in each company in a comparator group.
The tables below show the comparator groups for each tranche of awards granted under the 2009 LTIP to executive directors.

AUDITED INFORMATION continued Overview of share incentive plan performance conditions continued 2009 LTIP continued At the end of the performance period, each company in the comparator group will be listed in order of TSR performance to produce a ranking table.
The vesting of awards will then take place as follows: Ranking of Company against the comparator group Percentage of ordinary shares comprised in Award that vest Below median 0% Median 20% Upper decile i. e. top 10% 100% Between median and upper decile 20% 100% on a straight line basis In order to make sure that the 2009 LTIP encourages and rewards exceptional performance, the performance conditions attaching to awards also provide that, where the TSR of the Company produces a ranking at or above the upper decile level in the appropriate comparator group, a participant will then be given the opportunity to increase the percentage of his her award that vests through the application of a multiplier that is linked to the TSR actually achieved over the performance period.
The way in which this multiplier will operate is as follows: Multiplier applied to determine the number of ordinary shares that actually vest TSR of the Company over the performance period 1 50% or less 1.33 100% or more 1 1.33 on a straight line basis Between 50% and 100% However, notwithstanding the performance of the Company against the above targets, no part of any award will vest unless the remuneration committee is satisfied that there has been an overall satisfactory and sustained improvement in the performance of the Company as a whole over the performance period.
2006 LTIP Cairn India Awards In the case of all outstanding Cairn India Awards granted under the 2006 LTIP, the extent to which they vest is determined by comparing the TSR of a Cairn India share over a three year performance period with the TSR of a share in each company in a comparator group.
The tables below show the comparator groups for each tranche of Cairn India Awards.
At the end of the performance period, each company in the comparator group is listed in order of TSR performance to produce a ranking table.
The vesting of Cairn India Awards then takes place as follows: Ranking of Cairn India share against the comparator group Percentage of Cairn India Units comprised in Award that vest Below median 0% Median 20% Upper decile i. e. top 10% 100% Between median and upper decile 20% 100% on a straight line basis Directors and Governance Directors and Governance Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2010 81 Overview Business Review Directors and Governance Financial Statements Additional Information DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued 2.
AUDITED INFORMATION continued Overview of share incentive plan performance conditions continued 2006 LTIP Cairn India Awards continued For the same reasons as noted above in relation to the 2009 LTIP, where the TSR of a Cairn India share produces a ranking at or above the upper decile level in the appropriate comparator group, the percentage of the relevant Cairn India Award that vests may be increased through the application of the following multiplier that is linked to the TSR actually achieved over the performance period: Multiplier applied to determine the number of Cairn India Units that actually vest TSR of Cairn India over the performance period 1 40% or less 1.33 80% or more 1 1.33 on a straight line basis Between 40% and 80% Notwithstanding the performance of a Cairn India share against the above targets, no part of any Cairn India Award vests unless the remuneration committee is satisfied that there has been an overall satisfactory and sustained improvement in the performance of the Company as a whole over the performance period.
Replacement LTIP The vesting of a Converted Award is determined by the extent to which specified performance conditions are satisfied over the original three year performance period that applied to the 2006 LTIP Capricorn Award that it has replaced pursuant to the conversion mechanism described on pages 70 and 71.
The terms of these conditions that apply to each Converted Award are the same as those applied to the Capricorn Award that it has replaced.
In particular, the extent to which a Converted Award vests is determined by comparing the TSR of the Company over the applicable performance period with the TSR of a share in each company in a comparator group see below with vesting taking place as follows: Percentage of ordinary shares comprised Ranking of the Company against the comparator group in converted Award that vest Below median 0% Median 20% Upper decile i. e. top 10% 100% Between median and upper decile 20% 100% on a straight line basis For the same reasons as noted above in relation to the 2009 LTIP, where the TSR of the Company produces a ranking at or above the upper decile level in the appropriate comparator group, the percentage of the relevant Converted Award that vests may be increased through the application of the following multiplier that is linked to the TSR actually achieved over the performance period: Multiplier applied to determine the number of ordinary shares that actually vest TSR of the Company over the performance period 1 75% or less 1.33 150% or more 1 1.33 on a straight line basis Between 75% and 150% For the purposes of the above conditions, the TSR performance of the Company over the performance period will be calculated by aggregating i the growth or fall in the TSR of a Capricorn Unit achieved between the start of the period and the conversion date being the date on which the conversion mechanism described on pages 70 and 71 became effective : and ii the growth or fall in the TSR of a Cairn share between the conversion date and the end of the period.
Notwithstanding the performance of the Company against the above targets, no part of any Converted Award vests unless the remuneration committee is satisfied that there has been an overall satisfactory and sustained improvement in the performance of the Company as a whole over the performance period.

The table below shows the comparator groups for each tranche of Converted Awards.
2009 Approved Option Plan and 2009 Unapproved Option Plan All options granted under the above arrangements are subject to a TSR growth target measured over a three year performance period.
Under this target, vesting will occur as follows: Average annual compound growth in TSR of the Company over the performance period Percentage of ordinary shares comprised in option that vests Less than 5% 0% 5% 50% 10% or more 100% More than 5% but less than 10% 50% 100% on a straight line basis Notwithstanding the above condition, no part of an option granted under the 2009 Approved Option Plan or 2009 Unapproved Option Plan will vest unless the TSR of the Company over the performance period is sufficient to place it at or above the median level in the same comparator group of companies that is used for the purposes of the 2009 LTIP see table on page 79.
Replacement Option Plan The vesting of a Converted Option will be determined by the extent to which specified performance conditions are satisfied over the original three year performance period that applied to the 2006 Plan Capricorn Unit option that it has replaced pursuant to the exchange mechanism described on page 72.
The terms of these conditions that apply to each Converted Option are the same as those applied to the Capricorn Unit option that it has replaced.
In particular, the extent to which a Converted Option vests will be determined by reference to the Companys achievement against a share price growth target measured over the applicable performance period.
Under this target, vesting will occur as follows: Average annual compound growth in the price Percentage of ordinary shares comprised of a Cairn share over the performance period in Converted Option that vests Less than 5% 0% 5% 50% 10% or more 100% More than 5% but less than 10% 50% 100% on a straight line basis Notwithstanding the above condition, no part of a Converted Option vests unless the TSR of the Company over the performance period is sufficient to place it at or above the median level in the same comparator group of companies that is used for the purposes of the Converted Awards granted under the Replacement LTIP see the table above.
