124 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2010 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT STATEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE As the new Chairman of the Groups Remuneration Committee I am pleased to present the Directors remuneration report for 2010, for which we will be seeking approval from shareholders at our annual general meeting in May.
Firstly I would like to extend my thanks to Dr Wolfgang Berndt who chaired the Committee admirably through a challenging period and I am delighted to be given the opportunity to lead the Committee as we build the trust with all our stakeholders to ensure the best remuneration structure possible.
During the past year the Committee has undertaken a great deal of work to ensure a continued prudent approach to our remuneration policy while recognising the need to attract, incentivise and retain our key people.
Shareholders may care to note that of the six current members of the Committee, four have joined within the last 18 months.
We have carried out a wide-ranging and considered consultation with shareholders.
I have very much enjoyed the opportunity that this has given me to exchange views on the Groups remuneration strategy.
We have carefully reflected on the feedback from shareholders and this has directly influenced our approach.
There continues to be a high level of interest in remuneration in both the sector as a whole and Lloyds Banking Group arrangements.
Throughout the year we have sought to take this into account along with shareholders views on remuneration, ensuring continued compliance with the FSA Code of Practice on Remuneration whilst balancing these factors with what is right for our business.
We held fifteen Remuneration Committee meetings during the year, at which a wide range of matters were discussed.
This gives an indication of the importance we place on ensuring the effectiveness of the Groups remuneration structures.
Our conclusion, following the considerable amount of consultation and an in depth analysis of performance, was that 2010 outcomes should demonstrate the exercise of restraint rather than fully reflect improved performance and we should retain a broadly similar structural approach for 2011.
2010 REMUNERATION OUTCOMES The Group has made significant progress during the year.
We have also reduced the level of risk in our business in reaction to the economic events that had a particularly deep impact on the banking sector and we are endeavouring, as a business, to continue to support the UKs economic recovery.
Our decision making has focussed on balancing shareholders views on remuneration with the need to attract, incentivise and retain the right people, in light of improved business performance.
In reaching a decision on the size of the bonus pool as a whole and for the Executive Directors in particular, the Committee took into account the need for adjustments to reflect the Groups current profitability and current and future risk.
The Committee worked closely with the Group Risk Committee in making its decision.
As a result: There were no salary increases made to Executive Directors in 2010.
We have ensured that any bonuses paid in respect of performance in 2010 have been rigorously tested against targets.
The use of risk-adjusted and non-financial measures under this plan has been highly successful in promoting a long-term focus within the senior management team.
To ensure a prudent approach is applied in practice we have exercised downward discretion on the annual bonuses: the payouts are lower than if they were calculated on a purely formulaic basis.
Exercising its discretion, the Committee has been mindful, amongst other things, of the appropriate balance of profit between shareholders and staff, key balance sheet metrics, share price performance, the quality of profits and future risks as well as the competitive environment.
Furthermore, 100 per cent of any award will be deferred into shares and will not be released until March 2013 at the earliest.
In order to increase alignment with shareholders, this will be subject to malus if performance is not sustained.
Awards made in March 2010 under the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP were below 2008 levels by up to 100 per cent of salary and lower than the market practice for long-term incentives in our sector.
The approximate make-up of the main components of our package for Executive Directors on an expected value basis is shown below: Long-term incentive Based on a combination of performance targets comprising Paid in shares after 40% earnings per share, economic profit and the achievement of three years stretching share price targets Short-term incentive Based on financial measures and on a balanced scorecard Deferred into shares until 30% of non-financial measures at least March 2013, subject to malus Salary Based on role, market competitiveness, and performance Paid in cash 30% The split in the components in the above chart are for executive directors.
Comparable numbers for the Group Chief Executive are: long-term incentive 40 per cent, short-term incentive 32 per cent and salary 28 per cent Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information 125 Group profile 1 Summary of Group results 14 Board of Directors 110 Report of the independent Shareholder information 284 Lloyds Banking Group auditors on the consolidated Group structure 2 Divisional results 26 Directors report 112 Glossary 285 Annual Report financial statements 144 Group performance 3 Other financial information 52 Corporate governance report 114 Abbreviations 290 and Accounts 2010 Consolidated Strategy and progress 4 Five year financial summary 56 Directors remuneration Index to annual report 291 financial statements 146 report 124 Chairmans statement 6 Our people 57 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 153 Group Chief Executives review 8 Corporate responsibility 60 Report of the independent Addressing the key issues 10 Risk management 65 auditors on the parent company Marketplace trends 12 financial statements 272 Parent company financial statements 273 Notes to the parent company financial statements 276 OUR APPROACH TO REMUNERATION FOR 2011 The changes at Board level, including my appointment as Chairman of this Committee, provided us with an excellent opportunity to review the structure and quantum of our remuneration.
This review included an open and transparent dialogue with shareholders and I intend to maintain the renewed commitment to shareholder engagement that we have demonstrated.
Our principal focus was to ensure an appropriate alignment between performance and pay in terms of both business strategy and risk profile.
We continue to have concerns that our remuneration framework is uncompetitive and this is an area that will be kept under close and continuous review by the committee.
However, our approach to remuneration in 2011 remains broadly unchanged from last year: We are proposing increases to Executive Director base salaries for 2011, in line with those for the wider workforce.
This will be our first increase since 2008.
The annual incentive opportunity for 2011 will stay the same as in previous years.
The bonus will continue to be based on a combination of Group financial measures and a balanced scorecard of business financial and non-financial measures, including customers, people and risk.
Awards under the LTIP remain below 2008 levels and will be limited to 300 per cent of salary except for Antnio Horta-Osrio.
The performance measures for the LTIP will include Economic Profit and EPS, as in previous years, together with a measure of delivery to shareholders using absolute Total Shareholder Return TSR.
We are also proposing a change to the delivery of remuneration and shareholders will be asked at the annual general meeting to approve a resolution to use newly issued shares to settle deferred bonus and LTIP awards, rather than market purchased shares.
In response to concerns about the level of risk in the banking sector, we believe that this is an effective way of improving our capital position.
The Board has appointed Antnio Horta-Osrio as our new Group Chief Executive who starts on 1 March 2011.
He will be undertaking a review of strategy.
When this is complete we will review the remuneration arrangements to ensure they remain consistent with the strategy and if appropriate will consult with shareholders on any changes needed.
CONCLUSION During the course of 2010 our consultation with shareholders on executive remuneration has helped ensure that: We are rewarding executives for delivery of the most important drivers of the business, improving both the financial and non-financial health of the business and with a medium and longer term focus on risk, capital and liquidity of the business.
We have a prudent approach to remuneration with the structure for 2011 designed to reflect corporate and personal performance.
We strike an appropriate balance by considering both the sensitivity of the current environment and the longer term policy objectives to support the Groups business strategy.
Our approach is fully aligned with the FSA Remuneration Code of Practice.
We therefore recommend this report to shareholders and ask for your support at the forthcoming annual general meeting.
Anthony Watson CBE Chairman, Remuneration Committee This is a report made by the Board of Lloyds Banking Group plc, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee.
It covers the current and proposed components of the remuneration policy and details the remuneration for each serving Director during 2010.
The Group has complied throughout the period with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code previously known as the Combined Code in relation to Directors remuneration.
In addition, the report has been prepared in accordance with the Large and Medium sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008.
126 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2010 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT GOVERNANCE AND RISK MANAGEMENT An essential component of our approach to remuneration is the governance process that underpins it.
This ensures that our policy is robustly applied and risk is managed appropriately.
The overarching purpose of the Remuneration Committee is to consider, agree and recommend to the board an overall remuneration policy and philosophy for the Group that is aligned to its long-term business strategy, business objectives, risk appetite and values and recognises the interests of relevant stakeholders.
The Group has a conservative business model characterised by a risk culture founded on prudence and accountability.
The remuneration policy and philosophy covers the whole Group, but the Committee pays particular attention to the top management population, including the highest paid employees in each division, those colleagues who perform significant influence functions for the Group and those who could have a material impact on the Groups risk profile.
The Committees role is to ensure that these colleagues are provided with appropriate incentives and reward to encourage them to enhance the performance of the Group and that they are recognised for their individual contribution to the success of the organisation, whilst ensuring that there is no reward for excessive risk taking.
The Committee determines the pensions policy for the Group and advises on other major changes to employee benefits schemes.
It also agrees the policy for authorising claims for expenses from the Group Chief Executive and the Chairman.
It has delegated power for settling remuneration for the Chairman, the Group Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and any group employee whose salary and bonus exceeds a specified amount, currently 750,000.
To ensure compliance with the FSA Code of Practice, the Committee approves remuneration for remuneration Code Staff and that of senior risk and compliance officers.
The Committee monitors the application of the authority delegated to the Group Executive Committee and the divisional Remuneration Committees to ensure that policies and principles are being fairly and consistently applied.
The Committee liaises closely with the Risk Committee and the risk function in relation to risk-adjusted performance measures, including consideration of both current and future risk.
Together the management of remuneration and risk form an integral part of the Boards determination of Group corporate strategy.
All the independent Non-Executive Directors are invited to attend meetings and have the opportunity to comment on proposals and have their views taken into account before the Committees decisions are implemented.
The Committees terms of reference are available from the Company Secretary and are displayed on the Groups website, www.
These terms were updated in January 2011 to ensure continued compliance with the FSA Code.
The members of the Committee during 2010 were as follows: Dr Wolfgang Berndt chairman to 6 May 2010 Anthony Watson chairman from 6 May 2010 Sir Winfried Bischoff Sir Julian Horn-Smith Lord Leitch Glen Moreno from 1 March 2010 to 17 June 2010 David Roberts from 1 March 2010 Tim Ryan from 1 March 2010 During 2010, the Committee met 15 times and considered the following principal matters: Review of remuneration arrangements for senior executives.
Upon the appointment of the new Group Chief Executive we have deferred the implementation of this work until the completion of the strategy review and will consult shareholders during 2011 Determination of the appropriate remuneration packages for the new Group Chief Executive and a number of other senior new hires Determination of bonus pools based on Group performance and risk adjustments Performance conditions for the Long Term Incentive Plan Bonus and salary awards for Executive Directors and key senior managers Approval of remuneration and terms of service that fall within the Committees terms of reference, including new executive appointments Feedback from the Remuneration Committee Chairman on his meetings with the FSA and shareholders We thank all committee members for their commitment during the last year and attendance at meetings.
The Committee appoints independent consultants to provide advice on specific matters according to their particular expertise.
During the year, the Committee conducted a review of their independent advisors and appointed Deloitte LLP to advise the Committee.
Deloitte has voluntarily signed up to the Remuneration Consultants Code of Conduct and are judged by the Committee to be independent.
Kepler Associates were also retained by the Committee during 2010 to advise on various matters relating to executive remuneration.
During 2010, Alithos Limited continued to provide information on behalf of the Committee for the testing of TSR performance conditions for the Groups long-term incentive plans calculated by reference to both dividends and growth in share price.
Eric Daniels, Angie Risley Group HR Director, Liz Jackson HR Director, Reward from March 2010 and Harriet Kemp HR Director, Total Reward until March 2010 provided guidance to the Committee other than for their own remuneration.
Carol Sergeant Chief Risk Officer and Tim Tookey Group Finance Director also attended the Committee to advise as and when necessary on risk and financial matters.

Our policy is intended to ensure that our remuneration offer is both cost effective and enables us to attract and retain Executive Directors and senior management of the highest calibre, motivating them to perform to the highest standards.
Our objective is to align individual reward with the Groups performance, the interests of its shareholders, and a prudent approach to risk management.
In this way we balance the requirements of our various stakeholders: our customers, shareholders, employees, and regulators.
This approach is in line with the Association of British Insurers best practice code on remuneration and the FSA Remuneration Code of Practice, as the policy seeks to reward long-term value creation whilst not encouraging excessive risk taking.
We summarise below how each of these policy objectives is met by our remuneration offer.
Policy objective How achieved Building long-term We build relationships with our customers and people.
Working for Lloyds Banking Group is about more than pay.
relationships Our relationship with our people means that we want to pay them fairly and competitively, but our pay is positioned conservatively against the market and we do not seek to align with the highest payers in the sector.
In setting pay for Executive Directors and senior managers, we take account of relative pay positioning and target levels of variable remuneration opportunity for all levels of employees in the Group.
Our incentive measures are not just financial.
Our Balanced scorecards include objectives that cover effective risk management, lending to Corporates including SMEs and retail customers, performance against targets that measure how satisfied our customers are and the extent to which our employees feel engaged with and committed to working for the Lloyds Banking Group.
Managing the financial Economic profit is a key measure by which we manage our business.
This measure takes into account the level of capital consequences of our required to generate profits as well as the risks taken.
The same level of profit generated at lower risk results in higher business through the economic profit.
Economic profit also measures risk based on an assessment of how the business will perform through economic cycle the economic cycle.
For example, in good times, when default rates on loans are low, we adjust the economic profit measure downwards based on a higher average expected default experience over the economic cycle.
This encourages us to avoid business and funding strategies that are only profitable during boom times but turn bad in a recession.
Economic profit plays a prominent role in our incentive plans for executives, with its inclusion in both the annual and LTIP performance measures.
Aligning individual Our executives annual and long-term incentives are based on stretching performance objectives and targets in the rewards with Group Group Balanced Scorecard.
This balanced scorecard is derived from the Medium Term Plan which defines the financial performance and and non-financial targets within our agreed risk appetite over a three year period.
shareholders The annual bonus for Executive Directors is deferred into shares and released over a period of not less than two years, helping to increase alignment with shareholders.
These deferrals are subject to malus in the event of unsustainable performance.
Executives are also aligned with shareholders through the LTIP, which pays out in shares to improve alignment with shareholders based on performance against Group financial targets over a three year period.
We operate tough contract provisions relative to market practice, whereby no executive has an entitlement to more than 12 months notice not taking into account recruitment provisions, pay in lieu of notice is limited to basic salary, is paid monthly over 12 months and is mitigated if the executive gets another job.
This approach avoids the risk of payment for failure.
These requirements are among the toughest in the FTSE 100.
A prudent approach to Economic profit measures profit relative to the risk taken to generate that profit.
Its use in our incentive plans risk management encourages executives to take a prudent approach to risk.
We also have non-financial measures of performance against risk objectives in both the annual and long-term plans for executives.
For the 2010 annual incentive plan we increased the alignment to long-term prudent risk management by deferring 100 per cent of the award subject to malus over two years.
If the performance is unsustainable during the deferral period some or all of the award may be forfeited.
We have a robust governance framework with an independent Remuneration Committee reviewing all compensation decisions for senior executives.
This approach to governance and review is cascaded through the organisation.
We also ensure that all control function employees are assessed and their remuneration determined jointly by the relevant business Director and the control function Director.
Senior risk and compliance officers are also reviewed by the Remuneration Committee.
128 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2010 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Policy objective How achieved Cost effective packages We aim to ensure that the totality of remuneration for executive directors is competitive against our benchmark groups.
to attract and retain These groups are other major UK banks and the top 20 companies in the FTSE 100, reflecting practices in large UK executives companies across all sectors.
We aim to be competitively but conservatively positioned against the market, although for executive directors we have taken the decision to adopt a position that is behind market for 2011 in view of public concern.
We select incentive plan targets that are directly linked to the business strategy and priorities, ensuring alignment with company performance, targets that are meaningful to executives and incentive packages that are valued by executives and cost effective.
SUMMARY Following extensive consultation with shareholders, the Remuneration Committee is proposing a package for Executive Directors for 2011 that is closely based on the structure and principles of 2010 as follows: Element Level design for 2011 Key purpose Base salary Base pay should be set relative to FTSE 20 and banking sector competitors To provide the basis for a competitive package In light of circumstances, there will be increases to base salaries in line with the wider population of employees resulting in a lower quartile position Annual incentive 200 per cent of salary maximum 225 per cent for the Group Chief Executive Alignment with Group performance Based on Group financial targets relating to profit before tax and Motivation of executives economic profit as well as balanced scorecard measures covering Pay for performance divisional financial targets, customers e. g. SME lending, people, Alignment with sound risk management risk and building the business Subject to deferral and malus in line with FSA requirements Long-term Annual awards of up to 300 per cent of salary vesting based incentive plan on financial measures including Economic Profit and EPS and Motivation and retention of executives alignment with shareholders based on absolute TSR Alignment with sound risk management Alignment with long-term shareholder interests A higher award will be made to Antnio Horta-Osrio as detailed on page 129 Pension Defined contribution pension provision for new entrants Enable executives to build long-term From April 2012, any executive director in office at that time with retirement savings a legacy final salary pension will move to a defined contribution Retention pension arrangement Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information 129 Group profile 1 Summary of Group results 14 Board of Directors 110 Report of the independent Shareholder information 284 Lloyds Banking Group auditors on the consolidated Group structure 2 Divisional results 26 Directors report 112 Glossary 285 Annual Report financial statements 144 Group performance 3 Other financial information 52 Corporate governance report 114 Abbreviations 290 and Accounts 2010 Consolidated Strategy and progress 4 Five year financial summary 56 Directors remuneration Index to annual report 291 financial statements 146 report 124 Chairmans statement 6 Our people 57 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 153 Group Chief Executives review 8 Corporate responsibility 60 Report of the independent Addressing the key issues 10 Risk management 65 auditors on the parent company Marketplace trends 12 financial statements 272 Parent company financial statements 273 Notes to the parent company financial statements 276 GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE TRANSITION Eric Daniels On 20 September 2010, Eric Daniels announced his intention to retire from Lloyds Banking Group on 30 September 2011.
Mr Daniels will stand down from the Board on 28 February 2011.
He will continue to receive his basic salary, pension contribution and other benefits under the terms of his contract until retirement.
100 per cent of his bonus received in respect of 2010 will be deferred into shares in two equal tranches, vesting in March 2013 and March 2014 and subject in part to a holding period on vesting.
His outstanding long-term incentive awards will continue to vest at the end of the relevant three year performance period to the extent the performance conditions have been met and will be pro-rated for service.
Antnio Horta-Osrio Antnio Horta-Osrio was appointed to the Board on 17 January 2011 and succeeds Eric Daniels as Group Chief Executive on 1 March 2011.
In line with the Groups prudent remuneration policy and the current operating environment, his salary was set on recruitment at the same level as the outgoing Group Chief Executives at 1,035,000.
Recognising that this is behind the market, the committee decided to award an increase in line with the the other Executive Directors, effective from his start date.
He also has a reference salary of 1,220,000 that will be used to calculate certain elements of long-term remuneration, including his LTIP from 2012 and pension.
He will participate in the Groups annual incentive scheme for the calendar year 2011.
His annual bonus maximum opportunity for 2011 will be 225 per cent of basic salary.
This will be subject to deferral on terms at a minimum in line with the FSA Code and the deferred element will be subject to malus if the performance that generated the incentive is found to be unsustainable.
The Group agreed, as a condition of his accepting the appointment of Group Chief Executive on 1 March 2011, to grant him an LTIP award over the Groups shares with a market value equal to 420 per cent of his base salary as at 7 March.
His award will be made under Listing Rule 9.4 2 of the Listing Rules in order to facilitate his appointment as Group Chief Executive.
The Board considered that it was essential to the success of the recruitment process to make this LTIP award to him.
The award is on similar terms to awards granted under the LTIP including the performance conditions which will apply to LTIP awards granted in 2011 described on page 131.
He will be eligible for a pension allowance in respect of future service of 50 per cent of reference salary per annum including his flexible benefit allowance.
He has the option to take this as a cash allowance or contribution to a pension scheme vehicle.
He has been granted a number of one-off awards to compensate him for outstanding share and cash awards forfeited on his resignation from the Santander Group.
These include: Performance shares of 1,707,763 due to vest in 2013 subject to the Groups TSR performance against sector peer group, broadly equivalent to the performance conditions of Santander Group Restricted shares of 4,348,029 due to vest between 2011 2013 subject to remaining in employment Cash amounting to 516,000 vesting in three equal tranches in 2011 2013 The awards above vest in different proportions at different times to reflect the vesting periods of the Santander Group share awards which the awards replace.
On his resignation from Banco Santander, he suffered significant loss in relation to his previous pension accrual.
Lloyds Banking Group will compensate him in part for the loss of this income through the provision of an unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme UURBS up to a maximum of 26.5 per cent of base salary.
If he achieves the performance conditions described below at the maximum level, the pension accrued would still only represent 60 per cent of the pension forfeited by him.
This pension is payable from retirement at age 65.
In order to fully promote alignment with shareholders, this pension provision will accrue over the first six years of service and is entirely dependent on the achievement of share price targets as follows: At retirement, a percentage of reference salary or basic salary if higher for each of the first five calendar years of employment if in the last 90 days of that year the average share price of Lloyds Banking Group exceeds 75p Average Share Price.
The percentage applicable is 4 per cent in year 1, 3.5 per cent in year 2 and 3 per cent in years 3, 4 and 5.
Plus an additional 2 per cent for each year if the Average Share Price exceeds: Year 1: 90p Year 2: 102p Years 3-5 inclusive: 114p If at the end of the fifth year of employment the aggregate percentage pension accrued is less than 26.5 per cent, he may accrue up to a further 4.5 per cent in the sixth year to an overall maximum of 26.5 per cent of base salary if the Average Share Price for that year exceeds 75p and up to a further 2 per cent if the Average Share Price for that year exceeds 114p.
130 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2010 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT BASE SALARY Base salaries are reviewed annually, taking into account individual performance and market information which is provided by Towers Watson and supplemented with information from Deloitte LLP and normally adjusted from 1 January of the relevant year.
The remuneration committee confirmed during the 2010 review that the FTSE 20 was the most appropriate comparator group to use to benchmark overall competitiveness of the remuneration package whilst taking particular account of the remuneration practice of our direct competitors, namely the major UK banks.
Our review showed that salary levels are significantly below market.
However, we have continued to show restraint and made a moderate increase to base salaries in 2011, in line with the salary increase budget for other employees in the Group.

Incentive awards for Executive Directors are based upon individual contribution and overall corporate results.
Incentive opportunity is driven by corporate performance based on profit before tax and economic profit, together with divisional achievement and individual performance.
Individual targets relevant to improving overall business performance are contained in a balanced scorecard and are grouped under the following headings: Financial Building the Business Customer service Risk People development These targets are weighted differently for each of the Executive Directors, reflecting differing strategic priorities.
The non-financial measures include key performance indicators relating to risk management, SME lending, process efficiency, service quality and employee engagement.
The remuneration committee believes that the structure of the incentive in particular the use of risk-adjusted and non-financial measures has been highly successful in promoting a long-term focus within the senior management team.
The maximum annual incentive opportunity is 200 per cent 225 per cent for the Group Chief Executive of basic salary for the achievement of exceptional performance targets.
Consistent with the aim of ensuring that short-term financial results are only rewarded if they promote sustainable growth, the 2010 annual incentive is subject to deferral in shares until at least March 2013.
This deferred amount is subject to malus if the performance that generated the incentive is found to be unsustainable.
The committee reserves the right to exercise its discretion in reducing any payment that otherwise would have been earned, if they deem this appropriate.
The key achievements of the Group are set out in the Group Chief Executives review on pages 8 and 9 of this Annual Report.
The calculation of the annual incentive plan outcomes for Executive Directors, based on the achievement of performance against targets in respect of performance in 2010, has been vigorously discussed by the Remuneration Committee.
The bonuses awarded to directors are shown in the table below: Name J E Daniels A G Kane G T Tate T J W Tookey H A Weir Maximum Opportunity 225% 200% 200% 200% 200% % awarded for 2010 140% 130% 164% 157% 140% Bonus awarded for 2010 1,450,000 767,000 1,050,000 942,000 875,000 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information 130 131 Group profile 1 summary of Group results 14 Board of Directors 110 Report of the independent shareholder information 284 Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group auditors on the consolidated Annual Report Group structure 2 Divisional results 26 Directors report 112 Glossary 285 Annual Report financial statements 144 Group performance 3 other financial information 52 corporate governance report 114 Abbreviations 290 and Accounts 2010 and Accounts 2010 consolidated strategy and progress 4 Five year financial summary 56 Directors remuneration index to annual report 291 financial statements 146 report 124 chairmans statement 6 our people 57 notes to the consolidated financial statements 153 Group chief executives review 8 corporate responsibility 60 Report of the independent Addressing the key issues 10 Risk management 65 auditors on the parent company marketplace trends 12 financial statements 272 parent company financial statements 273 notes to the parent company financial statements 276 DiRectoRs RemuneRAtion RepoRt LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARD the current Ltip rules allow for awards to be made of up to 400 per cent of base salary.
under normal circumstances, awards can be made of up to 300 per cent of salary with the additional 100 per cent available for circumstances that the Remuneration committee deems to be exceptional.
in 2010, awards were made of up to 275 per cent of base salary to the executive directors.
in 2011, the committee intends to make awards of 300 per cent of salary.
As noted, for Antnio Horta-osrio his award for 2011 will be 420 per cent of his base salary.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES During the 2010 review, the committee was particularly mindful of driving sustainable performance through the cycle without encouraging excessive risk taking.
the committee has consulted widely with shareholders on the topic of performance measures and sharing the growth in the company appropriately between shareholders and management.
the committee believes that the performance measures for the 2011 Ltip award for the executive committee should be economic profit ep, earnings per share eps and absolute total shareholder Return.
these measures capture risk measurement, profit growth and shareholder experience and align shareholder experience and management reward.
At this time the committee is not in a position to determine the metrics that will attach to these performance measures as the new Group chief executive is completing a strategic review of the business.
We believe it is critical to ensure that the 2011 Ltip is aligned with the new strategic direction of the company and the goals we will set for ourselves over the medium term.
therefore the committee intends to determine the appropriately stretching and challenging metrics following the completion of the strategic review and to consult with shareholders on the metrics during the summer prior to communicating them to participants.
the committee recognise this is an unusual approach but given the circumstances believe it is the best way to align management reward and the strategy over the next three years.
the metrics set by the committee following the strategic review and consultation with major shareholders will be put to the annual general meeting in 2012 for approval.
Details of current Ltip awards are provided on page 139.
PENSION executive directors are entitled to participate in the Groups defined contribution scheme under which their pension entitlement will be based upon both employer and employee contributions.
company contributions are 25 per cent of salary, with the exception of Antnio Horta-osrio who is eligible for 50 per cent of reference salary, including his flexible benefit allowance.
these can be taken as cash or pension contributions.
At the date of this report, two executive directors remain in a defined benefit scheme.
pension accruals under the defined benefits scheme for eric Daniels and Archie Kane will continue until the date of retirement or April 2012 whichever is earlier.
thereafter Archie Kane will have the opportunity to either participate in a defined contribution scheme or to receive a cash supplement with no compensation for ceasing final salary accrual.
there is no entitlement to an immediate and unreduced pension should their employment be terminated before the normal date of retirement.
the defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants.
Details of pension contributions and accruals are shown on page 135.
OTHER SHARE PLANS the executive directors are also eligible to participate in the Groups sharesave and share incentive plans.
these are all-employee share plans.

All current Executive Directors are entitled to receive 12 months notice from the Group, but would be required to give six months notice if they wished to leave.
It is the Groups policy that where compensation on early termination is due, it should be paid on a phased basis, mitigated in the event that alternative employment is secured, and that bonus payments should relate to the period of actual service, rather than the full notice period, and will be determined on the basis of performance.
Any entitlements under the pension scheme or equity plans will be in accordance with the scheme rules on leaving.

Those directors who joined Lloyds TSB Group after 1 June 1989 and are members of a defined benefit scheme have pensions provided on salary in excess of the earnings cap through membership of or by an unfunded pension promise.
Retirement pensions accrue at rates of between 1 60 and 1 30 of basic salary.
For those Directors who are members of a defined benefit pension scheme, pension will continue to accrue until 5 April 2012, or the date of leaving if earlier.
On 6 April 2012, defined benefit pension accrual will cease and Directors will be offered the option to participate in the defined contribution pension scheme in operation at that date.
Alternatively, they may choose not to join the scheme and elect to receive a pension cash allowance.
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION SCHEME MEMBERS During the year to 31 December 2010 the Group has made the following contributions to the defined contribution scheme: 000 G T Tate 160 T J W Tookey 150 H A Weir 125 DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEME MEMBERS Additional Accrued Accrued Transfer Transfer pension pension at pension at Change in value at value at Change in earned to Transfer 31 December 31 December accrued 31 December 31 December transfer 31 December value of the 2010 2009 pension 2010 2009 value 2010 increase 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 a b a - b c d c - d e f J E Daniels 210 193 17 5,030 3,844 1,186 17 413 A G Kane 372 357 15 8,657 6,889 1,768 15 342 The disclosures in columns a to d are as required under section 421 of the Companies Act 2006.
Columns a and b represent the deferred pension to which the directors would have been entitled had they left the Group on 31 December 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Column c is the transfer value of the deferred pension in column a calculated as at 31 December 2010 based on factors supplied by the actuary of the relevant Lloyds TSB Group pension scheme.
Column d is the equivalent transfer value, but calculated as at 31 December 2009 on the assumption that the director left service at that date.
Column e is the increase in pension built up during the year, recognising i the accrual rate for the additional service based on the pensionable salary in force at the year end, and ii where appropriate the effect of pay changes in real inflation adjusted terms on the pension already earned at the start of the year.
Column f is the capital value of the pension in column e. The disclosures in columns e and f are as required by the UK Listing Authority listing rules.
The requirements of the listing rules differ from those of the Companies Act.
The listing rules require the additional pension earned over the year to be calculated as the difference between the pension accrued at the end of the financial year and the pension accrued at the start of the financial year less the increase in the pension earned over the year solely due to inflation.
The transfer value in column f can differ significantly from the change in transfer value as required by the Companies Act because the additional pension accrued over the year calculated in accordance with the listing rules makes allowance for inflation, and the change in the transfer value required by the Companies Act will be significantly influenced by changes in the assumptions underlying the transfer value calculation at the beginning and end of the financial year.
Members of the Lloyds TSB Groups pension schemes have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions: neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.
Major changes to the legislation governing the provision of pensions in the UK known as pension simplification came into effect in April 2006.
Benefits from an approved pension scheme will be limited to the Lifetime Allowance, currently 1.8 million which is equivalent to an annual pension of 90,000.
Any benefit in excess of this amount will incur a tax charge for the individual.
The Government has announced that the life time allowance will decrease to 1.5 million from April 2012.
The Group has agreed that if an Executive Director has benefits in excess of the Lifetime Allowance they may cease to accrue benefits in the Scheme and receive a salary supplement as an alternative.
This will not cost the Group more than the current arrangements.
The Group will not compensate any individual in respect of any increased tax liability arising from pension simplification.
To date, the Executive Directors affected have elected to continue to accrue benefits in the approved scheme.

140 Lloyds Banking Group Annual Report and Accounts 2010 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT AUDITED INFORMATION The following table contains information on the performance conditions for awards made under the long-term incentive plan.
LTIP award Performance conditions March 2007 For 50 per cent of the award the EPS Award the percentage increase in earnings per share of the Group on a compound annualised basis over the relevant period needed to be at least an average of 6 percentage points per annum greater than the percentage increase if any in the retail price index over the same period.
If it was less than 3 per cent per annum, the EPS Award would lapse.
If the increase was more than 3 per cent but less than 6 per cent per annum, then the proportion of shares released would be on a straight line basis between 17.5 per cent and 100 per cent.
The relevant period commenced on 1 January 2007 and ended on 31 December 2009.
For the other 50 per cent of the award the TSR Award the Groups TSR needed to exceed the median of a comparator group 14 companies over the relevant period by an average of 7.5 per cent per annum for the TSR Award to vest in full.
17.5 per cent of the TSR Award would vest where the Groups TSR was equal to median and vesting would occur on a straight line basis in between these points.
Where the Groups TSR was below the median of the comparator group, the TSR Award would lapse.
The relevant period commenced on 8 March 2007 the date of award and ended on 7 March 2010.
At the end of the relevant period, neither of the performance conditions had been met and the Awards lapsed.
Tim Tookey was not an Executive Director when his award was made in 2007, and as such his award vested at 31 per cent on the same basis as other award recipients below the Group Executive Committee level.
March and April 2008 For 50 per cent of the award the EPS Award the performance condition was as described for March 2007 with the relevant performance period commencing on 1 January 2008 and ending on 31 December 2010.
For the other 50 per cent of the award the TSR Award the performance condition was as described for March 2007 with the relevant performance period commencing on 6 March 2008 the date of the March award and ending on 5 March 2011.
April 2009 EPS: The release of 50 per cent of the shares will be dependent on the extent to which growth in EPS achieves cumulative EPS targets over the three year period from January 2009 to December 2011.
Economic profit: The release of the remaining 50 per cent of shares will be dependent on the extent to which the Group achieves cumulative Economic Profit targets over the three year period from January 2009 to December 2011.
As indicated in last years report, and as a consequence of the Groups non participation in GAPS, in June 2010 the Remuneration Committee determined that it was appropriate for the performance measures relative to those conditions to be restated: EPS Vesting % Growth in EPS Threshold 25% 26% Maximum 100% 36% Economic profit Vesting % Absolute improvement in adjusted EP Threshold 25% 100% Maximum 100% 202% Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information 141 Group profile 1 Summary of Group results 14 Board of Directors 110 Report of the independent Shareholder information 284 Lloyds Banking Group auditors on the consolidated Group structure 2 Divisional results 26 Directors report 112 Glossary 285 Annual Report financial statements 144 Group performance 3 Other financial information 52 Corporate governance report 114 Abbreviations 290 and Accounts 2010 Consolidated Strategy and progress 4 Five year financial summary 56 Directors remuneration Index to annual report 291 financial statements 146 report 124 Chairmans statement 6 Our people 57 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 153 Group Chief Executives review 8 Corporate responsibility 60 Report of the independent Addressing the key issues 10 Risk management 65 auditors on the parent company Marketplace trends 12 financial statements 272 Parent company financial statements 273 Notes to the parent company financial statements 276 AUDITED INFORMATION April 2009 Synergy Savings: The release of 50 per cent of the shares will be dependent on the achievement of target Integration Award run-rate synergy savings in 2009 and 2010 as well as the achievement of sustainable synergy savings of at least 1.5 billion by the end of 2011.
The award will be broken down into three equally weighted annual tranches.
Performance will be assessed at the end of each year against annual performance targets based on a trajectory to meet the 2011 target.
The extent to which targets have been achieved will determine the proportion of shares to be banked each year.
Any release of shares will be subject to the Remuneration Committee judging the overall success of the delivery of the integration programme.
Integration Balanced Scorecard: The release of the remaining 50 per cent of the shares will be dependent on the outcome of a Balanced Scorecard of non-financial measures of the success of the integration in each of 2009, 2010 and 2011.
The Balanced Scorecard element will be broken down into three equally weighted tranches.
The tranches will be crystallised and banked for each year of the performance cycle subject to separate annual performance targets across the four measurement categories of Building the Business, Customer, Risk and People and Organisation Development.
Performance for each of the first two years of the award has been assessed and all targets have been met or exceeded.
March 2010 EPS: Relevant to 36 per cent of the award.
Performance will be measured based on absolute improvement in adjusted EPS over the three financial years starting on 1 January 2010 relative to an adjusted fully diluted 2009 EPS base.
Economic Profit: Relevant to 36 per cent of the award.
Performance will be measured based on the compound annual growth rate of adjusted Economic Profit over the three financial years starting on 1 January 2010 relative to 2009 adjusted Economic Profit base.
Absolute Share Price: Relevant to 28 per cent of the award.
Performance will be measured based on the Absolute Share Price on 26 March 2013, being the third anniversary of the award date.
The targets are: EPS Vesting % Absolute improvement in adjusted EPS Threshold 25% 158% Maximum 100% 180% Vesting between threshold and maximum will be on a straight line basis.
Economic profit Vesting % Compound annual growth rate of adjusted EP Threshold 25% 57% p. a.
Maximum 100% 77% p. a. Vesting between threshold and maximum will be on a straight line basis.
Absolute Share Price Vesting % Absolute Share Price Threshold 0% 75p Maximum 100% 114p Vesting between threshold and maximum will be on a straight line basis, provided that shares comprised in the Absolute Share Price element of the award may only be released if both the EPS and Economic Profit performance measures have been satisfied at the threshold level or above.
