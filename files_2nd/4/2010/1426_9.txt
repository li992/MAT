For executive directors, all these At the start of the financial year, budgeted operating profit is set as the on allocations were to a maximum face value of 125% of base salary, and relate target performance level, and the Remuneration committee determines the to performance periods of three financial years.

Directors pensions The Remuneration committee aims to ensure that retirement benefits are in line with best practice standards adopted by major companies in continental Europe and the United Kingdom.
In accordance with this policy, executive directors are covered by final salary, defined benefit arrangements and can retire at their normal retirement age with retirement benefits broadly equivalent to two thirds of final pensionable salary.
The Company pension schemes are HM Revenue & Customs HMRC approved but the executive directors also have entitlements under employer-financed arrangements which are unregistered.
Over the past year the Remuneration committee has been following governmental proposals for pension reform in 2011 and the potential impact that any proposals will have on high earners, including executive directors.
The committee will review the options and conclude the best way forward for all those affected when governmental proposals have been finalised.

Directors share options There are two schemes under which both HMRC approved and unapproved options have been granted in the past: The Associated British Foods plc 1994 Share Option Scheme the 1994 Scheme required options granted to be held for five years before they became exercisable, at which point they were not subject to any performance criteria: and The Associated British Foods 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme the 2000 Scheme, under which options granted became exercisable by participants after an initial three-year performance period, to the extent that performance criteria had been satisfied.
Performance criteria were based on robust levels of business performance over the period.
Some years ago it was agreed that share option awards would no longer form part of the normal remuneration package for executives although the Remuneration committee reserved the right to grant options under special circumstances.
