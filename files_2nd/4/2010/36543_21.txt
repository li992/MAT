Vesting under the TSR performance condition is also subject to the Remuneration Committees satisfaction that the Companys underlying performance has been satisfactory in comparison with that of the FTSE Real Estate Sector.
Having considered the existing structure of the plan, the Committee has made a number of changes that will apply to grants in 2011: Performance measures: In addition to the two existing relative performance measures, a portion of awards will be subject to absolute Net Asset Value NAV growth targets.
Therefore, one-third of 2011 awards will be subject to each of relative TSR, relative TPR and absolute NAV performance.
The Committee believes that this will provide an appropriate balance of relative and absolute performance measures rather than the current exclusive focus on relative measures.
The TSR and TPR targets remain as previously set.
NAV growth of 7.5% p. a. will result in vesting under the NAV performance condition of 25%, with 100% vesting for NAV growth of 15% p. a. Vesting for intermediate performance will be pro-rata on a linear basis.
There will be no vesting for NAV growth of less than 7.5%.
Performance period: The Committee believes that for a long-term capital intensive and cyclical business, a longer performance period would be better aligned to the delivery of the business plan.
The performance period for future awards will therefore be increased from three to four years.
An immediate change to this policy would result in there being no vesting of an award in 2014.
To avoid this, an enhanced award of 300% of salary will be granted in 2011 only, with half of this award subject to a three-year performance period which would vest in 2014 and half subject to a four-year performance period vesting in 2015.
This will ensure there is no vesting gap in 2014 and overall will result in only a modest reduction in potential awards vesting to executives in the three-year period from 2014 to 2016.
Clawback: A clawback facility will be introduced whereby the Committee can recover vested awards in the event that they are subsequently found to have been paid as a result of misstated figures.

During the year ended 31 December 2010 no payments were made to Directors for expenses other than those incurred wholly and directly in the course of their employment or appointment.
As explained on page 47, the performance related bonus in respect of 2010 is payable in three parts.
One part is payable in cash Part A and a further element of the bonus is payable in shares Parts B and C. The payment in shares is made in two parts, one of which Part B is made at the time the cash bonus is paid and the other of which Part C is deferred for two years and is subject to the participant remaining with the Company.
Payments under Part A and Part B are included in the remuneration table above and deferred entitlements under Part C are shown in the table below.
However, in respect of the bonus for 2008 only, in view of market conditions, the Executive Directors agreed to defer the vesting of Part B shares such that they would be treated in the same way as Part C shares.
Accordingly, for 2008 only, the entitlement to Part C shares given in the table below additionally includes the potential entitlement to Part B shares.

In respect of the bonus for 2010, the Part B entitlement will be paid in cash on the date the bonus payment is made and the PartC entitlement will be paid in cash at retirement.
PENSIONS The Executive Directors all participate in the Companys defined benefit pension scheme, more fully described in note 6 to the accounts on pages 69 and 71 which provides pension and other benefits.
Pension entitlements are based on basic salary.
In previous years, members who joined the Scheme on or after 1 June 1989 were subject to restrictions imposed by the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
Following the introduction of the Finance Act 2004, these restrictions no longer apply for service accrued on or after 6 April 2006.
Since 6 April 2006 an individuals benefits under the Companys pension scheme would be subject to additional tax should those benefits exceed certain defined limits.
The Remuneration Committee has agreed that, in these circumstances, a Director may elect to receive a Pension Compensation Payment rather than further contributions being made to the Scheme.
Such compensation payments will be subject to income tax and national insurance contributions and will not qualify for annual bonus purposes or entitlements under long-term incentive plans.
David Atkins and Peter Cole are members of the Hammerson Group Management Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
David Atkins pension is currently being provided with a 1 60th accrual rate.
This is the rate of accrual received by all members of the Scheme who joined after overview business and finanCial review governanCe finanCial statements property portfolio Hammerson plc ANNUAL REPORT 2010 51 1 July 1994.
Peter Coles pension is accruing at a rate which will provide a pension of two-thirds of salary at retirement.
This is equivalent to an accrual rate of 1 45th offered to provide competitive benefits at retirement.
The Scheme has a normal retirement age of 60 and any pensions payable on early retirement would be reduced in accordance with the rules of the Scheme.
The following tables set out information on Directors defined benefit pension entitlements: Increase in Total accrued accrued benefit Years benefit at Increase in during the Age at service at Normal 31 December accrued benefit year excluding 31 December 31 December retirement Accrual 2010 during the year inflation 2010 2010 age rate 000 000 000 th David Atkins 44 12 60 1 60 56 20 13 th Peter Cole 51 21 60 1 45 194 20 19 For each Director, the total accrued benefit at 31 December 2010 represents the annual pension that is expected to be payable on eventual retirement, given the length of service and salary of each Director at 31 December 2010.
The increase in accrued benefit earned during the year represents the increase in this expected pension, including the effect of inflation, when compared with the position at 31 December 2009.
The increase in accrued pension excluding the effect of inflation over the year is also shown.

The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the Scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the Schemes liability in respect of the Directors pension benefits.
They do not represent sums payable to individual Directors and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
For each Director, the increase in transfer value of accrued benefits under the requirements of Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 is the transfer value of the total accrued benefit at 31 December 2010 less the corresponding transfer value at 31 December 2009.
The transfer value fo the increase in accrued benefits under the Listing Rules is the transfer value at 31 December 2010 of the increase in accured benefits during the period excluding inflation.
The transfer values disclosed above do not represent the sum paid or payable to the individual director.
Instead, they represent a potential liability fo the pension scheme.
