Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 48485 TEXT pp049 074. indd 56 15 03 2011 16:54 57 Responsibilities of the Committee The Committees role is to review and approve the remuneration strategy and policies of the Group, including the annual compensation review.
The Committees terms of reference include responsibility for setting the over-arching principles and remuneration policy on a Group-wide basis: this approach has been followed by Schroders for a number of years.
The Committee also determines the remuneration of the executive Directors, and monitors the level and structure of remuneration for senior management.
The responsibilities of the Committee are to: Review and approve, on an annual basis, the remuneration strategy of the Group, as recommended by the Chief Executive: Review and approve the remuneration approach for use in the Groups annual compensation review: Fix the remuneration of each of the executive Directors: Review and recommend to the Board the design and operation of long-term incentive plans and share option schemes, including any performance-related pay for executives: Monitor the level and structure of remuneration for senior management: Review and recommend to the Board the remuneration of the Chairman, the Board Secretary and the Group Head of Risk: Review and approve any employee remuneration packages exceeding parameters set by the Board: Approve contractual termination arrangements for executive Directors on an individual basis: Approve the appointment of external compensation advisers to the Committee: Provide an annual remuneration report of the Groups remuneration policy to the Board: Conduct an annual review of the Committees performance, periodically reviewing the adequacy of its terms of reference and recommending to the Board any changes: and Undertake appropriate discussions as necessary with institutional investors and the FSA on policy or other aspects of remuneration.
A member of the Audit and Risk Committee serves on the Remuneration Committee in order that any risks associated with setting remuneration and any circumstances that could materially increase the exposures to risk faced by the Group can be reported back to the Audit and Risk Committee.
The Committees terms of reference are aligned to the Combined Code, have regard to regulatory guidance from the Financial Services Authority FSA, major investor representative groups and best practice in the market and confirm that the Committee has oversight of remuneration policy and outcomes with respect to the senior management of the Group.
The full terms of reference of the Committee are available at www.
com or from the Company Secretary.
The annual evaluation of the Committees effectiveness, required under the Combined Code, was undertaken as part of the overall Board evaluation process in February 2011.
The specific findings relating to the Remuneration Committee were reviewed by the Committee Chairman.
| Schroders Annual Report and Accounts 2010 48485 TEXT pp049 074. indd 57 15 03 2011 17:03 58 Remuneration report continued Report on the Committees activities in 2010 During 2010 we developed our remuneration practices continuing the three objectives identified in our 2009 review: to align better remuneration policy with Group strategy: to take into account emerging regulatory guidance: and to meet institutional guidelines.
Schroders success is based on competitive and sustainable investment performance across a broad product range that meets the investment needs of clients.
The Groups overall performance is reflected in our annual bonus awards.
Success in these areas contributes to growth in earnings per share and net new business.
In 2010 we introduced a share based Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, following shareholder approval, in order to incentivise senior management in relation to further growth in earnings per share and net new business based on challenging targets over measurement periods of four years.
LTIP recipients will also generally participate in our Equity Compensation Plan ECP.
ECP awards are made to a wider range of employees.
Together ECP Share awards and ECP Fund awards have formed an integral part of our incentive compensation arrangements for several years.
They provide employees with potential remuneration upside but also downside risk through deferred bonuses that are linked to the performance of the share price or a range of Schroders investment funds.
This alignment between the interests of employees and shareholders is an important part of our remuneration strategy and is consistent with emerging regulatory guidance, including that of the FSA.
As our current plans expire in March 2011 we are proposing to introduce replacement plans the 2011 ECP and 2011 Share Option Plan SOP, for which shareholder approval is required.
Further information on the 2011 ECP and 2011 SOP proposals is included inthecircular that contains the notice of Annual General Meeting.
During the year the Committee also reviewed the Groups remuneration policies and the changes already implemented in anticipation of EU regulatory developments and the FSAs Remuneration Code.
The Committee determined the bonus pool based on a bonus to pre-bonus profit before tax ratio and also referenced total compensation costs as a percentage of operating revenue.
Additionally, the Committee received a variety of reports on risk, legal and compliance matters and reviewed remuneration and remuneration policies in this context.
The Committee reviewed the bonus deferral levels for senior management and concluded they remain appropriate in the context of the Groups strategy and regulatory developments.
The Committee also considered the following: 2009 and 2010 annual compensation reviews: Compensation review process: LTIP performance measures and targets: Objectives for the Chief Executive: Feedback from institutional investors: Arrangements providing pensions to UK employees and the tax treatment of these arrangements: Tax treatment of deferred awards: and Bank payroll tax.
Following a full review, including a period of consultation with the members, in order to reduce the Companys future liability risk, the Board has confirmed the closure of the defined benefit section of the UK pension scheme for future accrual on 30 April 2011.
All affected employees will be offered membership of the defined contribution section of the scheme from 1May2011.
Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 48485 TEXT pp049 074. indd 58 15 03 2011 12:43 59 Performance graph The following performance graph shows the Companys total shareholder return, comprising shareprice movements plus the value of dividends reinvested, compared to the FTSE 100 Index of which Schroders is a constituent.
This index was chosen by the Committee because it is the principal index in which the Companys shares were quoted during the period.
The graph shows the change in the value of an initial 100 amount invested in Schroders plc on 31 December 2005 over the five years to 31 December 2010, compared with the same initial amount invested in the FTSE 100 Index with dividends reinvested in both.

These are delivered in the form of an annual bonus paid out of a pool agreed each year by the Board.
For executive Directors and senior employees a significant proportion of their annual bonus is deferred into Schroders shares and funds, vesting over three years and they are eligible to participate in the LTIP which vests subject to performance conditions over four years.
For less senior employees, Group policy is to offer competitive salaries by reference to a benchmarked median and variable rewards based on performance.
Employees salaries are generally reviewed annually and are adjusted more frequently than those of executive Directors and senior management.
Our 2010 results were very strong in terms of investment performance, net new business and profitability with a corresponding impact on the 2010 bonus pool, which was calculated as a percentage of pre-bonus profit before tax.
The bonus charge amounted to 40 per cent.

The total compensation costs to operating revenue ratio was 45 per cent.
in 2010, down as expected from 49 per cent.
in 2009 and in line with our long-term target of 45 per cent.
Directors bonuses are not subject to individual caps but the overall bonus pool is capped each year by the Board.
Bonus payments to executive Directors were linked to objectives set in advance which covered individual and team responsibilities.
These were, to a large extent, achieved and in many cases exceeded.
The objectives covered both personal performance and the principal drivers of the business, notably superior investment performance, a net increase in assets under management and a positive profit before tax performance against budget.
of funds outperformed their benchmark or peer group over the three years and 67 per cent.
outperformed benchmark or peer group over the 12 months to 31 December 2010.
Net new business was at record levels as explained in the business review and compared favourably with what we know of competitor performance.
Profit before tax and exceptional items was materially ahead of both budget and the 2009 results.
Bonuses for all employees take account of overall Group, team and individual performance but, reflecting their greater ability to influence the overall Group performance, the bonuses of executive Directors and senior management will generally be most impacted by the overall Group performance.
Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 48485 TEXT pp049 074. indd 59 15 03 2011 12:43 Value of 100 invested on 31 December 2005 60 Remuneration report continued Objectives agreed by the Board for the Chief Executive included meeting targets for investment performance, net inflows and profitability, as well as retention and development of talent and succession planning.
Management of the Groups risks and the performance of our investment portfolio was also considered in assessing performance of the executive Directors.
Personal performance evaluation of the Chief Executive was conducted by the Chairman, after consultation with the non-executive Directors, and the Chairman reported his conclusions to the Committee.
Evaluation of the other executive Directors was conducted by the Chief Executive, who reported to the Committee.
The Committee received a variety of reports on the risks facing the business including a report from the Group Head of Risk to confirm that there were no known material outstanding threats to the business.
The Committee received a year end report from the Chief Executive on the underlying business and received updates on salaries and bonuses relative to competitors.
After consideration of these reports, the Committee decided on bonus arrangements as follows: Bonuses for executive Directors were subject to 50 per cent.

See details of the 2000 Equity Compensation Plan set out below: and Bonuses for executive Directors were reduced by 25 per cent.
of the award value of their 2010 LTIP awards, with the reduction applied to the deferred portion of their 2010 bonuses.
This is consistent with the approach we set out in the circular containing the notice of the 2010 Annual General Meeting.
The figures for deferred bonuses in this report are after the application of this reduction.
The Committee approved the Board Secretarys and the Group Head of Risks bonuses.
Bonuses for other staff were recommended by members of the Group Management Committee and subject to review by the Chief Executive taking into account individual performance against objectives, the performance of the area or function of the business in which the individual worked and the levels of reward for comparable roles in the external market.
The Committee had oversight of the amounts paid to senior employees, as well as the mechanisms used to determine their levels and the amount of deferral and had several opportunities to discuss these matters with the Chief Executive.
Our policy is to avoid guaranteed bonuses.
None of the executive Directors has such a guarantee.
However, there are times when guaranteed bonuses for the first performance year form part of the initial package necessary to recruit senior employees.
It remains the Committees practice and intention to grant share options sparingly, principally to assist in recruitment where necessary.
No options have been granted under the 2000 SOP since 2006.
The balance between the fixed and variable elements of the total compensation package based on the 2010 amounts for each of the executive Directors was as follows: Variable deferred LTIP 7% 10% 11% 11% Variable annual bonus deferred ECP 18% Variable annual bonus cash Fixed Fixed includes base salary, other cash payments, benets-in-kind each as disclosed in the Directors Emoluments 31% 42% 40% 39% 42% table and pension entitlements.

The salary of the Chief Executive is 400,000 per annum and the salaries of the other executive Directors are set at 300,000.
Base salary is the only element of remuneration that is pensionable.
The level of contribution into the UK pension scheme is subject to a notional earnings cap seeNotes to the accounts Retirement benefit obligations.
Benefits Executive Directors can participate on the same basis as other UK employees in the Groups flexible benefits plan covering, for example, private health care.
Pension The Groups policy is to provide competitive retirement benefits in line with local market practice and in a manner that meets statutory requirements and does not create an unacceptable level of risk for the Group.
Executive Directors can participate in the UK pension scheme on the same basis as other UK employees.
Two executive Directors received a taxable cash allowance in lieu of pension benefits.
Annual bonus variable Employees may, at the Groups discretion, receive a bonus award in respect of any year.
The determination of an employees bonus award, if any, will take account of a number of factors including the performances of the Group, the relevant division and team and the performance of the individual.
The manner of delivery of any bonus is also at the Groups discretion, but may involve all or part of the award being immediately payable in cash.
Depending on the employees location and the level of the award, a proportion of the award may be deferred.
The Equity Compensation Plan is the Companys main deferral plan and is described below.
2000 Equity Key employees at many levels in the Group receive part of their discretionary bonus Compensation Plan in the form of deferred awards under the 2000 Equity Compensation Plan 2000 variable ECP on terms designed to align their interests with those of shareholders and clients and to retain their services.
These awards do not give rise to any immediate entitlement but may be exercised in full from the third anniversary of the grant date provided that the participant continues to be employed by the Group.
The following forfeiture provisions apply if a participant resigns before the three years have elapsed: Completed years of service from date of award Less than 1 1 and 2 2 and 3 Percentage of award forfeited 100% 66.7% 33.3% In general the first 50,000 of any deferred award is provided in 2000 ECP Share awards.
Any balance, subject to a minimum fund award of 10,000, is delivered equally in 2000 ECP Share awards and 2000 ECP Fund awards.
The level of 2000 ECP Fund awards may vary in certain locations where local practice or legal restrictions limit or preclude the use of 2000 ECP Fund awards.
Further information on 2000 ECP Share awards and 2000 ECP Fund awards is provided below.
2000 ECP awards are not subject to further performance conditions as they are deferred awards from bonuses relating to past performance.

At the third anniversary of the date of grant the award is increased by 20 per cent.
Ifthe employee chooses to leave the award within the 2000 ECP until the fifth anniversary, the award is increased by a further 11.1 per cent.
No dividends are paid in respect of 2000 ECP Share awards prior to the fifth anniversary, but awards left in the 2000 ECP thereafter are adjusted up to the date on which they are exercised to accrue for dividends paid after the fifth anniversary and since 2008.
2000 ECP Share awards not previously exercised are deemed to have been exercised on the day before the tenth anniversary of their date of grant.
During 2009 the rules of the 2000 ECP were amended to allow participants to elect to accelerate the exercise of any 2000 ECP Share awards which had not reached the fifth anniversary of the date of grant and to receive on exercise ordinary or nonvoting ordinary shares subject to restrictions restricted shares.
Restricted shares have the same restrictions as the original 2000 ECPShare awards, including the forfeiture provisions, and therefore shareholder approval was not required.
In February 2010 the rules were further amended to allow new awards to be granted over restricted shares.
2000 ECP Fund awards 2000 ECP Fund awards are notional investments in a range of Schroders investment funds and can be granted by the Committee as an alternative to 2000 ECP Share awards.
Participants determine the allocation of their notional investments.
2000 ECP Fund awards are re-valued in line with the performance of the relevant fund and are paid out in cash upon exercise.
2000 ECP Fund awards not previously exercised are deemed to have been exercised on the fifth anniversary of their date of grant.
The rules of the 2000 ECP were also amended in February 2010 to allow participants to elect to accelerate the exercise of any 2000 ECP Fund awards which had not reached the third anniversary of the date of grant and on exercise to receive units in funds which are subject to restrictions restricted fund units.
Restricted fund units have the same restrictions as the original 2000 ECP Fund awards, including the forfeiture provisions.
2008 Equity Incentive Executive Directors do not participate in the Equity Incentive Plan EIP.
EIP awards Plan variable may be granted over either ordinary used wherever possible or non-voting ordinary shares in the Company and are normally structured as rights to acquire shares at nilcost and are not subject to performance conditions.
EIP awards are adjusted up to the date on which they are exercised to accrue dividends paid after the grant date.
These awards do not give rise to any immediate entitlement but may be exercised in full from the fifth anniversary of the grant date provided that the participant continues to be employed by the Group.
EIP awards not previously exercised are deemed to have been exercised on the day before the tenth anniversary of their date of grant.
If a participant resigns before the five years have elapsed, forfeiture provisions will apply.
The purpose of the EIP is to increase the shareholdings of key employees below senior management, for whom the LTIP will generally apply, and to provide retention incentives.
EIP awards in respect of 307,742 shares were made in 2010.
The following forfeiture provisions apply if a participant resigns before the five years have elapsed: Completed years of service from date of award Less than 3 3 and 4 4 and 5 Percentage of award forfeited 100% 66.7% 33.3% Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 48485 TEXT pp049 074. indd 62 15 03 2011 12:43 63 2000 Share Option Plan Under the 2000 Share Option Plan 2000 SOP, the Company may grant market variable value options over non-voting ordinary shares.
Options usually become exercisable if the option holder remains with the Group for at least three years.
For executive Directors, in line with market practice, options usually become exercisable if the performance target has been met at the third anniversary.
There is no retesting if the performance target is not met after three years.
Share options granted to other employees have no performance conditions.

of UK employees including Michael Dobson, Alan Brown, Kevin Parry and Massimo Tosato participated in the Plan as at 31 December 2010.
2010 Long-Term Incentive Executive Directors and senior management receive part of their remuneration in Plan variable the form of deferred awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP to help link their rewards to the Groups longer term performance.
The LTIP is designed as a forward looking plan to incentivise participants to drive the future performance of the Group and provides executive Directors and other participants with upside potential but also with downside risk based on challenging performance criteria measured over four years.
These awards do not give rise to any immediate entitlement and may be exercised in the 12 months following the fourth anniversary of the grant date provided that the participant continues to be employed by the Group.
The extent to which an award may be exercised will depend upon the Companys growth in earnings per share and net new business over a four year period.
The Committee will consider whether the measures, the relative balance between the measures and the targets are appropriate to the business strategy and are adequately challenging for any future awards.
LTIP awards are normally in the form of nil cost, performance linked options over Schroders ordinary shares used wherever possible or non-voting ordinary shares and will normally be granted annually.
No dividends are accrued or payable on shares subject to an LTIP award during any period before the awards are exercised.
The maximum annual award for any individual is four times salary.
Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2010 48485 TEXT pp049 074. indd 63 15 03 2011 12:43 64 Remuneration report continued The LTIP is designed to help us in targeting and linking awards to longer term performance.
InitialLTIP awards were made in 2010 covering the 2010 to 2013 performance period, and further awards are proposed in 2011 forthe 2011 to 2014 performance period.
The number of shares vesting from the 2010 LTIP awards depends on the performance of two measures: earnings per share growth and net new business.
Earnings per share growth Earnings per share growth is measured by comparing the Companys earnings per share in the final year of the performance period against earnings per share in the year preceding the performance period and calculating the percentage rate of growth in excess of the rate of growth in a composite index over the same period, as explained below.
The earnings per share growth targets for the 2010 awards are set out in the following table: 2010 1 Performance target % Vesting % Threshold 20 12.5 Maximum 40 50 Notes 1 For performance between the threshold and maximum targets, awards will vest pro-rata on a straight line basis, as shown in the diagram below.
We have a limited number of directly equivalent peers making comparisons inappropriate.
Accordingly a composite market index calculated as a weighted average of the most relevant indices based on the breakdown of the Groups funds under management is a more appropriate comparator.
The relative weighting is 60 per cent.

fixed income as measured by the Barclays Capital Global Aggregate Index.
Net new business The net new business performance is based on a four year cumulative figure.

The combined vesting percentage is applied to the target number of shares granted to determine the number of shares that will vest.
Over the four year measurement period, the accounting charge for the LTIP is the fair value of an award at the date of grant adjusted to reflect the extent that it is expected to vest.
The fair value is the market value at award discounted for the dividends forgone over the four years.
Assuming an award vests in full, the maximum charge in the income statement over the vesting period will be the fair value on the date of grant.
The bonus charge is determined through the operation of a profit share ratio and 50 per cent.

of an LTIP award vests, the full cost of the award will have been covered within the bonus charge.
of an LTIP award vests, the excess over 50 per cent.
will be funded by an increased bonus charge over and above the amount determined by the profit share ratio.
Personal shareholding policy In order to align the interests of the most senior employees with those of shareholders, the executive Directors and the other members of the Group Management Committee are required, over time, to acquire and retain a target holding of Schroders shares or rights to shares, equivalent to 300 per cent.
For these purposes, rights to shares include the estimated after tax value of ECP Share awards but do not include any unvested rights to shares awarded under the LTIP or any unexercised share options.
For each executive Director other than Kevin Parry who became an executive Director on 1 January 2009, based upon the share prices at close of business on that date this target had been achieved as at 31 December 2010.
Further details of the Directors rights to shares and their share interests are provided on pages 69 and 71.
Service contracts The Committees general policy is that each executive Director should have a rolling contract of employment withmutual notice periods of six months.
When recruiting executive Directors, the Committees policy is that contracts should not contain any provision for compensation upon early termination and that the parties should rely on employment rights conferred by law.
In the event that compensation for early termination is payable, the Committees policy is to seek to keep such compensation to an appropriate level.

If terminated by the Company without cause he would be entitled to 12 months compensation calculated as basesalary and discretionary annual bonus, cash and deferred, for the previous year.
Executive Directors non-executive directorships The Board may permit executive Directors to take on non-executive directorships in other organisations, in order to widen their skills and knowledge for the benefit of the Group, provided that it is satisfied that such an appointment would not be to the detriment of their responsibilities to the Group or represent a conflict of interest.
It is the Groups policy to allow executive Directors to retain any fees earned from such appointments.
