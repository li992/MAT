Directors remuneration report Directors remuneration report PART 1: UNAUDITED INFORMATION This report, prepared by the Remuneration Committee the Committee on behalf of the Board, has been prepared pursuant to Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 and the Listing Rules issued by the FSA.
Dear Shareholders This year the Remuneration Committee has undertaken a full-scale review of our approach to remuneration.
This is the first time the remuneration structure has been fully reviewed since 2007, and the external market and the goals of Premier Foods have clearly changed over the past four years.
Although remuneration serves various functions such as attracting and retaining key talent, we approached the review with the intention that the outputs should be primarily driven by our corporate strategy.
You will see that we have not looked to increase overall levels of variable pay as part of this review.
As stated elsewhere in the annual report, our current corporate priorities are: l Growing our branded sales faster than their respective markets by strengthening our brands: l Gaining a competitive advantage by utilising our consumer insight to deliver value to customers: l Delivering efficiency benefits such that supply chain costs and overheads are held flat or decline while volumes grow: and l Focusing on cash generation and debt reduction.
The combination of sales growth, improvements in margin and increasing trading profit will all help to reduce our debt levels, and this should ultimately be positive for shareholder value.
As part of the review, our objective was to design a framework whereby management would be incentivised towards achieving these corporate goals.
Overall, we have looked to design a cohesive structure a bonus plan linked to generating profit and cash flow, a deferred share bonus which is linked to branded sales volumes to increase our market share, and a long term plan which drives long term EPS growth and ultimately delivery of share price growth.
Further details regarding the structure are set out in the remuneration report below.
In January 2011, the Committee carried out a consultation exercise with major shareholders and investor bodies and comments received as part of this exercise have been reflected in the proposals set out below.
As part of the new arrangements the Company intends to seek shareholder approval for the new Long Term Incentive Plan at the AGM 2011.
This has undoubtedly been a busy year for the Remuneration Committee: however, we believe that the new remuneration structure will help to support the Company to successfully deliver its strategy over the short and longer term.

indd 71 09 03 2011 11:26:11 Directors remuneration report continued Pension benefits For each director, the total accrued benefit at 31 December 2010 represents the annual pension that is expected to be payable on eventual retirement of each director.
The additional pension earned during the year represents the increase in this expected pension including the effect of inflation when compared with the position at 31 December 2009.
All transfer values have been calculated in accordance with Regulation 7 to 7E of the Occupational Pensions Schemes Transfer Values Regulations 1996 and subsequent amendments.
The transfer values of the accrued pension entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of the directors pension benefits.
They do not represent sums payable to the director and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The increase in transfer value during the year is the increase in the transfer value of the accrued benefits at 31 December 2010 after deducting directors pension contributions to the scheme.
The transfer value of the increase in accrued benefits under the Listing Rules is the transfer value at 31 December 2010 of the increase in accrued benefits during the period excluding inflation less contributions made by the directors during the period.
The following table sets out the executive directors pension benefits as members of the Companys defined benefit pension schemes as at 31 December 2010: Increase Transfer Additional Transfer Transfer in transfer value of the Accrued Accrued pension value value value of increase pension pension Additional earned during of accrued of accrued accrued in accrued Age at entitlement entitlement pension the year, pension pension pension pension, 31 Dec at 31 Dec at 31 Dec earned during excluding at 31 Dec at 31 Dec during excluding 2 2010 2009 2010 the year inflation 2009 2010 the year inflation Robert Schofield 59 9,800 10,000 200 142,600 150,700 8,100 1 Tim Kelly 53 25,800 30,100 4,300 3,300 409,200 494,400 77,000 43,500 1 Tim Kellys transfer value at 31 December 2009 is based on total accrued benefit calculated using an accrual of 1 25th rather than 1 30th used in previous years.
