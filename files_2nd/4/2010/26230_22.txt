Pensions three of the executive directors tim Breedon, John pollock and Mark gregory are members of the group Uk senior pension scheme the plan, details of which are given in the pension entitlements section on page 77. executives who elected solely for primary protection in response to the lifetime allowance introduced as part of the reforms to pensions legislation in 2006, remain in the plan.
For those executives who elected for enhanced protection, they have opted out of the plan for future service accrual.
Consistent with the legislation, affected executives will be entitled to a pension determined by reference to pensionable earnings at retirement, provided this does not breach the enhanced protection requirements.
From 1 January 2009 onwards, the increases in pensionable salary under the plan have been capped at a maximum of 2.5% each year for active members including relevant executive directors.
For tim Breedon and John pollock, both of whom opted for enhanced protection and no longer accrue pension within the plan, their non-bonusable salary supplement is 22% of the equivalent of the capped pensionable salary had they remained members of the plan from 1January 2009, reflecting a broadly equivalent benefit to the application of a 2.5% per annum pensionable salary increase cap.
in addition, their basic salary at retirement will no longer be used to determine their ultimate pension entitlement.
there is no change to this arrangement in line with the governments announcement that enhanced protection taken under the a-day rules will not be affected by the changes in lifetime allowance.
it is now theoretically possible for them to incur an additional tax charge in some years if they exceed the annual allowance.

Due to changes in legislation and the rules of the defined benefit schemes, the Rpi referred to above will change to Cpi.
From 1 January 2009 onwards, the increases in pensionable salary under the plan are capped at a maximum of 2.5% each year for active members, including relevant executive directors.
retirement On retirement from legal & general at age 60 and subject to statutory limits, executive directors are entitled to pensions as follows: mark Gregory: one-sixtieth of his eligible pensionable salary for each year of eligible service subject to him continuing his 5% of pensionable salary contribution.
Tim breedon and John Pollock: one-sixtieth of eligible salary for each year of service through to the date they opted for enhanced protection.
since opting for enhanced protection on 6 april 2006 they have received a cash supplement in lieu of pension accrual as shown in the Directors Remuneration table on page 67.
Consistent with the legislation, their pension entitlement at retirement remained linked to their salary: however, this linkage ceased at 31December 2008.
Nigel Wilson: Nigel Wilson is a member of the groups defined contribution arrangements, the legal & general staff pension plan.
he is entitled to a Company contribution of 15% of his pensionable salary if he also contributes 5%.
