and focus on the retention of high calibre talent.
This has led the Committee to review the Groups long term incentive arrangements for 2011 and in particular the continued appropriateness of the performance conditions.
The review concluded that the TSR peer group and vesting schedule should remain unchanged in 2011 and that an amendment to the EPS performance conditions should be adopted.
As from 2011, the EPS element of the performance conditions will be based on a straightforward average annual EPS growth target of 3 to 15% over three years.
This amendment takes account of the overwhelmingly international nature of the Groups business, as well as market conditions and consensus forecasts for the Group, and the Committee believes that EPS performance conditions remain robust and demanding.
The adjustment was the subject of prior consultation with shareholders holding over 50% of our shares, who were supportive of the proposal.

Shareholding guidelines The Company has share ownership guidelines which operate in tandem with the executive share incentive schemes introduced in 2003, namely the Performance Share Plan and the Executive Share Option Scheme.
The guidelines were simplified in March 2011 and now require executive directors and other senior executives to retain in the form of shares for at least 2 years at least 35% of any profit made after paying the exercise price and any tax liability on the exercise of 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme options and the vesting of any Performance Share Plan awards.
No further Performance Share Plan awards will be granted to executives who fail to retain shares in accordance with these guidelines.
