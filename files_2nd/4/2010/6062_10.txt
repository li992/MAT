Previous years figures have been based on annual pensionable salary.
3 Jeff Carr was appointed on 29 September 2009.
4 Ellis Watson was appointed on 23 July 2009 and resigned as a Director on 22 March 2010.
5 Sir Moir Lockhead also has a cash benefit of 943,516 in the Local Government Pension Scheme.
Increase in cash net of inflation is 30,961.

8 Transfer values assume immediate retirement at both dates as Sir Moir Lockhead can retire immediately without reduction.
The Group does not have one pension scheme but instead operates a number of different schemes.
All of the schemes in which the Executive Directors participate are defined benefit schemes and are not limited in membership to Executive Directors.
Dean Finch, Sidney Barrie, Nicola Shaw, Jeff Carr and Ellis Watson participated in a final salary arrangement restricted through a scheme earnings cap based on the previous HMRC definition.
To reflect the need to provide a competitive pensions package, from 1 April 2008 a Group SIPP arrangement was introduced, in which these individuals were allowed to participate.
Each individual contributes a minimum of 5% of their basic salary in excess of the scheme earnings cap and the Company contributes 20% on the same basis.
This amounted to a Company contribution during the financial year of 3,927 in respect of Dean Finch, 35,780 in respect of Sidney Barrie, 35,130 in respect of Nicola Shaw, 30,140 in respect of Jeff Carr and 11,200 in respect of Ellis Watson.
