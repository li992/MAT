Directors remuneration report introduction This remuneration report sets out the groups policy and structure for the remuneration of executive and non-executive directors together with details of directors remuneration packages and service contracts.
The report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 Quoted Companies: Directors Remuneration Report to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 and shareholders will be invited to approve this report at the Annual General Meeting on January 20 2011.
The remuneration committee The remuneration committee is chaired by JC Botts.
Its other members during the year were The Viscount Rothermere and MWH Morgan.
All members of the committee are non-executive directors of the company.
The Viscount Rothermere and MWH Morgan are also directors of Daily Mail and General Trust plc DMGT but have no personal financial interests in the company other than as shareholders, and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The group chairman normally attends meetings of the remuneration committee, but is not present at any discussion concerning his own remuneration.
For the year under review, the committee also sought advice and information from the companys managing director and finance director.
The committees terms of reference permit its members to obtain professional external advice on any matter, at the companys expense, although none did so in 2010.
The group itself can take external advice and information from many sources in preparing proposals for the remuneration committee, but no material assistance from a single source was received in relation to remuneration decisions for 2010. remuneration policy The group believes in aligning the interests of management with those of shareholders.
The two consistent objectives in its remuneration policy since the companys inception in 1969 have been the maximisation of earnings per share and the creation of shareholder value.
The first objective is achieved through a comprehensive profit sharing scheme that links the pay of executive directors and key managers to the profits and growth in profits of the group or relevant parts of the group.
This scheme is completely variable with no guaranteed floor and no ceiling.
To support the policy of profit sharing, the group is divided into a number of profit centres.
The manager of each profit centre is paid a profit share related to the profit centres profits and profit growth.
Each profit centre is part of a larger business group.
Each business group manager has an incentive based on the business groups profits and profit growth.
Profit sharing encourages directors and managers to grow their businesses, to launch new ventures and to search for acquisitions that would fit well with their businesses.
All executives on profit shares are aware that if profits rise, so does their pay.
Similarly if profits fall, so do their profit shares.
The profit shares of executive directors and senior managers make up much of their total pay.
For example, of the total remuneration of the 12 executive directors who served in the year, 87% was derived from profit shares.
The creation of shareholder value is also encouraged through the 2010 Capital Appreciation Plan CAP 2010, the 2004 Capital Appreciation Plan CAP 2004 and an executive share option scheme.
CAP 2010 was approved by shareholders at the 2010 Annual General Meeting and is a highly geared performance-based share option scheme which not only directly rewards growth in profits of each executives businesses but also links more closely equity reward with the delivery of economic shareholder value.
CAP 2010 is deliberately similar to CAP 2004, and aims to mirror the success of CAP 2004 for both shareholders and employees by delivering exceptional profit growth over the four years to 2013.
Further details of CAP 2010 are set out on page 32.
Shareholders approved CAP 2004 in February 2005.
The CAP 2004 profit target was achieved in 2007, a year ahead of expectations, and exceeded again in both 2008 and 2009 resulting in the second and final tranche of options vesting, subject to the additional performance condition also being met by the individual businesses.
A more detailed explanation of CAP 2004 is given on page 33.
Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 30 20082.04 09 12 10 Proof 6 The current executive share option scheme was approved by shareholders in January 1996.
The performance criteria under which options granted under this scheme may be exercised are set out on page 34.
This scheme expired in 2006, but no share options have been issued under it since February 2004 although options previously granted may be exercised before various dates to February 2014.
The directors believe that these profit sharing and share option arrangements are responsible for much of the companys success since 1969.
These arrangements align the interests of the directors and managers with those of shareholders and are considered an important driver of the companys growth strategy.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the board based on the time commitment required by the non-executive, their role and market conditions.
The remuneration of the groups employees is reviewed on an annual basis with consideration given to local pay conditions, an individuals performance and the performance of the business that employs them.
The remuneration committee approves the overall remuneration increases for employees and in addition reviews the remuneration structure and value of senior management and key employees.
remuneration structure executive directors It is the groups policy to construct executive remuneration packages such that a significant part of a directors compensation is based on the growth in the groups profits contributed by that director.
The details of the remuneration packages of individual directors are set out below.
basic salary and benefits The basic salary and benefits are generally not the most significant part of a directors overall compensation package.
Each executive director receives a salary which is reviewed annually by the remuneration committee.
Certain non-cash benefits are also provided including private health care, and life assurance through the membership of one of the pension schemes.
Pension schemes Each UK-based director is entitled to participate in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme a defined benefit scheme, closed to new directors, the Euromoney Pension Plan a money purchase plan or their own private pension scheme.
Directors based overseas are entitled to participate in the pension scheme arrangements applicable to the country where they work.
Details of pension scheme contributions can be found on page 38 of this report.
There are no other post-retirement benefits.
Profit share scheme The group believes in aligning the economic interests of management with those of shareholders and achieves this through a comprehensive profit sharing scheme that links the pay of each executive director to the profits and growth in profits of the businesses that the executive director manages.
The executive directors who manage business divisions are set profit thresholds for the businesses for which they are responsible.
The profit thresholds are set at the time the director takes on responsibility for the businesses concerned, usually based on the profits of the previous 12 months, and are adjusted if such responsibilities change.
The normal profit share arrangement pays 1% of profits up to a threshold and then 5% of profits achieved in excess of this threshold.
Some of the directors have schemes which have been in place for a number of years and pay profit shares at slightly higher rates or which are subject to additional thresholds.
The profit shares of the chairman and managing director are based on the adjusted pre-tax post non-controlling interests profit of the group, thereby matching their profit share with the pre-tax return the group generates for its shareholders.
The chairman is entitled to 5.21% 2009: 5.32% of the adjusted pre-tax profit.
The managing director is entitled to 3.08% 2009: 3.15% of the adjusted pre-tax profit up to a threshold of 35,249,841 2009: 33,571,277 and an additional 1.16% 2009: 1.18% of adjusted pre-tax profit in excess of this threshold.
The finance director receives a profit share linked to the pre-tax adjusted earnings per share EPS of the group.
A fixed sum is payable for every percentage point the EPS is above 11p and an additional fixed sum is payable for every percentage point that EPS is above 20p.
CHC Fordham, in addition to his profit share, has an incentive linked to the performance of acquisitions in the period post-acquisition.

Each of the executive directors profit share schemes is completely variable with no guaranteed floor and no ceiling and is designed to be the most significant part of the executive directors remuneration package.
Each directors profit share scheme is subject to remuneration committee approval, and can be revised at any time if the directors responsibilities are changed.

2010 Capital Appreciation Plan CAP 2010 CAP 2010 was approved by shareholders on January 21 2010 and is a modestly revised version of and replaces the previously approved CAP 2009.
CAP 2010 is the direct replacement for CAP 2004 as no further awards may be granted under CAP 2004.
Awards were granted under CAP 2010 on March 30 2010 to approximately 200 directors and senior employees who have direct and significant responsibility for the profits of the group.
Each CAP 2010 award comprises two equal elements: an option to subscribe for ordinary shares of 0.25p each in the company at an exercise price of 0.25p per ordinary share: and a right to receive a cash payment.
In accordance with the terms of CAP 2010, no consideration was payable for the grant of the awards.
The award pool comprises 3,500,992 ordinary shares which have an option value calculated at date of grant using an option pricing valuation model of 15 million, and cash of 15 million, limiting the total accounting cost of the scheme to 30 million over its life.
The awards will vest in two equal tranches.
The first tranche of awards becomes exercisable on satisfaction of the primary or secondary performance condition and lapses to the extent unexercised by September 30 2020.
The second tranche of awards becomes exercisable in a subsequent financial year in which the profits achieved in the year of initial vesting are again achieved.
The second tranche only vests on satisfaction of the primary or secondary performance condition and an additional performance condition.
1 The primary performance condition requires the group to achieve adjusted pre-tax profits of 100 million, from a 2009 base profit of 62.3 million, by no later than the financial year ending September 30 2013 and that profits remain at this level or more for the vesting period of the second tranche.
If the primary performance condition is not met, the secondary performance condition requires the group to achieve adjusted pre-tax 1 profits of at least 84.9 million 60% of the growth under the primary performance condition for the year ending September 30 2013 and remain at this level or more for the vesting of the second tranche of awards.
The award pool is reduced on a sliding scale when the secondary condition is met, with a minimum award pool of 33% of the total if pre-tax profits are 84.9 million.
If the secondary performance condition is met but not the 1 primary condition and adjusted pre-tax profits increase in the following year then the award pool for the second tranche of options is increased catch-up award.
Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 32 20082.04 09 12 10 Proof 6 In the event that either the primary or secondary profit target is achieved, the award pool will be allocated between the holders of outstanding awards by reference to their contribution to the achievement of the performance condition, but no individual may have an award over more than 6% of the award pool.
The catch-up award is also allocated between the CAP participants in the same manner but by reference to their contribution to the achievement of the profit growth in the year the catch-up award applies only.
The additional performance condition, applicable for the vesting of the second tranche of the award, requires that the profits of the respective participants businesses in the subsequent vesting period remain at least 75% of that achieved in the year the primary or secondary performance condition was met.
Thus the CAP 2010 is designed so that profit growth must be sustained if awards are to vest in full.
The number of options received under the share award of the CAP 2010 is reduced by the number of options vesting with participants from the 2010 Company Share Option Plan see below and note 24.
The number of options received by the directors for CAP 2010 is provisional and reflects managements best estimate taking into consideration the profit forecasts to 2013 of the individual profit centres, the respective weighting of these profits between participants and the offsetting number of options delivered under the CSOP 2010.
The provisional number of options anticipated to be received by the directors for the CAP 2010 are given in the directors share option table on pages 39 to 42.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used to calculate its value are set out in note 24.
2010 Company Share Option Plan 2010 CSOP In parallel with the CAP 2010, the shareholders approved the 2010 Company Share Option Plan at the AGM on January 21 2010.
The CSOP 2010 plan was approved by HM Revenue & Customs on June 21 2010.
2 Awards were granted under the CSOP 2010 on June 28 2010 to approximately 135 directors and senior employees of the group who have direct 2 and significant responsibility for the profits of the group.
Each CSOP 2010 option enables each participant to purchase up to 4,972 shares in the 2 company at a price of 6.03 per share, the market value at the date of grant.
No consideration was payable for the grant of the awards.
The options will vest and become exercisable at the same time as the corresponding share award under the CAP 2010 providing the CSOP option is in the money at that time and does not vest before June 28 2013.
Once vested the CSOP option remains exercisable for a period of one month and then lapses.
If the CSOP option is not in the money at the time of vesting of the corresponding CAP 2010 share award it continues to subsist and becomes exercisable at the same time as the second tranche of the CAP 2010 share award.
The CSOP has the same performance criteria as that of the CAP 2010 as set out above.
The number of CSOP 2010 awards that vest will proportionally reduce the number of shares that vest under the CAP 2010.
The CSOP is effectively a delivery mechanism for part of the CAP 2010 2 award.
The CSOP 2010 options have an exercise price of 6.03, which will be satisfied by a funding award mechanism which is in place and results 3 in the net gain on these options being delivered in the equivalent number of shares to participants as if the same gain had been delivered using 0.25p CAP 2010 options.
The amount of the funding award will depend on the companys share price at the date of exercise.
2004 Capital Appreciation Plan CAP 2004 The CAP 2004 was approved by shareholders on February 1 2005 and replaced the 1996 executive share option scheme.
Each CAP 2004 award comprises an option to subscribe for ordinary shares of 0.25p each in the company for an exercise price of 0.25p per ordinary share.
In accordance with the terms of CAP 2004, no consideration was paid for the grant of the awards.
The awards vest in three equal tranches.
The first tranche of awards became exercisable on satisfaction of the primary performance condition in 2007, and lapse to the extent unexercised on September 30 2014.
The other two tranches of awards became exercisable following the results achieved in the 2008 and 2009 financial years when the profits exceeded those achieved in 2007 but only to the extent that an additional performance condition was also achieved.
The scheme 1 was potentially available to all employees.
The primary performance condition, broadly, required that the company achieve adjusted pre-tax profits of 57 million by no later than the financial year ended September 30 2008 and remain at least this level for two further vesting periods.
For the purposes of 2009 profits, redundancy costs were charged against profits for CAP purposes.
The additional performance condition requires that the profits of the respective participants businesses in the subsequent two vesting periods remain at least 75% of that achieved in the year the primary performance condition was met.
1 Adjusted pre-tax profits are before goodwill amortisation and impairment, exceptional items, movements in acquisition option commitment values, imputed interest on acquisition option commitments, foreign exchange gains on losses on tax equalisation contracts on hedges of intra-group financing, foreign exchange loss on restructured hedging arrangements, the cost of the CAP itself and for 2009, after charging redundancy costs.
2 The Canadian version of the CSOP 2010 has a grant date of March 30 2010 and an exercise price of 5.01, the market value of the companys shares at the date of grant, and enables each Canadian participant to purchase up to 19,960 shares in the company.
3 2 Net gain on the CSOP options is the market price of the companys shares at the date of exercise less the exercise price 6.03 multiplied by the number of options exercised.
Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2010 33 20082.04 09 12 10 Proof 6 Directors Remuneration Report Company Accounts Group Accounts Our Governance Our Performance Directors remuneration report continued The CAP 2004 profit target was achieved in 2007 and the option pool of a maximum of 7.5 million shares was allocated between the holders of outstanding awards by reference to their contribution to the achievement of the primary performance condition, subject to the condition that no individual had an option over more than 10% of the option pool.
One third of the awards vested immediately.
The primary performance target was achieved again in 2008 and, after applying the additional performance condition, 2,241,269 options from the second tranche of options vested in February 2009.
The primary performance target was achieved again in 2009 and, after applying the additional performance condition, 1,527,152 options from the third final tranche of options vested in February 2010.
For those individual participants where the additional performance conditions for the second and final tranches have not been met, the vesting is deferred until the profits are at least 75% of that achieved in 2007 but no later than by reference to the year ending September 30 2012.
The actual value of the third tranche of the CAP 2004 award to each director is set out in the directors share option table on pages 39 to 43 and has been trued-up from the estimates provided in last years annual report.
The provisional number of options vesting this year under CAP 2004 for those directors who have options that did not vest under the second and third tranches due to the additional performance test not being satisfied in previous years are also set out in the directors share option table.
The number of options vesting is provisional and will depend on the extent that the additional performance test has been met this year for their respective businesses.
The remuneration committee require the results of the businesses to be reviewed and subsequently modified for true-up adjustments during the period to December 31.
1996 executive share option scheme The executive directors have options from a previous executive share option scheme approved by shareholders in 1996.
This scheme expired in 2006 and no share options have been issued under it since February 2004 although options granted may be exercised before various dates to February 2014.
These options are exercisable subject to certain performance conditions.
For options that expired on January 5 2010 the performance test set by the remuneration committee required the growth in the companys earnings per share for the three consecutive financial years commencing from the year of grant to exceed the growth in the retail prices index by an average of 4% a year.
For all other options expiring after 2005, the performance condition set by the remuneration committee requires that the Total Shareholder Return TSR of the company exceeds that of the average TSR for the FTSE 250 index for the same period.
For the performance condition to be satisfied, the TSR of the company must exceed that of the FTSE 250 on a cumulative basis, measured from the date of grant of the option, in any four out of six consecutive months starting 30 months after the option grant date.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used to calculate its value are set out in note 24. saYe scheme The group operates an all employee save as you earn scheme in which those directors employed in the UK are eligible to participate.
Participants save a fixed monthly amount of up to 250 for three years and are then able to buy shares in the company at a price set at a 20% discount to the market value at the start of the savings period.
In line with market practice, no performance conditions attach to options granted under this plan.
The executive directors who participated in this scheme during the year were PM Fallon, PR Ensor, NF Osborn, DC Cohen, CR Jones, SM Brady and CHC Fordham, details of which can be found on pages 39 to 43 of this report.
DmgT siP scheme Daily Mail and General Trust plc, DMGT, the groups parent company, operates a share incentive plan scheme in which all UK-based employees of the Euromoney group are able to participate.
Employees can contribute up to 125 per month from their gross pay to purchase DMGT A shares.
These shares are received tax free by the employee after five years.

All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Retirement Benefit Transfer Values GN11 published by the Board for Actuarial Standards.
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of the directors pension benefits.
They do not represent a sum paid or payable to individual directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
These changes contributed to the increase in transfer value net of directors contributions.
Members of the scheme have the option of paying additional voluntary contributions.
Neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.
The normal retirement age for the Harmsworth Pension Scheme is 62 years.
