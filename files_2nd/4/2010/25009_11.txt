ICAP plc Annual Report 2010 56 Remuneration report continued In determining the remuneration policy and the size of the awards, the remuneration committee takes account of structures and levels of remuneration for executive directors in other substantial companies that it regards as appropriate comparators and of such companies stated remuneration policies.
The comparator companies, selected because their and the Groups activities are in broadly comparable areas of the financial services sector, include Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Collins Stewart, Tullett Prebon, Deutsche Borse, BGC Partners, Euronext, GFI, Jardine Lloyd Thompson, London Stock Exchange and Man Group.
Components of executive remuneration The executive directors remuneration comprises: basic salary: performance-related bonus: participation in the BSMP: pension contribution: life assurance: and medical insurance.
John Nixons remuneration for 2009 10 is based on his executive responsibilities as Chief Executive Officer of ICAP Electronic Broking, for the information business, strategic development and as an executive director of ICAP plc.
His performance-related bonus comprises a bonus based on profitability of ICAP Electronic Broking and participation on a limited basis in the bonus arrangements of the other executive directors.
John Nixons participation in the BSMP is based on his bonus payment under the executive directors arrangements.
A significant portion of his benefits comprises the Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax, which is required to be paid by the Company on his behalf.
Salaries and benefits The remuneration committee used its discretion and the bonus pool was adjusted downwards to reflect the SEC fine and the losses in the cash equities businesses.
In addition, the remuneration committee considered the achievements of the executive directors against previously agreed specified agreed priorities and objectives for the year ended 31 March 2010.
While the agreed priorities and objectives were substantially met, the FX adjusted profit fell 10% short of the 2009 10 target.
The committee identified a range of possible bonus payouts based on levels of profitability below target and used its discretion during March 2010 to arrive at a total bonus payout excluding John Nixons ICAP Electronic Broking bonus of 7.3 million of which 6.8 million was allocated in this year and 500,000 will be carried forward to the bonus pool for 2010 11.
Set out below are the salaries and benefits received by the executive directors in or, in the case of bonuses, in respect of 2009 10.
