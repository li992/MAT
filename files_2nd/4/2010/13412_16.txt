On his appointment as chief executive designate, Graham Chipchase signed a new contract of employment on 30 November 2009 that was effective from 16 November 2009 and which acknowledged his continuous employment from February 2003.

Thereafter, the contract becomes terminable on one years notice.
No two year notice period exists for any current executive director.
Executive directors contracts continue until such date as agreed between the executive director and the Company.
The contract can also be terminated by either party subject to required notice.

The Company will make any termination payment in monthly instalments over what would have been the notice period until the earlier of the director commencing in a new position or the notice period expiring.
The executive has a duty to mitigate his loss of office and actively seek alternative comparable employment at the earliest opportunity, thereby reducing the need for compensation.
There is no provision relating to the termination of a contract on a change of control.
