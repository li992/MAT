Governance Hochschild Mining plc Unlocking value through exploration Annual Report & Accounts 2010 57 Directors remuneration report INTRODUCTION This Directors remuneration report sets out information on the remuneration of the Directors of Hochschild Mining plc for the year ended 31 December 2010.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the relevant regulations made under the Companies Act 2006 and the requirements of the Financial Services Authoritys Listing Rules.
As required by law, the information provided in the table in the section entitled Long-Term Incentive Plan and the table on Directors total remuneration and accompanying notes has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP as it contains the information upon which the auditors are required to report to the Companys shareholders.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Sir Malcolm Field and its other members are Jorge Born Jr. and Nigel Moore.
All of the members of the Remuneration Committee are independent Non-Executive Directors.
The duties of the Remuneration Committee are to determine and agree with the Board the broad policy for the remuneration of the Executive Directors, the other members of senior management and the Company Secretary, as well as their specific remuneration packages including pension rights and, where applicable, any compensation payments.
In determining such policy, the Remuneration Committee shall take into account all factors which it deems necessary to ensure that members of the senior executive management of the Group are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage strong performance and are rewarded in a fair and responsible manner for their individual contributions to the success of the Group.
The composition of the Remuneration Committee and its terms of reference comply with the provisions of the Combined Code and are available for inspection on the Companys website at www.
com Members of senior management attend meetings at the invitation of the Committee.
During the year, such members included the Executive Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer and the Vice President of Human Resources.
No Director or senior executive is present at meetings when their own remuneration arrangements are considered by the Committee.
The Remuneration Committee was advised during the year on remuneration matters generally by Kepler Associates who did not provide any other services to the Group during the year.
REMUNERATION POLICY The Remuneration Policy of the Group as applied by the Remuneration Committee did not change in the year under review.
The principal objectives of the Groups policy are to attract, retain, and motivate its executives and senior management and to align management incentives with the creation of shareholder value.
The Group seeks to achieve this alignment over both the short and long term through the use of annual performance-related bonuses which reward the achievement of a balanced mix of financial and operational performance measures, and Total Shareholder Return TSR which determines the vesting of awards granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
This policy will continue to be applied by the Remuneration Committee in respect of the current financial year.
Furthermore, as at the date of this report, the Committee is consulting major shareholders on a proposal for an enhancement to the CEOs LTIP award, as described in the following CEO LTIP Plan section.
FIXED AND VARIABLE PAY The following chart illustrates the split between fixed and variable pay of the Executive Directors at both target and maximum performance.
The maximum bonus percentages are set out in each Executive Directors service contract and or as subsequently determined by the Remuneration Committee and, except in relation to the Executive Chairman whose remuneration arrangements were revised in early 2010 as detailed in the 2009 Directors Remuneration Report, have been set to ensure that the majority of remuneration is performance-based.

A. C. Ares, a Group subsidiary.
Salary paid by Ares included all legal labour benefits and compensation such as, but not restricted to vacation salaries and compensation for time services ruled by Peruvian Legislative Decree 6500 but excludes legal profit sharing.
2 As announced by the Company in December 2010, Roberto Daino assumed the role of Non-executive director and Special Adviser to the Chairman and senior management team with effect from 1 January 2011.
As a Non-executive director Mr Daino receives the fee disclosed above of 100,000.
In addition to this amount, Mr Daino receives an annual fee of 150,000 in respect of his role as Special Advisor to the Chairman and senior management team.
3 Ignacio Bustamante has a service contract with Ares.
Base salary includes all legal labour benefits and compensation such as, but not restricted to, vacation salaries but excludes legal profit sharing and compensation for time services ruled by Peruvian Legislative Decree 6500.
Further details on the increase in Ignacio Bustamantes base salary from 1 January 2011 are given in the Base Salaries section below.
BASE SALARIES Contractual Arrangements In respect of the year under review, both Eduardo Hochschild and Roberto Daino had service contracts with Hochschild Mining plc and Compaa Minera Ares S. A. C. Ares, a Group subsidiary.
Under these arrangements, one-fifth of their base salaries was paid by the Company and fourfifths was paid by Ares.
Ignacio Bustamante has a service contract with Ares only, and as a result, his base salary is paid entirely by that company.
2010 Review of Executive Chairmans Remuneration As mentioned in the 2009 Directors Remuneration Report, the Remuneration Committee agreed revised arrangements in respect of Eduardo Hochschild with effect from 1 January 2010.
Under these arrangements, a higher base salary was agreed and Mr Hochschilds participation in bonus and long-term incentive plans were waived.
2011 Review of CEOs Remuneration Mindful of the competition amongst international mining companies to secure the employment of talented senior executives, the Remuneration Committee is keen to ensure that Ignacio Bustamantes remuneration is structured and set appropriately to motivate and retain.
With this objective in mind, the Committee increased Mr Bustamantes base salary from $370,000 to $450,000 to take effect from 1 January 2011.
Even at this revised level, the Committee considers Mr Bustamantes salary to be significantly below median for comparable roles at other mining companies of similar size.
The Committee takes into consideration the remuneration arrangements for the wider employee population in making its decisions on remuneration for senior executives.
SHORT-TERM INCENTIVES Each year the Remuneration Committee approves objectives for each of the Executive Directors based on individual roles and responsibilities which include financial performance of the Group and achievement of key operational targets within the individuals scope of responsibilities.
The level of bonus paid depends on performance against these objectives and is subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The maximum bonus opportunities of the directors in executive office as at 31 December 2010 expressed as a percentage of their respective base salaries are as follows: Roberto Daino 100% Ignacio Bustamante 125% 2010 BONUS AWARDS A summary of the objectives set in respect of 2010 and performance against them is given below: Achieving a level of production within the range set for the year: Generating a level of cashflow which exceeded the highest target: Achieving Earnings Per Share on a pre-exceptional basis which exceeded the highest target: Assuring the growth of the business through increasing Life of Mine and developing greenfield projects, in respect of which the highest targets had been exceeded: Managing the progress of the Groups corporate development strategy, the results of which met the Boards objectives: and Governance Hochschild Mining plc Unlocking value through exploration Annual Report & Accounts 2010 59 Improving safety across the Group as measured by the Accident Frequency Index, the result of which was a significant improvement on the previous year, In light of the Executives performance against their objectives, the Remuneration Committee has approved the levels of annual bonuses as detailed in the table on page 63.
Pensions, statutory profit sharing and benefits-in-kind The Group does not provide pension benefits to the Directors but in respect of the year under review it did pay Eduardo Hochschild and Roberto Daino a cash supplement of $200,000 each per year in lieu of pension Pension Supplement.
Of this supplement, $160,000 was paid by Ares and $40,000 was paid by the Company.
In addition, under Peruvian law, mining companies with more than 20 employees must pay to employees an annual share of profits, in an amount equal to 8% of the companys taxable income for the year.
The amount receivable under this entitlement is determined with reference to seniority of the individual and length of service during the year.
The Group provided all of the Executive Directors serving during 2010 with medical insurance and, in the case of Eduardo Hochschild and Roberto Daino, allowances in respect of cars and personal security.
Performance graph The following graph shows the TSR Total Shareholder Return for the Company compared to the FTSE 350 Index, assuming 100 was invested on 3 November 2006, the date that conditional dealings in the Companys shares commenced.
The Board considers that the FTSE 350 index currently represents the most appropriate of the published indices for these purposes as it provides a view of performance against the broad equity market index of which the Company is a constituent.

For Executive Directors the maximum cash payment on vesting in any three-year period may not be more than six times salary or eight times salary in exceptional circumstances excluding interest on the deferred proportion of the Initial Awards defined below.
Initial Awards Initial awards under the plan were granted in 2008 and will vest in May 2011 the Initial Awards.
Further awards were granted during 2010 the 2010 Awards and, as signalled in last years report, the Company intends to make annual LTIP awards going forward in keeping with established market practice.
The vesting of the Initial Awards is subject to the Companys TSR over a three-year period to 31 December 2010, relative to a tailored peer group of listed international gold and silver mining companies the 2008 Comparator Index.
At the start of the plan, the 2008 Comparator Index comprised the following companies: Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd, Alamos Gold, AngloGold Ashanti Ltd, Apex Silver Mines Ltd, Barrick Gold Corp, Cia des Minas Buenaventura SA, Couer dAlene Mines Corp, Eldorado Gold Corp, Gold Fields Ltd, Goldcorp Inc, Highland Gold Mining Ltd, Iamgold Corp, Kinross Gold Corp, Minefinders Corp, Newmont Mining Corp, PAN American Silver Corp, Petropavlovsk Plc, Polymetal and Silver Standard Resources Inc. During 2009, one of these companies, Apex Silver Mines was fide-listed and was therefore removed from the comparator index.
25% of the maximum cash payment vests if the Company achieves median TSR performance, 75% of the maximum cash payment vests at upper quartile TSR performance and the whole award vests at upper decile TSR performance.
Vesting occurs on a straight-line basis for TSR performance between median and upper quartile and between upper quartile and upper decile.
The Initial Awards vest in two equal tranches, on the third and fourth anniversaries of grant.
Payment of the amount due on the fourth anniversary will attract notional interest at the inter-bank lending rate from the end of the Performance Period until the date of payment.
Hochschild Mining plc 60 Annual Report & Accounts 2010 Directors remuneration report Continued LTIP awards are subject to two clawbacks in relation to a whole, or part of an, award : firstly, if based on a discretionary assessment by the Remuneration Committee, the overall underlying business performance of the Company during the performance period is not satisfactory: and secondly, if there are failures relating to safety, environment, community and legal compliance that the Remuneration Committee considers would entitle it to exercise its discretion.
On a change of control, awards made under the LTIP may vest early unless a replacement award is made, but would be pro-rated to take account of the proportion of the period from the award date to the normal vesting date completed prior to the change of control, and the extent to which performance conditions applying to the award have been met.
Calculation of Relative TSR Performance of Initial Awards When calculated on a Common Currency basis, the Companys TSR over the 2008 LTIP Performance Period was below the median of the Comparator Index which results in nil vesting of the Initial Awards.
However, the Committee does not consider this to be a true reflection of the performance of the Group particularly in light of adverse foreign currency movements, and the significant appreciation in the Companys share price over the last two years of the Performance Period.
Accordingly, subsequent to the year-end, the Committee consulted with major shareholders on using domestic currency as the basis of calculating the Companys relative TSR performance.
A number of the Companys major shareholders expressed their support for this proposal.
Accordingly, the Committee has concluded that use of the domestic currency approach is fully justified and which results in the vesting of 47% of the value of participants Initial Awards.
Participants will receive 50% of their entitlement in May 2011 and the balance, together with accrued notional interest, will be received in May 2012 subject to participants continued service with the Group or otherwise in accordance with the rules of the plan.
Subsequent LTIP Awards The 2010 Awards are subject to principally the same terms as the Initial Awards, with the notable difference being that vesting is not phased and, accordingly, the 2010 Awards will vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
In 2011, the Remuneration Committee intends to grant LTIP awards on broadly the same terms as the 2010 Awards.
The comparator index in respect of these awards will comprise the constituents of the 2008 Comparator Index as subsequently amended supplemented by the addition of Fresnillo plc, Centamin Egypt Limited, African Barrick Gold plc and Randgold Resources Ltd.
Given the situation arising from the use of the common currency approach with respect to the Initial Awards, the Committee intends to calculate the Companys relative TSR performance using a combination of domestic and common currencies.
At the time of printing, shareholder consultation is ongoing and the Company therefore reserves the right to change the policy in respect of the 2011 awards based on feedback from the consultation.
Details of the LTIP awards held by the Executive Directors serving during the year are given in the table below.
Value of maximum award Value of maximum Value of awards Awards surrendered Value of maximum held at 31 December 2009 or award granted vested during or lapsed during the award held at date of appointment, if later during the year the year year 31 December 2010 2 Eduardo Hochschild $4m $4m Ignacio Bustamante $1.6m $0.74m $2.34m 3 Miguel Arambur $1.8m $1.8m 4 Ignacio Rosado $1.5m $1.5m 1 The vesting of LTIP awards held as at 31 December 2009 or date of appointment if later is subject to, amongst other things, the Companys relative TSR performance against a comparator index over the period from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2010 the Performance Condition.
After consultation with the Companys major shareholders, the Remuneration Committee has applied its discretion to calculate the Companys relative TSR performance on a domestic currency basis rather than with reference to a common currency, principally in light of the Companys share price appreciation in 2009 and 2010.
Further details are given in the paragraph headed Calculation of Relative TSR Performance of Initial Awards in the section of this report entitled Long-Term Incentive Plan.
2 As part of a review of the Executive Chairmans remuneration arrangements undertaken in early 2010, Mr Hochschild agreed to surrender his Initial Award under the LTIP.
3 The LTIP Award held by Miguel Arambur lapsed on his resignation from the Group on 30 June 2010.
4 The LTIP Award held by Ignacio Rosado lapsed on his resignation from the Group on 31 May 2010.
CEO LTIP PLAN As part of the CEOs remuneration review referred to above, the Committee proposes in 2011 to grant enhanced LTIP awards to Mr Bustamante that would vest over an extended performance period of six years.
These awards will be subject to shareholder approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, further details of which can be found in the Notice of the 2011 AGM.
Governance Hochschild Mining plc Unlocking value through exploration Annual Report & Accounts 2010 61 DIRECTORS SERVICE CONTRACTS As previously described, the contractual arrangements for those Executive Directors in office as at 31 December 2010 and who were appointed prior to the IPO in 2006 differ to those for the Executive Directors appointed subsequently.

In setting the notice period for termination at 12 months, the Remuneration Committee reduced the likelihood of having to pay excessive compensation in the event of termination at the Companys behest and, to this end, a provision for immediate dismissal with no compensation payable in the event of unsatisfactory performance is included in each Directors contract.

The contract is subject to Peruvian law and, as such, has no fixed term and may be terminated i by the executive on 30 days notice and ii by Ares without notice.
Under Peruvian law, termination by Ares other than termination for certain prescribed reasons such as gross negligence gives rise to an entitlement to compensation of no less than 1.5 times the monthly base salary for each year of service completed, up to a maximum of twelve months base salary.
