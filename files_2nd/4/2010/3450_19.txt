Section 3: Governance REMUNERATION REPORT This report is presented in accordance with the relevant provisions of Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006 and the Combined Code on Corporate Governance the Combined Code.
The Regulations require the auditors to report on the auditable part of the remuneration report.
The audited information has therefore been separately highlighted.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE RESPONSIBILITIES The role and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are set out in written terms of reference based on the model published by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, which are available on the Groups website and include the following: determination of the policy for remuneration of the executive directors and designated senior managers: determination of individual remuneration packages for the executive directors and designated senior managers: consideration of executive directors service agreements, pensions and related matters: making recommendations to the Board on the design of share incentive plans: exercise of all powers and discretions of the directors in connection with the Companys share-based arrangements: and review and note annually the remuneration trends across the Group.
During the year the Committee undertook a detailed review of its remuneration policy and arrangements, supported by its advisors and with full consultation with major shareholders, the ABI and RiskMetrics.
It decided that: remuneration packages should be market competitive.
Compared to companies in the lower half of the FTSE 250 Chloride was 260th in the FTSE at the time, the Committee found that the Chief Executives total target remuneration and base salary was signicantly below median, whilst the Finance Directors total target pay was around median: there should be sufficient incentive pay to appropriately incentivise management and the performance criteria on vesting of long-term incentives are appropriate: there should be sufficient remuneration at risk to help retain executives: there should be increased alignment of management and shareholder interests through greater share ownership: and the current arrangements should be brought into line with good practice.
Chloride has performed well over recent years with its profit growing in each year over the three years to March 2009.
Since then the economic climate has become more challenging, but the Committee considers that management has done an excellent job of maintaining profits around current levels through very difficult economic circumstances, and that there is a platform to resume earnings growth.
In addition, over the last three years to 31 March 2010, Chlorides TSR has outperformed the FTSE 250 Index by over 25%.
As evidenced by these achievements, the Committee considers that the senior management team is of a high calibre and highly marketable and that it is in the shareholders interests that their remuneration packages are competitive and, in particular, that there is substantial performancerelated pay.
As a result, the Committee has decided to make some changes to its remuneration policy: increase the base salary of the Chief Executive to the median market level: increase the level and length of compulsory deferral of the annual bonus, as well as introducing bonus clawback: at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, seek shareholder approval for a new Share Matching Plan, which will be operated for the first time in 2011: make some amendments to the Performance Share Plan to bring it into line with best practice and to allow greater exibility.
Shareholder approval is required for some of these changes and will be sought at the Annual General Meeting: introduce shareholding guidelines for the Executive Directors.
CHLORIDE ANNUAL REPORT 2010 43 Section 3: Governance REMUNERATION REPORT As a result of these changes, the Chief Executives total target remuneration is slightly above median.
The Committee believes that this is appropriate given the substantial proportion of the package related to long-term incentives and the strong performance of the Chief Executive since appointment.
The Committee believes these changes will increase the alignment of executives interests with shareholders and further increase the retentiveness of the packages.
Further details of these changes are set out in the relevant sections of this report and in the Notice of AGM.
MEMBERSHIP The members of the Remuneration Committee during the year were Gary Bullard Chairman, Norman Broadhurst, John Hughes, Paul Lester and Eric Tracey.
ADVISERS During the year, the Remuneration Committee received advice on remuneration of executive directors and senior executives from the Chief Executive and the Group Human Resources Director, neither of whom took part in the determination of their own remuneration.
Advice was also received from the Company Secretary in relation to the operation of the Companys share-based incentive plans.
Advice was obtained from Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS, who were appointed by the Remuneration Committee to advise on executive remuneration, and long-term incentive arrangements, including employee share schemes.
HNBS has no other connection with the Company.
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION During the year, the Remuneration Committee reviewed its performance through the process outlined in the corporate governance report on page 38.
The Remuneration Committee considered that it had the skills and experience to perform its responsibilities.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS POLICY ON REMUNERATION The fees of non-executive directors and the Chairman are determined by the Board and were reviewed during the year.
The policy is to set fees at the median level relative to companies with a comparable market capitalisation.
Fees do not contain any performance-related element and the non-executive directors do not participate in the Chloride Pension Scheme or in the share option or performance share schemes.
Additional fees are paid for chairmanship of the Audit and Remuneration Committees, reecting the additional workload and responsibility of these appointments.
Non-executive directors have no entitlement to compensation for early termination of their term of appointment, and take no part in the determination of their own remuneration.
Details of the fees paid during the year are included in the table headed Summary of remuneration on page 49.
The annual fee level for 2010 2011 is as follows: 2010 2011 2009 2010 Fee Fee Office 000 000 Chairman 125.0 115.0 Non-executive director 40.0 36.5 Remuneration Committee chairmanship additional fee 5.0 5.0 Audit Committee chairmanship additional fee 6.0 6.0 TERM OF APPOINTMENT The non-executive directors are appointed for specified terms of up to three years.
Their letters of appointment have no contractual notice period, and the appointment of each non-executive director is subject to re-election by shareholders on retirement by rotation, which occurs every two years.
The dates on which the current respective letters of appointment came into effect are as follows: Norman Broadhurst 21 April 2010: Gary Bullard and Eric Tracey 2 December 2008: Paul Lester 1 September 2007 and John Hughes 1 January 2009.
44 CHLORIDE ANNUAL REPORT 2010 EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS POLICY ON REMUNERATION The policy is to provide a combination of salary, shortand long-term incentives and benets, which form a competitive and fair total remuneration package.
Performance-related remuneration, in the form of annual bonus and performance shares, comprises a significant proportion of the total remuneration opportunity.
It is only receivable if stretching performance targets, which require substantial improvement in financial performance and, in the case of performance shares, superior total shareholder return, are achieved.
COMPONENTS OF THE REMUNERATION PACKAGE BASE SALARY The base salary of each executive director is reviewed annually, taking into account the responsibilities and performance of the individual together with independently furnished information on rates for similar jobs.
In particular, base salaries recognise salary levels in a group of comparably sized companies.
Details of salaries, bonuses and benets paid to executive directors during the year are included in the table headed Summary of remuneration on page 49.
The basic annual salaries of Tim Cobbold and Neil Warner with effect from 1 April 2010 are: T R Cobbold 400,000 N W Warner 255,000 These represent a 14.3% increase for Tim Cobbold and a 2% increase for Neil Warner.
With regard to Tim Cobbolds salary increase, the Committee believes he is a young, highly talented Chief Executive.
Initially, he was recruited as Chief Operating officer and then was appointed Chief Executive in 2008 on a below market salary and he did not receive an increase in 2009.
Reecting his strong performance, the Committee believes it is now appropriate and necessary to pay him a market median salary.
ANNUAL BONUS Chloride operates annual incentive plans for certain employees, including executive directors.
Eligibility for inclusion in such schemes and the measures of performance to be used are decided annually, taking account of key business issues.
For the executive directors and two senior executives, the maximum award under the 2009 2010 annual incentive plan was 100% of base salary.
The financial measure applicable to 80% of the annual bonus for executive directors was adjusted earnings per share compared with the previous year, with on-target performance being containment to a 7% decline and maximum bonus payable at 7% growth.
Chlorides EPS growth was within this range in 2009 2010 warranting a bonus payment of 56% of salary for the Directors.
The balance of the bonus, up to 20% of the maximum, was dependent on achievement of personal objectives: for example, key strategic initiatives and Chlorides CRS and environmental performances.
To date, bonus amounts earned up to 55% of base salary are paid in cash.
If the bonus earned exceeds 55% of base salary, the bonus earned between 50% and 75% of base salary is deferred into shares which are released after two years, normally subject to the executive director senior executive remaining in the Groups employment.
Bonus payable in excess of 75% of base salary is payable in cash.
The maximum bonus potential for 2010 2011 will be retained at the current level and performance again will be dependent on the achievement of stretching EPS growth targets 80% of bonus and personal objectives 20% of bonus.
However, for 2010 2011 and onwards the structure of the deferral will be changed so that one-third of any bonus earned will be deferred in shares and the deferral period will be lengthened to three years.
In addition, a clawback provision has been added so that individuals would have to repay forfeit some or all of their bonus both cash and deferred shares if there were subsequently found to be a material misstatement of results.
Bonus shares earned by the executive directors under the deferred bonus plan and not yet released by the Company are included in the table headed Interests under share plans starting on page 50.
Bonuses earned by the executive directors and senior executives under annual incentive plans are not pensionable.
CHLORIDE ANNUAL REPORT 2010 45 Section 3: Governance REMUNERATION REPORT BENEFITS IN KIND The taxable benets provided to executive directors during the year under review were use of a fully expensed car or car allowance, life insurance and medical cover.
PENSIONS During the year, the executive directors were members of the final salary section of the Chloride 1996 Pension Scheme the 1996 Scheme.
The 1996 Scheme is a funded, contributory, HMRC-approved, occupational pension scheme which is contracted into the State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme.
It provides a pension of up to two-thirds of final pensionable earnings up to normal retirement age under the Scheme, depending on service.
The 1996 Scheme also provides for dependants pensions and lump sums on death in service.
The table headed Pension entitlements on page 49 shows the retirement benets, excluding voluntary contributions, which accrued under the dened benefit section of the 1996 Scheme to the executive directors during the year, together with the total accrued annual pension to which each of them would be entitled under dened benefit arrangements on leaving service.
With effect from 6 April 2006, the 1996 Scheme adopted a cap on pensionable salary in place of the statutory earnings cap, which is cost neutral to the Group.
The pension benets of the executive directors are subject to this cap and they each received salary supplements in relation to salary in excess of the cap.
The amount of these payments is shown in the table on page 49 headed Summary of Remuneration.
EXECUTIVE SHARE INCENTIVE POLICY The Board encourages executive directors to build and maintain holdings of shares in the Company and believes that the potential for increased share ownership which is provided by share-based incentive schemes is an important element in promoting closer alignment of the interests of shareholders and executive directors.
The current policy is to make annual grants of awards under the Performance Share Plan.
Subject to shareholder consent, from 2011 awards will also be made under the Share Matching Plan.
Further details about this are set out below.
PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN The maximum annual value of shares which can be granted under the Performance Share Plan PSP is 100% of salary and this is the level of award which is currently made to the Executive Directors.
Shareholder approval is being sought at the Annual General Meeting to introduce a limit of 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances, although Chlorides major shareholders will be consulted before making any awards above 100% of salary.
In addition, approval is being sought to allow participants to receive a payment in cash or shares of an amount equivalent to the dividends that would have been paid on vested awards between grant and vesting.
This will only be applicable to awards granted in 2011 and onwards.
Awards granted under the PSP are normally exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of the award, to the extent that a total shareholder return TSR performance target is met over a xed performance period of three financial years.
TSR was chosen as it aligns the interests of the directors with shareholders by requiring superior TSR performance compared to its peers.
The TSR target for grants up to June 2008 compares the Companys TSR with that of constituents of the FTSE Small Cap Index excluding Investment Trusts.
Once the Company became a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index excluding Investment Trusts, the Committee decided that the Companys TSR should be measured against that index for awards granted from June 2008 onwards.
The vesting schedule for already granted awards and 2010 awards is as follows: Chlorides ranking % of awards which vest Below median 0% Median 30% Between median and upper quartile Straight line between 30% and 100% Upper quartile 100% In addition, no awards vest under the PSP unless the Companys EPS growth is at least equal to the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 2% p. a. over the performance period.
Subject to approval being obtained for the amendments to the Performance Share Plan, the plan will also be amended so that i for awards in 2011 and onwards the level of vesting at median will be reduced from 30% to 25% of salary, ii in future, to reect current good practice, awards which vest in good leaver circumstances normally will be time pro-rated in addition to being performance linked and iii to be consistent with the provisions of the new Share Matching Plan, future awards will be exercisable from vesting until the tenth anniversary of the award date to provide some exibility to employees to choose the year in which to pay tax on their shares.
The awards granted in 2006 met the performance conditions in full and became exercisable in the year.
The performance conditions for the 2007 awards were also met in full as at 31 March 2010 and these awards will become exercisable in June 2010.
The TSR calculation is independently calculated by HNBS.
46 CHLORIDE ANNUAL REPORT 2010 SHARE MATCHING PLAN At the 2010 AGM, approval will be sought for the introduction of a Share Matching Plan SMP.
The first awards under this plan will be made in 2011.
It is anticipated that only executive directors and senior executives will participate.
Deferred shares from the annual bonus plan equivalent to one-third of any bonus will be subject to a match by the Company under the SMP.
In addition, executive directors and senior executives will also be able to voluntarily invest up to another third of any bonus in shares which will also be subject to a match by the Company.
The Remuneration Committee will have the ability to set the precise level of voluntary deferral each year, but this cannot be more than a third of the bonus.
Awards will vest after three years subject to continued employment and the satisfaction of specified performance conditions and the retention of the invested shares.
The maximum match will be 2:1 Company: Employee on the gross investment for a stretch level of performance and the threshold level of match will be 0.5:1 Company: Employee.
The performance conditions applying to SMP Shares will be based on challenging compound EPS growth targets compared to the Retail Prices Index over three years.
The precise targets will be discussed with major shareholders in 2011 and a specic resolution will be brought before shareholders for approval at the 2011 Annual General Meeting before the first awards are made.
The Committee believes that the SMP will further increase the alignment between management and shareholders, and facilitate greater share ownership by management.
EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEMES No grants have been made under the Chloride Group 2001 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS since [2005] and there are no plans to grant options in future.
If awards are made under this scheme and the Performance Share Plan then there is as an aggregate limit of two times basic salary.
In calculating the value of awards, a performance share is deemed equal to two ESOS awards.
Options granted under this scheme are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant, on condition that earnings per share growth targets are met over a period of three consecutive years.
Prior to the Chloride Group 2001 ESOS, the Company operated the Chloride Group 1994 Share Option Scheme and the 1996 Share Option Scheme, under which HMRC-approved options and, in the case of the 1996 Scheme, unapproved options were granted to executive directors as well as senior executives.
No further options can be granted under the 1994 or 1996 schemes.
Options granted under the 1994 and 1996 Schemes are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant and were subject to meeting performance targets relating to EPS growth.
There are no outstanding options held by a director under any of the above option schemes.
Details of the options exercised by Neil Warner are set out in the table on page 50 headed Interests under Share Plans.
SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES Executive directors will be expected to build up and maintain a shareholding of 100% of salary.
Until this level of shareholding is achieved, executive directors will have to retain 50% of all vesting share awards after tax until the guideline is met.
This retention of some vested shares will take effect in 2010 in relation to deferred shares and PSP awards and will apply to SMP awards when they start to vest.
SAVINGS-RELATED SHARE OPTION SCHEME The Group operates a savings-related share option scheme the 2007 Scheme, which expires in July 2017.
Under the Scheme, options which are available to eligible UK employees who contract to save a specified monthly amount are not normally exercisable until the expiry of three or, depending on an individuals initial election, five years from the contract start date.
The 1997 savings-related share option scheme expired in July 2007, and no further options can be granted under it.
The outstanding interests of the executive directors under all executive share option schemes, the savings-related share schemes and the PSP are set out in the table starting on page 50 headed Interests under Share Plans.
CHLORIDE ANNUAL REPORT 2010 47 Section 3: Governance REMUNERATION REPORT CONTRACTS OF EMPLOYMENT Each of the executive directors has a rolling contract of employment, terminable on 12 months notice if terminated by the Company and six months notice if terminated by the director.
The executive directors current contracts of employment became effective on the following dates: Tim Cobbold 29 July 2008 Neil Warner 23 April 1997 In the event of termination by the Company, each of the executive directors would be entitled to 12 months salary, pension benets, salary supplement and benets in kind.
In an appropriate case the Company would have regard to the departing directors duty to mitigate loss.
However, the contracts of employment of the directors contain special terms relating to dismissal following a change of control of the Company, under which they would each be entitled to receive a prescribed payment made up of 12 months salary and benets including a bonus payment of 20% of basic salary.
Four senior executives also have contracts of employment containing this formula for a prescribed compensation payment on dismissal following a change of control.
However, in line with best practice, no bonus will be included in contracts for any directors appointed in future.
No compensation payments were made to executive or non-executive directors during the year.
POLICY ON EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The current policy is that executive directors should not take on more than one major outside appointment and then only with the prior approval of the Board.
Fees associated with any such appointment will normally be retained by the individual.
During the year, fees received and retained were as follows: Fee 000 Company Neil Warner 38.75 Dechra Pharmaceuticals plc TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN The graphs set out below show the performance of the Company over the last five financial years in terms of TSR, relative to the FTSE Small Cap Index and the FTSE 250 Index both excluding investment trusts.
