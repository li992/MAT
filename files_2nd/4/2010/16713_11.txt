com Report on Directors Remuneration This report covers the remuneration of executive and non-executive Directors.
The Companys approach to the Chairmans and executive Directors remuneration is determined by the Board on the advice of the Remuneration Committee.
Individual remuneration packages are determined by the Remuneration Committee within the framework approved by the Board.
The Companys approach to non-executive Directors remuneration is set by the Board with account taken of the time and responsibility involved in each role, including where applicable the Chairmanship of Board Committees.
The Remuneration Committee consists entirely of non-executive Directors, as set out on page 25, and is chaired by Patrick fide Smedt.
The Remuneration Committee has access to independent advice where it considers it appropriate.
This year, the Committee has continued to use the services of Hewitt New Bridge Street which it has previously appointed for Directors remuneration.
Neither Hewitt New Bridge Street nor AON Corporation, its ultimate parent company, provide any other services to the Company, save in respect of those relating to other senior executive remuneration and administration of share schemes.
Remuneration policy The Company aims to provide a remuneration structure that is aligned with shareholder interests and as such is competitive in the marketplace to attract, retain and motivate executive Directors of superior calibre in order to deliver continued growth of the business.
Company policy is that performance related components should form a significant portion of the overall remuneration package, with maximum total potential rewards being earned through the achievement of challenging performance targets based on measures that represent the best interests of shareholders.
In 2010, if executive Directors earned a maximum annual bonus and Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP payout, basic salary would represent one third of total remuneration, with one third attributable to annual bonus and one third to LTIP excluding pension provision.
This assumes an LTIP award of one times salary.
Going forward, as mentioned below, the LTIP award level will be increased to 125% of basic salary for the awards due to be made in the year ending 30 September 2011.
Potential overall remuneration package mix for executive Directors 2010 2011 1 LTIP 33 3% LTIP 38% 1 Basic salary 33 3% Basic salary 31% 1 Bonus 33 3% Bonus 31% In formulating remuneration policy, full consideration has been given to the principles set out in Section B of the Combined Code and the Committee will regularly review the policy to ensure it takes due account of best practice including the principles of the new UK Corporate Governance Code, effective for the year ending 30 September 2011 and the particular circumstances of the Company.
In line with the Association of British Insurers Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee ensures that the incentive structure for executive Directors and senior management do not raise environmental, social or governance ESG risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
More generally, with regard to the overall remuneration structure, there is no restriction on the Committee which prevents it from taking ESG matters into account.
The Committee is also satisfied that the overall remuneration structure neither encourages nor rewards inappropriate operational risk-taking and is fully compatible with the Companys risk management policies and systems.
When setting the executive Directors remuneration, due account is taken of pay and employment conditions of other Group employees.
In this regard, the Committee will liaise with the Groups Human Resources function to ensure it is fully aware of all the relevant issues.
Basic salary and benefits The basic salary for each executive Director is reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee.
It is intended that basic salary levels should reflect those paid to senior management of comparable companies selected on the basis of market capitalisation and turnover.
Individual salary adjustments take into account each executive Directors performance against agreed challenging objectives and the Groups financial circumstances as well as comparing each executive Directors basic salary to senior management in the Group and relative to the external market.
The Committee used the services of Hewitt New Bridge Street to provide comparative data.
The executive Directors received no increase in basic salary for the financial year ended 30 September 2010.
For the financial year ending 30 September 2011, the Chief Executives basic salary will increase by 3% to $670,000 and the Groups contributions to his pension scheme and associated salary supplement will increase from 20% of basic salary to 25% of basic salary, with the Groups employees in general receiving pay rises ranging from 5% - 8% depending on promotional increases and individual performance.
18297 07 12 10 Proof 37 Stock code: VCT Victrex plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 29 Following his appointment on 8 October 2010 the Finance Directors basic salary is 240,000 and the total remuneration packages of both executive Directors will remain around median levels.
Annual cash bonus Each executive Director was eligible to receive an annual cash bonus of up to 100% of basic salary for the year ended 30 September 2010.
This was determined by reference to performance targets based on the Groups financial results up to 80% of basic salary and specific individual objectives up to 20% of basic salary set at the beginning of the financial year.
For 2010 the individual objectives included a revision of the Groups corporate strategy following divisionalisation in 2009, the completion of customer and employee satisfaction surveys and operational and technical effectiveness and efficiencies across the Group.
The second component of the bonus is payable only if, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, there has been an improvement in the underlying financial and operating performance of the Group during the year ended 30 September 2010.
The actual bonus payable to each executive Director for the year ended 30 September 2010 was 81.3% of basic salary.
This comprised 61.3% based on performance against budgeted Group profit before tax and 20% for the achievement of specific non-financial objectives.
These levels of bonus reflect a year of outstanding Group and personal performance.
For the annual bonus plan for the year ending 30 September 2011 the maximum bonus potential will remain at 100% of basic salary and the split of targets will be consistent with those used in the year ended 30 September 2010.
Awards under the 2009 Victrex Long Term Incentive Plan At the 2009 AGM, shareholder approval was obtained for the establishment of a new Victrex Long Term Incentive Plan the 2009 LTIP which replaced the original Long Term Incentive Plan which had expired.
Under the 2009 LTIP executive Directors can be eligible to be awarded options to acquire, at no cost, market purchased ordinary shares in the Company up to a maximum equivalent value of 150% of basic salary each year.
In exceptional circumstances such as recruitment or retention, this limit is increased to 200% of basic salary.
To date all awards made under the 2009 LTIP have been equivalent to 100% of basic salary: this award level will be increased to 125% of basic salary for the awards due to be made in the year ending 30 September 2011 so as to ensure long-term incentive provision remains market competitive.
Notwithstanding the increase in long-term incentive provision together with the salary increase noted above, the remuneration packages of the executive Directors will remain around median levels.
Awards normally vest in three equal tranches on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant to the extent that the applicable performance conditions measured over a single three year period from grant see below have been satisfied and provided the participant is still employed in the Companys Group.
Participants will have a five year period from the date each tranche vests in which to exercise awards.
Participants will receive a payment in cash and or shares on or shortly following the vesting of their awards, of an amount equal to the dividends that would have been paid on those shares between the time when the awards were granted and the time when they vest.
Alternatively, participants may have their awards increased as if dividends were paid on the shares subject to their award and then reinvested in further shares.
The extent to which the initial awards made in the years ended 30 September 2009 and 2010 will vest is dependent on two independent performance conditions with 50% determined by reference to the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR and 50% determined by reference to the Groups earnings per share EPS, as follows: the TSR element of an award will vest in full if the TSR ranks in the upper quartile, as measured over the three year period, relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts at the beginning of that period.
This element of the award is reduced to 25% on a pro rata basis for median performance and is reduced to nil for below median performance: and the EPS element of an award will vest in full if EPS growth exceeds inflation, as measured by the Retail Prices Index, by an average of 12% per annum or more over the three year period.
This element of the award is reduced to 25% on a pro rata basis if EPS growth exceeds inflation by an average of 5% per annum over the period and is reduced to nil if EPS growth fails to exceed inflation by 5% per annum.
The Remuneration Committee considers that this combination of performance conditions is the most appropriate way of rewarding executive Directors because it takes into account both the long-term returns to shareholders and the Groups financial growth.
The TSR performance condition is monitored on the Committees behalf by Hewitt New Bridge Street whilst the Groups EPS growth is derived from the audited financial statements.
It is intended that the same performance conditions will be applied to awards granted under the 2009 LTIP in the year ending 30 September 2011.
