84 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2010 Directors remuneration report Dear shareholder I am delighted to have become chairman of Petrofacs Remuneration Committee during another year of exceptional performance, with strong growth across all our KPIs including revenue, earnings and backlog, as well as the successful demerger of the UK Continental Shelf assets from our Energy Developments business in April 2010.
Our remuneration policy is geared towards having a significant proportion of reward linked to the continued success of the business.
As such, our policy is for basic salaries to be at median or below, with variable pay structured to allow executive directors to achieve upper quartile total remuneration if outstanding performance is achieved.
We believe this approach will allow Petrofac to attract, retain and motivate high calibre individuals with the skills and capabilities to match our ambitions for continued growth and sustained success.
Accordingly, as previously advised, the Committee reviewed executive remuneration during the year in the context of Petrofacs exceptional performance to date.
Our review showed that basic salary levels continued to be appreciably below industry benchmarks and below lower quartile compared to UK companies of similar size.
Total Membership remuneration levels remained below market even after last years Prior to the Bernard fide Combret Chairman changes to performance related pay.
This gap continued to widen 2010 AGM Michael Press due to Petrofacs sustained strong growth.

Indeed, in January 2011, we were able to announce the appointment of Andy Inglis as Chief Executive, Energy Developments and Production Solutions, whose remuneration package is given on page 92.
The Committee is also proposing to make a minor administrative amendment to the Deferred Bonus Share Plan to extend participation to employees in certain Petrofac joint venture organisations, where appropriate.
Further details are outlined on page 90.
Shareholder approval for this amendment will be sought at the forthcoming AGM.
The Committee believes that these changes are in the best interests of shareholders.

In last years remuneration report, the Committee signalled its intention to review basic salaries during 2010, and in particular their impact on total compensation levels, in the context of Petrofacs exceptional performance.
The 2010 benchmarking review showed that basic salary levels remained below industry benchmarks and also below lower quartile compared to UK companies of similar size and complexity.
This had 38% Salary 20% Salary a significant impact on total remuneration, which generally remained 39% Annual bonus 40% Annual bonus well below market competitive levels, even after the changes to 23% PSP 40% PSP performance related pay last year.
This gap continued to widen given the outstanding performance and sustained growth of the business during 2010.
If an executive director receives a maximum cash bonus and maximum PSP award equal to 200% of basic salary, his fixed There is upward pressure on remuneration levels within the oil & gas remuneration excluding cash allowances benefits would be one fifth services industry, both in the general workforce and at more senior of his overall remuneration, with variable remuneration making up the levels.

Fixed and variable pay A significant proportion of Petrofacs total remuneration package is variable.
There is a particular emphasis on long-term share-based incentives, to align closely directors interests with shareholders interests.
The balance between the fixed basic salary and variable annual bonus and long-term incentive elements of remuneration varies depending on performance.
The charts below show the mix between fixed and variable pay, excluding cash allowances benefits.
The actual mix may be higher or lower, depending on the performance of Petrofac and the individual.

Additionally, appropriate, the business division for which the individual director following the demerger he acted as interim Chief Executive of Energy is primarily responsible, have achieved annually established Developments and Production Solutions for the remainder of 2010. budgets and targets Therefore, the Committee is proposing to make a PSP award of 250% of salary to Ayman in March 2011.

TSR remains the best measure of the Companys ultimate delivery of shareholder returns and EPS is the internal financial measure most closely linked to value creation in an oil & gas services business.
The performance period is three years, as this is considered to be an appropriate long-term time horizon for both performance measurement and retention.

TSR is the percentage return to a purchaser of an ordinary share in the Company arising from share price appreciation and reinvestment of dividends over a given period.
The TSR of the Company is measured and then compared against the median TSR of an index of a number of international peer companies, as detailed in the following table.

A resolution is proposed at the 2011 AGM to amend the Articles of Association in order to increase the maximum nonexecutive director fees payable to 1 million per annum.
This increase is necessary to allow Petrofac sufficient headroom to discharge its obligations without further shareholder approval.

3 Following the completion of the demerger of Petrofacs UK Continental Shelf oil & gas assets to EnQuest PLC in April 2010, the Company applied an adjustment factor of 1.08 8% to unvested share awards held under the Petrofac Performance Share Plan PSP to compensate awardholders for not being entitled to EnQuest PLC shares at the time of the demerger.
