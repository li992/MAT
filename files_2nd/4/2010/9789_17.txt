com annualreport2010 71 Operating & Financial review p16 Governance Financial statements p78 Directors pension information a Pension benefits John Dixon is the only executive director who is a member of the Companys Defined Benefit Pension Scheme.
Details of the pension benefits earned by John Dixon during the year ending 3 April 2010 are shown below: Transfer value of increase Additional in accrued accrued Additional pension earned Transfer value transfer value Increase in pension during Accrued pension pension pension earned during the of accrued of accrued transfer value the period entitlement at entitlement at during the period above pension at pension at during the above Age as at 09 09 09 03 04 10 period inflation 09 09 09 03 04 10 period inflation 03 04 10 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 John Dixon 42 114 120 6 6 1,148 1,307 159 57 The accrued pension entitlement is the deferred pension amount that the director would receive at age 60 if he left the Company on 3 April 2010.
The increase in entitlement is the difference between the accrued benefit at the year end and that at the date of appointment to executive director.
The Listing Rules require this to be disclosed excluding inflation.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance note Gn 11.
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of the directors pension benefits.
They do not represent sums payable to the director and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The increase in the transfer value less directors contributions is the increase in the transfer value of the accrued benefits during the year after deducting directors pension contributions to the scheme.
no other executive director participates in the scheme.
Instead they receive a salary supplement in lieu of membership of the Group Pension Scheme as described on page 62. b Payments to former directors Details of payments made to former directors during the year are: 2010 2009 1 Early retirement pensions payable until 000 000 James Benfield 22 April 2009 7 85 Derek Hayes 19 november 2008 57 2 Unfunded pensions Clinton Silver 108 107 1 Under the Early Retirement Plan, the Remuneration Committee could, at its discretion, offer an unfunded Early Retirement Pension, separate from the Company pension, which was payable from the date of retirement to age 60.
With effect from 31 March 2000, the Early Retirement Plan was withdrawn but payments continue for awards made before this date.
2 The pension entitlement for Clinton Silver is supplemented by an additional unfunded pension paid by the Company.
For 2009, the details of these pension payments were included within the Directors emoluments table under Former directors.
