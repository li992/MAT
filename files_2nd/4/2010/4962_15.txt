Governance Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT 59 The Committee has sought to ensure that the variable elements of management remuneration achieve an appropriate balance between short-term financial and operational performance, progress towards th he Gr e Group oup s s strategic objectives and alignment with the returns to shareholders.
Tim Barker Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Introduction The spreads between power price and the cost of generation during 2010 have been at the lowest levels since the electricity industry was privatised in 1990.
The Remuneration Committee the Committee is acutely aware that it is these spreads that primarily determine the returns to our shareholders in the short term.
This is a critical component in the Committees determination of the remuneration packages of executive directors and senior staff.
The Committee also recognises that true alignment with the interests of our shareholders requires management to make judgements to ensure that the business is managed effectively through challenging market conditions and take action to develop an enduring, sustainable business which is less reliant on the spreads available from coal-fired power generation.
The strong contracted power sales position which was put in place by management in 2009 provided a substantial hedge against the low spreads and gave more certainty over our earnings.
Operationally, 2010 was an exceptional year with a number of measures at best ever performances levels for the power station.
The resulting high availability and high output, allowed the Group to benefit from the power stations ability to provide critical support to the electricity system in some unusually cold weather over the winter.
These factors, combined with strong cost control, resulted in an improved profit position compared to the prior year.
There has also been progress in the strategic development of the biomass operation and the continuing growth of the retail business, Haven Power Limited Haven Power.
Collectively, these are important steps in positioning the Group for its long-term development, and have been taken against a background of significant regulatory uncertainty.
The Committee has striven to maintain a fair remuneration package.
It needs to reflect the current economic context and the returns to shareholders, whilst also providing the right rewards and incentives to encourage the management of Draxs transition to become a sustainable, low carbon business.
The Committee has considered the environmental, social and governance implications of the remuneration arrangements and is satisfied that they will not lead to irresponsible behaviours.
This Remuneration Committee report has been prepared on behalf of the Board by the Committee.
The Committee has adopted the principles of good governance as set out in the Combined Code 2008 and complies with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, the relevant schedules of the Companies Act and the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations, 2002 the Regulations.
These Regulations require the Companys auditors to report on the Audited information in the Remuneration Committee report and to state that this section has been properly prepared in accordance with the Regulations.

Principal responsibilities The Committee has formal terms of reference, in accordance with which its principal responsibilities are: recommending to the Board the remuneration strategy and framework for the executive directors and senior managers: determining, within that framework, the individual remuneration arrangements for the executive directors and senior managers: approval of the design of annual and long-term incentive arrangements for executive directors and senior managers, including agreeing the annual personal targets and payments under such arrangements: determining and agreeing the general terms and conditions of service and the specific terms for any individual within the Committees remit, either on recruitment or on termination: determining the policy for, and scope of, executive pension arrangements: and overseeing any major changes in employee benefit structures throughout the Group and reviewing remuneration trends across the Group.
Agenda Each year the Committee agrees an annual work schedule.
The regular scheduled matters considered by the Committee in 2010 were: review of the performance of the Group by reference to the 2009 Balanced Corporate Scorecard BCS, including the application of the Committees discretionary factor: ratification of the measures and weightings of the 2010 BCS: 2009 annual bonus awards to directors and senior managers by reference to the BCS and individual performance against personal objectives: agreeing personal objectives for directors and senior managers for 2010: review of base salary and overall remuneration packages for executive directors and senior managers: review of the Chairmans remuneration: granting of awards under executive and all employee share plans: consideration of vesting of awards under executive share plans no such awards vested during 2010 : and review of fees paid to advisers.
Governance Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 61 In addition, with the assistance of its advisers PwC, the Committee reviewed long-term incentive arrangements of the Group.
Further details of the review and of the adjustments to the performance conditions made as a result of the review are included in the section of this report headed Conditional share awards under the Bonus Matching Plan on page 65.
The Committee also reviewed the rules of the Annual Bonus Plan, which it considered to remain appropriate.
It considered that the opportunity under the Annual Bonus Plan is consistent with market practice and the mix of performance measures applied via the BCS and further personal objectives provide suitably challenging targets.
Remuneration policy The core principles of the remuneration policy are to: manage salaries and benefits around market levels, taking into account remuneration in relevant comparator groups: link a significant proportion of remuneration to performance: award annual bonuses which are linked to the delivery of the annual Business Plan targets and personal performance: and provide staff with long-term incentives linked to Total Shareholder Returns TSR and to the delivery of Business Plan targets with a particular emphasis on the achievement of strategic objectives.
When applying this policy to senior managers below director level, the Committee selects salary and benefit benchmarks appropriate to individual specialisms.
The objectives of the remuneration policy are to: motivate executive directors and staff to help ensure that Drax meets challenging performance goals: enable Drax to recruit and retain the expertise needed to manage and develop its business: strengthen teamwork at all levels: and ensure alignment of executive and shareholder interests.
During the year under review the remuneration package of executive directors and senior managers was made up of: Fixed Variable Annual performance bonus Base salary A mix of cash and deferred shares Long-term incentive comprising conditional shares under the Bonus Matching Plan BMP Pension Performance over three years Benets in Kind BiK All employee share plans Car allowance, private medical etc The table on page 62 shows the mix of remuneration that applied in 2010 for executive directors between variable and fixed, and short-term and long-term remuneration.
During 2010, the Committee appointed PwC as its independent adviser, in place of Kepler Associates who had held that appointment for more than five years.
Following PwCs appointment in October 2010, the Committee reviewed the remuneration arrangements for its executive directors and senior management.
The Committee was particularly concerned to ensure that these provided the right incentive and retention elements to ensure alignment with the steps needed to manage the business effectively and to develop a sustainable business relying less on coal generation, increasing its generation from biomass and developing its supply business.
The review concluded that base salary levels effective from 1 April 2010 as detailed on page 67, benefits and annual bonus performance structures were appropriate and aligned with the market.
It was considered, however that there was an opportunity to improve the long-term incentive arrangements provided through the Bonus Matching Plan BMP, the vesting of awards under which was determined wholly by relative TSR, which, because of its close correlation with commodity markets, is a measure over which management has limited influence.
The Committee considered that it was appropriate to retain a significant element of relative TSR in the long-term incentive performance condition in order to align directly with the interests of shareholders, but also to include measures relating to the operational and strategic objectives of the Company.
The Committee therefore consulted with the Companys largest shareholders on proposals to adjust the performance conditions of the BMP to include additional performance measures.
Shareholders who were consulted were generally supportive of the proposed adjustments and the Committee took account of comments made by shareholders in implementing the proposals.
Further details of the BMP are included on page 65.
The Committee believes that the current remuneration arrangements, including the adjusted performance conditions of the long-term incentive, are appropriate and fit for purpose taking account of the particular nature of Draxs business.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 62 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT Components of remuneration The main components of current executive directors remuneration are summarised as follows: Chief Finance Production Executive Director Director Salary Salaries were benchmarked in 2010 against comparator groups of utilities, power generators and selected other industrial and commercial companies with comparable market capitalisation, turnover and employee numbers.

The Bonus Matching Plan opportunity is based on fair value assuming the annual bonus pays out at target and the fair value of a BMP performance share is 4.5% of its face value.
The following paragraphs provide more detail in relation to each of the components of remuneration for executive directors.
Base salary Executive directors base salaries and benefits are reviewed each year with any changes taking effect from 1 April.
The review takes into account individual performance and market competitiveness.
In March 2010, Kepler presented a report to the Committee in which executive director salaries were benchmarked against two relevant comparator groups.
Firstly, an industry sector group of 20 companies comprising companies in the electricity, oil and gas, engineering and utilities sectors.
Secondly, a comparator group comprising 20 companies of comparable size to Drax in terms of market capitalisation, turnover and employee numbers from a variety of industry sectors.
By way of an additional comparator, the report reviewed reported remuneration at International Power plc, which was considered to be the company with characteristics most similar to that of Drax.
The report indicated that the remuneration of the Companys executive directors was, in all cases, in the lower quartile of the comparator group by reference to salary, cash and total remuneration.
The Committee also took account of the fact that no increase in salary had been awarded to the executive directors in the pay review year ending on 31 March 2010, and also of the level of general pay increases within the Company.
The pay increase agreed on behalf of staff covered by collective bargaining arrangements was 2.7% to be effective on 1 April 2010, with further increases of RPI plus 0.3% on 1 January 2011 and 1 January 2012.
The collective settlement for 2009 had been 3.5%.
It was therefore noted that, on an annualised basis, general increase in salaries in the Company had been in excess of 7% over a two year period.
The RPI based increase for the collective bargaining group as at 1 January 2011 was 4.9%.
In light of the benchmarking exercise and the other factors considered, the Committee agreed that with effect from 1 April 2010: the Chief Executives base salary should be increased from 450,000 to 500,000: the Finance Directors base salary should be increased from 300,000 to 340,000: and the Production Directors base salary should be increased from 255,000 to 280,000.
Governance Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 63 Following the increases, each of the executive directors salary, cash and total remuneration remained below median by reference to the comparator group.
The Committee consider this salary level to be appropriate taking into account all of the factors set out.
The Committee has determined that executive directors salaries shall be increased by 2% with effect from 1 April 2011.
Pensionable salary is derived from base salary only.
Annual performance bonus The Group operates an annual bonus scheme.
Bonuses are based on both Group and individual performance against objectives and are designed to reward short-term performance.
The Committee determines Group performance measures using a BCS for which the Board sets challenging performance targets as part of the Business Plan approval process.
Each element of the scorecard has a low, target and stretch target measure and is given a percentage weighting.
No score is attributed if performance is below the low target and maximum score is attributed to stretch target performance.
In 2010 the scorecard had the following elements and weightings: Elements Weighting Financial targets Underlying earnings per share: and 20% 1 Cash and controllable costs.
10% Production targets Safety and Plant and operational performance.
20% Strategic and Business Plan objectives Trading and commercial: 10% Commissioning of co-firing plant: 5% Alternative and advantaged fuel combustion: 2.5% Biomass plant project development: 10% Supply business customer and volume growth: and 12.5% Other business plan objectives.
10% Notes: 1 Cash flow for the year excluding the impact of short-term investments prior to payment of equity dividends.
In setting these measures and weightings, the Committee recognises that the short-term financial performance of the Group is substantially determined by commodity prices, and especially the dark green spread, over which management has limited control.
The Committee, nevertheless, believes that the variable elements of pay should be sufficiently linked to financial performance to ensure that there is alignment with the interests of shareholders.
The Committee considers that the annual bonus measures and weightings achieve an appropriate balance between financial performance measures and other key performance measures that are more directly in the control of management.
The Committee assesses corporate performance against each of these measures, and has a discretion to adjust the overall score by a factor between 0.75x and 1.25x i. e. 25% to reflect performance and unexpected developments that are not directly included in the scorecard, leading to an overall percentage score.
Following the process, the Committee assessed the corporate score for 2010 at 150%.
A summary of the assessment is set out in the following table: Elements Financial targets Stretch target achieved for: underlying earnings per share: 1 cash and controllable costs.
Between target and stretch target for safety: and Production targets Stretch target achieved for plant and operational performance.
Between target and stretch target for: Strategic and Business Plan objectives trading and commercial: commissioning of co-firing plant: and supply business customer and volume growth.
Stretch target achieved for: Alternative and advantaged fuel combustion.
Below target for: Biomass plant project development.
Notes: 1 Cash flow for the year excluding the impact of short-term investments prior to payment of equity dividends.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 64 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT The Board determines personal performance objectives for each executive director.
The Committee assesses performance against these objectives and applies an individual performance multiplier of between zero and 1.5.
To determine the actual bonus awarded to each executive director, the target bonus is multiplied by the corporate score and by the personal score, subject to a cap of two times the target bonus.
For bonus awards in 2010, the target bonus for the Chief Executive and the other executive directors was 65% and 60% of base salary respectively.
The maximum bonus was 130% and 120% respectively.
75% of any bonus award is paid in cash and 25% is deferred in shares that vest after three years and are forfeited if the executive leaves the Group other than as a good leaver before the shares vest.
The target and maximum bonus percentages for 2011 for the Chief Executive and the other executive directors are the same as in 2010, and bonus measures and targets have been set using a similar process to that used previously.
The corporate scorecard weightings are, as for 2010, 30% financial, 20% production and 50% strategic and Business Plan.
The weightings are set out in the following table: KPI Target weighting Financial performance 1 Group underlying earnings per share 20% 2 Cash and controllable costs 10% Total financial 30% Production Safety and production targets 20% Total production 20% Strategic and Business Plan Regulatory 10% Biomass development 15% Retail development 10% Trading added value 5% Alternative advantaged fuel burn 5% Other 5% Total strategic and Business Plan 50% Total weighting 100% Notes: 1 Calculated using underlying earnings, being profit attributable to equity shareholders adjusted to exclude the after tax impact of unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
2 Cash flow for the year excluding the impact of short-term investments prior to payment of equity dividends Governance Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 65 Conditional share awards under the Bonus Matching Plan The Group operates a Bonus Matching Plan BMP as a long-term performance share plan.
Awards under the BMP have been made in 2009 and 2010.
Under the BMP executive directors and other senior executives receive an annual grant of conditional shares to a value of up to 1.5 times the amount of the executives annual bonus for the prior year.
No payment is made for the shares, however vesting is subject to service and performance conditions.
In respect of existing awards, 33% of awards granted to those members of senior management who are not members of the Executive Committee will vest on the third anniversary of grant provided that the participant is still employed by the Group.
Awards granted to members of the Executive Committee and the balance i. e. 67% of the awards granted to other members of senior management will vest on the third anniversary of grant provided the participant is still employed by the Group and subject to achievement of a performance condition determined by the Committee and described below.
The Committee has approved a condition relating to the Companys TSR over the three-year period measured from the start of the financial year in which an award is granted relative to the TSR over the same period of the companies comprising the FTSE 51150 the Comparator Group.
The TSR condition provides for vesting as follows: Vesting of Matching Awards granted to Vesting of Matching Awards granted to Company rank within the comparator group Executive Committee members other participants Within upper quartile 100% 100% At median 15% 33% Below median 0% 33% subject normally to continuing service up to the third anniversary In addition, the Committee must be satisfied that there has also been a demonstrable and sustained improvement in the Companys performance over the period.
In determining this, the Committee will take into account all relevant factors but in particular will consider improvement in the Companys financial, production and trading performance.
Adjustment to performance conditions for 2011 and subsequent awards As mentioned above, the Committee, assisted by its independent advisers PwC, conducted a review of its long-term remuneration arrangements.
This concluded that: the basic construct of the BMP remains appropriate for Drax: the maximum incentive opportunity under the BMP remains competitive and appropriate: relative TSR should remain a significant part of the performance measure for the BMP: and the performance measures on half of the matching shares under the BMP should be aligned more directly to short-term and operational performance and to the achievement of long-term strategic objectives.
The current BCS used to measure performance in respect of the annual bonus arrangements has been developed over a number of years and is a key tool for aligning reward to both business performance and strategy.
The Committee has therefore concluded that the BCS should be adapted so that it can be used for both short-term performance measurement for the assessment of annual bonus payments and as a building block in the three year assessment of performance under the BMP.
Accordingly, the following amendments will be made to the performance measures for awards made under the BMP to executives in 2011 the BMP award : 50% of the BMP award will vest based on TSR relative to the FTSE 51150 in line with the current performance condition the TSR award : and 50% of the BMP award will vest by reference to the Companys performance against the average outcome from the BCS over the three year performance period the Scorecard award.
The TSR performance condition will continue to measure TSR performance relative to companies in the FTSE 51150 over the threeyear performance period measured from the start of the financial year in which the BMP award is made.
It will also continue to be leveraged such that 0% of the TSR award will vest if Draxs TSR ranking against the FTSE 51150 at the end of the performance period is less than Median, 15% of the TSR award i. e. 7.5% of the total BMP award will vest upon achieving Median and 100% of the TSR award i. e. 50% of the total BMP award will vest upon achieving a ranking at least equal to upper quartile.
The Scorecard award will vest by reference to the average mean of the outputs of the BCS for each of the three years reported on during the performance period, commencing at the start of the financial year in which the BMP award is made.
The averaging calculation is capped although the annual result on which the three year calculation will be made will not, for this purpose, be so capped.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 66 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT It is then proposed that the Scorecard award will vest at the end of the three year performance period as follows: Average BCS outcome % of Scorecard Award vesting 1 0% 1 15% 7.5% of total BMP award 1.5 100% 50% of total BMP award Straight-line vesting between 15% and 100% for average result between 1 and 1.5.
In addition, at the end of the three year performance period the Remuneration Committee will ratify each of the annual results going into the average BCS calculation and will have the discretion to adjust the final outcome based on events over the period to ensure an outcome that is consistent with the underlying performance progression of the business.
In exercising their discretion the Committee will pay particular regard to progress against the strategic objectives incorporated in the BCS including sustainable development of biomass generation and the development of the Haven Power supply business.
For awards made to executives who are not members of the Executive Committee, one-third of the award will continue to vest on the third anniversary of the award subject to continued service, one-third will vest by reference to TSR relative to the FTSE 51150 and one-third will vest by reference to the average BCS output on the basis described above.
Pension Executive directors are entitled to membership of the Groups defined contribution pension plan.
The employers contribution for executive directors is 20% of base salary.
Contributions were and are capped by the different statutory limits applicable before and after 6 April 2006, although there is no executive director for whom contributions would mean they exceed either the lifetime or annual allowances.
Alternatively, at their option, executive directors may either have contributions of the same amounts made to their personal pension schemes or cash in lieu of pension at the stated rate and subject to normal statutory deductions.
Details of pension contributions for executive directors and of payments in lieu are included in the Directors emoluments table in Part 2 of this report.
Benefits in kind car, private medical cover, etc Car allowance The Companys policy is to offer a car allowance to executive directors and to certain senior managers, according to their role.
The annual allowance is currently: 17,500 per annum for the Chief Executive: 12,000 per annum for other executive directors: and 9,000 per annum for senior managers whose remuneration is determined by the Committee.
Life assurance Life assurance in a sum assured of four times base salary is provided for the executive directors and senior managers.
Private medical cover The Companys policy is to offer BUPA private medical cover to all employees within the Group.
The executive directors and senior managers receive medical cover for them and their dependants.
Relocation expenses and second Relocation expenses are paid where appropriate.
Second base expenses provide an allowance base expenses towards the cost of accommodation and travel when a director is required to spend a significant amount of time at two Drax locations.
Executive Share Incentive Plan Between 2006 and 2008, the Group operated the Executive Share Incentive Plan ESIP.
The ESIP is a long-term performance share plan under which executives received conditional awards of shares which vest after a three-year performance period, subject to Draxs relative TSR compared to an index of comparator companies.
The ESIP was replaced by the BMP in 2009.
Details of awards made to the executive directors under the ESIP are set out in Part 2 of this report.
The 2007 ESIP Award was due to mature on 19 April 2010.
Over the three-year performance period, Draxs TSR was below that of the index.
As a result, all awards under the 2007 ESIP award have lapsed and no shares have been transferred to participants.
It is anticipated that the 2008 ESIP Award will lapse on 14 April 2011, if the trend during the relative performance period continues.

All employee share plans The Committee operates a Savings-Related Share Option Plan SAYE and a Share Incentive Plan SIP, both of which are approved by HM Revenue & Customs and must be operated on an all employee basis.
The executive directors may participate in each plan upon the same terms as other employees.
The plans are the main vehicles for aligning staff with TSR.
SAYE The SAYE provides for the grant of options which, at the Committees discretion, may be offered at a discount of up to 20% to the market price of a share determined in accordance with the rules of the plan linked to a savings contract which pays interest at a statutory rate.
The plan was operated in 2006 and again in 2010, so that subject to the statutory upper aggregate limit of 250 per month on an individuals savings under all SAYE plans a participating employee could choose to save for either or both periods of three or five years.
The options in both 2006 and 2010 were granted at the permitted discount of 20% to the prevailing share price determined in accordance with the plan rules resulting in option prices of 636 pence per share and 310.5 pence per share respectively and may be exercised upon successful completion of the three year or five year savings contract to which they are linked.
The five year contracts under the 2006 Plan are due to mature on 1 July 2011.
The closing mid-market price of the Drax Group plc shares on 31 December 2010 was 368.3 pence per share, which is materially below the option price of 636 pence per share.
Details of the SAYE options held by the executive directors are shown in the table in Part 2 of this report.
The Committee agreed that invitations to the SAYE be made again in 2011, immediately following the preliminary results announcement.
The 20% discount to the market price is applied and participants will be able to take out SAYE contracts over three and five years and contribute in total no more than 250 per month.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 68 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT SIP In any one tax year, the Committee may operate the SIP for the benefit of participants using any combination of the following elements: award Free Shares up to 3,000 in value : allow the purchase of Partnership Shares up to 1,500 in value subject to an overriding maximum of 10% of salary : allocate free Matching Shares in a maximum ratio of two Matching Shares for each Partnership Share : and allow the investment in shares of dividends received in respect of SIP shares.
The table below details how the SIP has been operated between 2006 and 2009: 2006 2007 2008 2009 SIP Free Share Participants received Participants received 2,500 worth of shares in Participants received 1 Award 2,000 worth of shares.
Partnership Shares Participants were allowed to invest up to the maximum permitted of 1,500 subject to an overriding maximum of 10% of salary in each year.
Matching Share Partnership shares matched on a one-for-one basis in each year.
1 Award Notes: 1 The SIP Trustee was funded by the Group to purchase the required Free and Matching Shares in order to avoid any dilution.
In accordance with the plan rules, shares taken up by an employee are allocated to a trustee which holds them on behalf of the employee.
Under normal circumstances, the employee will receive the shares from the trustee without incurring a tax liability once the shares have been held in trust for five years.
The employee is entitled to receive dividends paid in respect of the shares held in trust.
Details of the shares allocated to executive directors under the SIP are shown in the table in Part 2 of this report.
The Committee decided not to operate the SIP in 2010 or 2011.
Provision of shares for share plans dilution All equity-based plans are funded through the issuance of shares, or through the purchase of shares in the marketplace through a trust, subject to an overall dilution limit for all employee share plans of no more than 10% of share capital in any ten year period and a limit of 5% of share capital in any ten year period for the Companys discretionary share plans e. g. BMP.
The current estimated dilution from subsisting awards, including executive and all employee share awards, is less than 0.5% of the shares in issue at the date of this report.
Share ownership guidelines The Company has share ownership guidelines for executives participating in its performance share plans.
They are 100% and 50% of base salary for executive directors and other senior manager ESIP BMP participants, respectively.
Those who receive shares by virtue of share plan awards or who receive deferred bonus shares must retain 50% of the net that is, after income tax and national insurance contributions shares received until the applicable guideline is reached.
No shares have vested since the introduction of the relevant performance share plan.
Governance Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2010 69 Service contracts Executive directors service agreements are of indefinite duration, terminable at any time by either party giving 12 months prior notice except that Peter Emerys contract is terminable by him providing six months notice to the Company.
Under each of the executive directors service agreements other than the Chief Executives, Drax has the right to make a payment in lieu of notice of termination, the amount of that payment being the salary and benefits that would have accrued to the executive director during the contractual notice period.
The following table shows for each person who has served as a director of the Company at any time during the year ended 31 December 2010, the commencement date and term of the service agreement or contract for services, and details of the notice periods.

External appointments The Committee recognises that executive directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies and that such appointments can broaden their knowledge and experience to the benefit of the Group.
The policy is that an executive director who accepts an external appointment having had the prior approval of the Board should retain the fees payable in respect of the appointment.
Dorothy Thompson was appointed as a non-executive director of Johnson Matthey plc with effect from 1 September 2007, and received 48,750 in fees for that appointment during 2010.
Non-executive directors The Chairman and non-executive directors receive fees in respect of their services.
They do not receive any pension or benefits in kind.
Nor are they eligible for any annual performance bonus or any of the share-based reward plans.
The Chairmans notice period is six months whilst the other non-executive directors have a notice period of one month.
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Committee whilst that of the other non-executive directors is determined by the Chairman and the executive directors.
It is designed to: recognise prevailing market rates for the Chairmans and non-executive directors fees in other listed companies of a similar market value or turnover to Drax: reflect the responsibilities and time commitment: and attract and retain individuals with the necessary skills and experience to contribute to the future growth of the Company.
Chairman The Committee determined that upon his appointment on 17 April 2008, the Chairmans remuneration should be at the annual rate of 200,000, which is reflected in the table of annualised rates of pay on page 67.
The Committee determined that the Chairman would not receive any increase in his remuneration in the review year ending on 31 March 2011.
