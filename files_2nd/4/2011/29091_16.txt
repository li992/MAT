He began to draw his pension from the Scheme on 17 April 2007.
The values shown in this table in respect of his pension benefits are notional.
The accrued pension represents the annual pension which each Director is entitled to receive at the Schemes normal retirement age 60.

Transfer values have been calculated using assumptions set by the Scheme Trustee, having taken advice from the Scheme Actuary, in accordance with the Occupational Pension Schemes Transfer Values Amendment Regulations 2008.
Transfer values increased significantly during the year as a result of the impact of low gilt yields on the discount rate.
The accrued pension and transfer values shown above do not include any allowance for additional voluntary contributions made by a Director.
