the cash element increased to 60% of the annual bonus an increase in the shareholding guideline requirement for the Chief Executive from 100% to 150% of gross base salary the introduction of a clawback provision in the LTIP whereby the Committee can recover incentive awards in the event that it is subsequently found that accounts or information relevant to performance for a vesting are shown to be materially wrong and that vesting was higher than should have been the case.
This provision has subsequently been extended to embrace situations of personal misconduct.

As a result, Simon Melliss forfeited 58,080 shares that were awarded on 1 April 2009 and 137,993 shares that were awarded on 30 April 2010.

Hammerson plc | Annual Report 2011 63 Directors report | Governance | Remuneration report Pensions Timon Drakesmith does not participate in a Company pension scheme and receives a non-pensionable salary supplement equal to 20% of his base salary.
The supplement received for the period from 30 June 2011 to 31 December 2011 was 40,222.
The former Chief Financial Officer, Simon Melliss, received a cash supplement rather than further contributions being made to the Company deferred benefit pension scheme of 64,068 for the period from 1 January 2011 to 30 June 2011, when he retired from the Board.
As stated earlier, David Atkins and Peter Cole participate in the Hammerson Group Management Pension and Life Assurance Scheme the Scheme, the Companys defined benefit pension scheme, more fully described in note 6 to the accounts on pages 85 to 87.
For the year ended 31 December 2011, David Atkins will receive a cash supplement of 64,908 for pension benefits that exceed the annual allowance of 50,000 in respect of the year ending 31 December 2011.
Peter Cole has not been affected by the annual allowance restriction and will not be receiving a cash supplement.
David Atkins pension in the Scheme is based on a 1 60th accrual rate.
This is the rate of accrual received by all members of the Scheme who joined after 1 July 1994.
Peter Coles pension has been accruing at a rate which would provide him with a pension of two-thirds of final salary at retirement should he continue to work for the Company until age 60.
This is equivalent to an accrual rate of 1 45th offered to provide competitive benefits at retirement.
Therefore neither David Atkins nor Peter Cole have made any contributions during the year.
The following tables set out information on Directors defined benefit pension entitlements and transfer values: Total accrued Increase in Increase in accrued Years benefit at accrued benefit benefit during the year Age at service at Normal retirement 31 December 2011 during the year excluding inflation 31 December 2011 31 December 2011 age 000 000 000 David Atkins 45 13 60 72 15 12 Peter Cole 52 22 60 213 19 9 For each Director, the total accrued benefit at 31 December 2011 represents the annual pension that is expected to be payable on eventual retirement, given the length of service and salary of each Director at 31 December 2011.
The increase in accrued benefit earned during the year represents the increase in this expected pension, including the effect of inflation, when compared with the position at 31 December 2010.
The increase in accrued benefit during the year excluding the effect of inflation over the year is also shown.
Requirements Companies Act 2006 The Listing Rules Transfer value at 31 December Transfer value at 31 December Value of increase in accrued Transfer value at 31 December 2010 of total accrued benefit 2011 of total accrued benefit benefit during the year 2011 of increase in accrued benefit 000 000 000 000 David Atkins 550 745 195 127 Peter Cole 2,488 2,908 420 123 All transfer values have been calculated in accordance with regulation 7 to 7E of the Occupational Pensions Schemes Transfer Values Regulations 1996 and subsequent amendments.
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the Scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the Schemes liability in respect of the Directors pension benefits.
They do not represent sums payable to individual Directors and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
For each Director, the increase in transfer value of accrued benefits under the requirements of Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 is the transfer value of the total accrued benefit at 31 December 2011 less the corresponding transfer value at 31 December 2010.
The transfer value of the increase in accrued benefits under the Listing Rules is the transfer value at 31 December 2011 of the increase in accrued benefits during the period excluding inflation.
The transfer values disclosed above do not represent the sum paid or payable to the individual Director.
Instead, they represent a potential liability of the Scheme.
