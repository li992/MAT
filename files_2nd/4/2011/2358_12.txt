Annual bonus Targets are similar to those for executives in order to create alignment, and include Group and divisional profitability, cash flow, management of land, ROIC and customer service targets.
Long Term Incentive Plan Senior management employees participate in the long-term incentive plan, with the same targets as the executive directors.
The Committee believes that this drives cohesive behaviour and the creation of long-term shareholder value.
Total Direct Remuneration The Committee believes that, as for executive directors, a significant proportion of the total remuneration package for senior management should be variable and subject to performance.
In setting the level of pay, both fixed and variable, the Committee considers both competitiveness against the external market and the internal relativities in relation to the level of pay for executive directors, and the level of pay of the wider management and wider workforce.
Pensions Senior management are eligible to participate in either the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme or the defined contribution Bovis Homes Group Personal Pension Plan.
