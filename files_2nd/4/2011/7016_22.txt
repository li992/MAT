Chairman 21 June 2011 Halma p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011 59 Report on Remuneration Strategy and Policy Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied theprinciples relating to directors remuneration in the Combined Code.
As required by the Act, a resolution to approve thereport will beproposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on certain parts of the Directors Remuneration Report and to statewhether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Accounting Regulations.
Thereport has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information Remuneration policy Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, retain and motivate executives of the high calibre needed to manage theGroupsuccessfully and align their interests with those of theshareholders by rewarding them for enhancing value to shareholders.
Theperformance measurement of the executive Directors and key members of senior management and the determination of their annualremuneration package are undertaken by the Committee.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package forexecutive Directors and senior management: Element Purpose Operation Salary To provide competitive xed remuneration that will Reviewed every 12 months.

Bonus is based on Economic Value Added.
Equity incentive Performance share plan incentivises executives to Share awards are made annually to senior executives achieve superior returns to shareholders and are based on a combination of TSR 50% and ROTIC over a three-year period.
Retain key individuals and align interests Maximum awards range from 100% to 140% with shareholders.
Pension To provide competitive post-retirement benets.
Executives may participate in either a Group dened benefit pension plan, Group dened contribution pension plan or the US 401k money purchase arrangement.
Cash supplements in lieu of Company pension contributions are made to some individuals.
The Companys policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive Directors should be performance-related.
Asdescribed below, executive Directors may earn annual bonus payments of up to 100% of their basic salary together with thebenets ofparticipation in share plans which are subject to amaximum value, in the year of grant, of 140% of basic salary.

Annual Report and Accounts 2011 60 Directors Report Governance Remuneration Report continued Basic salary An executive Directors basic salary is reviewed by the Committee against the market, Company performance and future strategy prior tothe beginning of each year and when an individual changes position or responsibility.
The Chief Executive is responsible for assessing theperformance of each senior executive taking account of the complexity of the operations under their control, their opportunities for advancement with the Group, their remuneration relative to other executives in the Group and their bonus earning potential.
He then formulates a remuneration proposal for the Committees consideration.
In deciding appropriate remuneration levels, the Committee also considers the Group as a whole and relies on objective external research which gives information on a comparator group of companies.
Basic salaries are reviewed in January February of each year with increases, if appropriate, taking effect from 1 April.
Executive Directors contracts of service which include details of remuneration will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
Annual bonus payments During the year the Committee carefully assessed existing incentive arrangements and determined that incentive levels are appropriately set.
The Committee establishes the economic value added EVA objectives that must be met for each financial year if a cash bonus is to be paid.
In setting appropriate bonus parameters the Committee has determined that bonuses of approximately 60% of salary are payable on the achievement of targeted levels of growth.
The maximum performance-related bonus that can be paid is 100% of basic annual salary.
Executive Director bonus payments for 2011 were 1,127,000 versus 322,000 in the prior year reecting the Groups improved performance in terms of reported profit and EVA.
This performance-related bonus plan, which applies to executive Directors and Divisional Chief Executives, is reviewed annually by the Committee and approved by the Board.
In the case of a Divisional Chief Executive a bonus is earned if the profit of the Division for which he is responsible exceeds a target calculated from the profits of the three preceding financial years.
The profits calculated for this purpose regard each Division as a standalone group of companies charging it with the cost of capital it utilises including the cost of acquisitions.
For the Chief Executive and Finance Director, bonuses are calculated as above but based on Group profit exceeding a target calculated from the profits for the three preceding financial years after charging cost of capital, including the cost of acquisitions.

Transitional provisions exist for divisional restructuring to ensure Divisional Chief Executives remain appropriately incentivised.
Subsidiary directors participate in bonus arrangements similar to those established for senior executives.
Performance share plan PSP The Directors have long believed that share plans are an excellent way to align the interests of senior management with those of shareholders and that share plans provide excellent motivation.
The Committee, recognising the need to assess and evaluate such incentives, adopted aperformance share plan following shareholder approval at the 2005 annual general meeting: this Plan replaced the existing share option plans in respect of future share awards.
The Committee has responsibility for supervising the Plan and the grants under its terms.
TheCommittee believes that any incentive compensation awarded should be tied to the interests of the Companys shareholders and that the principal measure of those interests is Total Shareholder Return.
