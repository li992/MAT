Remuneration report This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to Directors remuneration in the UK Corporate Governance Code.
As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company, at which the Financial Statements will be approved.
The Act requires the Auditor to report to the Companys members on certain parts of the Directors Remuneration Report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Accounting Regulations.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.

Executive Directors remuneration The Groups remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages which ensure that Directors and senior managers are fairly and responsibly rewarded for their contributions.
The aim is to provide remuneration packages which are sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the quality required to achieve the Groups objectives and thereby enhance shareholder value.
The committee takes account of the level of remuneration paid to Executive Directors and senior managers of comparable public companies and best practice standards.
It is the intention that this policy will continue to apply for 2012 and subsequent years subject to ongoing review as appropriate.
The main details of the Executive Directors Service Agreements relating to base salary, annual bonus, share plan awards, pensions and other benefits for 2011 are as set out below.
51 Corporate governance Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2011 2011 January 2011 February 2011 March 2011 April 2011 May 2011 June 2011 July 2011 August 2011 September 2011 October 2011 November 2011 December Remuneration report continued Service Agreements The Service Agreements for the Executive Directors are for no fixed term and may in normal circumstances be terminated by either party on giving six months notice.
The Company reserves the right and discretion to pay the Executive Director in lieu of notice.
If the Company terminates the employment of an Executive Director by exercising its right to pay in lieu of notice, the Company is required to make a payment equal to the aggregate of basic salary and the cost to the Company of providing other contractual benefits which excludes bonus for the unexpired portion of the duration of any entitlement to notice.
If, within 12 months of a change of control, the Company terminates the employment of an Executive Director in breach of the terms of his Service Agreement in circumstances where the Company is not entitled to terminate the Executive Directors employment, the Executive Director will be entitled to payment of a fixed sum equal to six months base salary not including accrued bonus.
In return for the payment of such a fixed sum, the Executive Director agrees to waive, release and discharge any entitlement to further or additional compensation of any kind whatsoever.
Date of contract Notice period James Menzies 29 11 06 Six months Mike Buck 29 11 06 Six months Jonathan Copus 31 10 11 Six months Nick Cooper resigned on 31 May 2011 29 11 06 Six months Salary The annual base salaries of the Executive Directors for the year to 31 December 2011 were as follows: Salary s James Menzies 391,400 Mike Buck 288,400 Jonathan Copus 250,000 Nick Cooper resigned on 31 May 2011 288,400 The salary of each Executive Director is subject to regular review by the Remuneration Committee and such a review took place in January 2012.
During the review, a 5% salary increase for James Menzies and Mike Buck, and a 10% salary increase for Jonathan Copus, were agreed by the Remuneration Committee for the year to 31 December 2012.
When determining the salary of the Executive Directors the committee takes into consideration: the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills, in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity, in particular the levels of base salary at those comparable companies within the FTSE Oil & Gas Producers sector and the comparator group: the performance of the individual Executive Director: the individual Executive Directors experience and responsibilities: and pay and conditions throughout the Company.
Bonus Each of the Executive Directors is eligible for a discretionary annual bonus up to a maximum of 100% of their base salary.
The bonus may only be payable to the extent that individual and corporate performance targets set by the Remuneration Committee are achieved in the relevant year.
52 Corporate governance Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2011 Bonus continued Executive bonus levels are assessed on the level of the Companys performance against financial, operational and strategic targets.
These may include, but are not limited to : share price performance: reserves replacement: execution of planned exploration drilling programme: HSE performance: financial performance: and production growth.
Considering the above, the Remuneration Committee assessed that an award of 60% of the maximum bonus potential was appropriate when judging by the achievements of the executive team against the above priorities and when looking at a broader picture of the Companys performance over the period.
The general targets for the annual bonus plan are reviewed and agreed by the Remuneration Committee each year to ensure that they are appropriate to the current position of the Company.
The committee is in no doubt that in the current economic environment, achieving substantial progress in these priority areas will continue to be extremely challenging.
Non-executive Directors do not participate in any bonus arrangements.
Pay and conditions across the Group Consideration has also been given to general pay and employment conditions across the Group.
The Group operates in a number of different countries and has many employees who perform a diverse range of jobs.
Therefore, although it is difficult to take into account pay and employment conditions across the Group specifically when setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors: all employees, including the Directors, are paid by reference to the market rate: consistently high performance is rewarded through a number of performance related bonus schemes across the Group: the Group offers internal promotion opportunities: the Group offers employment conditions which are commensurate with a UK listed company including high standards of health and safety and equal opportunity policies: the Group offers a range of benefits depending on employee location including pension, flexible benefits, paid annual leave and healthcare insurance: and the Company believes that share plans are important to align the interests of employees and shareholders.
Therefore, the Company offers the following employee share plans: the Performance Share Plan, open to Executive Directors and senior management: and the Deferred Share Plan as approved by the shareholders at the 2009 Annual General Meeting, open to all other employees.
The Remuneration Committee will continue to assess these and other matters, such as the prevailing market conditions, when determining levels of remuneration for Executive Directors.
53 Corporate governance Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2011 Remuneration report continued Performance Share Plan In accordance with the Companys Performance Share Plan PSP and at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, all eligible employees including Executive Directors may be awarded share options in the Company, the vesting of which are subject to conditions as set out in this report awards.
The committee supervises the operation of the PSP including the levels of awards made to employees and Executive Directors.
As approved by the shareholders at the 2009 Annual General Meeting, a new deferred bonus scheme replaced the PSP for certain employees but not Directors, recognising that the PSP continuing to apply to all employees was not appropriate.
The PSP remains the sole long term incentive arrangement for all Executive Directors.
During the year, as approved by the shareholders at the 2010 Annual General Meeting, the individual limit in the PSP was increased.
The PSP was first adopted when the Company listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2006.
When it was adopted, the PSP was structured so as to provide a competitive long term incentive compared to other companies of a similar size Salamander initially listed within the FTSE Small Cap, and with the features conforming to prevailing market practice and best practice at that time.
In 2010, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the operation of the PSP in the context of Salamander as a FTSE 250 constituent and concluded that, in order to remain competitive relative to the market, changes to its operation for 2010 and future years were required, namely, an increase to the individual limit in the PSP to 200% of salary p. a.
The PSP is operated in line with: awards are made annually to Executive Directors worth up to 200% of salary which is the maximum grant limit except where the Remuneration Committee deems it necessary to grant a higher award in specific circumstances.
Other senior management were also granted awards at a lower percentage of salary.
In 2009, the Remuneration Committee decided to amend its policy of granting awards to the whole workforce, and limited participation in the PSP to senior executives: the vesting of awards is subject to a relative total shareholder return TSR performance condition, comparing Salamanders TSR performance to that of a selected group of other listed Oil & Gas Exploration & Production companies, measured over three years: and 30% of awards vest for median performance, and awards vest in full for upper quartile performance with a sliding scale between the two points.
The PSP is intended to facilitate the retention and incentivisation of employees of the Group and to align their interests with those of shareholders by enabling employees, including Executive Directors, to receive shares in Salamander, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions and continued employment.
Accordingly, the Remuneration Committee believes that the PSP provides an appropriate degree of flexibility in the way in which a share based incentive arrangement can be operated by the Group, while giving due consideration to best and market practice.
Awards vest on or following the third anniversary of the date of grant once the committee has determined the extent to which the applicable performance condition see below has been satisfied and provided the participant remains an employee with the Group.
Awards, once vested, will normally remain capable of exercise for a period of 12 months.
54 Corporate governance Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2011 Performance Share Plan continued Awards granted to all employees, including the Executive Directors, will vest based on Salamanders performance against an industry-specific peer group of companies drawn from the constituents of the FTSE 250, FTSE Small Cap and AIM listed companies in the Oil and Gas Producers sector with market capitalisations in excess of 100 million at or around the date of grant.
The comparator groups for the 2011 and 2010 awards were: 2011 Awards 2010 Awards Afren Heritage Oil Afren Ithaca Energy Aurelian Energy Ithaca Energy Bankers Petroleum JKX Oil & Gas plc Bowleven JKX Oil & Gas Bowleven Melrose Resources plc Cairn Energy Jubilant Energy Cairn Energy Petroceltic Coastal Energy Melrose Resources Coastal Energy Premier Oil Cove Energy Nautical Petroleum Dana Petroleum plc Regal Petroleum Encore Petroceltic Dragon Oil Serica Energy Enquest Premier Oil Enquest SOCO International Faroe Petroleum San Leon Geopark Holdings Sterling Energy Geopark Holdings SOCO International Gulf Keystone Tullow Oil Gulf Keystone Tullow Oil Gulfsands Petroleum Valiant Petroleum Gulfsands Petroleum Valiant Petroleum Heritage Petroleum Awards vest as follows in relation to Salamanders relative TSR performance over the performance period: if Salamander is ranked below median, none of the award will vest: for a ranking position of median, 30% of the award will vest: for a ranking position of upper quartile or better, full vesting 100% of the award will occur: and for a ranking between median and upper quartile, there will be straight line vesting between 30% and 100%.
Hewitt New Bridge Street carried out a performance monitoring exercise in respect of the awards made on 28 March 2008 under the terms of the Salamander Performance Share Plan.
Their calculations were carried out to 27 March 2011, the end of the performance period for these awards and therefore represented final results.
As noted above, these awards were subject to a TSR performance condition relative to the 2011 comparator group over a performance period.
Based on Salamanders TSR and ranking being between median and upper quartile, the awards vested at 62.53% of the number of awards granted on 28 March 2008.
The market price on vesting of the awards was 2.822365.
Details of the Directors interests further to the vesting of this award are set out later in this Remuneration Report.
At 31 December 2011, a total of 4,676,140 awards of options over ordinary shares representing 3.0% of the Companys issued share capital of 154,797,171 ordinary shares at the year end were outstanding and granted to eligible employees including the Executive Directors.
Further information regarding share based payments is included in note 28 to the consolidated Financial Statements.
Benefits Executive Directors receive a defined pension contribution or salary supplement in lieu of pension contributions equal to 15% of their salary, private medical cover and life assurance of up to four times salary.
55 Corporate governance Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2011 Remuneration report continued Non-executive Directors remuneration The Companys policy on Non-executive Directors remuneration is to set compensation at a level which is sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate high quality non-executives and to be consistent with best practice standards.

The salary and benefits reported above for Mike Buck include his net expatriate salary grossed up for income tax payable in his host country, and other expatriate benefits.
As a result of Singapore tax legislation, Mike Buck is no longer able to claim an exemption on income earned based on time spent outside of the country.
As a result, his benefits have been grossed up at the higher rate of applicable income tax.
2 Jonathan Copus received a bonus of 155,000 during 2011, being a signing on bonus of 30,000 and a performance bonus of 125,000.
3 Included in the benefits above are pension contributions of 125,909 2010: 141,000.
However, participants who are granted nominal cost options under the PSP are required to pay the Company the nominal value of 0.10 for each share issued upon the exercise of the option.
2 The committee considers the interests of shareholders when deciding on how the PSP is operated and ensures that no individual is granted excessive levels of awards, taking into consideration the overall quantum and structure of that individuals compensation package.
In circumstances where the committee considers it appropriate to do so, including the recruitment or retention of an employee or Executive Director, the committee may exceed the normal 200% limit at its discretion.
3 The aggregate value of awards granted in 2008 by the committee to Mike Buck Chief Operating Officer was equivalent to 200% of his base annual salary, reflecting his increased operational responsibilities and contribution to the Groups performance.
4 The highest and lowest closing prices of the Companys shares during the year were 1.82 and 3.18 respectively.
The mid-market price of the Companys shares at 31 December 2011 was 2.02.
5 During 2010 Hewitt New Bridge Street carried out a performance monitoring exercise in respect of the awards made on 5 October 2007 under the terms of the Salamander Energy Performance Share Plan.
These awards were subject to a total shareholder return performance condition relative to a comparator group over a performance period and accordingly vested at 91.79% of the number of awards granted on 5 October 2007.
The market price on vesting of the awards was 2.5289.
The Executive Directors exercised the full award vested, receiving ordinary shares after selling shares sufficient to cover the cost of the option price and tax resulting from the exercise of the vested awards.
No other options lapsed or were exercised during the year.
6 During 2011 Hewitt New Bridge Street carried out a performance monitoring exercise in respect of the awards made on 28 March 2008 under the terms of the Salamander Energy Performance Share Plan.
