When determining executive remuneration, the Committee takes careful account of pay and employment conditions in the Company as a whole.
The current salaries for Executive Directors are set out below, and will be increased with eff ect from 1 April 2012 as indicated in the table below: 2011 salary 2012 salary Executive Director % increase David Fischel 495,000 520,000 5.1% Matthew Roberts 365,000 400,000 9.6% Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC Overview Business model Business Financial Corporate Governance Accounts Other Annual Report 2011 77 and strategy review review responsibility information Short-term incentive Performance measures In 2011, the performance measures for the short-term incentive were weighted as illustrated by the following diagram: Growth in adjusted EPS 22% Relative Property Capital Return vs. IPD Retail Index 22% Growth in NAV per share plus dividends 22% Strategic and Operational Objectives 34% Performance against each of the measures for the 2011 short-term incentive arrangements is summarisedbelow: Remuneration 2011 Committee Performance element performance assessment Growth in NAV per share dividends reinvested 3.9% Below target Relative Property Capital Return 1.0% Above target Growth in EPS 7.1% Above target Strategic and Operational Objectives The Committee considered that performance during the year against Strategic and Operational Objectives exceeded expectations and noted the following achievements in particular: Strong operational performance against key metrics Like-for-like growth in net rental income of 3.6 per cent Footfall growth of 2 per cent High occupancy at 97 per cent 2010 98 per cent Successful integration and management re-organisation of The Traff ord Centre Successful acquisition of Broadmarsh Shopping Centre, Nottingham Progress with active management projects extensions Securing a new 375 million revolving credit facility Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC 78 Annual Report 2011 Directors remuneration report continued Individual short-term incentive outcomes A participants bonus is also based on the CEOs Remuneration Committees assessment of their individual contribution to the Groups performance during the year and the achievement of speci c individual objectives, which are determined and communicated at the start of each year, and include key strategic, financial and operational goals.
For 2011, David Fischel and Matthew Roberts each received a total short-term incentive award of 125 per cent of salary.
Deferral into shares 84 per cent of the 2011 short-term incentive for both David Fischel and Matthew Roberts was deferred into CSC shares.
Employees must remain in employment with the Company for a period of two years after the date of award before such shares are released.
Previously the approach was two-thirds deferred for two years and one-third deferred for four years.
However, the Committee feels that this is too long when considered in conjunction with the high proportion of short-term incentive which is deferred.
Short-term incentives in 2012 For 2012, the Remuneration Committee intends to continue operating the short-term incentive arrangement as outlined above.
TheCommittee reviews the short-term incentive arrangements prior to the start of each year, including performance measure selection, calibration oftargets and respective weighting, to ensure they remain aligned with shareholders interests.
Long-term incentive ESOS In March 2011, David Fischel and Matthew Roberts received market value share option grants with a face value of c. 270 per cent and c. 260 per 1 cent of salary, respectively.
These long-term incentive grant sizes are lower quartile relative to FTSE 200 property REITs.
The Committee was concerned that the normal option grant size of 200 per cent of salary is bottom quartile relative to FTSE 200 property REITs.
When considered against the experience and contribution of the Executive Directors, the Committee determined it appropriate to grant awards above the normal limit, particularly as it is concerned that the objectives of the Remuneration Policy are not being met.
Also, the Committee was particularly mindful of feedback received from some shareholders in May 2011 regarding the use of exceptional ESOS grants in both 2009 and 2010.
A summary of the circumstances is provided below: 2009 circumstances There had been no option grants since 2004 There were no other long-term incentives in place 2010 circumstances The demerger of Capital & Counties took place and the Remuneration Committee was anxious to ensure that CSC and Capco employees were treated equitably with regard to variable pay Given the above, the Committee believes it important to review the current long-term incentive arrangements together with all aspects of executive remuneration policy and other reward schemes in 2012, with the aim of implementing any changes in 2013.
However, the Committee considered that in the meantime, grant levels for the Executive Directors in 2012 should be set at the normal Scheme limit of 200 per cent of salary.
The sliding scale will be for three-year EPS growth ranging from 4 per cent p. a. to 6 per cent p. a.
100 per cent vests for growth of 6 per cent p. a. or higher: 33 per cent vests for growth of 4 per cent p. a. : awards vest on a straight-line basis for performance between these levels.
Awards will lapse for growth of less than 4 per cent p. a.
Full details of historical ESOS grants are provided in the table on page 83.
Note, on a change-of-control or in the case of a good leaver, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to permit early vesting of ESOS awards and pro-rate for time and performance, as appropriate.
1 Comparison carried out on an expected value basis: assumed one performance share a long-term incentive structure typically used by the comparators is equivalent to two share options, i. e. 200 per cent of salary in options is equivalent to 100 per cent of salary in performance shares.

Exercise price following adjustment in respect of demerger in 2010.
Pre-adjustment exercise prices were: 2004 698 pence: 2009 359 pence.
The Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion to waive the performance conditions in respect of Mrs Chaldecotts options granted in 2009, 2010 and 2011.
The standard performance condition for options granted between 2004 and 2011 is as follows: The Companys smoothed earnings are to grow over a three-year period at a rate in excess of 5 per cent per annum compound.
Smoothed earnings means the percentage increase in underlying earnings per share, adjusted by a excluding exceptional and valuation items and b limiting trading or non-recurring items to 10 per cent of pro t before tax.
The base gure for comparison purposes in respect of both the 2009 and 2010 option grants is the smoothed earnings achieved, after adjustment for the demerger, as at 31 December 2009 adjusted earnings per share 15.1 pence.
Therefore the performance condition cannot be satis ed until the outcome of 2012 year end.
The base gure for comparison purposes in respect of the 2011 option grant is the smoothed earnings as at 31 December 2010 adjusted earnings per share 15.4 pence.
As noted above, the performance condition for grants of options in 2012 and thereafter will be based on a sliding scale of EPS performance.
The market price of Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC ordinary shares as at 31 December 2011 was 312 pence and during the year the price varied between 289 pence and 425 pence.
The interests of Directors in conditional awards of ordinary shares under the annual bonus scheme are detailed in note 51 on pages 128 and 129.
