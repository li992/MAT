measures for Group Divisional Directors from 2011.
These measures were originally set at 75% AEPS and 25% on relative TSR.
We have reduced the AEPS weighting to 37.5% and introduced a Divisional EBITA target with 37.5% weighting.
The Committee believes this better reflects their individual, as well as Group responsibilities.
The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director remain on 75% AEPS and 25% TSR for all five cycles.
The divisional targets for the third and fourth cycles for the Wood Group PSN division were set post completion to reflect the new combined business.
It was also agreed that for certain executives mainly those joining from PSN, the third cycle would be a two year cycle covering 2011-12.
