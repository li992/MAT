Unaudited Information Continued Long-Term Incentives Introduction In order to encourage executive directors and other selected senior employees to deliver superior levels of long-term performance for the benefit of shareholders, the Companys policy since 1999 has been to provide these individuals with share incentives under an LTIP.
The current arrangement is the Cairn Energy PLC Long Term Incentive Plan 2009 2009 LTIP, which was approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 19 May 2009.
As of 1 February 2012 there are no awards outstanding under any other LTIPs.
In 2011, the three-year performance period applicable to certain awards granted under the 2006 LTIP and Replacement LTIP as defined below came to an end 59% of the Cairn India Awards granted in May 2008 under the 2006 LTIP vested, while full vesting 133% of the Awards granted in May 2008 under the Replacement LTIP occurred.
The extent to which the relevant performance conditions had been met is explained in full on page 83.
2009 LTIP The 2009 LTIP enables Executive Directors and selected senior employees to be granted conditional awards over ordinary shares, the vesting of which is normally dependent on both continued employment with the Group and the extent to which pre-determined performance conditions are met over a specified period of three years.
The scheme is intended to incentivise the participants to create shareholder value whilst retaining due focus on the underlying financial performance of the Group and to align their interests more closely with those of shareholders.
The value of ordinary shares awarded to a participant under the 2009 LTIP in any financial year is subject to a limit of 300% of his her basic salary although a 400% of salary limit can be applied to an individual by the Remuneration Committee in exceptional circumstances.
Details of the outstanding awards granted to the Executive Directors under the 2009 LTIP are set out on page 81.
On the vesting of an award under the 2009 LTIP, only 50% of the ordinary shares to which the holder has become entitled are released to him her immediately, with the remaining 50% normally being released after a further period of one year.
No amounts due under the 2009 LTIP are recognised as remuneration until the award has vested and the ordinary shares released.
The extent to which awards vest will be determined by comparing the growth in TSR of the Company over a three year performance period, with the TSR of a comparator group, currently comprising 17 international oil and gas companies.
In order to encourage exceptional performance at upper decile levels a multiplier is applied which is subject to the achievement of stretching absolute TSR growth targets.
The vesting of awards will then take place as follows: ranking of company against the comparator group percentage of ordinary shares comprised in Award that vest Below median 0% Median 20% Upper decile i. e. top 10% 100% Between median and upper decile 20% 100% on a straight line basis Should the Company achieve upper decile performance against the comparator group the following multiplier is applied: Multiplier applied to determine the number of ordinary shares that actually vest tsr of the company over the performance period 1 50% or less 1.33 100% or more 1 1.33 on a straight line basis Between 50% and 100% However, notwithstanding the performance of the Company against the above targets, no part of any award will vest unless the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that there has been an overall satisfactory and sustained improvement in the performance of the Company as a whole over the performance period.
2009 LTIP awards granted in 2012 and later years will also be subject to a clawback provision.
The details of this are currently being considered by the Remuneration Committee and will be disclosed in next years Annual Report.
Page 84 contains a detailed description of the LTIP comparator group and the performance conditions that will determine the extent to which these awards vest at the end of the applicable performance period.
For awards made in future years, the Remuneration Committee will review, and may amend, the performance conditions used for this arrangement in order to ensure they remain appropriate, challenging and in line with best practice investor guidelines.
The committee has not made any changes to the performance conditions attaching to the LTIP awards granted in 2012 save in respect of adjustments to the members of the comparator group.

Unaudited Information Continued Long-Term Incentives Introduction continued Other LTIPs Formerly Used During the year, Executive Directors also held outstanding awards under the following historic share incentive arrangements operated by the Company: h The Cairn Energy PLC Long Term Incentive Plan 2006 2006 LTIP.
h The Cairn Energy PLC Replacement Long Term Incentive Plan Replacement LTIP.
Summaries of the 2006 LTIP and Replacement LTIP are provided below.
As of 1 February 2012, there are no outstanding awards or shares due to be released under these LTIPs.
2006 LTIP The 2006 LTIP was approved by shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting EGM held on 17 November 2006, conditional on the flotation of Cairn India becoming effective, which occurred on 9 January 2007.
Following the adoption of the 2009 LTIP, no further awards have been or will be granted under the 2006 LTIP.
The date of grant of the last award under the 2006 LTIP was 7 July 2008.
The 2006 LTIP enabled Executive Directors and selected senior employees to be granted conditional awards over two separate pools of notional units, the first relating to Cairn India Cairn India Units and the second relating to the Capricorn Group Capricorn Units together, Units.
As explained in the previous years Directors Remuneration Report, all participants in this arrangement who held awards over Capricorn Units Capricorn Awards surrendered those rights in exchange for the grant of Converted Awards over ordinary shares in the Company pursuant to the Replacement LTIP further details of which are provided below, with the number of ordinary shares subject to each such Converted Award being calculated by reference to an implied valuation of the Capricorn Group derived from the 2009 farm-in to its Greenland assets by PETRONAS.
The above conversion process did not, however, apply to outstanding awards over Cairn India Units Cairn India Awards.
As a result, these awards held by the Executive Directors and a number of senior managers continued to subsist on their original terms.
The extent to which a Cairn India Award vests is normally dependent on continued employment within the Group and the extent to which predetermined performance conditions relating to CIL are met over a specified period.
Following the vesting of a Cairn India Award, the participant becomes entitled to such number of ordinary shares in the Company as have a market value equal to the aggregate price of the vested Units.
For the purposes of the 2006 LTIP, the price of a Cairn India Unit on any day is equal to the price of a Cairn India share, as quoted on the BSE and the NSE of India.
Only 50% of these ordinary shares are transferred to the participant immediately, with the remaining 50% normally being subject to a further holding period.
Information in relation to the Cairn India Awards held by the Executive Directors, together with details of those awards that vested during 2011, are set out on pages 81 to 83.
A summary of the applicable performance conditions is provided on page 85.
As highlighted on page 75, the holding period applicable to the Cairn India Awards that vested during 2011 which was originally intended to last one year was subsequently terminated with effect from 30 January 2012.
Replacement LTIP The Replacement LTIP was approved by shareholders at an EGM on 21 December 2009 and, as explained above, was used to grant Converted Awards over ordinary shares to those participants in the 2006 LTIP who accepted an invitation to surrender their Capricorn Awards.
These Converted Awards were granted on 22 December 2009.
No awards were granted under the Replacement LTIP during 2011 and no further awards will be granted pursuant to this arrangement in the future.
Converted Awards comprise conditional rights to acquire ordinary shares, the vesting of which is normally dependent both on continued employment with the Group and on the extent to which pre-determined performance conditions are met over a specified period of three years.
The form of these performance conditions, and the period over which they are measured, mirrors those that applied to the replaced Capricorn Awards.
On the vesting of a Converted Award, any ordinary shares to which the holder becomes entitled are subject to an extended holding period during which they cannot be sold save to meet tax liabilities arising on vesting.
Where a participant ceases employment with the Group during the above holding period his her unreleased ordinary shares are normally forfeited for no consideration.
Exceptions to this general forfeiture principle are at the Remuneration Committees discretion but are usually limited to good leaver circumstances.
In addition, if prior to the end of the holding period, events occur which cause the Remuneration Committee to consider that the implied value of the Capricorn Group used as part of the conversion process see above was materially overstated as at the date on which the conversion took place, then a proportion of a participants unreleased ordinary shares may be forfeited for no consideration.
In these circumstances, the number of ordinary shares to be forfeited would be decided by the Remuneration Committee on such fair and equitable basis as it may determine at the relevant time.
Information in relation to the Converted Awards held by Executive Directors, together with details of those awards that vested during 2011, are set out on pages 82 to 84.
A summary of the applicable performance conditions is provided on page 86.
As explained on page 75 of this report, the holding period applicable to all Converted Awards that had vested under the Replacement LTIP in 2011 and earlier years which was originally intended to last until 9 January 2013 was subsequently terminated with effect from 30 January 2012.

Unaudited Information Continued Long-Term Incentives Events Occurring After the End of the Financial year to 31 December 2011 Impact of 2012 Return of Cash At a general meeting held on 30 January 2012, shareholders approved a US$3.5 billion return of cash by means of a B share structure with a connected share capital consolidation.
As explained in the Circular dated 10 January 2012 that was sent to shareholders convening the general meeting, the impact of this return of cash on outstanding awards granted under the Companys LTIPs was as follows: 2006 LTIP and Replacement LTIP As at 30 January 2012, all awards under the 2006 LTIP and the Replacement LTIP had already vested in accordance with the terms of the applicable performance conditions.
As a result, any outstanding entitlements of participants in these plans related to shares that were subject to a post-vesting holding period.
In the case of the 2006 LTIP, the vested shares were due to be released in December 2012 one year after the date of vesting and in the case of the Replacement LTIP, in January 2013.
The Remuneration Committee sought legal advice on the impact of the return of cash on these outstanding entitlements and was advised that the rules of the 2006 LTIP and Replacement LTIP contained a discretionary power that it could consider invoking in these circumstances to terminate the applicable holding periods.
After careful consideration, the Remuneration Committee concluded that it would be appropriate for the above discretionary power to be exercised with effect from and conditionally upon the passing of the appropriate resolution at the shareholder meeting approving the return of cash.
In reaching this decision, the committee took into account the following matters: h Change in the nature of the business The Remuneration Committee concluded that it would be inappropriate for the relevant participants to continue to have the value of their awards locked into a business that, as a consequence of the Vedanta transaction return of cash, was radically different to the one that had existed at the time the original holding period requirement was imposed.
h Alignment with treatment of shareholders The termination of the holding periods allowed the relevant individuals to participate fully in the return of cash in respect of their award shares and also gave them the freedom to decide on the ongoing level of holding they wished to maintain in the post transaction Company.
This ensured that, in respect of their shares that had already been earned on the vesting of awards, participants in the 2006 LTIP and Replacement LTIP were able to receive the same benefit, and enjoy the same investment flexibility, as all other shareholders.
h Decreasing relevance of the clawback mechanism The clawback mechanism in the rules of the Replacement LTIP provided for forfeiture to be applied where the committee subsequently became aware of any event or circumstance that i had occurred or existed at the time the awards over Capricorn Units were originally converted into awards over Cairn shares: and ii led the committee to conclude that the Capricorn valuation used for the purpose of the conversion process was materially overstated at that time.
The committee agreed that no events or circumstances of this kind had been identified as at January 2012 and it was now highly unlikely that any additional matters would come to light in the period to January 2013.
It was therefore concluded that there was a very remote possibility of the clawback provisions actually being applied in practice.
2009 LTIP Participants in the 2009 LTIP, all of whom held unvested awards, were not eligible to participate in the return of cash.
In addition, and as a consequence of the share capital consolidation, no adjustment was made to the terms of these entitlements with the result that they continue to subsist over the same number of shares and subject to the same performance conditions.
Grant of Share Award to Sir Bill Gammell In the Circular to shareholders convening the general meeting for 30 January 2012 the Company proposed a resolution seeking shareholder approval for a share award to Sir Bill Gammell to recognise his leadership of the deal negotiations with Vedanta and his delivery of the disposal of 40% of Cairn India to Vedanta prior to the longstop date.
The share award was to take the form of an option to acquire 940,321 ordinary shares at nominal value with the award vesting in full on the third anniversary of its date of grant.
Following consultation with several institutional shareholders and their representative bodies in connection with the proposed award, the Board withdrew the resolution from consideration at the general meeting and has now determined not to pursue the proposed award.
Meetings with shareholders will be held in April 2012 to close out this matter and to discuss the Remuneration Report.
Pension Arrangements The Company operates a defined contribution group personal pension plan in the UK.
The scheme is non-contributory and all UK permanent employees are eligible to participate.
The Company contributes 10% of basic annual salary 15% in respect of senior executives on behalf of all qualifying employees.

Unaudited Information Continued Payments in Connection with Cessation of Executive Directors Employment During 2011 During the year, and in anticipation of the Companys future requirements following completion of the part sale of its shareholding in Cairn India to Vedanta, it was decided to reduce the size of the Board with the result that the positions of Chief Operating Officer and Engineering and Operations Director became redundant.
As a consequence, Malcolm Thoms and Phil Tracy stood down from the Board and left the Companys employment on 30 June 2011.
Sir Bill Gammell stood down as Chief Executive and following consultation with the Companys major shareholders, took over as Non-Executive Chairman from Norman Murray.
Sir Bill also agreed to continue as Chairman of Cairn India and retained overall responsibility for the Vedanta transaction.
All of these changes took effect on 1 July 2011.
Sir Bill subsequently resigned as Chairman and a Non-Executive Director of Cairn India following completion of the sale by the Company of 40% of the fully diluted share capital of Cairn India to Vedanta in December 2011.
Details of the payments made in connection with the above cessations of employment, all of which were made following detailed legal advice obtained by the Company, are set out below: Malcolm Thoms and Phil Tracy Both Malcolm Thoms and Phil Tracy received on termination of their employment and in settlement of their contractual entitlements, a payment of salary and benefits in lieu of their contractual notice period of one year Malcolm Thoms: 466,000: and Phil Tracy: 468,000 and a cash bonus under the Companys Annual Cash Bonus Scheme Malcolm Thoms: 200,000: and Phil Tracy: 200,000.
They also received enhanced redundancy payments in line with the Companys established custom and practice i. e. four weeks pay for each year of service, pro-rated for part-years Malcolm Thoms: 633,000: and Phil Tracy: 254,000.
These payments reflected periods of continuous employment of 22 years in the case of Malcolm Thoms and nine years in the case of Phil Tracy.
The settlements with each of them were recorded in compromise agreements.
Sir Bill Gammell Sir Bill Gammell received on termination of his employment and in settlement of his contractual entitlements, a payment of salary and benefits in lieu of his contractual notice period of one year 770,000 and a cash bonus under the Companys Annual Cash Bonus Scheme of 625,000.
Redundancy compensation was not paid as the position of Chief Executive was not redundant.
The settlement with Sir Bill was recorded in a compromise agreement.
In addition to the above, each of Malcolm Thoms, Phil Tracy and Sir Bill Gammell were considered to be good leavers for the purposes of the Companys various share incentive plans in which they participated.
All Employee Share Schemes Share Incentive Plan 2010 In order to encourage increased levels of long-term share ownership amongst its general employee population, the Company launched an HM Revenue and Customs approved share incentive plan SIP in April 2010.
The SIP provides eligible employees, including the Executive Directors, with the following benefits: h Partnership shares employees can authorise deductions of up to 1,500 per tax year from pre-tax salary, which are then used to acquire ordinary shares on their behalf.
h Matching shares the Company can award further free shares to all participants who acquire partnership shares on the basis of up to two matching shares for every one partnership share purchased.
For the tax year 2011 2012, the Company awarded two matching shares for every one partnership share purchased and intends to continue using this award ratio for the tax year 2012 2013. h Free shares employees can be given up to 3,000 worth of ordinary shares free in each tax year.
On 20 June 2011, an award of free shares was made to employees, including the Executive Directors.
As the SIP is an all-employee arrangement, no performance conditions are imposed in relation to any matching or free shares awarded pursuant to its terms.

The total number of shares held by each of the current executive directors under the SIP is included in their beneficial shareholdings disclosed in the directors report on page 56.
The Company does not have a policy regarding executive shareholding requirements.
Share Option Schemes for Other Employees Introduction The Company currently operates the following share option schemes for employees below senior management level.
h 2009 Approved Share Option Plan 2009 Approved Option Plan h 2009 Unapproved Share Option Plan 2009 Unapproved Option Plan h Replacement Share Option Plan Replacement Option Plan h 2003 Approved Share Option Plan 2003 Option Plan h 2002 Unapproved Share Option Plan 2002 Option Plan h 1996 Second Share Option Scheme 1996 Option Scheme Brief summaries of these arrangements are set out below.
It should, however, be noted that none of the Companys Executive Directors participate in any of the above schemes and it is not intended that options will be granted to them under these arrangements in the future.
2009 Approved Option Plan and 2009 Unapproved Option Plan The 2009 Approved Option Plan and the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan, both of which were approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 19 May 2009, are used to grant market value options to less senior employees of the Group.
The principal difference between these two arrangements is that the approval of HM Revenue and Customs was sought and obtained for the 2009 Approved Option Plan, whereas no such approval was sought in relation to the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan.
Options granted under the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan and 2009 Approved Option Plan are normally exercisable between three and ten years following their grant but only if and to the extent that specified performance conditions have been satisfied.
The value of ordinary shares over which options may be granted to a participant under the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan and 2009 Approved Option Plan in any financial year is subject to a limit of 200% of his her basic salary although a 300% of salary limit can be applied to an individual by the Remuneration Committee in exceptional circumstances.
The first options under the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan and 2009 Approved Option Plan were granted on 29 May 2009, with further awards being made to selected employees during 2010 and 2011.
A summary of the performance conditions that will determine the extent to which these options vest at the end of the applicable performance period is provided on page 87.
Replacement Option Plan The Replacement Option Plan, which was approved by shareholders at an EGM on 21 December 2009, was introduced to facilitate the conversion of certain options that had previously been granted by the Company under the Cairn Energy PLC Share Option Plan 2006 2006 Plan.
Converted options granted under the Replacement Option Plan comprise conditional rights to acquire ordinary shares for a specified price, the vesting of which is normally dependent on both continued employment with the Group and the extent to which pre-determined performance conditions are met over a specified period of three years.
A summary of the performance conditions that determine the extent to which converted options vest at the end of the applicable performance period is provided on page 87.
No options were granted under the Replacement Option Plan during 2011 and no further awards will be granted pursuant to this arrangement in the future.

Unaudited Information Continued Share Option Schemes for Other Employees continued 1996 Option Scheme, 2002 Option Plan and 2003 Option Plan The 1996 Option Scheme, 2002 Option Plan and 2003 Option Plan all of which have subsequently been superseded were formerly used by the Company to grant options to a broad selection of employees in the Group.
Although a number of options granted under these plans currently subsist, no further awards will be granted pursuant to their terms.
A summary of the performance conditions that must be satisfied before awards under these plans can be exercised is provided on page 87.
Dilution of Share Capital Pursuant to Share Plans In any ten-year rolling period, the number of ordinary shares which may be issued in connection with the Companys discretionary share plans cannot exceed 5% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital.
In addition, in any ten-year rolling period, the number of ordinary shares which may be issued in connection with all the Companys employee share schemes whether discretionary or otherwise cannot exceed 10% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital.
It should also be noted that all shares acquired by or awarded to participants under the SIP are existing ordinary shares purchased in the market.
As a result, the SIP does not involve the issue of new shares or the transfer of treasury shares.
Non-Executive Directors The remuneration of each of the Non-Executive Directors other than the Chairman is determined by the executive members of the Board and the Chairman within limits set out in the Articles of Association and having taken independent advice on appropriate levels.
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Remuneration Committee, again based on independent advice.
In all cases, the fees are designed to attract experienced individuals and reflect the increased responsibilities of the role of the Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors.
With the exception of Sir Bill Gammells residual good leaver interests in various LTIPs, no Non-Executive Directors participate in any of the Companys share schemes and they are not entitled to a bonus or pension contributions.
The Non-Executive Directors fees for 2011 are set out in full in the remuneration table on page 80.
On appointment as Chairman, the annual rate of fees payable to Sir Bill Gammell was set at 213,000.
The annual fees for 2011 for the other Non-Executive Directors were 66,000, increased to 70,000 for 2012 representing a 4% increase.
In addition to this, an annual fee of 10,000 was payable to each of Iain McLaren and Dr James Buckee for their roles as Chairman of the Audit and Remuneration Committee respectively.
Service Contracts Letters of Appointment The Companys policy is for all Executive Directors to have contracts of service which can be terminated either by the director concerned or by the Company on giving 12 months notice of termination.
In the event of termination by the Company other than as a result of a change of control, the Executive Directors would be entitled to loss of salary, bonus, benefits and pension contributions for the notice periods.
Depending on the circumstances of termination, the Executive Directors may be entitled, or the Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion to allow the Executive Director to retain a proportion of his or her outstanding awards under long-term incentive arrangements but only to the extent that any applicable performance conditions have been met.
Each of the Non-Executive Directors has a letter of appointment in terms of which he or she is appointed for a fixed three-year period, subject to the Companys Articles of Association, which provide for retirement by rotation at least once every three years.
The letters of appointment set out the time commitment expected by the Company and can be terminated with immediate effect by either the director concerned or the Company.
The Board is satisfied that each of the Non-Executive Directors commits sufficient time to fulfil his her duties as a director of the Company.
None of the Non-Executive Directors has any conflict of interest which has not been disclosed to the Board in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association.
The Executive Directors service contracts and Non-Executive Directors letters of appointment are available for inspection on request and will be available for inspection before and during the AGM to be held on 17 May 2012.

Audited Information Continued Directors Interests in Shares Under the Companys Various LTIPs continued Awards Vesting During the year Overview On 6 May 2011, the three-year performance period applicable to certain awards granted under the 2006 LTIP and Replacement LTIP came to an end.
Thereafter, the Remuneration Committee determined that the relevant performance conditions see pages 85 and 86 for full details had been met to the following extent: h in the case of the Cairn India Awards granted under the 2006 LTIP, Cairn Indias TSR performance over the period was ranked between median and upper decile in the applicable comparator group resulting in a vesting of approximately 59% of the Cairn India Units over which the awards subsisted: and h in the case of the Converted Awards granted under the Replacement LTIP, the Companys TSR performance over the period was i ranked above upper decile in the applicable comparator group: and ii in excess of 150%.
The 1.33 multiplier contained within the rules of the Replacement LTIP was therefore applied in full, resulting in a vesting of 133% of the ordinary shares over which the awards subsisted.
The calculations used to determine these vesting percentages were carried out by Cairn and independently verified by Ernst & Young LLP.

2 A s explained on page 81 of this report, the awards that were held by Sir Bill Gammell, Malcolm Thoms and Phil Tracy did not lapse on their cessation of employment with the Company, but instead vested at the same time and in the same manner as the current employees of the Company save that, on such vesting, all of the ordinary shares to which these former employees became entitled were released immediately.
In accordance with the rules of the 2006 LTIP, 50% of the ordinary shares in respect of which the current Executive Directors Cairn India Awards vested were released to them immediately.
The remaining 50% of these ordinary shares became subject to a withholding period during which they were withheld by the trustee.
However, as explained on page 75 of this report, this holding period terminated with effect from the passing of the return of cash resolution at the general meeting held on 30 January 2012 and the relevant ordinary shares were released to the individuals in question immediately thereafter.

Following the above vesting, a total of 1,741,229 ordinary shares acquired by the current and former Executive Directors were sold on their behalf to fund the tax and national insurance liabilities arising on vesting.
The balance of the ordinary shares acquired became subject to an extended holding period during which they were held by the trustee as nominee for each of the individuals.

Audited Information Continued Overview of SIP Performance Conditions Introduction The vesting of each award and option granted under the Companys various SIPs is conditional on the achievement of performance conditions determined by the Remuneration Committee at the relevant date of grant.
Set out below is a summary of the conditions applicable to awards and options that were outstanding during the year.
In the case of the Companys LTIPs being the arrangements in which the Executive Directors participate, the conditions principally relate to the TSR performance of the Company.
These TSR measures were selected by the Remuneration Committee on the basis that they improve shareholder alignment and are consistent with the Companys objective of delivering long-term value to shareholders.
On the expiry of the performance period applicable to an award or option, the calculations necessary to determine the extent to which the relevant conditions have been satisfied are subject to independent verification by Ernst & Young LLP.
2009 LTIP In the case of all outstanding awards granted under the 2009 LTIP, the extent to which they vest will be determined by comparing the TSR of the Company over a three year performance period with the TSR of a share in each company in a comparator group.
The tables below show the comparator groups for each tranche of awards granted under the 2009 LTIP to executive directors.
At the end of the performance period, each company in the comparator group will be listed in order of TSR performance to produce a ranking table.
The vesting of awards will then take place as follows: ranking of company against the comparator group percentage of ordinary shares comprised in Award that vest Below median 0% Median 20% Upper decile i. e. top 10% 100% Between median and upper decile 20% 100% on a straight line basis In order to make sure that the 2009 LTIP encourages and rewards exceptional performance, the performance conditions attaching to awards also provide that, where the TSR of the Company produces a ranking at or above the upper decile level in the appropriate comparator group, a participant will then be given the opportunity to increase the percentage of his her award that vests through the application of a multiplier that is linked to the TSR actually achieved over the performance period.
The way in which this multiplier will operate is as follows: Multiplier applied to determine the number of ordinary shares that actually vest tsr of the company over the performance period 1 50% or less 1.33 100% or more 1 1.33 on a straight line basis Between 50% and 100% However, notwithstanding the performance of the Company against the above targets, no part of any award will vest unless the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that there has been an overall satisfactory and sustained improvement in the performance of the Company as a whole over the performance period.

Audited Information Continued Overview of SIP Performance Conditions continued 2006 LTIP Cairn India Awards In the case of the Cairn India Awards that were granted under the 2006 LTIP and which vested on 16 December 2011, the extent of vesting was determined by comparing the TSR of a Cairn India share over a three year performance period with the TSR of a share in each company in the following comparator group: cairn india Awards with performance period commencing on 7 May 2008 Addax Petroleum, Inc BG Group PLC Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited Chesapeake Energy Corporation CNOOC Limited EOG Resources, Inc Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited Indian Oil Corporation Limited Newfield Exploration Company Noble Energy, Inc Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited PTT Exploration & Production PLC Santos Limited Talisman Energy, Inc Tullow Oil PLC Venture Production PLC Woodside Petroleum Limited Denotes companies that have delisted during the applicable performance period.
At the end of the performance period, each company in the comparator group was listed in order of TSR performance to produce a ranking table.
The vesting of Cairn India Awards was then calculated as follows: ranking of cairn india share against the comparator group percentage of cairn india Units comprised in Award that vest Below median 0% Median 20% Upper decile i. e. top 10% 100% Between median and upper decile 20% 100% on a straight line basis For the same reasons as noted above in relation to the 2009 LTIP, where the TSR of a Cairn India share produced a ranking at or above the upper decile level in the above comparator group, the percentage of the relevant Cairn India Award that vested could be increased through the application of the following multiplier linked to the TSR actually achieved over the performance period: Multiplier applied to determine the number of cairn india Units that actually vest tsr of cairn india over the performance period 1 40% or less 1.33 80% or more 1 1.33 on a straight line basis Between 40% and 80% However, no multiplier was applied in relation to the Cairn India Awards that vested on 16 December 2011.
Notwithstanding the performance of a Cairn India share against the above targets, no part of any Cairn India Award would have vested unless the Remuneration Committee was satisfied that there had been an overall satisfactory and sustained improvement in the performance of the Company as a whole over the performance period.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2011 85 leadership and Governance Directors Remuneration Report Continued 2.
Audited Information Continued Overview of SIP Performance Conditions continued Replacement LTIP The vesting of the Converted Awards on 6 June 2011 was determined by the extent to which specified performance conditions were satisfied over the original three year performance period that applied to the 2006 LTIP Capricorn Award that it has replaced pursuant to the conversion mechanism described on page 74.
The terms of these conditions that applied to each Converted Award were the same as those that applied to the Capricorn Award that it replaced.
In particular, the extent to which a Converted Award vested was determined by comparing the TSR of the Company over the applicable performance period with the TSR of a share in each company in a comparator group see below with vesting taking place as follows: ranking of the company against the comparator group percentage of ordinary shares comprised in converted Award that vest Below median 0% Median 20% Upper decile i. e. top 10% 100% Between median and upper decile 20% 100% on a straight line basis For the same reasons as noted above in relation to the 2009 LTIP, where the TSR of the Company produced a ranking at or above the upper decile level in the appropriate comparator group, the percentage of the relevant Converted Award that vested could be increased through the application of the following multiplier linked to the TSR actually achieved over the performance period: Multiplier applied to determine the number of ordinary shares that actually vest tsr of the company over the performance period 1 75% or less 1.33 150% or more 1 1.33 on a straight line basis Between 75% and 150% A multiplier of 1.33 applied to the Converted Awards that vested on 6 June 2011.
For the purposes of the above conditions, the TSR performance of the Company over the performance period was calculated by aggregating i the growth in the TSR of a Capricorn Unit achieved between the start of the period and the conversion date being the date on which the conversion mechanism described on page 74 became effective : and ii the growth in the TSR of a Cairn share between the conversion date and the end of the period.
Notwithstanding the performance of the Company against the above targets, no part of any Converted Award would have vested unless the Remuneration Committee was satisfied that there had been an overall satisfactory and sustained improvement in the performance of the Company as a whole over the performance period.
The comparator group applicable to each Converted Award was identical to the group that applied to the Capricorn Award it replaced.
