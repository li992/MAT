Governance directors remuneration report Composition of the remuneration committee The remuneration committee is appointed by the board.
During the year the committee comprised Norman Murray chairman of the committee, Ian Durant, Jane Scriven until her retirement and John Brady appointed to replace her.
All of the committee members during the year were regarded by the board as independent nonexecutive directors.
Terms of reference and reporting The committee determines, and annually reviews, all elements of executive directors remuneration and the remuneration of certain other senior executives who report to the chief executive, and whose details are set out on page 33.
It recommends the fees that should be payable to the chairman to the board.
It approves the contracts of the executive directors and those senior executives referred to above and any compensation arrangements arising from their termination.
It also approves all LTIP allocations and oversees the operation of all of the companys share based plans.
The committee is made aware of the salary levels of the wider senior management team and of the incentive arrangements operating throughout the company.
Advisers to the remuneration committee The committee has taken external advice on general remuneration matters and comparator information from Hewitt New Bridge Street, who do not provide any other services to the company.
Advice and assistance is also obtained, where appropriate, from the companys brokers, Deutsche Bank.
During the course of the year legal advice has been obtained from the law firm Pinsent Masons.
The committee also received internal advice from Rooney Anand, chief executive, in determining appropriate remuneration and incentive packages for the finance director and the other senior executives.
Remuneration policy The company operates in a highly competitive market and must attract, motivate and retain high quality directors.
The committee considers current market practice and makes comparisons with turnover, market capitalisation and operational details against a selection of other companies.
The committee is made aware of and has regard to pay and conditions elsewhere within the group and endeavours to ensure that pay rises for executive and nonexecutive directors are generally comparable with those being applied elsewhere in the group.
A range of bonus plans are operated for managers throughout the group, and all staff with the requisite qualifying service have access to the companys share save scheme.
No director makes a decision relating to his own remuneration.
Individual directors leave the meeting when their own remuneration is being discussed.
A significant proportion of each executive directors potential remuneration is performancerelated with appropriately stretching targets, thus aligning the directors interests with those of shareholders and encouraging performance at the highest levels.
The committee has considered whether there are any aspects of the remuneration policy which could inadvertently encourage executives to take inappropriate risk and has concluded that the policy remains appropriate in this regard.
Components of directors remuneration The remuneration package of each executive director consists of the following elements: Annual pay Annual pay reflects the responsibilities, market value and sustained performance level of executive directors.
Pay is reviewed annually or when a change in responsibility occurs.
The pay rises granted in 2010 11 were considered appropriate taking account of pay rises for other employees in the group, the performance of the company, the individuals and the relative market positioning of the individuals packages.
Benefits in kind The range of taxable benefits available to executive directors is listed on page 84.
Bonus Bonus payments are determined by the remuneration committee and awarded where justified by performance.
For the financial year 2011 12, the executive directors will be eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus, the maximum amount being 150% of annual pay, forthe achievement of stretch targets.
Two thirds of this amount, up to a maximum of 100% of annual pay, is based on predetermined performance metrics, set at the start of the year, based on group profitability, return on capital employed, and a range of financial and nonfinancial specific targets relevant to each individual.
The remaining one third of the bonus entitlement, equal to a maximum of 50% of annual pay, is subject to a separate performance condition based on challenging levels of annual economic profit performance in excess of the companys strategic plan, with all of any additional bonus being invested in shares or granted in the form of nil cost options, which would be deferred or, as the case may be, not exercisable for a period of one year and which would be forfeited in the event that the relevant director or employee leaves the group, other than as a good leaver, during that time, to improve motivation, lockin and alignment of interest.
In addition, the additional bonus will be reclaimable by the company in exceptional circumstances of misstatement or misconduct.
The enhanced element of the annual bonus provides improved strategic linkage through the use of an economic profitbased performance condition.
Economic profit operating profit before exceptional items less the weighted average cost of capital multiplied by capital employed is an important management tool and its use in the annual bonus complements this strategic focus.
The use of economic profit also provides abalance to the rest of the bonus plan.
The additional focus on economic profit encourages the management team to target mediumterm decisions to ensure growth by: ensuring better deployment of capital expenditure: encouraging further improvements in relation to returns on invested capital: freeing up assets where higher economic profit can be gained by the group: and extracting higher returns from existing uninvested assets.
The target set for 2011 12 is to achieve a stretching level of economic profit over and above the budget for the year, with a sliding scale for vesting which will ensure that management will not benefit from more than 20% of the uplift in economic profit.
If this economic profit is achieved, it will benefit shareholders and the committee therefore considers that senior management should be incentivised to deliver this additional performance.
There will be disclosure in the directors remuneration report at the end of the year of the basis on which the bonuses were payable.

co. uk Governance Components of directors remuneration continued Pension and life assurance The pension arrangements for Rooney Anand and Ian Bull are on a defined contribution basis.
They both have selfinvested personal pension schemes to which the company makes a contribution.
The contribution rates are 25% for Rooney Anand and 20% for Ian Bull.
Directors are given an option to have pension contributions above the 50,000 annual limit imposed by the government with effect from 6 April 2011 paid to them in cash.
No element of remuneration other than annual pay is treated as pensionable.
Both executive directors participate in a group deathinservice insurance scheme, with death benefits in excess of the HMRC maximum being provided through additional insurance.
The cost of this insurance is disclosed as a noncash benefit in the emoluments table on the following page.
Long term incentives Long term incentives form an important part of the companys remuneration for its directors and senior employees, with historically a mix of options and LTIP awards being granted, subject to performance conditions based on earnings per share EPS.
Since 2009 10 the company policy has been to grant only LTIP awards.
Directors are entitled each year to an LTIP award equivalent to a maximum of 133% of base salary.
Awards are made in the form of restricted forfeitable shares, on which dividends are payable.
Dividends in respect of future awards will be held in escrow pending vesting and will be released to the directors to the extent that the awards vest.
All LTIP awards are subject to two performance measures, namely an adjusted free cash flow condition and an earnings per share condition, both measured over a three year period.
There is a 60:40 weighting in favour of the cash measure, given the importance of cash management as a medium term business priority.
The use of two separate performance conditions is designed to provide a rounded assessment of the companys financial performance.
For the threeyear adjusted free cashflow measure, this will be determined by reference to net cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditure.
Net cash flow from operating activities will include the impact of changes in working capital, and interest and tax payments, but will be adjusted to exclude exceptional items at the discretion of the remuneration committee in consultation with the auditcommittee.
The capex related deduction in the free cashflow measure will be for capital expenditure on properties that were within the estate at the beginning of the performance measurement period, where that capital expenditure has not been funded from property disposal proceeds.
Free cashflow has been chosen as a performance condition because converting EBITDA to positive cashflows to support debt repayment, continued investment in the business and the ongoing payment of dividends is a key measure for both management and shareholders.
The target range for the adjusted free cash flow performance target for the 2011 12 awards will be that the aggregate adjusted free cash flow of the company for the three financial years ending in April 2012, 2013 and 2014 must be more than 250m to vest at the minimum level and at least 290m to vest in full.
Measuring on an aggregate threeyear basis rather than the more common approach of focusing onthe endyear only of the three will ensure that there will be a focus on delivering cash across all three years.
The adjusted earnings per share part of the performance condition for awards granted in 2011 12 will be based on a sliding scale range ofpence per share targets for the 2013 14 year end, with between 0% and 100% of that part of the award vesting depending on the extent to which the targets are met.
The committee does not consider it appropriate to disclose the range, but does consider it to be appropriately challenging in the current economic climate.
There will be disclosure of the conditions and the extent to which they have been achieved inthe remuneration report at the time each award vests.
Employee share schemes In common with all other employees, the executive directors are also entitled to participate in the companys sharesave plan.
Further details are given later in this report.

The market price of the shares on 12 August 2010, when the last awards were made, was 412.6p, although the number of shares comprising the award was determined by reference to the closing market price on 11 August 2010, namely 417.9p.
During the year the 2007 LTIP awards lapsed on the third anniversary of their grant as a result of the remuneration committee having determined that the performance conditions applicable to those awards had not been met.
The 2008 LTIP awards will also lapse on the third anniversary of their grant for the same reasons.
Total gains made by directors under the LTIP in the period ended 1 May 2011 therefore amounted to nil 2010: nil.
The 2009 LTIP awards will only vest to the extent that two separate performance targets are met, over the three financial years ending in April 2012.
A maximum of 60% of each award will vest if an adjusted free cash flow performance condition has been met.
The remaining 40% of the award will vest if an earnings per share performance condition has been met.
The target range for the adjusted free cash flow performance condition is that the aggregate adjusted free cash flow of the company for the three financial years ending in April 2010, 2011 and 2012 must be more than 190.0m to vest at the minimum level and at least 230.0m to vest in full.
The 2010 LTIP awards will only vest to the extent that the relevant performance targets are met over the three financial years ending in April 2013.
As with the 2009 award, a maximum of 60% of each award will vest if an adjusted free cash flow performance condition has been met and the remaining 40% of the award will vest if an earnings per share performance condition has been met.
The target range for the adjusted free cash flow performance condition is that the aggregate adjusted free cash flow of the company for the three financial years ending in April 2011, 2012 and 2013 must be more than 230.4m to vest at the minimum level and at least 270.4m to vest in full.
The earnings per share performance conditions set a range for the EPS for the financial year ending in April 2012 for the 2009 LTIP orApril 2013 for the 2010 LTIP which the remuneration committee considered to be sufficiently challenging in the market conditions.
The remuneration committee is advised on a regular basis as to how actual performance is tracking against the relevant targets.
In relation to the 2009 LTIP, based on performance to date and assuming that the business units meet their stretching strategic plan targets, it is anticipated that the business will meet the upper quartile of the free cash flow target and the upper quartile of the earnings per share target.
For the 2010 LTIP, and on the same assumptions, it is anticipated that the business will meet the upper quartile of the earnings per share target, whilst performance against the free cash flow target is in the lower quartile.
Details as to the extent to which the targets have actually beenmet and the awards have vested will be provided at the end of each three year performance period.
No changes were made during the period, or since the year end to the date of this report, to the terms and conditions of any awards thenoutstanding.
Save as set out above, no awards vested or lapsed during the period.
There have been no other changes to the date ofthisreport.
