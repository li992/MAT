IX Directors LTIP, PSP and Reward Share awards The directors restricted beneficial interests shown in the table below represent the maximum number of shares which may vest under the LTIP, PSP or Retention and Recruitment plan.
Details of the LTIP and PSP, including performance conditions, are described in section II b ii, above.
In 2008 under the Retention and Recruitment plan a limited number of senior executives below Board level received an award of Reward Shares whereby no performance conditions applied, but, other than in the event of death or change of control, shares will only be released in the event that the relevant individuals remain with the Group for a three year period.
The Reward Shares were considered necessary to ensure that those executives key to delivering the targets were appropriately incentivised and locked in tothe Company for three years.
The vesting date for the 2008 award of Reward Shares is 4 July 2011.
The quantum of shares awarded was calculated using the mid-market value of the shares on 6 June 2007, the date on which John Browett accepted the offer of employment with the Group.
This one off award of shares was made in compensation of the significant value of share awards and bonus entitlement John Browett was forfeiting upon joining the Company and was not subject to any performance conditions.
The release of these shares was dependent on John Browett remaining in employment until the vesting date, 6 December 2010.
The share price on the date of vesting was 25.55p and the number of shares actually released was calculated net of any applicable tax deductions.
2 The standard LTIP made to John Browett on 6 December 2007 failed to meet its performance condition and therefore lapsed.
3 Vesting of the 2008 09 LTIP award was dependent on the Companys TSR performance as outlined below over the three financial periods ended 2 May 2009, 1 May 2010 and 30 April 2011.
Since 30 April 2011, the Remuneration Committee has reviewed this performance condition and has determined that it has not been met.
Accordingly, these awards have now lapsed.
4 The award was made prior to Nicholas Cadbury joining the Board.
Dixons Retail plc 51 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 11 Directors Report Corporate Governance Remuneration Report continued For 2008 09 LTIP awards and 2009 10 PSP awards TSR performance is compared to that of a bespoke weighted index comprising UK and European retailers.

All companies have equal weighting within the group other than Kesa Electricals and Metro Group, who have greater competitive relevance and therefore have double weighting.
Under this condition full vesting occurs for performance equivalent to the upper quartile over the three year performance period, reducing to 25% of an award vesting for performance equivalent to median with no vesting below this level.
Vesting between these targets will occur on a straight-line basis.
PSP awards made in 2010 11 are subject to TSR performance relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index comprising FTSE 101-350 companies, excluding investment trusts, at the start of the performance period.
Full vesting will occur for upper quartile performance reducing on a straight-line basis to 25% of the award at median.
No award vests for below median performance.
Additionally, awards made to the executive directors contain an EPS defined on page 19 underpin requiring total EPS growth of RPI plus 2% per annum for the performance period.
The status of the provisional awards under the LTIP and PSP are reviewed regularly and as at the last review in May 2011, the status of the awards as at 30 April 2011 is as follows: Period in which provisional award made Status Award if status maintained 2008 09 TSR below index lapsed No award 2009 10 TSR below index No award 2010 11 TSR below median No award lapsing occurred subsequent to the period end following review by the Remuneration Committee.
It is intended that any releases of shares under the LTIP will be satisfied by shares held in trust by Halifax EES Trustees International Limited, thetrustee of the employee share ownership trust.
2 Options granted on 6 December 2007 and 11 July 2008 for John Browett and 14 August 2008 for Nicholas Cadbury have EPS performance conditions for which the performance period ended on 30 April 2011.
Since that date, the Remuneration Committee has reviewed this performance condition and has determined that it has not been met.
Accordingly, these options have now lapsed.
3 The Reward Sacrifice Scheme was approved by shareholders at the 2009 AGM.
Under this scheme the executive directors sacrificed a portion of their salary in return for receiving non-performance related market value share options of an equivalent fair value to the sacrificed salary.
4 Options granted under the Sharesave Scheme are exercisable in the six month period following the date of maturity of a three year or five year savings contract.
The share price on 30 April 2011 was 14.41p and closing prices ranged between 11.80p and 31.70p during the year.
Dixons Retail plc 53 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 11 Directors Report Corporate Governance Remuneration Report continued Options are exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant, subject to the performance conditions being met.
The following table summarises the performance conditions applicable to the executive directors and senior managements discretionary options excluding Reward Sacrifice Options which do not have a performance condition outstanding as at 30 April 2011.
Performance conditions Re-testing Grants made before 1 Jul 2003 The market price on the date of exercise is at least 20% higher than the During the life option price, assuming exercise takes place between three and four of the option years after the date of grant.

Exercise is also conditional upon EPS having increased by not less than 3% above the annual RPI over any consecutive period of three years during the life of the option.
Grants made between Over the three year performance period, EPS growth is equal to or greater No re-testing 11 Oct 2004 and 11 Jul 2008 than annual RPI plus 5% per annum.
Where EPS growth is between annual RPI plus 3% and RPI plus 5%, options will vest on a straight-line basis between 50% and 100% of the award.
Grants made between Over the three year performance period, EPS growth is equal to or No re-testing 12 Jul 2008 and 23 Jul 2009 greater than annual RPI plus 4% per annum.
