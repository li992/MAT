Section 4 | Governance Remuneration Report Dear Shareholder I am pleased to present the Directors Remuneration Report for 2011.
As reported in the Operating Review pages 40 to 53, Serco has delivered a strong financial and operational performance in 2011 with good organic growth plus increased operating margin and strong cash generation.
Looking forward it is expected that the UK and US markets will continue to be challenging, with new sectors and geographies being important areas of strategic development.
The Committee has devoted a great deal of time during the year to the triennial review of executive remuneration.
As a result of the deliberations, the Committee has concluded that, for now, the overall structure and shape of remuneration should remain unchanged.
The current emphasis on performance-related pay will remain the same.
For target performance variable pay accounts for well over half of total direct pay.
Remuneration for Chief Executive Remuneration for Finance Director 34% 37% 41% 39% 25% 24% Base salary Performance-related annual bonus Performance-related long-term incentives expected value Some changes have been made in the light of the development of Serco Groups business strategy.
The Committee has consulted with major shareholders and the voting guidance services on two important adaptations to the pay arrangements of Executive Directors.
First, we have increased the emphasis on Earnings Per Share EPS growth but, at the same time, retained relative Total Shareholder Return TSR as a key measure.
Growth in EPS is a key performance indicator both for Serco and for our major shareholders.
Over the coming years we shall face a challenging operating environment in the UK and US coupled with an intention to grow the Group in what we perceive to be the more attractive geographies and sectors.
This suggests to us that, to maximise the alignment of interest between Executive Directors and shareholders, we need also to enhance the emphasis on EPS growth.
The Committee also believes that this increases the line of sight for the executive linking longer-term pay and performance.
The definition of EPS will remain the same and exclude material acquisitions, disposals, currency movements and be before amortisation of acquired intangibles and acquisition-related costs.
The Committee will continue to retain the discretion to vary the shares that vest to ensure that outcomes are fair in the light of Sercos underlying financial performance.
This will allow the Remuneration Committee to take into account the quality of earnings and the general financial health of the Company.
Prior to 2012 the vesting of shares awarded to the Executive Directors under the Performance Share Plan PSP was determined by relative TSR performance for 70% of the shares and by reference to EPS growth for the remaining 30%.
Under the Deferred Bonus Plan DBP the vesting levels for the award of matching shares was determined in equal measure by relative TSR performance and by EPS growth.
From 2012, the vesting of shares awarded under the PSP will be weighted 50% based on EPS growth and 50% relative TSR.
Any matching shares awarded under the DBP will vest on EPS growth targets.
The performance ranges for 2012 awards will be discussed with shareholders before the awards are made.
These changes have also been made to the wider leadership team.
Reinforcing the importance of increasing line of sight in the performance measures, the Company will also be introducing a minimum share ownership level for the members of the Executive Committee, who also participate in the DBP.
At the end of the year the Chief Executive held 820,197 shares and the Finance Director 310,991 shares representing, by reference to the share price at that time 474p, share ownership levels as a percentage of salary of 534% and 345% respectively.
We have thought carefully about these changes and hope that our shareholders will support them.
96 | Serco Group plc | Annual report and accounts 2011 During the year the Committee conducted its regular annual review of base salaries of the Executive Directors, taking into account the current economic climate, the challenges facing the business, their performance and the competitiveness of their remuneration against the UK market.
The Committee also had regard to the overall pay decisions for employees across the Group as a whole.
Against this backdrop, salaries were adjusted in line with our remuneration principles to provide market competitive reward opportunities for performance where appropriate.
In 2011 increases were awarded of 4% and 3.4% for the Chief Executive and Finance Director respectively.
On the basis of Sercos performance in 2011, annual bonus awards of 121% and 105% of salary have been determined for the Chief Executive and the Finance Director.
The Executive Directors delivered a financial performance that met the target for revenue growth and exceeded the targets for PBT and Cash performance.
Sercos financial performance for the year is described in more detail in the Our performance section starting on page 20.
The personal objectives set for each of the Directors covered areas such as Corporate reputation management, the securing of key strategic contracts to deliver long-term performance as well as specific activities around the ongoing development of the Group Strategy.
In addition, the entry into the Global BPO market was an important objective for 2011.
Under the 2009 PSP, vesting of 30% of the shares are subject to our EPS performance, and under the DBP, 50% of the matching shares are subject to this measure.
Our performance against the three-year EPS performance measure was compound growth of 20.9% per annum which resulted in 100% vesting for the 2009 PSP and the DBP.
It is disappointing that our TSR performance for the period ended 31 December 2011 relative to the comparator group was below median, therefore no shares vested under this element of either the PSP 70% or the DBP 50%.
After six years I shall be sorry to leave the board at the 2012 Annual General Meeting.
I am, however, delighted that Angie Risley, who is already a Director and a member of the Committee, will be replacing me as the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
Leonard V. Broese van Groenou Remuneration Committee Chairman 27 February 2012 Serco Group plc | Annual report and accounts 2011 | 97 Financial statements Governance Our performance Our business Overview Section 4 | Governance Remuneration Report Introduction The following report details the remuneration policy and the decisions on remuneration of the Directors of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2011.
In preparing this report, consideration has been given to the disclosure requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Companies Act 2006 and the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008.
The Remuneration Committee In 2011, the Remuneration Committee the Committee comprised three independent Non-Executive Directors.
These were Leonard V. Broese van Groenou Chairman of the Committee, David Richardson, and Angie Risley from 1 April 2011.
Alastair Lyons also became a member of the Committee on 10 May 2011.
He is Chairman of the Board and was deemed independent on appointment to the Board.
The Executive Directors may attend meetings of the Committee at its discretion and as appropriate.
They are not in attendance when their own remuneration arrangements are discussed.
The Committee met six times during the year.
The terms of reference of the Committee, a copy of which can be found on the Groups website, are reviewed annually to ensure that they remain appropriate.
Details of the Directors attendance at the Committee meetings can be found in the Corporate Governance Report on page 85.
The Committee determines the overall remuneration policy for senior management and the individual remuneration of the Executive Directors.
This includes base salary, bonus, long-term incentives, pensions, benefits and terms of employment including those terms on which service may be terminated.
The Committee also determines the remuneration of the Chairman.
During the year, in addition to the triennial review, the Committee meetings covered a number of topics including the annual base salary review, the determination of bonus payments, a review of service contracts and 2011 performance targets.
Advisors to the Remuneration Committee The Committee has been advised by Towers Watson, who were originally appointed by the Committee in May 2008.
They have provided advice throughout the triennial review process on the overall remuneration policy and philosophy.
Consulting services have also been provided to the Group by Towers Watson in relation to retirement benefits and pay data.
In this regard, the Committee is satisfied that any potential conflicts are appropriately managed.
Towers Watson is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group which oversees the voluntary code of conduct in relation to executive consulting in the UK.
Fees paid to Towers Watson during the period totalled 434,000, the majority of which related to services provided for executive remuneration.
The Group Human Resources Director, Geoff Lloyd, also provides advice and guidance to the Committee.
Remuneration policy During 2011 the Committee carried out its triennial review of the executive remuneration and of the principles which form the basis of the Companys remuneration policy.
The Committee concluded that it was not appropriate to change Sercos remuneration policy, which it considered supported the achievement of the Companys long-term strategic objectives.
Sercos approach to executive remuneration should: Support Sercos long-term future growth, strategy and values: Align the financial interests of executives and shareholders: Provide market competitive reward opportunities for performance in line with expectations and deliver significant financial rewards for sustained outperformance: Enable Serco to recruit and retain the best in all our chosen markets: Be based on a clear rationale which participants, shareholders and other stakeholders are able to understand and support.
In setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors, in particular the non-financial objectives relating to the annual bonus scheme, the Remuneration Committee is able to consider corporate performance on safety, environmental, social and corporate governance matters.
The Committee retains discretion to reduce bonuses or the vesting of awards under the share plans if performance in these areas is unsatisfactory.
The elements of remuneration Composition The remuneration package for Executive Directors consists of base salary, annual bonus, long-term share-based incentives, pension and other benefits.
The Groups policy is to ensure that a significant proportion of the package is related to performance.
Base salary The Committees policy is to set the base salaries of the Executive Directors so as to ensure that total target remuneration is competitive.
Base salaries are normally reviewed annually.
The Committee takes note of relative pay and employment conditions, both within the Company and the comparator group, when determining salaries.
The Committee is satisfied that the size profile of the companies in Towers Watsons database is representative of the companies in the FTSE 51 to 130.
It also believes that it is important that the same sources of market data are used across the Company to ensure consistency.
98 | Serco Group plc | Annual report and accounts 2011 To ensure that pay and conditions across the Group are taken into account when making decisions on Executive Directors pay, the Committee was briefed about the overall decisions on base salaries and pay bill increases for Sercos Executive Committee and employees across the Group.
The Committee is satisfied that the principles and considerations that were applied to Executive Directors are, as far as possible, applied to all employees.
Pay levels are designed to be competitive, fair and to reflect the skills and performance of individual employees.
Individual pay increases in excess of those granted to the Executive Directors were awarded to various employees for reasons including promotion and increased scope of role.
The salary review date for the Executive Directors was moved to April in 2011 which brings them into line with the vast majority of Sercos employees.
The Committee considered carefully whether base salaries for Christopher Hyman and Andrew Jenner should be increased in 2011.
With effect from 1 April 2011, their salaries were increased by 4% to 728,000 and by 3.4% to 427,000 respectively.
In 2012 the salaries will be increased for both Directors by 3% to 750,000 and 440,000 respectively.
These increases were very much in line with increases for higher performers across the Group.
The impact of these increases on the market position of total remuneration including pension is to maintain the competitive position established at the time of the last triennial review.
A comprehensive explanation of the business performance during the year has been provided in the Our performance section on pages 20 to 81.
Annual bonus Bonus is earned on the basis of achievement of a mix of financial and non-financial objectives which are weighted 80% and 20% respectively.
Payment for target performance is at 75% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 65% of base salary for the Finance Director.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity is 150% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 130% of base salary for the Finance Director.
Annual bonuses are not pensionable.
Financial measures are based on Serco Groups Key Performance Indicators KPIs and the non-financial measures are individually set and are based on key strategic goals.
The three financial measures for 2011 were based on revenue, profit before tax and cash conversion.
These measures reflect the growth and margin improvement strategies of the business.
The standards of performance set are designed to be stretching.
The non-financial goals set for 2011 assessed performance against a number of strategically important objectives for each individual linked to key strategic areas such as corporate reputation management, the securing of key strategic contracts to deliver long-term performance as well as specific activities related to the development and execution of the Groups Strategy.
In addition, the entry into the global business process outsourcing BPO market was an important objective for 2011.
On the basis of Sercos performance in 2011, annual awards of 121% and 105% of salary have been determined for the Chief Executive and Finance Director respectively.
The Executive Directors delivered a financial performance that met the quantitative targets and, in the case of PBT and Cash performance, exceeded those targets.
The bonus objectives for 2012 have been set on a similar basis.
Share-based remuneration Long-term share incentives are awarded usually on an annual basis to Executive Directors under the Serco Group plc Deferred Bonus Plan DBP and the Serco Group plc Performance Share Plan PSP.
All awards are made pursuant to the rules of the applicable plans and in accordance with the Model Code and policies in relation to the treatment of leavers have been adopted.
The measurement of the performance targets is undertaken by Mercer for the DBP and the PSP, and in relation to the Earnings Per Share EPS growth element of the targets, is audited by Deloitte LLP.
The conditions relating to the plans are detailed below.
Deferred Bonus Plan Under the DBP, Executive Directors can elect to defer, for three financial years, up to 50% of their annual bonus by purchasing investment shares.
If stretching performance targets, measured over three years, are met each investment share which could have been purchased with the gross equivalent of the amount used to purchase investment shares will be matched by a maximum of two matching shares.
For awards made in 2011 the performance measures, each determining the vesting of half of the matching shares, were: TSR compared to the companies in the FTSE 51 to 130 excluding investment trusts : and Annual compound EPS growth.
The structure for vesting was the same for both measures and no matching shares vest where performance is below median TSR or threshold EPS.
On a combined basis, for median level TSR performance and a threshold level of EPS performance, each invested share will be matched on a gross investment basis by half of a share.
For upper quartile level of TSR performance and a maximum level of EPS performance, each invested share will be matched on a gross investment basis by two shares.
For performance between median or threshold and upper quartile or maximum, the number of matching shares will be determined on a straight line basis.
For the award made under the DBP and the PSP in 2009, the structure for vesting for the first year of the performance period is annual growth in EPS of 13% at threshold to 19% at maximum.
This takes into account the impact on earnings of the acquisition of SI at the end of 2008.
Serco Group plc | Annual report and accounts 2011 | 99 Financial statements Governance Our performance Our business Overview Section 4 | Governance Remuneration Report The definition of EPS is basic EPS excluding material acquisitions, disposals, currency movements and before amortisation of acquired intangibles.
The Committee has discretion to vary the proportion of awards that vest under the DBP to ensure that the outcomes are fair and appropriately reflect the underlying financial performance of the Group.
In 2011 both the Chief Executive and the Finance Director elected to defer 50% of their earned bonus into the DBP.
For matching awards which completed their performance period on 31 December 2011, performance against the three-year EPS measure was compound growth of 20.9% per annum which resulted in 100% of the EPS element 50% of the award vesting.
For the TSR element of the matching award, the Groups TSR performance relative to its comparator group was below median and therefore no shares under TSR element 50% of the matching award vested.
Changes to the Deferred Bonus Plan The Committee has consulted with a selection of the largest shareholders and the voting guidance services in a key change to the DBP.
In a challenging environment, EPS growth through, for example, our increased penetration of high-growth sectors and geographies, is one of Sercos KPIs and will be a critical value driver over the next few years.
To enhance the line of sight for Executive Directors between performance against this key objective and reward, EPS growth will become the sole measure to determine the vesting of matching shares.
The Committee believes EPS growth can be directly influenced by executive decision-making whereas relative TSR reflects not only the achievements of our management but also that of other companies and the factors influencing the market as a whole, particularly for Serco for which there are no direct comparators.
There is, therefore, a much weaker link between executive performance and reward as determined by relative TSR performance.
This combined with the significant shareholdings of the Executive Directors will also drive alignment of interest with shareholders.
The DBP also extends to Sercos Executive Committee on the same basis.
Some shareholders have asked why deferral of bonus is not mandatory and why the matching shares are necessary.
The DBP is part of a carefully considered approach to Sercos executive remuneration policy.
The Committee wants to encourage Executive Directors who already have significant shareholdings to invest further in the Company.
As ever we shall keep emerging best practice under review.
The EPS growth range will be determined in the next few weeks and discussed with major shareholders.
Performance Share Plan The PSP awards granted to the Executive Directors are calculated at a face value on grant of 200% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 175% of base salary for the Finance Director.
The shares will normally only vest at the end of a three-year period, if the Executive Directors are still in employment with Serco and two performance conditions have been met.
The measures are EPS growth and TSR compared to the companies in the FTSE 51 to 130 excluding investment trusts.
The two measures are independent and each determines a fixed proportion of the award.
EPS growth is measured on a compound basis over a three-year performance period.
25% of the award will vest for threshold performance rising on a straight line basis to 100% for maximum performance.
Threshold vesting for the relative TSR condition is at 50% of the TSR achieved by the comparator group.
Maximum vesting is achieved if the Companys relative TSR ranking is in the upper quartile.
Relative TSR is measured with reference to the cumulative performance over the three-year period.
The graph below illustrates the mechanics of vesting, which is the same for both measures.
Note that no awards vest for performance below Median Threshold.
100 75 50 25 0 Median Threshold Upper quartile Maximum Performance For awards made in 2011 Relative TSR performance determined the vesting of 70% of the shares and EPS growth the remainder.
100 | Serco Group plc | Annual report and accounts 2011 % of award vesting Summary of EPS performance to 31 December 2011 Compound EPS growth was 20.9% per annum.
Accordingly, 100% of the June 2009 awards vest.
The level at which maximum vesting would occur was 19% for year one and 14% per annum for the remaining two years of the performance period.
Summary of TSR performance to 31 December 2011 The Groups TSR performance relative to the comparator group was below median and therefore the TSR element of the award lapses in full.
Changes to the Performance Share Plan From 2012 the vesting of shares awarded under the PSP will be weighted 50% based on EPS growth and 50% relative TSR.
Going forward whilst relative TSR remains an appropriate measure the Committee has decided that greater emphasis should be placed on EPS growth for the reasons stated above in connection with the DBP.
Dividends are reinvested and distributed under both plans only in respect of shares that vest at the end of the performance period.
The Committee has discretion to vary the proportion of awards that vest under the Plans, to ensure that the outcomes are fair and appropriately reflect the underlying financial performance of the Group.
Prior to 2009 share-based incentive awards were made under the Serco Group plc 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and the Serco Group plc 2005 Executive Option Plan EOP : the conditions relating to these plans are detailed in the notes to the share-based incentive tables.
Sharesave Scheme The Group operates a Sharesave Scheme.
No performance conditions are attached to options granted under the Scheme as it is an all-employee scheme.
Options granted to Scheme participants are normally set at a discount of 10% to the market value of shares at grant.
None of the Directors participate in the Sharesave Scheme.
Share ownership policy The share ownership requirement for the Chief Executive is two times base salary and one times base salary for the Finance Director.
The Committee believes that share ownership is a meaningful way to align executives interest with those of shareholders.
Executive Directors are required to retain in shares 50% of the net value of any performance shares or options exercised until they satisfy the shareholding requirement.
Going forward members of the Executive Committee are also going to be required to build over a period of five years, their shareholding in the Company to the level of one times base salary.
At the end of the year, by reference to the share price at that date, Executive Directors share ownership levels were as follows: Ordinary shareholding at Ordinary shareholding at 31 December 2011 474p 31 December 2010 555.5p No.
of shares % of salary Chief Executive 820,197 534% 777,889 617% Finance Director 310,991 345% 289,574 390% Pensions, life assurance and other benefits Serco operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The Executive Directors participate in the Serco Pension and Life Assurance Scheme SPLAS.
This is a funded, defined benefit scheme, which provides for a target pension of two-thirds of pensionable salary following a full career.
Members contribute to the scheme at rates varying according to the section of the scheme.
From 1 January 2007 Serco also introduced SMART whereby all members were given the option to have their pension contributions paid by salary sacrifice.
Under this arrangement the member makes no normal pension contributions, Serco makes additional contributions to SPLAS equal to those that the member would otherwise have made and the members contractual pay is reduced by the amount of these contributions.
Both Christopher Hyman and Andrew Jenner opted to have their contributions paid by SMART.
Christopher Hyman opted to cease accruing benefits in the pension scheme after 1 April 2010 and Andrew Jenner after 31 December 2010.
Since 1 April 2010 Christopher Hyman has been in receipt of a cash allowance equal to 33% of his base salary in lieu of further pension provision.
From 1 January 2011 Andrew Jenner has also been in receipt of a cash allowance equal to 33% of his base salary in lieu of pension provision.
The Executive Directors remain entitled to lump sum and widows pension benefits should they die before retirement and while still employed by Serco.
The Executive Directors receive a range of other benefits which comprise 25 days holiday per year, a car, private medical insurance, permanent health insurance, life cover, an annual allowance for independent financial advice, and voluntary health checks every two years.
Serco Group plc | Annual report and accounts 2011 | 101 Financial statements Governance Our performance Our business Overview Section 4 | Governance Remuneration Report Service contracts and compensation Each Executive Director has a rolling service contract and these contracts will be available for inspection prior to the start of and after the Companys annual general meeting.
The service contracts have a notice period of 12 months.
The Company reserves the right to make a payment in lieu of notice.
In addition, where a Director leaves the Company following a change of control, whether or not he is dismissed or he elects to leave on notice, he will be entitled to receive a payment equivalent to up to one years remuneration.
The service contracts do not provide for termination payments to be made in any other circumstances.
There have been no payments made during the year in relation to compensation for loss of office.

Serco Group plc | Annual report and accounts 2011 | 105 Financial statements Governance Our performance Our business Overview Section 4 | Governance Remuneration Report Comparison of total shareholder returns Serco Group plc total shareholder return TSR vs FTSE 100 Total Return Index Value of investment of 100 on 31 December 2006 170 160 150 140 130 120 110 100 90 80 70 31 Dec 2006 31 Dec 2007 31 Dec 2008 31 Dec 2009 31 Dec 2010 31 Dec 2011 Serco FTSE 100 Index In drawing this graph, it has been assumed that all dividends paid have been reinvested.
The TSR level shown at 31 December each year is the average of the closing daily TSR levels for the 30-day period up to and including that date.
The Companys TSR is compared to that of the FTSE 100 Index, which is a broad equity market index of which it is a constituent.
As detailed earlier, TSR is defined as the return shareholders would receive if they held a notional number of shares, and received dividends on those shares over a period of time.
It measures the percentage growth in the Companys share price together with the value of any dividends paid, assuming that the dividends are reinvested into the Companys shares.
106 | Serco Group plc | Annual report and accounts 2011 Pensions and life assurance This section has been audited by Deloitte LLP.
The Directors receive pension and life assurance benefits consistent with those provided by other leading companies.
The details of the defined benefit schemes operated by the Group are set out in the note on pages 149 to 154.
In the event of death in service, the Serco Supplementary Death Benefit Scheme provides for a lump sum payment.
The accrued pension benefits of all Directors under the Serco Pension and Life Assurance Scheme, which is a defined benefit scheme, are as follows: Increase Transfer Change Increase in accrued value of Transfer Transfer Directors in transfer in accrued pension increase value at value at contributions value during pension during the in accrual Accrued 31 December 31 December for the the year during year, net over the pension at 2011 2010 year 4 the year of inflation year year end 1 2 3 1 - 2 - 3 5 6 7 8 p. a. p. a. p. a. Christopher Hyman 2,180,757 1,744,001 436,756 5,122 407 7,022 126,390 Andrew Jenner 1,184,608 929,133 255,475 2,989 212 3,231 77,719 Notes: a Christopher Hyman ceased pension accrual on 1 April 2010 and Andrew Jenner on 31 December 2010, opting to receive a cash alternative equal to 33% of base pay excluding bonuses in lieu of any further pension provision.
Executives remain entitled to lump sum and widows pension benefits should they die before retirement and whilst employed by Serco.
b The accrued pension shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement, based on pensionable service to the date of ceasing accrual.
c The increase in the accrued pension over the year is shown both as a gross increase and net of statutory inflation see further notes below.
d Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the Occupational Pension Schemes Transfer Value Regulations 1996.
The assumptions used for calculating transfer values have been reviewed by the Trustees during the year and updated to reflect future pension increases and revaluations linked to the Consumer Prices Index CPI measure of inflation, rather than Retail Prices Index RPI.
e CPI increased by 5.2% over the year September 2010 to September 2011, the period used for statutory increases.
Statutory indexation restricts preretirement increases to 5% p. a. for pension earned prior to 5 April 2009 and to 2.5% p. a. for pension earned after that date, and we have used this measure of inflation for calculating the increase in accrued pension net of inflation in 6. f The increase in the accrued pension for both Directors allows for an increase in line with RPI to a maximum of 4% p. a. over the period from date of ceasing accrual to the year end, as agreed when they ceased accrual.
Since the increase in pension over the year has been less than the statutory increase in inflation that would have applied on leaving service, the increase allowing for inflation in 6 is negative.
g The impact of allowing for CPI in the transfer value assumptions on its own would result in lower transfer values than would have applied with the previous assumptions.
However, market movements over the year have acted to increase transfer values.
The difference between the transfer values at the beginning and end of the year, shown in 4, includes the effect of both changes in the transfer value assumptions and the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and the Directors, such as stock market movements.
h The transfer values disclosed do not represent the sum paid or payable to the individual Director.
Instead they represent a potential liability of the pension scheme.
Share dilution Awards granted under the Serco Group plc share plans are met either by the issue of new shares or by shares held in trust when awards vest.
The Committee monitors the number of shares issued under its various share plans and their impact on dilution limits.
The relevant dilution limits established by the Association of British Insurers in respect of all share plans 10% in any rolling ten-year period and discretionary share plans 5% in any rolling ten-year period were, based on the Companys issued share capital at 31 December 2011, 6.48% and 4.35% respectively.
The Group has an employee share ownership trust which is administered by an independent trustee and which holds ordinary shares in the Company to meet various obligations under the share plans.
In April 2011 a loan of 24 million was made to the Employee Share Ownership Trust in order to finance the purchase of shares to satisfy the ongoing liabilities under the Companys employee share plans.
The Trust held 4,710,201 and 8,267,992 ordinary shares at 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2011 respectively.
