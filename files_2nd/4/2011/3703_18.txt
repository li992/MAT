 for the year relating to the above Executive Directors were 188,190 2010: 162,752.
The inflation figure used for 2011 is 3.1%, being the statutory revaluation rate for deferred pensioners for 201011 for a member not retiring in 2011 after oneyears service.
The Additional transfer value accrued in excess of members contributions during 2011 is significantly greater than the corresponding value for 2010.
This is predominantly due to a reduction in gilt yields over the year, leading to a reduction in the yields used for the calculation of the transfer values.
The transfer value basis at 31 December 2011 was therefore significantly stronger than the corresponding basis at 31 December 2010.
