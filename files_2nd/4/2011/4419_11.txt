To underpin this commitment, the Committee expects that, while the guideline holding remains unfulfilled, Executive Directors will not dispose of any shares vesting to them under any of the Kesa incentive plans save for any disposals necessary to meet tax liabilities arising from them, until they hold shares worth the following percentage of their base salary.
CEO 150 per cent of base salary Other Executive Directors 100 per cent of base salary Executive Committee Members 50 per cent of base salary 15 Directors interests The beneficial interests of the Directors, which include holdings by their spouses or other related parties, together with non-beneficial interests in the ordinary shares of the Company, are shown below.
