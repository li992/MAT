Business performance, senior leadership changes and strategic change projects all impact remuneration.
I have sought to steer a pragmatic course with the objectives of: a operating a reward policy that allows the Company to attract, retain and incentivise the key talent that it needs i to deliver the recovery programmes in the under-performing parts of the business and ii to continue to deliver at and ahead of targets in the more strongly performing areas: b ensuring that performance targets are aligned with business priorities and that outcomes under the various incentive plans are commensurate with achievement: and c providing a measured response to current challenges.
We might need to conduct a review of our remuneration policy once the new Chairman and the new Group Chief Executive Offi cer have had the opportunity to defi ne the strategic priorities of the Company over the medium-term.
In delivering to the above objectives, I have been grateful for the views expressed by shareholders in consultation meetings, and these inputs have helped shape the actions taken.
I would draw your attention to the following: The terms of the resignation of the Companys former Group Chief Executive Offi cer, Manny Fontenla-Novoa, provide for no vesting under short or long-term incentive plans and provide for no payments beyond those legally or contractually due to him.
The Company is fortunate to have secured the services of the Deputy Group Chief Executive Offi cer, Sam Weihagen, to serve as Group Chief Executive Offi cer beyond his planned retirement date, until a permanent successor is found.
His annualised total remuneration is consistent with the Companys target total remuneration pay positioning.
No bonus payments will be made to any Executive Director in respect of the year ended 30 September 2011.
The Board has agreed to introduce deferral and claw-back in respect of future senior executive bonus payments.
The performance conditions in respect of awards made under the Performance Share Plan and the Co-Investment Plan in 2008 and 2009 have not been achieved.
Accordingly, these awards have lapsed with no vesting.
The Committee reviewed remuneration policy during the fi first half of the year and agreed a more focused approach to the list of companies with whom we conduct peer group comparison, but otherwise agreed no major changes to policy.
The Board will be submitting this Report for approval by shareholders at our Annual General Meeting on 8 February 2012.
Peter Middleton Chairman, Remuneration Committee 13 December 2011 Directors Report: Business Review Directors Report: Governance Financial Statements 57 InformatIon not subject to audIt a.
Governance Composition The following Independent Non-Executive Directors are members of the Remuneration Committee the Committee : Peter Middleton Chairman Roger Burnell Bo Lerenius There has been no change to the composition of the Committee during the financial year ended 30 September 2011 the Year.
Terms of reference The responsibilities of the Committee include: making recommendations to the Board on the Companys framework of executive remuneration and its cost: reviewing and determining, on behalf of the Board, the remuneration and incentive packages of the Executive Directors to ensure that they are appropriately rewarded for their individual contributions to Thomas Cooks overall performance: and formulating remuneration policy with regard to the strategic objectives and operational performance of the Company.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on www.
com or from the Group Company Secretary at the registered office.
Meetings The Committee held six meetings during the Year.
Attendance at those meetings is disclosed on page 45 of the Corporate Governance Report.
Main areas of focus Matters discussed by the Committee during the Year included: the Groups remuneration policy, including a review of comparator companies used for benchmarking purposes: key trends in executive remuneration: the market competitiveness of the remuneration packages for Executive Directors: views expressed by institutional shareholder and governance bodies: resignation terms for the former Group Chief Executive Officer, Manny Fontenla-Novoa: reward arrangements for the current Group Chief Executive Officer, Sam Weihagen: annual bonus: achievement of the annual bonus targets for Executive Directors in respect of the previous financial year and the structure and targets of the annual bonus arrangements for the Year: long-term incentives: performance against targets set in respect of long-term incentive share awards granted in 2008, 2009 and 2010: and approval of the grants of new awards: review of risk in remuneration arrangements: and review of remuneration advisers.
Advisers The Committee invites individuals to attend meetings, as it deems beneficial to assist it in reviewing matters for consideration.
During the Year, these individuals included the Chairman of the Company, the Group Chief Executive Officer, the Group Human Resources Director, the Group Company Secretary and the Group Head of Reward.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee also usually attends meetings to ensure that there is coordination on risk and accounting issues.
No Director or senior executive is present at meetings when his or her own remuneration arrangements are being discussed.
In the performance of its duties, the Committee seeks assistance from external advisers, where necessary, to ensure it is suitably advised.
During the Year, Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS provided advice to the Committee in the following areas: trends in executive remuneration and review of the Companys remuneration policy and long-term incentive plans: and the benchmarking of remuneration and pension benefits for Executive Directors.
Alithos Limited Alithos provided advice on the performance of the total shareholder return targets attached to the Companys long-term incentive schemes.
Neither Alithos nor HNBS advises the Company in any other capacity.
Evaluation The Committee evaluated its own performance, which took place at the time of the Board evaluation, details of which are on page 47. directors report: 58 remuneration report Remuneration report continued b.
PoLIcY and aPProacH Remuneration policy The Groups remuneration policy is to ensure that Directors and senior executives are rewarded in a way which attracts and retains management of the highest quality and motivates them to achieve the highest level of performance consistent with the best interests of the Group, its shareholders and employees.
In developing its remuneration policy, the Committee has had regard to the fact that the Group has signifi cant international operations and, in order to compete in the global environment for the recruitment, retention and incentivisation of high-quality Executive Directors and senior managers, it must offer rewards which, on the basis of above average performance, offer upper quartile levels of reward.
The Committee will continually review the remuneration policy to ensure it remains effective, appropriate and continues to support the Groups objectives.
The Committee therefore sets its remuneration policy in view of, and applying, the following principles: The Groups objective is to deliver fi financial results which consistently outperform the average of the industry sector.
The Group will look to retain and attract Directors and senior executives with above average skills and leadership potential.
The Committee will look for the Group to provide above industry average total remuneration in line with above average performance.
The Committee has determined that its policy for the design of remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors is that their base salary shall be set in line with the median of a peer group of companies with which the Company should properly be compared and that total remuneration which is made up of base salary, benefi ts, bonuses and long-term incentive awards shall be set in the upper quartile of the comparator group but subject to the attainment of appropriate and challenging performance criteria.
The remuneration of each Executive Director will be based on performance both of the Group and of the individual executive, potential i. e. the executives potential to grow in responsibility and performance and scarcity i. e. the availability of candidates to replace the executive should he leave the Group.
The remuneration for Executive Directors will be highly geared towards performance with the proportion of at risk pay increasing disproportionately according to: the level of personal performance.
the seniority of the Executive Director and his ability to infl uence results.
The proportion between fi xed and variable remuneration will typically be targeted at 30% fi xed and 70% variable.
Overview of remuneration structure for Executive Directors The remuneration of the Executive Directors in respect of the Year is set out in the audited section of this report.
For the Year, the remuneration of the Executive Directors comprised base salary, participation in the annual bonus and long-term incentive arrangements, other benefi ts including the provision of pension contributions or allowances, private medical insurance, income protection, death in service benefi t and a car allowance.
The only component of executive remuneration that is pensionable is base salary.
In benchmarking the remuneration of Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee looks at pay levels at other travel and leisure sector companies and takes a broader view by considering pay at other companies of a similar size to Thomas Cook.
At its meeting in December 2011, the Committee agreed to increase the required minimum level of bonus deferral for its senior executives and to introduce claw-back provisions in respect of the deferred bonus.
a Balance between fi xed and variable remuneration The remuneration of Executive Directors is highly geared towards performance with the proportion of at risk pay increasing according to: the seniority of the Executive Director and his ability to infl uence results: and the level of personal performance.
The performance related portion of remuneration rewards short-term and long-term performance separately, with the potential level of payment being heavily weighted in favour of the long-term.
The relative importance of the fi xed and variable elements of the remuneration packages of Executive Directors in circumstances of target and stretch performance, are shown in the chart opposite.
The chart assumes: a base salaries as at 30 September 2011: b value of pension allowances and other benefi ts provided in the Year: c annual bonus: 60% of full bonus paid at target performance: 100% of full bonus paid at maximum performance: Directors Report: Business Review Directors Report: Governance Financial Statements 59 d Performance Share Plan: 25% of the award vests at target performance with 100% of the award vesting at maximum performance: and e Co-Investment Plan: an initial investment of: at target performance, 10% of net of tax base pay: at maximum performance, the net of tax bonus paid above 100% of base salary.

The terms of the settlement were agreed by the Committee and by the Board and provided for no remuneration beyond that which was contractually or legally due to him.
Manny Fontenla-Novoas service contract contained a 12-month notice period.
In accordance with its terms he received a payment in lieu of notice in respect of base salary, pension allowance and contractual benefits.
No payment was made in respect of annual bonus and all subsisting share awards have lapsed with no vesting.
Total payments made to Manny Fontenla-Novoa after his resignation amount to 1,166,639, which is made up as follows: he continued to receive his salary, pension and certain benefits private medical, life cover, personal accident, income protection, death in service pension and access to car and pool driver in accordance with contractual terms for the period between his resignation and 4 November 2011.
Payments made and benefits received during this period amounted to 315,525: and Value directors report: 60 remuneration report Remuneration report continued on termination of his employment on 4 November 2011 it was agreed that a payment of 851,114 would be made to Manny FontenlaNovoa, in full and fi final settlement of all amounts due.
Due to deterioration of the Companys forecast year-end headroom position after agreement was reached, Mr Fontenla-Novoa agreed to a deferral of the due date for payment of this sum until after the seasonal cash low point at the end of December.
With the exception of medical cover, which is being continued until 1 April 2012, all other insured benefi ts ceased on termination of employment.
Full details of the settlement given to the former Group Chief Executive Offi cer are included in the table of Directors remuneration and relevant footnotes on pages 68 and 69.
Sam Weihagen, Deputy to the Group Chief Executive Offi cer, relinquished his additional role as Chief Executive Offi cer, Northern Europe from 1 January 2011 and became part-time with a view to retiring at the end of 2011.
His remuneration was pro rated 50% to refl ect his contractual commitments.
Upon the Boards acceptance of the resignation of Manny Fontenla-Novoa, Sam Weihagen was asked to assume the role of Group Chief Executive Offi cer on an interim basis until a permanent successor is appointed.
Sam Weihagen accepted and agreed to postpone his planned retirement, to relocate to London and to revert to full-time hours.
The Committee, having regard for the Companys remuneration policy, the unique features of the interim appointment and also for market rates of pay for the position, set remuneration for the duration of this interim appointment.
The key features of this remuneration are: base salary at a rate of: 750,000 per annum: maximum annualised bonus opportunity: 175% of base salary against clearly defi ned objectives: pension allowance: 25% of base salary: and benefi ts: accommodation in London, regular home leave fl ights, private health insurance, personal accident cover, death in service benefi t. Long-term incentives are not provided.
The base salary has been set at a level below that of the former incumbent, but at slightly above median.
Overall this produces a greater weighting on the fi xed elements of remuneration than provided for under the remuneration policy.
The Committee considered this appropriate to refl ect the interim nature of the appointment and to recognise the willingness of Sam Weihagen to postpone his retirement.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity and the pension allowance percentages are unchanged from his previous entitlement.
Shareholder engagement During the Year, Peter Middleton met with a number of major shareholders to discuss remuneration matters.
The meetings were helpful and productive and all matters raised were reported back to the Board at its next meeting.
It is intended to continue with a level of engagement in the current fi financial year.
Risk assessment During the Year, the Committee considered remuneration in relation to risk and concluded that the Groups remuneration policy and incentives were not incompatible with its risk policies and systems.
Pay and conditions across the Group Thomas Cook is a large international business with diversifi ed business interests across the travel and leisure sector.
As such, we do not believe it is appropriate to establish direct correlation between pay and employment conditions of employees of the wider business and Directors remuneration.
Rather we seek to ensure that core principles are applied in determining remuneration at all levels across the Group.
Core principles and features of broader remuneration practices include: employees, including the Executive Directors, are paid competitively and fairly by reference to the local market rate.
Benchmarking is carried out to support pay positioning: through short and long-term incentive schemes, which operate throughout the organisation, overall pay is aligned to business strategy and performance.
The Company is reviewing the operation of key performance related pay structures to increase alignment to business goals, improve consistency, transparency and fairness and ensure effective line of sight and cascade: the Company offers a range of benefi ts depending on employee location including pensions, fl exible benefi ts, paid annual leave and healthcare insurance: the Company offers internal promotion opportunities: the Company promotes employment conditions that are commensurate with a good employer and with a high profi le brand, including high standards of health and safety and policies on equal opportunity: and the Company promotes a wide range of best practice learning and development programmes to help people maximise their potential contribution to the business and be eligible for higher levels of reward and promotion opportunities.
Directors Report: Business Review Directors Report: Governance Financial Statements 61 c. remuneratIon bY PaY eLement Base salary In accordance with the Groups remuneration policy, the base salary of Executive Directors reflects the size and scope of their responsibilities.
The Committee reviewed the base salary of the Executive Directors in November 2010 and agreed that they should remain unchanged.
Changes to Sam Weihagens base salary during the Year to reflect his changing role, are described in the section on Group Chief Executive Officer remuneration on page 60.
A review of market rates of base salary and total remuneration for Executive Directors was conducted in August 2011, which the Committee reviewed in September 2011.
The Committee agreed that base salaries should remain at their current level and will be reviewed again in 2012.
The annual rates of base salary, as at 13 December 2011 throughout the Year for Sam Weihagen, for the Executive Directors are shown in the table below: 2011 2010 Name Role 000 000 1 Sam Weihagen Deputy Group Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer, Northern Europe seK 5,600 SEK 5,600 Deputy to the Group Chief Executive Officer seK 2,800 Group Chief Executive Officer GbP 750 Paul Hollingworth Group Chief Financial Officer GbP 480 GBP 480 1 Sam Weihagens base salary of 5.6m Swedish Krona equated at 30 September 2011 to a base salary of 527,538 and his salary of 2.8m Swedish Krona equated to 263,769 at the same date.
Details of the periods of service in respect of each role are given in the service contracts section of this report on page 65.
Pensions The Committee believes that the Executive Directors should be provided with competitive post retirement benefits.
In respect of each Executive Director, the Company contributes an amount equivalent to 25% of base salary each year, either into a pension scheme or as a cash allowance.
Sam Weihagen is entitled to a bridging pension payable under a defined benefit pension scheme between the ages of 60 and 65 of 70% of his final salary and a lifetime pension payable from 65 of 30% of his final salary less the Swedish state pension.
From age 60, when the Companys contributions to the above pension ceased, Sam Weihagen was paid a salary supplement of 25% of his base pay.
Since reaching age 60, Sam Weihagen has not drawn any of his bridging pension, which will be subject to actuarial adjustment once it is drawn.
The table on page 69 discloses these arrangements.
Annual bonus The Committee believes that it is important to incentivise Executive Directors on a short-term basis with an annual cash bonus, earned on the attainment of stretching performance targets.
These targets are set by the Committee at the start of the financial year.
Should all objectives be achieved in full, the maximum annual bonus opportunity for all Executive Directors is 175% of base salary.
Of the maximum bonus payable in respect of the Year: i 37.5% was linked to the attainment of Group financial targets, earned on a pro rata basis by reference to the achievement of those targets: ii 25% was linked to the attainment of quarterly Group free cash flow targets: iii 12.5% was linked to the achievement of a significant reduction in the level of exceptional items: and iv 25% was linked to the attainment of individual financial and non-financial targets including those relating to strategic change projects and executive succession planning.
The Committee determines the extent to which it considers the objectives have been met and the annual bonus payable.
Achievement of Group financial targets is required as a hurdle before achievement against other performance targets are measured.
For the Year, the Group financial targets were not met and the Committee determined that no bonus would be payable to any of the Executive Directors.
The annual bonus for the year ended 30 September 2012 will be structured in the following way: i 40% to be linked to the attainment of Group financial targets: ii 35% to be linked to the attainment of quarterly Group free cash flow targets: and iii 25% to be linked to the attainment of individual financial and non-financial objectives.
Long-term incentives The Committee believes that influencing long-term performance and the close alignment of Executive Directors remuneration with the interests of shareholders is an important element of the Companys remuneration policy.
Therefore, the following two share-based long-term incentive plans, both of which have been approved by shareholders, have been designed to reward and retain Executive Directors and key senior executives over the longer-term, whilst also aligning with the interests of the Companys shareholders.
directors report: 62 remuneration report Remuneration report continued In line with market practice, awards vest three years after the award date, providing the participant is still employed by a company within the Group and to the extent that the performance target has been met.
Unless there are exceptional circumstances, awards are made annually within 42 days of the Companys annual fi financial results being announced.
No award can be made under either plan later than 10 years after the anniversary of the adoption date and options are not exercisable later than 10 years after the date of the award.
Neither plan has a performance target retest provision.
a Thomas Cook Group plc 2007 Performance Share Plan PSP In January 2011, PSP awards with a face value equal to the following percentages of base salary were made to the Executive Directors: Percentage of Name base salary 1 Paul Hollingworth 200 Sam Weihagen 150 Manny Fontenla-Novoa 175 1 As an exception to the remuneration policy the Committee agreed that Paul Hollingworth would receive an award equal to 200% of base salary for the fi first two years following his appointment.
Thereafter, his awards will revert to 150% of base salary.
Awards with a face value of 100% or less of base salary were also made to other senior executives.
b Thomas Cook Group plc 2008 Co-Investment Plan COIP Under the COIP, Executive Directors and key executives must purchase the Companys shares out of their bonus.
If the bonus paid is below 100% of salary, 10% of the participants net base salary or the whole of the net bonus if less must be invested.
If the bonus paid is above 100% of base salary, all of the bonus payable above 100% of base salary subject to the minimum investment of 10% of net base salary must be used to acquire shares.
Participants can also choose to invest a further part of their bonus to purchase shares.
The shares purchased, on either a voluntary or a mandatory basis, are referred to as Lodged Shares.
Participants may receive up to three and a half Matching Shares for every one Lodged Share at the end of the performance period subject to the satisfaction of the performance target.
The requirement for compulsory investment under the COIP will cease once the value of all shares held by a participant reaches a value equal to 200% of base salary.
This level of shareholding must be maintained.
In December 2011, the Remuneration Committee and the Board approved changes to the COIP which will take effect for awards made in respect of the 2011 12 bonus year.
These will increase the level of mandatory investment to 25% of gross base salary, reduce the maximum match from three and a half Matching Shares to two Matching Shares for every one Lodged Share and include claw-back rights in respect of the Lodged Shares.
The number of Lodged Shares held by each Executive Director and the percentage of base salary that represents based on a market value of 39.89p per share as at 30 September 2011 is detailed below: Number of Lodged Percentage of Name Shares held base salary Sam Weihagen 101,715 5.4 Paul Hollingworth 103,897 8.6 Vesting of awards under long-term incentive plans The performance measurement period in respect of awards granted under the PSP and COIP in 2008 ended during the Year.
As the targets had not been met, the Committee determined that no part of the awards would vest.
At its meeting in October 2011, the Committee made the same determination in respect of PSP and COIP awards granted in 2009 as it was clear that these targets would similarly not be met.
Under the terms of Manny Fontenla-Novoas departure, none of his Matching Shares, awarded under the COIP, vested.
Award grants in 2011 12 It is intended to make awards under the PSP and COIP in the current fi financial year.
Performance conditions attached to long-term incentive plans Following the consultation, the Board sought shareholder approval for new performance targets to attach to PSP and COIP awards at the AGM on 25 March 2010.
This resolution was passed with 99.8% of the vote.
The Committee adopted these targets for awards granted in February 2010.
Following a review of the continued appropriateness of these targets, the Committee concluded that they remained appropriate and adopted these targets again for awards granted in January 2011.
The Committee will review the performance conditions attached to any future awards to ensure they are stretching and that the interests of the Executive Directors and senior management are aligned with shareholders.
It is currently intended that further awards granted during the current fi financial year will have the same performance targets as were attached to awards granted in February 2010 and January 2011.
Details of the performance targets attached to each PSP and COIP award are detailed in the table opposite.
A further explanation of the selection of the different performance measures is given on page 64.

directors report: 64 remuneration report Remuneration report continued Total shareholder return The Committee selected relative TSR as a performance condition under the PSP and the COIP as it considered it to be aligned with shareholder interests.
The TSR performance of the Company is measured relative to that of companies in the following comparator groups: PSP 2008 and 2009: the comparator group consists of the 50 companies at the bottom of the FTSE 100 and the 50 companies at the top of the FTSE 250 the FTSE comparator group.
This was chosen as it is a broad group of companies of similar size and against which the performance of the Companys management should be judged: and PSP and COIP 2010 and 2011: two comparator groups as follows: the FTSE comparator group: and a tailored peer group of international travel operators see details below.
The Committee believes that this second comparator group improves the relevance of the performance target to participants.
The constituent members of both of the comparator groups are determined on the date the awards are made.
At the end of the performance period, TSR calculations will be performed by the Companys external advisers using the 90-day average share price at the start and end of the performance period.
The sector specifi c comparator group applied to the 2010 and 2011 PSP and COIP awards consists of the following companies: Company name Country of main listing Company name Country of main listing Accor SA France Air Berlin PLC Germany Air France KLM SA France Avis Budget Group Inc US 1 2 Avis Europe plc UK British Airways Plc UK Carnival Corp US Deutsche Lufthansa AG Germany easyJet plc UK Expedia Inc US Flight Centre Limited Australia Hogg Robinson Group plc UK Holidaybreak plc UK Intercontinental Hotels Group PLC UK Kuoni Reisen Holding AG Switzerland Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc UK Priceline.

Under the terms of the PSP and COIPs performance targets the position of Avis was established at the date the scheme of arrangement became effective and its position frozen.
2 British Airways Plc BA delisted from the London Stock Exchange on 24 January 2011 following its merger with Iberia.
Under the terms of the PSP and COIPs performance targets the position of BA was established at the date of the merger and its position frozen.
Earnings per share The Committee selected EPS as a performance condition under the PSP and the COIP as it is regarded as a good refl ector of business performance.
PSP and COIP 2008 and 2009: the Committee was advised that an absolute target was considered more appropriate than a percentage growth target as there was little historic data for the Company, having only been established in 2007.
The EPS target range was set by reference to early consensus forecasts.
PSP and COIP 2010 and 2011: the EPS target was set as a compound annual growth rate over a three-year period.
EPS will be derived from the income statement for the last fi financial year ending prior to the end of the performance period.
Return on invested capital ROIC in relation to the COIP: ROIC was chosen to measure the effi ciency of the use of the Groups capital in achieving the underlying earnings target.
The ROIC ranges were set by reference to the Weighted Average Cost of Capital used by the Group for the purposes of impairment testing.
ROIC will be calculated over the three-year performance period by taking the post tax operating profi t over the performance period and dividing this by the sum of the opening capital for each year in the period.
Change of control and other circumstances In the event of a change of control, the awards under both the PSP and COIP shall vest at the Committees discretion taking into account the period of time for which the award has been held by participants and the extent to which performance conditions have been achieved since the award date after an independent valuation of performance to date.

Directors Report: Business Review Directors Report: Governance Financial Statements 65 Funding of share plans It is the Companys current intention to satisfy the requirements of its share plans in the method best suited to the interests of the Company, either by acquiring shares in the market or, subject to institutional shareholder guidelines, issuing new shares.
The Committee has agreed that it is prudent and appropriate to hedge the shares awarded under the PSP and the matching element awarded under the COIP.
As at 30 September 2011, 3,863,970 shares were held in the Thomas Cook Group plc 2007 Employee Benefit Trust, which represents 13% of share incentive awards held on that date and 0.4% of the total issued share capital.
The level of hedging will be kept under review.
Subject to the rules of the plans, awards cannot be made if awards under any discretionary employee share plan operated by Thomas Cook Group plc in the preceding ten-year period would exceed 5% of the Companys issued share capital at that time.
The Trustee would not normally vote at general meetings on the Thomas Cook Group plc shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust and did not vote at the AGM held in February 2011.
Service contracts Each of the Executive Directors, who served during the Year, has or had a service contract with the Company or one of its subsidiary companies.
The date of the current service contract and notice period for each Executive Director are set out below: Name Date of contract current directors Sam Weihagen 2 August 2011 Paul Hollingworth 12 November 2009 former directors Manny Fontenla-Novoa 30 January 2008 During the Year Sam Weihagen has served under three different contracts: Up to 31 December 2010: Chief Executive Officer, Northern Europe and Deputy to the Group Chief Executive Officer: 1 January to 1 August 2011: Deputy Group Chief Executive Officer: and 2 August 2011 onwards: Group Chief Executive Officer interim.
The notice period for Sam Weihagen serving in this role is three months, but the stated intention of the parties is that the appointment shall last until a successor is selected.
The notice period for Paul Hollingworth is 12 months.
The Committee believes that this is appropriate given the need to retain the specialist skills that the Executive Directors bring to the business and to achieve continuity in the Companys senior management.
Either the Executive Director or the Company may terminate employment by giving the relevant period of written notice and the Company may pay compensation in lieu of notice.
Under its terms of reference, it is the Committees responsibility to determine the basis on which the employment of an Executive Director is terminated.
The Committee aims to avoid rewarding poor performance and to take a robust line on reducing compensation to reflect any obligation to mitigate loss on the part of the departing Executive Director.
There is no clause in the Executive Directors contracts providing them with additional protection in the form of compensation for severance as a result of change of control.
Manny Fontenla-Novoa served as an Executive Director until his resignation as Group Chief Executive Officer with effect from 2 August 2011.
His employment was subsequently terminated in line with contractual terms which provided for a notice period of 12 months or payment in lieu thereof.
External appointments The Company recognises the benefits to the individual, and to the Group, of Executive Directors taking on external appointments as non-executive directors.
Subject to the approval of the Committee and to such conditions as the Committee may, in its discretion, attach, an Executive Director may accept such appointments at other companies or similar advisory or consultative roles.
The Committee has set a limit of one external appointment for each Executive Director, to a FTSE 100 or FTSE 250 company, or an international company of a similar size, unless there is justification for a further appointment.
Paul Hollingworth, Group Chief Financial Officer, is a non-executive director of Electrocomponents plc.
For the Year he received a fee of 53,750 from Electrocomponents plc, which he is allowed to retain.
Non-Executive Directors The Committee is responsible for determining the fees for the Chairman of the Company.
The fees for the other Non-Executive Directors are set by the Board.
No Director votes on his or her own remuneration.
The Non-Executive Directors fees were reviewed during the Year.
The fees were benchmarked against other companies in the FTSE 350 and, following the review, it was agreed that no increase in the fees should be made, but a further review will take place in 2012.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any bonus plans, are not eligible to participate in any long-term incentive plans and no pension contributions are made on their behalf.
