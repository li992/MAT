57 GOVERNANCE Directors Remuneration Report Variable remuneration in 2011 ANNUAL BONUS The performance measures were the same as for the previous year and the targets and results are as follows: Measure Weighting Target range Achieved EPS 50% 95% - 105% 45.1% ROCE 30% 95% - 105% 16.8% Personal objectives 20% 0% - 20% 10%-14% The evaluation of personal objectives involved the Remuneration Committee considering personal development and performance by the executive eirectors on a balanced scorecard of measures, including the following main topics: Market outperformance: Risk monitoring: Health and safety: Integration of BSS: Global sourcing initiatives: Category management capability: Supply chain optimisation: Succession.
The Remuneration Committee assessed the specific achievements against these objectives by reviewing the detailed measures attached to each one as well as reviewing the performance of each director overall.
The annual bonus for each of the executive directors is as follows: % bonus Full bonus Cash bonus Deferred in shares John Carter 75.9 291,760 218,820 9,106 Geoff Cooper 91.1 582,498 435,873 18,180 Paul Hampden Smith 71.9 276,384 207,288 8,626 PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN The targets set in 2008 were not met and no awards vested in 2011.
This is disappointing as the Company has out-performed its competitors and the share price has risen significantly.
It does serve as a reminder that stretching targets are difficult to achieve in difficult economic circumstances.
SHARE MATCHING SCHEME There was partial vesting at 51% of the full awards made in 2008.
The participants have also benefitted from the increase in the share price along with other shareholders.
ALL EMPLOYEE SHARE PLANS Over 2,100 colleagues shared a record pay-out of more than 17 million under the Sharesave scheme.
None of the executive directors received this benefit as their savings and share options under the scheme do not mature until December 2013.
EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION AWARDS Executive share options granted in 2008 vested during the year for over 100 senior managers.
The executive directors were excluded from this one-off award.
The Board believes that wider employee share ownership benefits the Company and strengthens the link between shareholders and group employees.
In 2011 the success of the two schemes previously mentioned, along with our Buy as You Earn scheme has created many more employee shareholders.
Variable remuneration in 2012 As mentioned above, we do not propose any fundamental change to the current remuneration structure during 2012, but we are conducting a full review with our new advisers.
58 TRA VIS PERKINS ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2011 ANNUAL BONUS The compulsory deferral of 25% of the bonus in shares remains.
Performance will be assessed against agreed budgets and the weighting will be as follows.
The weighting is unchanged from 2011.
Measure Weighting EPS 50% ROCE 30% Personal objectives 20% PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN The maximum award levels will be 150% of basic salary for each of the executive directors.
The performance targets will be Aggregate Cashflow, Relative Total Shareholder Return TSR and Adjusted Earnings per Share EPS with the same relative weighting as last year.
Measure Rationale Weighting Aggregate cashflow Reinforces importance of cash generation at a time when the Group wishes to reduce the financial leverage taken on in respect of acquisitions 40% Relative TSR External measure of shareholder value 20% EPS growth A reasonable and well understood proxy for an increase in shareholder value for the benefit of all shareholders, provided undue leverage is controlled 40% Range Aggregate cashflow over three years up to 2014 Three aggregate cash flow targets No vesting below lower target 761m - 841m Straight line increase until full vesting at upper target Company TSR relative to FTSE250 Index Median top 50% 30% vests Upper quartile top 25% 100% vests Straight-line between these points EPS growth RPI 3% p. a.
100% vests Straight-line between these points The Earnings Per Share targets are calculated on a compound annual basis and include the increase in the Retail Prices Index RPI.
Although RPI is forecast to reduce in the next 3 years, it has remained stubbornly high for some time.
If it reduces to average 3% over the next 3 years the aggregate EPS growth will have to be 44% in 3 years time for this part of the award to vest in full.
Given the current economic climate, this would represent an outstanding achievement.
SHARE MATCHING SCHEME Once again the maximum investment will be 50% of post-tax salary and the other features of the scheme will also be unchanged.
The performance target will be Cash Return on Capital Employed CROCE.

FTSE150-250: individual performance, experience and contribution.
Benefits market competitive: linked to benefits for other group employees.
Pension where appropriate, membership of a group pension scheme: alternative cash allowance or top-up at 25% of all or part of basic salary.
Variable remuneration Annual bonus Targets reviewed each year: on target bonus for CEO 60% of salary: max bonus for CEO 120% of salary: on target bonus for other directors 50% of salary: max bonus for other directors 100% of salary: compulsory deferral of 25% of bonus in Company shares and paid after 3 years, subject to continued employment.
Performance share plan Awards made each year: max value of award 150% of salary: awards vest after 3 years subject to achievement of a range of performance targets and continuing employment: current performance targets are EPS growth, TSR and Aggregate Cash Flow each with a vesting range.
Share matching scheme Voluntary investment by director in Company shares from own resources: max investment equal to 50% of post-tax salary: matching shares awarded after 3 years provided that investment shares are still held, performance targets are met and director continues in employment: matching shares of up to 2 for each 1 investment share held plus grossing up for tax:.
