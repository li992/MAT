Accounts Go Gov five errn nanc ance e Business review Overview MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 5HPXQHUDWLRQ UHSRUW 5HPXQHUDWLRQ SROLFLHV DQG SULQFLSOHV General remuneration principles The Committee is responsible for formulating remuneration policies and principles that promote the success of the Company in creating value for shareholders over the longer term, through alignment with the corporate objectives and business strategy after taking into full account the associated risks.
The Committee understands that it is accountable to shareholders for the decisions made on Executive remuneration and seeks to maintain open and constructive communication where changes on remuneration policy are being proposed.
The remuneration policy for the Companys Executive Directors and other group senior executives is shaped by the requirement to align the interests and individual performance of the Senior Executive team with those of MITIEs shareholders.
The policy has particular regard to the Companys and the groups long-standing culture of encouraging equity ownership in order to achieve this alignment.
The Committee, and the Board, continue to believe that the principle of equity incentivisation has been a key driving force in the past success of the group.
Consequently, in order to maintain and further develop MITIEs performance culture, the Committee believes that the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors should continue to contain significant performance-related equity-based elements.
The Remuneration Committee believes exceptional performance should be matched with appropriate remuneration to attract, retain and motivate Directors and management while being mindful of the behaviour that such packages create.
The Committee ensures that packages are linked to and support the long-term performance of the Company.
Remuneration policy The remuneration policy of the Company promotes and embeds the Companys remuneration principles.
The Companys policy is: Performance linked Company performance determines a significant element of remuneration packages.
Only top-end performance can achieve the stretching targets that are reflected in the performance-linked pay elements of the packages.
Shareholder aligned The discretionary share schemes are based on EPS growth aligning the interests of shareholders and the members of the senior executive team.
Bonuses are structured to reward the attainment of the strategic target of long-term sustainable, profitable growth.
Comprehensive and simple The overall remuneration policy is comprehensive without becoming overcomplicated and encourages Executives to concentrate on growth of the group.
The Remuneration Committee believes, and is satisfied that, the remuneration policy is appropriate and takes account of the groups performance and strategic objectives.
The Committee plans to continue to use this approach and policy as a framework for the setting of future packages, whilst having due regard for the remuneration packages offered across the group and the external market.
Share ownership policy A share ownership policy for Executive Directors was introduced in 2007 at the same time as the LTIP.
Under this policy, all Executive Directors are required, over time, to build and maintain a shareholding in the Company worth 100% of base salary 150% of salary for any Executive Director who is granted an LTIP award of more than 100% of base salary.
The Committee recognises that the principal mechanism for building up this holding will be on the exercise of LTIP awards and accordingly, until such time as the shareholding requirement is met, Executive Directors will be expected to retain no fewer than 50% of shares net of taxes that vest under the LTIP.

MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011.
H HOHPHQWV RI [HFXWLYH 'LUHFWRU 5HPXQHUDWLRQ The overall package for Executive Directors consists of a fixed element salary and certain benefits and a variable element annual performance-related bonus and long-term equity based incentives and has been structured in order to align the Executive Directors packages with the interests of shareholders.
The Committee tests the remuneration structure regularly to ensure that it remains aligned with business needs and is appropriately positioned relative to the market.
The balance between the fixed and variable elements of the Executive Directors packages is set out below.
Base salary Benchmarking is conducted by external remuneration consultants against sector and size comparators, in respect of base salary, total cash ie salary plus bonus and total remuneration.
The Committee also takes account of a range of other factors when determining appropriate salary levels including market conditions and the responsibilities and skills of the individual Directors.
The Executive Directors received salary increases during the year that took account of the range of factors described above the continued growth and performance of the group and the performance of the individual executive directors, with due consideration of the outcomes of the benchmarking exercise.
Annual bonus Variable remuneration is designed to drive MITIEs performance and be aligned to the group strategic objective of achieving long-term sustainable, profitable growth.
The annual bonus rewards mainly short-term Company performance but also has a link to longer-term performance through partial delivery in MITIE Group PLC shares.
During 2010 11, Executive Directors had the opportunity to earn bonuses of up to 125% of salary, with any bonus earned above 100% of salary deferred into MITIE Group PLC shares for two years and forfeited should the Director leave the 62 business during this period.
As in the previous year, up to100% of salary could be earned for the achievement of group 63 budgeted financial performance and, following an amendment by the Remuneration Committee in May 2010, the 25% additional level of bonus for 2010 11 would be assessed on a series of non-financial strategic targets.
In setting the nonfinancial strategic targets, the Remuneration Committee had due consideration of the longer-term success of the Company and the aligning of interests with shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee continue to believe that the performance targets for the annual bonus are sufficiently stretching for the maximum bonus payment.
During the year under review, MITIE achieved the financial performance target in full and 100% of base salary was paid in cash.
The Remuneration Committee decided that significant overall progress had been achieved on the nonfinancial strategic targets and therefore awarded a further 25% of base salary, deferred into MITIE Group PLC shares for two years.
As at the date of the report, the Committee expects the annual bonus structure for 2011 12 to remain broadly unchanged.
Share-based incentives The remuneration package reinforces long-term decision making and sustainable profitable growth through the use of share-based incentives.
For Executive Directors and certain senior group executives, the principal methodologies and schemes designed to support this ethos are the Companys LTIP as described on page 65 and the Share Ownership Policy as described on page 62.
Vesting of share awards under the LTIP are based on performance measured over three years.
This period is considered appropriate to align rewards to Executive Directors with the strategic objectives of the Company.
Certain Executive Directors still retain options granted under the ESOS details of the holdings are set out in Table 4 of Section B below.
It is the intention of the Committee not to issue further ESOS options to Executive Directors, although ESOS continues to be used to reward and incentivise certain other members of the senior group executive and management teams.
Details of the amendments to share schemes applicable below Board level are detailed on page 65.

[HFXWLYH 'LUHFWRUV VHUYLFH FRQWUDFWV All Directors are appointed for an indeterminate period of office but are subject to annual re-election at the AGM in accordance with the New Code.
The Executive Directors service contracts are available for inspection at MITIEs registered office, the head office and at the AGM.
All the Executive Directors have rolling service contracts which provide for a maximum of 12 months notice from either party.

The dates of the service contracts of the Executive Directors are set out below: Table 2: Executive Directors service contracts Date of Contract term agreement Notice period R McGregor-Smith Rolling contract 01-Apr-03 12 months S C Baxter Rolling contract 10-Apr-06 12 months W Robson Rolling contract 01-Apr-03 12 months 3ROLF RQ H[WHUQDO DSSRLQWPHQWV The Board recognises that the appointment of Executive Directors to non-executive positions at other companies can be beneficial both for the individual Director and the group through the broadening of their experience and knowledge.
Ruby McGregor-Smith receives fees of 51,000 per annum in respect of her role as a Non-Executive Director of Michael Page International plc.
As set out in the Directors and Governance Report, Executive Directors are entitled to retain any fees earned from external appointments.
1RQ [HFXWLYH 'LUHFWRUV Non-Executive Directors fees The fee level is designed both to recognise the contribution and responsibilities of the role and to attract individuals with the experience and skills required to contribute to the future development of the Board and the group.

The group currently operates three equity-based incentive schemes as set out below.
The Board is proposing the renewal of scheme rules where indicated below and the introduction of new schemes as detailed.
The interests of the Executive Directors in each of these schemes is set out in Tables 4 and 5 of Section B below.
2001 SAYE Scheme 2001 SAYE The 2001 SAYE Scheme is the Companys non-discretionary option scheme open to all eligible employees and is approved for HMRC purposes.
Salary deductions are made and savings are used to purchase the options at the end of the three-year period.
No options have been issued to any Directors under the 2001 SAYE Scheme.
An award may not be granted under the 2001 SAYE Scheme rules after September 2011, when the scheme expires.
Following a review by the Remuneration Committee, the Board continues to believe that the SAYE Scheme encourages equity participation for all employees and proposes the introduction of new SAYE Scheme rules 2011 SAYE, details of which can be found in the Notice of AGM.
In addition to the introduction of the 2011 SAYE, the Board proposes the introduction of a new Share Incentive Plan 2011 SIP which allows employees to use their salary to purchase shares in the Company.
Further details of the scheme are found in the Notice of AGM.
2001 Executive Share Option Scheme 2001 ESOS The 2001 ESOS is a discretionary scheme and therefore not open to all employees of the group.
The award of options under the 2001 ESOS is generally focused towards employees who are below main Board level and who do not 64 participate in the LTIP.
Currently, 2001 ESOS is used to retain, reward and motivate employees with continuous service of six months who are part of the leadership team of the group includes senior managers, managers and team leaders.
65 The scheme has been approved by HMRC and options over shares to an individual limit of 30,000 can be awarded in the approved element of the scheme.
Above 30,000, options are awarded under the unapproved for HMRC purposes section of the scheme.
Overall, awards are limited to 100% of an individuals base salary.
Following changes to the scheme approved by shareholders at the 2007 AGM, the ESOS has a single performance threshold for vesting of the options average growth in earnings per share over the three-year vesting period must exceed inflation measured as RPI plus 4% per annum.
The scheme permits the grant of share appreciation rights and the settlement of outstanding unapproved options with share appreciation rights.
No price is payable upon award in respect of 2001 ESOS.
As a result of the review of equity schemes by the Remuneration Committee, the Board is recommending an introduction of new ESOS rules 2011 ESOS which are broadly consistent with the 2001 ESOS, as detailed in the Notice of AGM.
The Board feels that the scheme continues to offer incentive and motivation to those employees below main Board level and proposes to continue with awards on the basis explained above.
The share options detailed in Table 4 of Section B were granted to Executive Directors prior to 2007 under the 2001 ESOS and the performance conditions that applied at the date of grant required a percentage growth in the Companys earnings per share equal to or in excess of 10% per annum compound over the period from the date of grant of the option to the date on which the option first became exercisable.
The performance conditions relating to the awards to Directors detailed below are the same as for any other member of the schemes who received awards at the same time.
Since the grant to Ruby McGregor-Smith and Suzanne Baxter detailed in Table 4 of Section B, there have been no grants to Directors under the 2001 ESOS both under the unapproved part and the HMRC-approved part, and it is the Committees current policy that equity-based incentives for Directors will be based solely upon LTIP awards.
Long-term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP is a discretionary scheme and therefore not open to all employees of the group.
The LTIP is focused on incentivising Executive Directors and senior management.
Awards under the LTIP may be made, either through a joint-ownership structure or through direct grants, in the form of nil-cost options, conditional shares or forfeitable shares.
The Committee may also decide to grant cash-based awards of an equivalent value to share-based awards or to satisfy share-based awards in cash, although it does not currently intend to do so.
An award may not be granted under the current LTIP after 26 July 2017, when the current scheme expires.
No payment other than in respect of any individual recipient electing to pay income tax and national insurance, where appropriate is required for the grant of an award.
Awards are not transferable, except on death, and are not pensionable.
The scheme rules, in line with standard industry practice, contain provision for pro-rata vesting in the event of retirement, redundancy, disability and or death.
In the event of a change of control of the group, awards will be pro-rated both for time and performance, subject to the discretion of the Committee.
The upper limit on the market value as at grant of awards that an individual Executive Director may receive in any financial year is 200% of annual base salary.
In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment, the rules currently allow for awards of up to 250% of any employees annual base salary.
Accounts Go Gov five errn nanc ance e Business review Overview MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 5HPXQHUDWLRQ UHSRUW The Committee continues to believe that EPS is the most appropriate long-term performance measure for MITIE as it is aligned with the groups strategy and KPIs.
This performance criterion has the advantages of simplicity and transparency which the Committee believes enhance the LTIPs effectiveness as an incentive.
Awards will normally vest after three years provided that certain performance criteria have been met.
All awards are subject to performance conditions that require adjusted EPS, less inflation measured by the retail prices index RPI, to exceed certain performance thresholds over a three-year period.
Where EPS growth is less than a lower performance threshold no awards will vest, awards vest in full when EPS growth is equal to, or more than, an upper performance threshold, vesting is on a straight-line basis for performance between these levels.
For LTIP awards granted in 2010, the lower performance threshold at which 25% of an award vests is RPI 5% per annum and the upper performance threshold is RPI 10% per annum.
Table 5 in Section B provides details of the performance targets governing the vesting of LTIP awards granted in prior years.
As announced on 30 March 2010, the Committee approved the accelerated vesting of LTIP awards granted in 2007, in line with the plan rules.
This decision was taken by the Committee after thorough and considered reflection and did not result in any additional costs to the Company.
The upper performance threshold applicable to the 2007 LTIP award was assessed to have been achieved and consequently the awards granted in 2007 vested in full.
On 26 July 2010 the normal vesting date, the Committee assessed the extent to which the performance conditions applicable to the award had been satisfied, confirming that no shares were to be clawed-back and approved the transfer of legal title.
LTIP awards granted to, and exercised by, the Executive Directors are set out in Table 5 of Section B below.
Share dilution The Company manages dilution rates within the ABI guidelines of 10% of issued Ordinary share capital in respect of all-employee schemes and discretionary schemes the LTIP, ESOS and SAYE and 5% in respect of discretionary schemes the LTIP and ESOS.
In calculating compliance with these guidelines the Company allocates available headroom on a ten-year flat-line basis, making adjustments for projected lapse rates and projected increases in issued share capital.
LTIP awards are satisfied through the market purchase of shares held by the MITIE Group PLC Employee Benefit Trust 2007 and the MITIE Group PLC Employee Benefit Trust 2008.
The potential dilution of the Companys issued share capital is set out below in respect of all outstanding awards granted under the Companys equity-based incentive schemes which are to be satisfied through the allotment of new shares.

The Committee is of the opinion that these comparators provide a clear picture of the performance of MITIE relative to a range of companies of comparable size as well as a specific group of companies within the same sector.
Total shareholder return is calculated according to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 and assumes that all dividends are reinvested.

The Company made contributions to the groups defined benefit scheme on behalf of the three Directors who are members of the scheme at a rate of 10% 2010: 10% of the value of the benefit cap of 123,600.
In addition, the three directors received a salary supplement of 20% of salary 2010: 20% in lieu of pension contributions following approval of the Remuneration Committee, in order to bring the value of their benefits in line with market practice.
Suzanne Baxter is not a member of the MITIE Group PLC Defined Benefit Pension Scheme as the scheme was closed to new entrants in 2005, before she joined the group.
It is the intention of the Remuneration Committee that the value of the pension benefits provided to Suzanne Baxter should mirror the value of the pension benefits provided to the other Executive Directors under the capped defined benefit arrangements, albeit that her benefits are provided through a separate defined contribution arrangement.
Following an assessment of the value of her defined contribution pension scheme assets as at 31 March 2010, no pension contributions were required for Suzanne Baxter for the year ended 31 March 2011 2010: 13.5% of base salary.
In addition, Suzanne Baxter received a salary supplement of 20% of base salary 2010: 20% in lieu of pension contributions following approval of the Remuneration Committee, in order to bring the value of her benefits in line with market practice.
