The figures shown for the increase in accrued pension over the year exclude any increase for inflation.
The accumulated accrued pension is that which would be paid annually on retirement from normal pension age, based on service to 31 December 2011.
A lump sum death benefit of four times basic annual salary is payable on death in service.
A dependants pension of one-half of prospective pension is payable on death in service, and of one-half of pre-commutation pension on death in retirement.
Post-retirement increases are applied at the rate of increase of the RPI up to a maximum of 5% per annum, except that for pension benefits in respect of pensionable service up to 15 May 2000 the minimum inflationary increase is 4.5% per annum.
The pensionable salary used to calculate benefits in the defined benefit scheme for PI France and JM Davis is restricted to a scheme specific earnings cap which is currently 123,600.
The figures shown for RH Arnold are in respect of his membership of the Rotork Controls Inc. pension scheme and a supplemental executive retirement plan so that, in aggregate, the pension arrangements for RH Arnold will provide a pension of at least 60% of uncapped basic salary at age 65.

The figures shown for the increase in accrued pension over the year incorporate the increase for inflation.
The transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the relevant Technical Actuarial Standards TASs published by the Board for Actuarial Standards.
The increase in accrued pension and the increase in transfer value over the year for RH Arnold are due to movements in the US dollar relative to sterling.
In US dollars, the accrued pension for RH Arnold increased from $168,344 per annum at 31 December 2010 to $179,195 per annum at 31 December 2011 and the transfer value increased from $2,198,000 at 31 December 2010 to $2,503,000 at 31 December 2011.
The transfer value of accrued pension for RH Arnold reflects the benefits provided by the US scheme together with a US valuation of these benefits and is therefore not directly comparable with the transfer values for directors in the UK scheme.
