No director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.
Shareholding guideline A shareholding guideline is in place for executive directors and certain senior managers, who are required to build up a holding of shares in the Company over a period of five years.
The shareholdings may include shares received through earlier grants under the Companys share option schemes and or the LTIP and or the DAB and, in the case of executive directors and members of the Executive Committee, the required holding is 100% of base salary.
Notes Incentive arrangements 2010 bonus was limited to 125% of base salary under the DAB rules 2011 bonus is within the new limit of 150% of base salary approved by the Remuneration Committee for 2011 onwards The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that individuals are fairly rewarded for their contribution to the success of the Group.
There are four key incentive schemes in operation across the workforce as a whole.
These are the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan DAB and All bonuses are subject to a performance multiplier on an individual basis but remain subject to the overall limit of 150% Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP for executive directors and senior managers and the Employee Equity Plan and Annual Bonus Plan for all other employees.
These plans provide alignment between remuneration and the financial performance of the Group and strengthen retention For 2012, the Committee has decided to adopt the same bonus target arrangement so that 50% of bonus will be dependent on achieving a of key employees through deferment of bonus.
Option grants to executive directors ceased in 2006 although the facility to grant options US dollar revenue target and 50% on achieving a NOP target calculated at the Group budget exchange rate of 1:US$1.60.
The Committee exists in exceptional circumstances and the move away from options to restricted shares for all employees reduces potential dilution and has believes that these targets have been set at levels that are challenging but achievable at high rates of performance.
Since 2007, variable remuneration for executive directors and certain senior managers has consisted of two performance-related elements: annual bonus under the DAB and an annual conditional award under the LTIP.
At EPS growth equal to the increase in the Consumer Prices Index CPI plus 4% per annum, the deferred shares will be matched on a 0.3:1 basis, rising to 2:1 when EPS growth is in excess of CPI plus 12% per annum.
These targets are directly related to the Groups financial Deferred Annual Bonus Plan DAB results and encourage achievement of the Groups short-term financial goals, while the deferral and matching elements encourage a longer There is a strong variable element to executive directors remuneration and for 2011 a bonus of up to a maximum of 150% of base salary term view of the success of the Group.
The deferred shares can be forfeited in the event of gross misconduct and the matching shares are after application of a personal performance multiplier which flexes the payment by 0.75 to 1.25 could be earned through the DAB if all subject to forfeiture for bad leavers.

The normalised operating profit NOP target range was from zero payout at 164.2 million up to 25% at permitted.
The performance conditions are based on the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR when measured against that of two 182.8 million and 50% at 202.5 million, all at the Group budget exchange rate of 1:US$1.60.
Actual NOP for 2011 was 218.8 million, again comparator groups each testing half of the shares comprised in the award.

It is to the credit of the executive team and all employees that these targets were exceeded in such a potentially difficult year.
The bonuses payable to each executive director in respect of The performance criteria provide the link to performance against appropriate peer groups.
For each comparator group, the number of shares performance during 2011 are shown later in this report and are all at 150% of base salary, half of which was compulsorily deferred into shares that may vest may be up to a maximum of 200% of the relevant half of the shares comprised in the conditional award if the Companys TSR for three years.
Each of the executive directors achieved a personal performance multiplier in excess of 1.2. ranks in the upper decile, 50% of the relevant half of the shares will vest in the event of median performance and between median and upper decile performance vesting will increase on a straight-line basis.
Additional shares may vest to cover dividends paid by the Company during The personal performance multiplier depends on the achievement of pre-determined objectives which are reviewed and approved by the the performance period.

Management Charter which is designed to foster employee development, understanding of the overall vision and strategy of the Group and good governance.
There is compulsory deferral into shares of 50% of the bonus earned and an opportunity to earn an equity match of up to 2:1, subject to achievement of an EPS performance condition.
At the end of the three year deferral period the shares and any matching shares earned are satisfied through the issue of new shares any treasury shares available would be used first.
Shares representing the deferred element of bonus earned in 2008 and awarded in 2009 vested in February 2012, with the maximum 2:1 ratio of matching shares being triggered.
This ratio was achieved because EPS growth was greater than CPI plus 12% per annum for each of the three years making up the performance period.
