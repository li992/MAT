Governance Ladbrokes plc 31 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Governance Directors remuneration report Dear Shareholder In my letter last year, I outlined the planned changes to our remuneration structure, and I am pleased to report that these have been fully implemented in 2011.
As a result of the changes, long-term incentive arrangements now include a wider group of participants, and the level of awards granted to individuals are well differentiated to reflect their personal contribution to both short-term performance and the longer-term strategic objectives of the Company.
2011 was a key development year for the Ladbrokes business.
The Executive team have been fully focused on progressing the strategy laid out in 2010, and the 2011 annual bonus outturns reflect the progress made in the context of a difficult economic climate.
However, the minimum performance targets under the 2009 Performance Share Plan were not met and as a result these awards will not vest.
In 2012, no annual salary increases will be awarded to the Executive Committee, although the wider workforce will be eligible for pay reviews following two years of pay freezes.
The Committee has also reviewed the bonus structure for the forthcoming year, to ensure that it is fully aligned with the Boards objectives to grow profit, in particular in the Digital business.
As a result, the Committee will cap the amount payable under the financial element of the bonus at 60% of maximum unless a significant specified increase in Digital net revenue is achieved.
This cap will apply to the executives and senior management team.
The Committee continues to monitor the practices and reviews taking place in respect of executive remuneration and it intends to follow good practice as it emerges.
We remain committed to transparent reporting of remuneration arrangements and do not believe the remuneration framework in place for Ladbrokes raises environmental, social or governance issues or inadvertently motivates irresponsible behaviours.
The Committee appreciates all feedback from shareholders and hopes to receive your support at the forthcoming AGM.
Christopher J Rodrigues Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Remuneration Committee remit, composition and activities The Ladbrokes Board entrusts the Committee with the responsibility for the remuneration policy in respect of the executive directors andsenior executives.
In setting the remuneration for these groups, the Committee takes into account the pay and conditions of the wider workforce as a matter of course.
Further details in relation to wider workforce pay can be found on page 36.
The Committees main duties are to: determine and agree with the Board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of executive directors, the Chairman and certain senior executives: review the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of the remuneration policy: approve the design of, and determine targets for, any performance-related pay schemes: review the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and shareholders: determine the policy for, and scope of, pension arrangements for each executive director and other designated senior executives: and set the individual remuneration packages of all executive directors, certain senior executives and the Chairman within the agreed policy.

The Chief Executive, the Group HR director and the HR director Reward & Resourcing attend Committee meetings by invitation, other than when their personal remuneration is discussed.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
The Committee met five times during 2011.
S Bailey did not attend one meeting during the year due to other commitments.
The Committee retained independent remuneration consultants Deloitte LLP and has taken advice during the year from them in relation to certain executive remuneration matters.
Deloitte LLP is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and as such voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
Deloitte LLP also provides the Company with internal audit and miscellaneous tax and consulting services.
SJ Berwin LLP, one of the Companys corporate lawyers, has also provided material advice.
The Directors remuneration report has been prepared in accordance with the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 Regulations and meets the relevant requirements of the Financial Services Authoritys Listing Rules.
In forming the remuneration policy, the best practice provisions set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code have been followed, and the guidelines issued by the Association of British Insurers ABI and the National Association of Pension Funds NAPF have been noted.
During 2011 the Committee, amongst other items, considered the following: implementation of the policy changes established in the 2010review: remuneration arrangements for senior hires and departures: determination of short and long-term incentive outcomes based on Company and personal performance of the executive directors and senior executives: and review of the structure, quantum and calibration of the annual bonus and performance share plans for 2012 onwards.
Remuneration policy The principles underlying the remuneration policy are that total remuneration packages should: be aligned with and support the business strategy: enable the Company to attract, retain and motivate key individuals: and be strongly aligned with shareholder value creation.
