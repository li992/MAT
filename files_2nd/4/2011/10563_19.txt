Overview Business review Governance Financial statements REMUNERATION REPORT Introduction by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee I am pleased to introduce this years Remuneration report, following another year of strong performance by the Group.
The Remuneration Committee considers that its approach to aligning management incentives with shareholders interests is helping to produce strong returns that are in the longer term interests of the Group.
We think the changes to some of the performance measures we made last year in particular, the introduction of long-term EBITA and ROCE measurement at Divisional level have enhanced management focus on value creation and provide clearer line-of-sight in relation to the Groups strategy.
In addition, for 2012, we have also included ROCE as an LTIP measure at Group level.
The Committee believes that the Directors are fairly and appropriately remunerated with a significant element of their package being linked to the long-term success of Morgan Crucible.
Shareholders will be aware of the considerable achievement by management of key performance measures over the last three years, not least the upper-quartile growth in shareholder return, including a more than threefold increase in the share price.
This performance has resulted in a maximum vesting of the 2009 LTIP and a 1.8 times match vesting of the 2009 BDSMP, which is subject to very demanding earnings per share EPS growth targets.
Those shares will be released during 2012 at the end of their three-year vesting period and will be detailed in the 2012 Annual Report.
The 2008 LTIP awards were tested for the three-year performance to the end of 2010 and lapsed in full, and hence no long-term shares were released to executive Directors during 2011.
EPS targets continue to be set considering internal and external reference points.
Awards made this year will be on the back of a strong set of financial results.
The Committee believes that the existing 8%-15% pa range for the 2012 LTIP and the 8%-20% pa for the bonus deferral plan represent demanding yet appropriate performance targets over the next three years and remain appropriate for the 2012 award cycle.
ROCE targets have been set using a similar approach with external references and reflecting the returns required to meet and exceed the Groups internal strategic plan.
The target range for Group ROCE has been set at 33%-37% which the Committee believes provides a significant degree of demanding performance.
The Committee feels that, although challenging, the targets it sets are fair, and incentivise both strong earnings growth EPS and high returns on capital ROCE simultaneously, whilst taking proper account of risk.
As with 2011, the Committees approach to setting bonus targets for 2012 is that bonuses are only paid at threshold if Morgan Crucibles profit increases versus the prior years achievement.
The Committee welcomes and carefully considers feedback from shareholders, and particularly the encouragement that overall remuneration should both be in the longer term interests of shareholders and meaningful for management.
I hope you will find this balance appropriately reflected in the report that follows.
Simon Heale Chairman Remuneration Committee Remuneration report The Directors Remuneration report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee the Committee and has been approved by the Board.
Shareholders will be given the opportunity to approve the report at the Annual General Meeting on 8 May 2012.
The report has been drawn up in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 and the UK Listing Authority Listing Rules.
The Remuneration report is divided into two parts.
The first part contains commentary on remuneration policy, which is not required to be audited.
The second part contains the remuneration tables that have been audited in accordance with the relevant statutory requirements.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing Group policy on executive remuneration and for determining, on behalf of the Board, specific remuneration packages for the executive Directors and the Chairman.
The Committees terms of reference are available on our website.
During the year the members of the Committee were: Simon Heale, who is the Chairman of the Committee, Martin Flower, Tim Stevenson and Andrew Given.
Each of the non-executive Directors is regarded by the Board as independent.
Tim Stevenson was independent at the time of his appointment as Chairman of the Board.
The Committee met on five occasions during the year.
Each Committee members attendance at these meetings is set out in the Corporate governance report on page 58.
66 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual Report 2011 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
The Chief Executive Officer and the Director of Human Resources attend meetings of the Committee by invitation.
The Committee also had access to advice from the Chief Financial Officer.
No executive Director or other attendee is present when his or her own remuneration is under consideration.
Kepler Associates was appointed by the Committee in 2010 as its independent executive remuneration advisers and during 2011 provided advice on performance measurement, setting of annual bonus and long-term incentive targets, total shareholder return TSR analysis and provided market data in respect of senior executive remuneration and non-executive Director fees.
Kepler reports directly to the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and provided no other services to the Group during the year.
Remuneration policy The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that all the remuneration packages offered are competitive and designed to attract, retain and motivate executive Directors and senior executives of the right calibre in order to run the Group successfully, and to create value for shareholders.
The Committee takes a longer-term perspective on retention and motivation, and although the short-term is important, the Committees view is that this has to be put in the context of the Groups long-term interests.
The policy of the Committee is to ensure that a significant proportion of the total remuneration opportunity is performance-related, with particular emphasis on long-term performance, and based on the achievement of measurable targets that are relevant to and support the business strategy.
This is in order to create a strong link between performance and reward which should be beneficial to shareholders, employees and the Group.
In assessing all aspects of pay and benefits, the Committee also takes into account the packages offered by similar companies to ensure the remuneration of executive Directors is competitive against the market in which the Company competes for talent.
For the purposes of such analysis, comparator companies are chosen having regard to: business sector: the size of the company eg in terms of market capitalisation, turnover and number of people employed : the diversity and complexity of its businesses: and the geographical spread of its businesses.
The Committee also considers the level of pay and employment conditions throughout the Group when determining executive Directors remuneration.
The Committee believes that the current remuneration structures are appropriate and support the business strategy.
Main components of remuneration The table below summarises the Companys policies in respect of each of the key elements of executive Directors remuneration as they applied during the year.

This is based on the Groups remuneration policy.
Target 50% 25% 25% Stretch 20% 20% 60% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Salary Bonus Long-term incentives Calculated on a projected value basis assuming 10% pa share price growth at target performance and 15% pa share price growth at stretch.
Base salary The base salary for each executive Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the performance of the individual and having regard to practice in FTSE 350 companies of comparable sector, size and complexity.
Salaries are normally reviewed on an annual basis.
In line with the approach being taken across the organisation, executive Directors salaries will be increased in 2012.
In considering the level of increase, the Committee has been mindful of the general level of increase across the Group of 3%, as well as the positioning of roles against the market.
The table below shows the salaries in 2011 and with effect from 1 January 2012.
Salary 2011 2012 Mark Robertshaw 465,000 480,000 Kevin Dangerfield 275,000 285,000 Andrew Hosty 305,000 312,500 Base salary is the only element of the remuneration package that is pensionable.
Annual bonus The targets for the annual bonus are set by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the shortand long-term requirements of the Group.
Challenging goals are set, which must be met before any bonus is paid.
This approach is intended to align executive reward with shareholder return by rewarding the achievement of stretch targets.
The bonus scheme provides the opportunity for executive Directors to earn a bonus of up to 100% of basic salary if stretching performance targets are achieved.
For 2011, the bonus for the CEO and CFO was based on Group profit before taxation and amortisation.
The targets were set to incentivise the executive Directors to manage much more of the income statement to improve the earnings per share of the Group.
For 2011, the bonus for the CEO Morgan Ceramics was balanced between the performance of the Morgan Ceramics Division and the Group as a whole, comprising Group profit before tax and amortisation 30%, Morgan Ceramics EBITA 50% and Morgan Ceramics third-party working capital to sales % 20%.
In addition to the achievement of the targets set, in considering any awards to be made, the Committee also takes into account the quality of the overall performance of the Company.
The bonuses awarded to executive Directors in respect of 2011 were as follows: Mark Robertshaw 100% of salary 2010: 100%.
The awards for the CEO and CFO were made on the basis that in 2011 the maximum Group profit before tax and amortisation target was achieved resulting in a bonus payment of 100% of salary.
The award for the CEO Morgan Ceramics also reflected performance against the Group profit before tax and amortisation target together with a Morgan Ceramics Division EBITA target achieved at the maximum performance level and a Morgan Ceramics Division third-party working capital to sales % target achieved at 87.5% of the target, resulting in a bonus payment of 97.5% of salary.
No changes will be made to the annual bonus opportunity or performance measures for executive Directors in 2012.
68 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual Report 2011 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Long-term incentive arrangements The Committee believes that share ownership by the executive Directors and senior executives helps align their interests with those of shareholders.
Accordingly the Company operates a number of share schemes for the executive Directors and other senior employees, details of which are set out below.
Bonus Deferral Share Matching Plan BDSMP The BDSMP was introduced following shareholder approval in 2008.
This plan operates alongside the other long-term incentive arrangements.
Under the plan rules, participants may be offered the opportunity to defer up to 75% of their annual bonus on a preor post-tax basis into Company shares.
Participants must hold the deferred shares for three years to be eligible for a matching award based on the pre-tax value of their deferred shares.
Matching shares may be earned at the end of three years in the event that stretching EPS targets have been met.
For the bonus earned for the 2010 performance year ie payable in early 2011, participants were given the opportunity to defer up to 50% of their bonus under the Plan.
This was a lower deferral level compared with the 75% deferral opportunity in respect of the bonus earned for the 2009 performance year ie payable in early 2010, as explained in the 2010 Report.
The performance criteria attaching to awards under this plan are disclosed in notes 4, 5 and 6 to the Awards to Directors under the Bonus Deferral Share Matching Plan table on page 75.
For the bonus earned in respect of the 2011 performance year payable in early 2012, participants will be given the opportunity to defer up to 50% of their bonus under the BDSMP.
Targets for the 2011 matching awards were as follows: EPS performance Matching shares 20% pa 3x match 16% pa 2x match 12% pa 1x match 8% pa 0x match There is straight-line vesting between each of the points above.
EPS growth is considered the best measure of performance for the BDSMP, as it provides alignment with Group strategy and good line-of-sight for management.
The reference to RPI was removed for 2011 awards, following consultation with the Groups 10 largest shareholders, as UK Retail Price Inflation is not considered by the Committee to be a relevant benchmark for Morgan Crucibles profit growth, given 84% of sales are generated outside the UK.
The Committee believes that the above targets are appropriately stretching and will continue to review the targets at the start of each award cycle.
During the year under review, 2008 BDSMP awards lapsed in full.
The Committee expects a 1.8 times match vesting under the 2009 BDSMP shares which would, subject to achievement of performance conditions, be released in 2012, in line with the Groups strong EPS performance over the three-year period to 1 January 2012.
Details of the outcome of this award will be disclosed in next years Report.
No changes will be made to the BDSMP opportunity, performance measures or targets in 2012.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP was introduced following shareholder approval in 2004.
It offers executive Directors and other senior executives the opportunity to receive shares as a reward for outstanding performance.
The scheme allows awards of up to 150% of basic salary, although in exceptional circumstances the Committee is able to make awards of up to 200% of basic salary.
The vesting of the awards is subject to the achievement of performance targets measured over the three-year period from the start of the year in which the award is made.
During 2011, an award over 171,068 shares equivalent to 111% of 2010 salary was made to Mark Robertshaw, 97,147 shares equivalent to 100% of 2010 salary were awarded to Kevin Dangerfield, and 102,641 shares equivalent to 100% of 2010 salary were awarded to Andrew Hosty.
For the CEO and CFO, performance for these awards will be based 50% on EPS growth and 50% on TSR relative to the constituents of the FTSE All-Share Industrials Index, as follows: TSR performance against FTSE All-Share Industrials Index % of the award that vests EPS growth % of the award that vests  performance 50% 15% pa 50% Median-ranked performance 15% 8% pa 15% Below-median-ranked performance 0% 8% pa 0% Straight-line vesting applies between each point for both vesting schedules.
Annual Report 2011 The Morgan Crucible Company plc 69 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements REMUNERATION REPORT continued Long Term Incentive Plan continued The Committee must also be satisfied that the Groups underlying financial performance justifies the level of vesting.
To support the Groups Divisional structure, the Committee approved long-term incentive plans for senior Divisional executives tailored to the value creation of each Division.
The LTIP within each Division is therefore based on performance against stretching EBITA growth and ROCE targets.
For the Divisional CEOs, Andrew Hosty and Don Klas, half of their 2011 incentive is linked to Group TSR as for the CEO and CFO and half is based on the relevant Divisional EBITA and ROCE measures.
This combination of measures is considered most appropriate for the Divisional CEOs, reflecting their roles as senior executives within the Group, as well as their roles as heads of Divisions.
The stretching targets reflect the strategic plans within each of these Divisions.
For Andrew Hosty, CEO Morgan Ceramics, the Divisional portion of the 2011 LTIP will only vest if stretching performance is achieved, with no vesting occurring unless EBITA growth in Morgan Ceramics is at least 12% pa and ROCE is 35.7% in 2013: full vesting will occur for EBITA growth of 18% pa and ROCE of 40.7%.
During the year under review, the 2008 LTIP awards lapsed in full.
The Committee expects full vesting of shares under the 2009 LTIP shares which would be released in 2012, in line with the Groups strong EPS and TSR performance over the three-year period to 1 January 2012.
For the awards to be granted in 2012, the Committee considered its desire to have the most relevant balance of measures that reflected feedback from shareholders and directly related to the stretching objectives in the Groups business plan.
The Committee therefore decided on the introduction of a ROCE measure for the 2012-14 performance period.
For the CEO and CFO, TSR, EPS and ROCE performance will be rewarded on an equal one-third basis as follows: % of the % of the % of the award award award TSR performance against FTSE All-Share Industrials Index that vests EPS growth that vests ROCE that vests  performance 33% 15% pa 33% 37% 33% Median-ranked performance 10% 8% pa 10% 33% 10% Below-median-ranked performance 0% 8% pa 0% 33% 0% For the Divisional CEOs, Andrew Hosty and Don Klas, a third of their 2012-14 LTIP will continue to be linked to Group TSR and two thirds will be based on the relevant Divisional EBITA and ROCE performance.
For Andrew Hosty, the Divisional portion of the LTIP will only vest if stretching performance is achieved, with no vesting occurring unless EBITA growth in Morgan Ceramics is at least 6% pa and the average ROCE for the three years ended 2012, 2013 and 2014 Average ROCE is 41%: full vesting will occur for EBITA growth of 15% per annum and Average ROCE of 43.5%.
The details of outstanding awards held by all Directors are shown on page 74.
Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The ESOS was approved by shareholders in 2004 and offers executive Directors and other senior executives the opportunity to receive options granted at the market price of the Companys shares at the time of the grant.
No awards were made under the ESOS in 2011.
There is one outstanding award to Mark Robertshaw, who has a vested option from 2004 that he has not exercised see Directors share options table on page 73.
There is currently no intention to make awards under the ESOS in 2012.
Savings-related Share Option Scheme SAYE As UK employees, the executive Directors may also participate in the Savings-related Share Option Scheme on the same basis as other eligible employees and subject to UK legislation.
Scheme members save a fixed amount per month over three years and options have been granted with an exercise price at 80% of the market price at the date of grant.
Those Directors who received options under this scheme are shown in the table on page 76.
No performance conditions apply to these options as they are a tax-efficient mechanism for all employees to acquire shares in the Company at their own cost.
Other benefits Executive Directors are eligible to receive certain benefits including either a company car or a car allowance, health insurance and, where appropriate, relocation and other expenses.
Shareholding guidelines In order to encourage alignment with shareholders, individual shareholding guidelines are operated for executive Directors and senior executives.
Under such guidelines, executive Directors are encouraged to build and maintain over time a shareholding in the Company equivalent to at least 100% of basic salary.
This policy is supported by the BDSMP under which participants are encouraged to invest their bonus in Company shares.
70 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual Report 2011 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements At the market price on 15 February 2012, Mark Robertshaw, Kevin Dangerfield and Andrew Hosty respectively held shares worth 372%, 246% and 165% of their basic salaries.
More detail on Directors interest in shares are shown on page 72.
Chairman and non-executive Directors Annual fees paid to the Chairman are reviewed on a biennial basis.
Tim Stevenson was appointed as Chairman on 1 December 2006 and the fee was first reviewed in December 2008.
However, in view of the economic conditions at the time, the recommended increase was deferred for 12 months to 1 January 2010 when his fee was increased from 125,000 to 140,000.
The Chairmans fee was next reviewed in December 2011.
A fee increase to 150,000 was recommended with effect from 1 January 2012.
Non-executive Director fees are also reviewed biennially.
Following the biennial review in 2010, the annual fee for non-executive Directors was set at 42,000 pa. Additional payments of 8,000 are made to the Senior Independent Director, the Chairman of the Audit Committee and to the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
No changes were made to non-executive fees during the year.
The Chairman and non-executive Directors are also entitled to reimbursement of expenses incurred in attending Board, strategy and other meetings.
None of the non-executive Directors has a service contract with the Company although they do have letters of appointment which contain no obligations relating to any notice period.
There are no obligations on the Company to make any payments in lieu of notice to any non-executive Director.
The non-executive Directors do not participate in any of the incentive, share or share option plans.
Service contracts Executive Directors are employed on contracts subject to 12 months notice at any time.
Contracts may be terminated on 12 months notice given by the Company or on six months notice given by the Director concerned.
Contracts end on each Directors anticipated normal retirement date.
The following table shows the date of the contract for each executive Director who served during the year.
Date of Date of Executive Director appointment service agreement Kevin Dangerfield 3 August 2006 15 August 2008 Mark Robertshaw 4 August 2006 15 August 2008 Andrew Hosty 28 July 2010 17 August 2010 The service agreements for Mark Robertshaw, Kevin Dangerfield and Andrew Hosty do not contain specific termination provisions.
In the event of early termination, the Company may be liable to pay an amount in damages having regard to salary, bonus and other benefits that would have been received had they served out their notice period.
The value of any termination payment made will be at the judgment of the Committee having regard to all relevant factors including ensuring that the full benefit of mitigation is obtained.
There is no automatic entitlement to bonus as part of the termination arrangements.
Company pensions policy The three executive Directors participate in The Morgan Group Senior Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme which is a contributory, HMRC-registered, defined benefit, funded occupational pension scheme.
With effect from 6 April 2006 the basis of the scheme changed from final salary to career average and the normal pension age increased by five years.
Its main features are now: A normal pension age of 65.
Pension at normal pension age based on two-thirds career average pensionable salary, subject to completion of at least 20 years employment 26 years and eight months for joiners since 2006.
Life assurance of four times basic salary.
Pensionable salary is the members basic salary restricted to a scheme earnings cap of 129,600 for the 2011-12 tax year.
In addition, executive Directors received a pension allowance derived from employer contributions based notionally on the registered scheme pensionable salary in excess of the earnings cap.
The value of the pension allowance for each executive Director is set out in the Directors emoluments table on page 73.
The Committee has also reviewed the impact of the Governments new Annual Allowance limits on pension contributions.
A small number of senior managers are impacted by these changes and Mark Robertshaw is the only Executive Director similarly affected at this time.
The Company is currently involved in a consultation process over consequent changes to the scheme as a result of the new measures.
The Committee decided it wished to provide allowances for those involved, though needs to wait for the outcome of the consultation process with Scheme members before its proposals can be confirmed.
Overall, these allowances will be cost-neutral, and consistent with market practice.
The allowance, if the proposals are confirmed, would be paid from April 2012 and will be reported in next years Remuneration report.
Annual Report 2011 The Morgan Crucible Company plc 71 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements REMUNERATION REPORT continued External directorships With the approval of the Board in each case, and subject to the overriding requirements of the Group, executive Directors may accept external appointments as non-executive Directors of other companies and retain any fees received.

30% of the awards vest for achieved median-ranked performance with full vesting for  performance.
For performance between median and upper quartile, awards vest on a straight-line pro-rata basis.
The share price at the year end was 263.0 pence and the high and low during the year were 357.1 pence and 224.0 pence respectively.
A wards granted to executive Directors in 2008 were subject to relative TSR and EPS.
The EPS target applying to 50% of each award requires three-year EPS growth of RPI 4% pa for 30% of that element to vest rising to full vesting for EPS growth of RPI 10% pa or higher.
The TSR target applying to the other 50% of each award requires Morgan Crucibles three-year TSR performance to rank at median against 17 industrial and engineering comparators for 30% of that element to vest, rising to full vesting if Morgan Crucibles TSR ranks at or above the upper quartile against these peers.
The performance conditions attached to the 2008 LTIP awards were not met and therefore awards lapsed in full.
Awards granted to executive Directors in 2009 were subject to relative TSR.
The TSR target required Morgan Crucibles three-year TSR performance to rank at median against 17 industrial and engineering comparators for 30% of that element to vest, rising to full vesting if Morgan Crucibles TSR ranks at or above the upper quartile against these peers.
At the end of the performance period, Morgan Crucibles TSR performance resulted in 100% vesting.
Vested awards will not be released until the third anniversary of grant 27 February 2012.
Awards granted to executive Directors in 2010 are subject to relative TSR and EPS.
The TSR target applying to the other 50% of each award requires Morgan Crucibles three-year TSR performance to rank at median against 23 industrial and engineering comparators for 30% of that element to vest, rising to full vesting if Morgan Crucibles TSR ranks at or above the upper quartile against these peers.
Awards granted to executive Directors in 2011 are subject to relative TSR and EPS.
The EPS target applying to 50% of each award requires three-year EPS growth year EPS growth above a threshold of 8% pa of that element to vest, commencing at 30% vesting for that element, rising to full vesting for EPS growth of 15% pa or higher.
The TSR target applying to the other 50% of each award requires Morgan Crucibles three-year TSR performance to rank at median against the FTSE All-Share Industrials Index for 30% of that element to vest, rising to full vesting if Morgan Crucibles TSR ranks at or above the upper quartile against the companies in this index.
LTIP awards made in 2010 to Kevin Dangerfield and Andrew Hosty are structured as an Approved Performance Share Plan APSP and comprise three elements: i HM Revenue & Customs HMRC approved options CSOP over shares to the value of up to 30,000 with an exercise price of 205.1 pence per share: ii an LTIP award in the form of a conditional award of free shares to the value of the remainder of the award above this limit: and iii a funding award, also in the form of a conditional award of free shares, over such numbers of shares whose value at exercise at the approved option equals 30,000.
The provisions of these CSOP options, funding awards and LTIP awards are linked so that the maximum aggregate number of shares that can be acquired on exercise of LTIP and CSOP awards the funding award being used to pay the exercise price arising on exercise of the CSOP is limited to that number of shares that had a market value on the date of the awards equal to 100% of Kevin Dangerfields 2009 base salary and 240,000 for Andrew Hosty the limit.
Vested funding awards are not transferred to the participant.
Investment shares represent those shares acquired with a portion of the bonus set out in the emoluments table on page 73 voluntarily deferred into the Bonus Deferral Share Matching Plan.
This is the maximum number of shares based on the pre-tax value of the deferred shares that could be earned at the end of the performance period if the performance condition set out on page 69 is met in full.
In 2008 the executive Directors deferred their bonus payment on a gross basis and in 2009 and 2010 deferral was on a net basis.
In 2011 deferral was on a gross basis, as it will be for 2012.
The flexibility to defer on either basis is within the Plan rules.
Matching awards granted to executive Directors in 2008 and 2010 are subject to three-year EPS growth.
The EPS target requires three-year EPS growth of RPI 4% pa for a 0.25x match, RPI 5% pa for a 0.5x match, RPI 7.5% pa for a 1x match, RPI 10% pa for a 1.75x match and RPI 15% pa or higher for a 3x match.
There is straight-line vesting between these points.
The performance conditions attached to the 2008 BDSMP awards were not met and therefore matching awards lapsed in full.
Matching awards granted to executive Directors in 2009 are subject to three-year EPS growth.
The EPS target requires three-year EPS growth of 4% pa for a 0.25x match, 5% pa for a 0.5x match, 7.5% pa for a 1x match, 10% pa for a 1.75x match and 15% pa or higher for a 3x match.
The performance targets for awards made in 2009 did not reference growth above RPI.
Given the difficult economic climate at that time the Committee considered the targets to be stretching.
Matching awards granted to executive Directors in 2011 are subject to three-year EPS growth.
The EPS target requires three-year EPS growth above a threshold of 8% pa before any matching, 12% pa for a 1x match, 16% pa for a 2x match, and 20% pa or higher for a 3x match.
Note: Prior to 6 April 2010, the Committee amended the terms of the 2008 Investment shares, in line with the plan rules, to allow individuals to crystallise the tax due on their earned deferred bonus awards.
This decision has not resulted in any additional costs to the Company.
The net value of these awards will continue to be held until the normal vesting date.
No amendment has been made to the terms of the matching shares.

T he accrued benefit entitlement for Mark Robertshaw, Kevin Dangerfield and Andrew Hosty is the pension that would be paid annually on retirement based on service at the end of the year.
The transfer values for the pension benefits have been calculated on the basis set by the Trustee of the pension scheme.
The Trustee of the pension scheme is an independent body that is separate from the Company and they must calculate transfer values in accordance with legislation, having taken actuarial advice from an independent adviser.
The assumptions used in the calculation of transfer values depend on market conditions.
Over the year, Government bond yields fell.
This movement increases the assessed transfer values and was much more significant than the increase in accrued benefits over the year.
Members of the pension scheme had the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions.
Neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.
Mark Robertshaw, Kevin Dangerfield and Andrew Hosty also received a pension allowance, details of which are set out in the Directors emoluments table on page 73.
