The guidelines, which as explained last year were simplified in March 2011, require executive directors and other senior executives to retain in the form of shares for at least 2 years at least 35% of any profit made after paying the exercise price and any tax liability on the exercise of 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme options and the vesting of any Performance Share Plan awards.
No further Performance Share Plan awards will be granted to executives who fail to retain shares in accordance with these guidelines.
