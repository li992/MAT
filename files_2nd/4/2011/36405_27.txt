102 Great Portland Estates | Annual Report 2011 Directors remuneration report The Companys remuneration policy seeks to provide remuneration in a form to attract, retain and motivate high calibre executives, with an emphasis on delivering greater variable reward for achieving and exceeding theGroups strategic plan.
Remuneration policy principles The Executive directors total pay is analysed by looking across each of the different elements of remuneration including salary, pension, the annual bonus plan and long-term incentives to provide the Remuneration Committee the Committee with a total remuneration view rather than just the competitiveness of the individual elements.
It is important that the Groups remuneration policy reinforces the Companys goals, providing effective incentives for exceptional Group and individual performance with significant upward and downward variability from median based on performance.
As well as providing motivation to perform, remuneration plays an important retention role and needs to be competitive with alternative employment opportunities, in particular at a time in the property cycle where demands on the Executive Directors and employees are high and there is a scarcity value on proven performers.
To achieve the Companys remuneration policy, the Committee seeks to position total executive remuneration around mid-market for on-target performance taking into account the size and complexity of the business as compared to other peer companies in the sector, using a significant proportion of variable reward with the opportunity to increase total potential remuneration for superior performance through the annual bonus plan and long-term incentives.
Changes in 2010 11 Following shareholders approval at the Annual General Meeting in July 2010 the following changes to the remuneration structure for Executive Directors were implemented: The Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP and Share Matching Plan SMP were simplified so that only one scheme, the 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan the New Plan operates for the award of annual Performance Shares and Matching Shares: a new performance measure for the New Plan was adopted based on relative Total Property Return to ensure that the measures under the New Plan mirrored the fundamental measures that demonstrated the Groups performance being: growth in absolute net asset value per share: relative Total Shareholder Return: and relative Total Property Return.
the level of NAV growth that is required for awards to vest was increased significantly: the maximum award under the unmatched part of the LTIP was increased from 150% of basic salary to 200% of basic salary in order to provide a competitive overall total remuneration package: in order to receive a Matching Share award of up to 100% of basic salary, the Executive Directors were required to buy or pledge existing shares of one-third of basic salary rather than the 30% of salary previously required: and in the year to 31 March 2011 only, Executive Directors were given the opportunity to receive an award of an additional 100% of basic salary by making a further investment of one-third of basic salary in Company shares or pledging the same amount of shares currently held.
The performance conditions in relation to this additional award are considerably more stretching than awards made under the ongoing LTIP.
103 Annual review Financials Governance Charles Irby Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Changes for 2011 12 In considering the Executive Directors reward structure for the year to come, the Committee believes that the relative size of the elements of the variable reward structure and the proposed performance targets in the new incentive arrangement are appropriate in the current market environment.
Composition of total on-target annual Composition of maximum annual 1 Executive Director remuneration Executive Director remuneration 15% 15% 17.5% 17.5% 23.5% 25% 27.5% 29.5% 4% 4% 2011 2012 2011 2012 6% 22% 30% 7% 26% 35% 27% 18.5% 20.5% 29.5% Salary Pension Bonus Performance shares Matching shares 1.
The on-target award level for the bonus plan is assumed to be 75% of salary with a maximum award of 150% assuming the NAV underpin is achieved.
If the NAV underpin is not achieved, the on-target award level for the bonus plan will be 52.5%.
The on-target award for the Performance Shares and Matching Shares under the 2010 LTIP are based on the market norm expected values provided by  LLP PwC of 55% of face value apart from the additional award of Matching Shares in 2011 which has an expected value of 40% of face value.
Details of all payments to Executive Directors in the year, which are disclosed on page 104, show the relative values of the basic and performance related elements of remuneration for the year under review.
Basic salary and benefits Basic salaries and the level and nature of benefits provided to Executive Directors are reviewed by the Committee annually and are assessed having regard to Company performance, individual performance and responsibilities, as well as salary levels in comparable organisations particularly within the listed property sector.
The Committee is, however, mindful of the need to treat comparisons with caution to avoid an upward ratchet of remuneration levels.
It also takes account of pay and employment conditions across the Group, especially when determining annual salary increases.
Basic salary is the only element of Executive Director remuneration which attracts pension contributions.
On 1 April 2011, the Executive Directors received increases in salaries as follows: Toby Courtauld 490,000 from 471,000 and Neil Thompson 390,000 from 325,000.
The increase for Toby Courtauld is in line with the average increases provided to employees across the Group.
The increase for Neil Thompson is ahead of the average across the Group because his responsibilities were significantly increased after the departure of the Property Director during the year to 31 March 2010 when he became Portfolio Director with responsibility for both the asset and development management teams.
The Committee, taking account of salaries of senior operational directors at peer comparator companies, has sought to re-align Mr Thompsons salary since then to reflect these increased responsibilities as he has grown into the role.
104 Great Portland Estates | Annual Report 2011 Directors remuneration report It should be noted that, unlike many of its peers the Company does not provide a car allowance for Executive Directors.
Benefits principally comprise life insurance, health insurance, private healthcare subscriptions, travel concessions and membership subscriptions.
The taxable value of these benefits for Executive Directors is included in the table below.
Following the increases to basic salary described above, the Committee notes that the fixed remuneration for the Executive Directors remains below market.
Resigned from the Board on 31 December 2009.
Retired from the Board on 9 July 2009.
As a result of the Groups results being adversely affected by the CPO of 18 19 Hanover Square, W1, in November 2009, the IPD target for the bonus plan was not met for the year ended 31 March 2010.
Following continued negotiations with Transport for London during the course of 2011 in respect of the Groups claim in relation to the CPO of 18 19 Hanover Square, W1, a full and final settlement of an additional 56 million was reached in March 2011 in respect of the value of Land Taken in 2009.
This amount has, therefore, been treated as relating to the year ended 31 March 2010 rather than 31 March 2011, resulting in the IPD target for the bonus plan for the year ended 31 March 2010 being partially met 50% and resulting in a 2010 bonus payment to the Executive Directors of 37.5% of their 2010 salary.
Discussions with Transport for London are continuing to resolve the remaining elements of the claim.

106 Great Portland Estates | Annual Report 2011 Directors remuneration report Bonus plan Each year the Committee considers the appropriateness of the component parts of the annual bonus plan on page 105 in assessing the overall remuneration of Executive Directors.
The Committee also has the discretion to recommend the payment of an additional bonus to a director for exceptional performance over and above the high standard already required.
This discretion was not exercised for the year ended 31 March 2011.
The Company has continued to perform well overall, both in its relative total shareholder return, achievement against NAV and IPD targets and in the Executive Directors achievement of their personal objectives to progress the Companys strategy.
The personal objectives, other than those covered by the corporate measures, for the Executive Directors for 2011 included the following and were specific as to each individuals role and responsibilities: proactive targeting of potential investment and development opportunities: fide-risking of the shortto medium-term development programme: successful progression of the development programme: active tracking of, and responsiveness to, changing tenant requirements: exceeding rental income, void and delinquency targets: ensuring appropriate turnover of assets: proactive shareholder relations programme: provision of high quality financial reporting: maintaining and extending strong relationships with debt finance providers: arrangement of appropriate financing facilities: effective internal and external communication: ensuring appropriate levels of human resources and succession planning: development of individuals teams: active representation on key property industry associations: setting of the Groups environmental and sustainability strategy: integration of the Groups property and finance IT systems: and ensuring delivery of health and safety objectives.
As a result of the achievement of the Executive Directors objectives during the year, as reflected in the review of the Company on pages 2 to 56, the Committee has awarded the Executive Directors the full 30% of salary for operational excellence.
Long-Term Incentive Plans New 2010 LTIP Following shareholder approval, a new incentive arrangement the 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan the New Plan, was introduced in July 2010 to simplify the LTIP and SMP arrangements and to improve the alignment of executive incentives with the Companys strategy.
The New Plan has two elements: firstly, participants are eligible to receive a conditional annual allocation of shares or nil price options worth up to 200% of base salary Performance Shares : secondly, participants may purchase or pledge shares already owned in the Company Investment Shares up to a value of one-third of basic salary in return for which they receive a conditional allocation of shares worth up to three times the equivalent of the amount so invested or pledged Matching Share Award.
Except in the first year, the Matching Share Award will be limited to shares worth up to 100% of salary.
Awards vest based on the achievement of performance conditions after three years.
In the first year of operation only, if Executive Directors purchase or pledge shares worth an additional one-third of basic salary, this limit was extended by an additional 100% of salary.
The associated additional Matching Share Award is also subject to more stretching performance conditions.
Investment Shares will remain registered in the name of the holder with full voting and dividend rights but if Investment Shares are disposed of then the corresponding conditional Matching Share Awards will lapse.
Dividends on Matching Shares will be rolled up and paid to the extent that the Matching Shares vest.
107 Annual review Financials Governance Under the New Plan there are three separate performance conditions for the vesting of the Performance Shares and the Matching Share Award, each applying to one-third of the shares awarded.
The Committee believes these provide the best alignment between the interests of participants and shareholders.
the performance condition attached to one-third of an award requires NAV growth of between RPI plus 3% p. a. on a straight-line to RPI plus 9% p. a. over three financial years starting with the financial year that commences immediately before the date of grant for between 20% and 100% of this part of the award to vest.
The additional Matching Share Award requires NAV performance of between RPI plus 4% p. a. to RPI plus 9.5% p. a. to vest.
Straight-line vesting is provided between these points: the performance condition attached to the second third requires TSR performance against constituents of the FTSE 350 Real Estate Sector excluding agencies over the three years from grant of the award of between median and upper quartile for between 20% and 100% of this part of the award to vest.
The additional Matching Share Award in the first year requires TSR performance of between the 60th percentile and 80th percentile for the award to vest.
Straight-line vesting is provided between these points: and the performance condition attached to the final third requires Total Property Return TPR performance against constituents of the IPD Total Property Return Central London Index over the three years from grant of the award of between median and upper quartile for between 20% and 100% of this part of the award to vest.
The additional Matching Share Award in the first year requires TPR performance of between the 60th percentile and 80th percentile for the award to vest.
Straight-line vesting is provided between these points.
The performance conditions selected for the New Plan are considered by the Committee to mirror the fundamental measures that demonstrate the Groups performance of: growth in absolute net asset value per share: relative Total Property Return: and relative Total Shareholder Return.
Actual performance against the conditions will be independently verified and reported to the Committee.
Upon vesting, shares to satisfy awards under the LTIP, SMP and New Plan are transferred out of the Great Portland Estates plc LTIP Employer Share Trust the Trust, a discretionary trust established to facilitate the operation of the Companys share plans.
The shares to satisfy vested awards have been purchased by the Trustees of the Trust in the open market.
The number of shares held by the Trust as at 31 March 2011 was 2,482,630.
2008 and 2009 LTIP awards Executive Directors and Senior Managers to a lesser extent were eligible to be awarded shares under an LTIP, up to an annual limit of 150% of a participants salary.
Under the scheme there are two separate performance conditions for the vesting of awards, each applying to one half of the shares awarded.
the performance condition attached to one half of an award requires NAV growth of between RPI plus 3% in total increasing on a straight-line to RPI plus 8% in total over three financial years starting with the financial year that commences immediately before the date of grant for between 20% and 100% of this part of the award to vest i. e. between 10% and 50% of the total award : and the performance condition attached to the other half requires total shareholder return TSR performance against constituents of the FTSE 350 Real Estate Sector excluding agencies over the three years from grant of the award of between median and upper quartile for between 20% and 100% of this part of the award to vest i. e. between 10% and 50% of the total award with straight-line vesting in between.
Timon Drakesmith has resigned from the Board with effect from 27 May 2011.
Performance conditions attached to the 2008 and 2009 LTIP awards are described on page 107.
Performance conditions attached to the 2010 Performance Shares awards are described on pages 106 and 107.
To take account of the Rights Issue completed in June 2009 adjustments were made to 2008 and 2009 awards under the LTIP and SMP by applying an adjustment factor to the awards to ensure that the value of shares under award before and immediately after shares in the Company became ex-rights were, as far as possible, the same.
The figures in the table show the number of shares after the adjustment factor was applied.
Share Matching Plan 2008 and 2009 SMP awards Executive Directors and to a lesser extent Senior Managers were eligible to be awarded shares under an SMP.
an individual could purchase or pledge shares already owned in the Company Investment shares up to an amount equal to 30% of their pre-tax annual base salary.
After the Investment shares have been purchased or pledged, the Company granted conditional awards of shares Matching shares under the SMP with a value equal to two times the value of the Investment shares grossed up for the marginal rate of income tax and employee National Insurance : Investment shares remain registered in the name of the holder with full voting and dividend rights but if Investment shares are disposed of then the conditional Matching awards will lapse on a proportionate basis: and dividends on Matching shares are rolled up.
There are two separate performance conditions, each applying to half of the Matching shares awarded: the performance condition attached to one half of an award will require NAV growth of between RPI plus 4% in total increasing on a straight-line to RPI plus 12% in total over three financial years starting with the financial year that commences immediately before the date of grant over the three years from grant of the award for between 20% and 100% of this part of the award to vest i. e. between 10% and 50% of the total award : and 109 Annual review Financials Governance the performance condition attached to the other half will require total shareholder return TSR performance against the constituents of the FTSE 350 Real Estate Sector excluding agencies of between median and upper quartile for between 20% and 100% of this part of the award to vest i. e. between 10% and 50% of the total award with straight-line vesting in between.
For the part of an award to which the TSR performance condition applies, for both the LTIP and SMP the Committee must also be satisfied that the number of shares that vest as a result of the performance conditions being met is reflective of the underlying financial performance of the Company.
Performance conditions attached to the 2008 and 2009 SMP awards are described on pages 108 and 109.
Performance conditions attached to the 2010 Matching Share awards are described on page 107.
To take account of the Rights Issue completed in June 2009 adjustments were made to awards under the LTIP and SMP by applying an adjustment factor to the awards to ensure that the value of shares under award before and immediately after shares in the Company became ex-rights were, as far as possible, the same.
