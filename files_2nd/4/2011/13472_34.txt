f The value of share based awards has been determined in accordance with the recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS2 Share-based Payment.
The fair value of awards granted under the Share Option Plan SOP, the Management Share Plan MSP, the Bonus Deferral Plan BDP and the Share Savings Plan SSP have been calculated at their dates of grant using an independent lattice-based option valuation model provided by external consultants, Lane Clark and Peacock LLP.
With effect from 2010, the Groups policy for settling awards granted under the Performance Share Plan PSP formerly known as the Mining Companies Comparative Plan MCCP changed.
For settlement of all awards under this plan, participants will be assigned shares and offered a third party facility to realise these shares for cash and or to meet any tax liabilities.
Accordingly, the fair values of the awards granted prior to this change were re-measured at 1 July 2010 and from that date treated as equity-settled awards.
This re-measurement was calculated using a Monte Carlo valuation model based on the market price of shares and their relative TSR performance at 30 June 2010.
The fair value of awards granted after July 2010 is measured at date of grant.
Further details of the valuation methods and assumptions used for these awards are included in note 46 Share Based Payments in the 2011 financial statements.
The fair value of other share based awards is measured at the purchase cost of the shares from the market.
The non-executive directors do not participate in the long term incentive share schemes.
g BDP represents the deferral of the full 2008 STIP and 50 per cent of the 2010 and 2011 STIP into Rio Tinto Shares.

Rio Tinto plc ordinary shares of 10p each stated in sterling: Rio Tinto Limited ordinary shares stated in Australian dollars.
Each option is granted over one share at no cost to participants.
Details of the performance conditions for the SOP are provided in the Executive remuneration structure table on page 101. b The closing price of Rio Tinto plc ordinary shares at 31 December 2011 was 31.25 and the closing price of Rio Tinto Limited shares at 31 December 2011 was A$60.30.
The high and low prices during 2011 of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited shares were 47.18 and 26.37 and A$89.04 and A$58.52 respectively.
c The exercise price represents the price payable on the options.
d The weighted fair value per option during 2011, at date of grant was as follows: Rio Tinto plc SSP two year contract 6.73 and five year contract 4.95.
Rio Tinto plc SOP 14.36: Rio Tinto Limited SOP A$26.79.
e The value of options exercised during 2011 is calculated by multiplying the number of options exercised by the difference between the market price and the exercise price on date of exercise.
f Options granted in 2008 under the SOP failed to satisfy their performance condition and lapsed on 10 March 2011.
The value of options which lapsed during 2011 is calculated using the closing share price on the lapse date with the exercise price subtracted.
As the exercise price is greater than the share price on the lapse date the options are valued at zero.
g Details of the performance conditions for the SOP are provided in the Executive remuneration structure table on page 102. h As of 20 February 2012, the executives held 2,442,088 options to acquire Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited shares.
