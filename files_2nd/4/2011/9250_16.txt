Directors remuneration report for the year to 31 December 2011 Dear Shareholder I am pleased to be able to take this opportunity in my capacity as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee to summarise the remit of the Remuneration Committee and the work that has been carried out during 2011.
The main aim of our remuneration policy is to attract and retain executives of the appropriate calibre and experience needed to manage the international complexity of Lairds operations and who are focused and adequately incentivised to deliver outstanding business results.
During the year the Remuneration Committee: Reviewed the base salaries of the executive directors determining they would not be increased.
Amended the performance conditions for the awards made in 2011 under the 2003 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and 2003 Executive Share Option Plan Option Plan, to include both underlying earnings per share EPS as well as total shareholder return TSR measures for both plans.
Introduced a revised list of 20 companies including six US corporations to be used as the comparator group for the TSR performance condition to provide greater correlation than the FTSE 250 which was used previously.
The revised comparator group for TSR is shown on page 48.
Consulted with key shareholders during February 2011 on the performance conditions for awards under the LTIP and Option Plan.
Unfortunately during the year two of our executive directors left the Board, and the Committee has dealt with the related remuneration aspects as explained later in this report.
In 2012, one of the principle actions of the Committee will be to determine an appropriate remuneration package for the new Chief Executive, taking into account market practice.
The Committee believes that it has developed a remuneration structure that will both support and motivate our senior team whilst aligning them both to the Companys strategic objectives and to achieving long term growth for our shareholders.
I hope that you will be able to support the Committees report at this years Annual General Meeting.
Yours sincerely Tony Reading Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 43 Directors remuneration report continued for the year to 31 December 2011 Introduction The role of the Remuneration Committee the Committee is to recommend to the Board the Companys general policy on remuneration and in particular to determine the remuneration for the Chairman and the executive directors.
The Committee has adopted the principles of good governance relating to Directors remuneration as set out in the Code which applied to the Company from 1 January 2011 and also complies with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and with the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and the regulations thereunder the Regulations.
The Regulations require that the Companys auditor reports to shareholders on certain parts of this Report and states whether in its opinion those parts of it have been properly prepared in accordance with the above Regulations.
A resolution to approve this Report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company on 4 May 2012 and details are set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting.
This Report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee on behalf of the Board.
The Companys remuneration policy and practices are kept under regular review by the Committee which consults with the Companys major shareholders and their representative bodies as appropriate.
The Remuneration Committee The members of the Remuneration Committee are appointed by the Board and the membership is reviewed at least annually.
The Chairman of the Committee is appointed by the Board and cannot be the Chairman of the Board.
The members are: Tony Reading Remuneration Committee Chairman Nigel Keen Chairman Professor Michael Kelly Sir Christopher Hum Andrew Robb Dr William Spivey All Members are independent non-executive directors, other than Nigel Keen who has assumed the role of Executive Chairman while the Company seeks a new Chief Executive.
The Board considers it essential that the Chairman of the Board be involved in setting remuneration policy and therefore he is a member of the Remuneration Committee.
The Chairman does not attend discussions on his own remuneration.
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
During the year, Deloitte LLP provided independent external professional advice to the Remuneration Committee.
Deloitte LLP also provide internal audit services to Laird PLC.
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that no conict of interest exists in the provision of these services.
During the year, the Remuneration Committee also sought the views of Peter Hill who was Chief Executive until 25 November 2011.
In normal circumstances, the Chief Executive is given notice of all meetings and, at the request of the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, attends the meetings.
The Chief Executive may request that he attends and speaks at Committee meetings.
In normal circumstances, the Chief Executive will be consulted on general policy matters and matters concerning the other executive directors and employees.
The written Terms of Reference of the Remuneration Committee are available on the Companys website and from the Company on request.
The Committee met six times in 2011.
Details of the attendance at Committee Meetings is given on page 38.
Remuneration Policy The Remuneration Committee has established a policy on the remuneration of executive directors and the Board has established a policy for the non-executive directors.
The policy for the executive directors is to structure the remuneration package so that no single aspect dominates.
Therefore there is a mixture of xed remuneration and performance-related remuneration, with the latter split between annual bonuses, with a range of dierent measures, and longer-term share incentives, which use more than one performance target.
Further details are set out below.
44 The Remuneration Committee believes that having an incentive-driven remuneration package promotes the alignment of interests of executive directors and shareholders.
That policy is based upon the following principles: remuneration should be linked to achieving strategic objectives and to sustainable long-term corporate success, having due regard to environmental, social and governance issues and the overall risk prole of Laird: the reward opportunity oered to executive directors should be suciently competitive to recruit and retain management of the appropriate calibre and experience: the total compensation package should reect the international complexity of Lairds operations: and Company performance as well as overall shareholder returns should be taken into account when structuring and assessing executive remuneration.
The Remuneration Committees policy on the remuneration of executive directors is regularly reviewed taking into account market practice, the individuals performance, the performance of Laird and other pay structures within Laird.
Executive Directors Directors Leaving the Board Marty Rapp Following a reorganisation to streamline the reporting structures, Marty Rapps employment with Laird Technologies, Inc. terminated with eect from 31 August 2011 and he resigned from the Board.
Under the terms of his service contract dated 31 December 2004, the Company is entitled to make a payment in lieu of notice of one years salary and benets on termination.
The total compensation for loss of oce paid to Marty Rapp for the year was $1,138,221 709,172.
This was made up of one years salary $704,000 and benets $434,221.
In addition he received a bonus of $586,267 365,275 in respect of 2011.
Further details are set out on page 46.
His awards under the LTIP and Option Plan were dealt with in accordance with the respective plan rules and details are set out on pages 51 to 53.
Peter Hill Peter Hill stepped down as Chief Executive with eect from 25 November 2011, due to ill health.
Under the terms of his contract of employment, Peter Hill is eligible, whilst he remains unwell, to sick pay based on his existing salary and benets until 25 November 2012.
Executive Directors Remuneration The executive directors receive base salary, annual performance incentive awards up to a maximum percentage of base salary, pensions and other benets, and long-term performance awards which are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee.
On a regular basis, the Committee requests its independent consultants to undertake a benchmarking exercise on base pay.
The most recent benchmarking exercise was completed in December 2010 and covered all aspects of the remuneration package for the executive directors and other senior executives.
The previous benchmarking exercise was carried out in July 2008.
Performance linked incentives are a key component of the total remuneration package.
In addition to the annual performance incentive award, the Remuneration Committee makes awards under the Companys LTIP and Option Plan.
A summary of these arrangements is set out on pages 46 and 47.
The Committee believes that a combination of share options and LTIP awards for senior executives is an appropriate way of providing the incentive to create substantial improvement in the Companys performance in a way that aligns the interests of executives and shareholders.
Benets comprise the provision of a car or car allowance, life, disability and health insurance, participation in the annual performance incentive award scheme and membership of a pension scheme.
Neither performance incentive awards nor benets in kind are pensionable.
Base Salary In view of the challenging economic climate, executive directors salaries, at their request, have not been increased since 1 July 2008 Peter Hill, 1 July 2007.
The Remuneration Committee agreed that a freeze in base salaries was appropriate.
Jonathan Silvers salary will next be reviewed in July 2012.
45 Directors remuneration report continued for the year to 31 December 2011 When the Remuneration Committee reviews salaries, the individuals and the Companys performance and salary levels for other company executives and the pay and conditions of other employees of Laird is taken into account, including any base salary increases awarded.
In 2011 salary increases for management level employees ranged from zero to 8% depending on several factors, including the region where they work and individual performance.
Greater increases were awarded to certain individuals as a result of promotions or significant increases in the scale or geographic scope of their responsibilities.
Annual Performance Incentive Awards The maximum award, for exceptional performance, that could be earned for 2011 was 100% of base salary for Peter Hill and Jonathan Silver and 125% for Marty Rapp.
Target awards were 75% of base salary for the UK executive directors and 100% of base salary for Marty Rapp.
The award criteria established for 2011 were based on targets of: i underlying profit before tax 45% of the maximum : ii working capital metrics 10% of the maximum : iii the achievement of criteria designed to assess and drive performance against a number of key, measurable strategic objectives for the Company, including those relating to environmental, health and safety 20% of the maximum : and iv for exceptional performance 25% of the maximum, on a discretionary basis.
The specic criteria used under iii above are not disclosed for reasons of commercial sensitivity, but include, inter alia, the successful implementation of the Groups Strategy: the implementation of a new organisational structure: continued organic growth and development of the customer base: and implementing the exit from Mobile Antennae Systems.
The profit target was based on a combination of budgets and market estimates for the year.
In determining the awards for 2011, the Remuneration Committee took into account that underlying profit before tax in 2011 was 31% higher than in 2010, and that operating cash conversion, after capital expenditure, in 2011 was excellent at 106%, notwithstanding the significant growth in profits in the year.
The actual award as a percentage of base salary in respect of 2011 for Peter Hill was 55% 2010, 55% and for Jonathan Silver it was 75% 2010, 55%.
20% of Jonathan Silvers award was for exceptional performance in recognition of attainment of personal goals, including the successful re-nancing of the Group.
Marty Rapps bonus was 125% of base salary 2010, 75% but was pro-rated to 31 August 2011 giving a bonus of approximately 83% of base salary.
In considering Marty Rapps bonus, the attainment of his personal goals was taken into account, as well as the underlying financial performance of Laird.
Long-term Incentives Share Plans The share incentive plans currently operated by the Company for the executive directors are the LTIP and Option Plan, which the Remuneration Committee believes are the most appropriate way of providing the incentive to create substantial improvement in the Companys continuing long-term performance in a way that aligns the interests of executives and shareholders.
Each time awards are made under the LTIP and the Option Plan, the Committee carefully considers the performance measures to be used, including whether to use non-financial Key Performance Indicators.
For the awards made in 2011 it was concluded that both Total Shareholder Return TSR and underlying Earnings Per Share EPS be used for both plans and that they were the most appropriate measures for aligning the objectives of executives with those of shareholders.
These are described in more detail below.
The LTIP and Option Plan may use either market purchased shares or newly issued shares, provided that any newly issued shares are within the overall dilution limit of 10% of the ordinary share capital in issue from time to time for allocations in respect of newly issued shares over a ten year period under these plans and all other share plans operated by the Company.
a The LTIP The LTIP involves the award of shares which only vest after the achievement of demanding performance targets measured over three years.
Executive directors are eligible for a maximum annual award of shares of one times base salary.
In setting the level of awards, the Remuneration Committee takes into account options granted to executive directors under the Option Plan in the same financial year.
Awards under the LTIP take the form of nil cost options or conditional awards in order to comply with US tax legislation, to be satisfied by shares from the Laird 1990 Employee benefit Trust the Trust purchased in the market.
Further details on the Trust are in note 30 on page 96.
46 The level of awards in 2011 was considered by the Committee and the awards made to each director equated to 100% of base salary 2010, 95%.
In deciding this, the Committee took into account the level of award under the Option Plan described below.
These awards should promote the interests of executives and shareholders in the delivery of above market growth in shareholder value in future years.
In accordance with the rules of the LTIP, outstanding awards may vest and or become exercisable before their normal vesting date in the event of a change of control of the Company.
The rules of the LTIP also permit the waiver of performance criteria in certain limited circumstances, such as a change of control, death or retirement.
The amount charged to the income statement during the year in respect of the LTIP awards granted to the executive directors was 498,000 2010, 541,000.
The fair value for accounting purposes was calculated as 50.5% of the face value of the awards made in 2011. b The Option Plan The basis for calculation of the maximum grant of options to executive directors and other employees is the equivalent of shares with a market value at the time of grant of up to one times base salary in any one year and up to two times base salary in special circumstances, such as the recruitment or promotion to a key management position.
When granting options, the Remuneration Committee takes into account both the level of awards made to executive directors under the LTIP and the prevailing share price.
In accordance with the rules of the Option Plan, outstanding options may vest and become exercisable before their normal vesting date in the event of a change of control of the Company.
The rules of the Option Plan also permit the waiver of performance criteria in certain limited circumstances, such as a change of control, death or retirement.
The maximum level of awards under the Option Plan is normally one times base salary, however, the Remuneration Committee considers the level of awards in the light of the Companys business performance and the then current share price level when it decides on the number of share options to be awarded.
In 2011 the awards equated to 75% of base salary as the Remuneration Committee considered that the potential for future growth was higher and that these awards, together with awards under the LTIP described above, should incentivise executive directors in the delivery of above market growth in shareholder value in future years.
The amount charged to the income statement in respect of the share options granted to the executive directors was 229,000 2010, 34,000.
The fair value for accounting purposes was calculated at 34.9% of the face value of grants made in 2011.
Performance Conditions for awards made in 2011 under the LTIP and Option Plan Performance conditions are measured over a single three year period and there is no provision for re-testing therefore the awards lapse if the performance targets are not met.
The Committee consulted with key shareholders on the performance conditions for the 2011 awards under the LTIP and Option Plan.
Two measures were used: achievement of a Total Shareholder Return TSR target and an underlying Earnings per Share EPS target.
For LTIP awards made in 2011, 75% is based on achievement of the TSR target and 25% is based on achievement of the EPS target.
For awards under the Option Plan, 75% is based on EPS and 25% on TSR.
The EPS and TSR conditions are set out below.
47 Directors remuneration report continued for the year to 31 December 2011 TSR condition For previous awards, Lairds TSR has been measured against the FTSE Mid 250 companies excluding investment trusts.
However, in 2011, the following list of 20 companies was selected as the comparator group to be used for these purposes: Amphenol Invensys Sanmina TT Electronics AVX Meggitt Senior TTM Technologies Bodycote Molex Smiths Group Ultra Electronics CSR Morgan Crucible Spectris Vishay Intertechnology E2V Technologies Oxford Instruments Spirent Communications Wolfson Microelectronics The level of vesting of the applicable portion of the award 75% of the award under the LTIP: 25% of the award under the Option Plan is dependent on Lairds relative TSR performance over three years against this group of companies, as follows: Total Shareholder Return Amount of Award Vesting for TSR Measure Performance Level % Upper Quartile Full Vesting Median to Upper Quartile Pro-rata between 30% and full Vesting Below Median Nil In addition, the TSR portion of the award will not vest unless the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the Companys underlying financial performance.
The TSR target will be measured over a three year period from 21 February 2011 to 21 February 2014.
EPS condition The level of vesting of the applicable portion of the award 75% of the award under the Option Plan: 25% of the award under the LTIP is dependent on Lairds EPS performance for the 2013 financial year, as follows: Applicable Performance Target: Level of vesting in 2014 for EPS Measure 2013 Earnings per share EPS Threshold 30% vesting 18.3 pence Full vesting 22.4 pence There is pro-rata vesting on a straight-line basis where EPS is between 18.3 pence and 22.4 pence.
Earnings per share are calculated with reference to underlying earnings per share before exceptional items, the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, deferred tax on acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the gain or loss on disposal of businesses, the impact arising from the fair valuing of financial instruments and acquisition transaction costs as stated in the 2013 Annual Report and Accounts.
Lapse of awards made in 2009 under the LTIP and Option Plan Awards made under the LTIP in 2009 lapsed at the end of 2011, as the performance criteria for total shareholder return to 31 December 2011 was not met.
Options granted under the Option Plan in 2009 also did not meet the performance criteria of 18.7p EPS for 50% vesting and 21.3p EPS for full vesting and will therefore lapse.
48 Pensions Peter Hill and Jonathan Silver are members of a UK Group contributory dened benets scheme.
The main benets are: on pension retirement at age sixty, a maximum pension of two thirds final salary excluding bonuses and other benets dependent on service: on death in retirement, a dependants pension of 60% of the members pension: on death in service, a lump sum of four times salary and a dependants pension of 20% of salary or 60% of the members expected pension, if higher.
Pensions in payment for Peter Hill and Jonathan Silver will increase by the lesser of the increase in the retail price index or 8.5% per annum compound.
Transfer values provided on leaving service do not include any allowances for discretionary benets.
Peter Hills benets in the dened benets scheme are subject to an earnings cap.
They are supplemented by an unfunded arrangement to maintain the same level of benets as if the earnings cap did not apply.
Since 1 July 2008, Peter Hill has received a taxable salary supplement of 40% of base salary in lieu of future accrual of the unfunded arrangement.
With eect from 25 November 2011, Peter Hill ceased to be a director due to ill health.
Under the terms of his contract of employment, he is eligible whilst he remains unwell to sick pay based on his existing salary and benets until 25 November 2012.
For the purpose of the pension disclosures below, Peter Hills pension accrual is therefore shown for the whole year to 31 December 2011.
Following the introduction of the A Day legislation in April 2006, Jonathan Silvers pension has ceased to accrue within the dened benets scheme.
In light of the Companys previous pension commitment to Jonathan Silver, he now receives a taxable salary supplement of 40% of base salary in lieu of future pension accrual under the pension scheme.
These payments in respect of Peter Hill and Jonathan Silver are expected to reduce future pension risks for the Company.
Payments in lieu of pension provision are excluded from the calculation of any bonus entitlements and share scheme awards and are not included in the calculations below.

Shareholding Guidelines Since 2003 executive directors have been expected to retain, as shares, all of the after-tax profit on the gains made on the vesting of LTIP awards and the exercise of existing or future share options under the Option Plan, until they have acquired a shareholding equal in value to their base salaries.
At 31 December 2011, Jonathan Silver had an interest in shares equivalent to a multiple of 1.72 2010, 1.94 of his base salary.
49 Directors remuneration report continued for the year to 31 December 2011 Outside Appointments The Board believes that there can be significant benets, to both the Company and the individual, from executive directors accepting non-executive directorships of companies outside the Group.
The Board takes into account the likely time commitment for such appointments prior to approving them.
During the year the fees which the executive directors are entitled to retain, were as follows: Fee Director Company Peter Hill Cookson Group plc 40,000 Jonathan Silver INVESCO Income Growth Trust plc 22,500 Service Agreements Each of the executive directors has a service agreement.
Peter Hills and Jonathan Silvers service agreements are dated 8 March 2004.
In line with the Companys policy, the executive directors service agreements are not for a xed term and provide for twelve months written notice of termination from either party.
Marty Rapps service agreement was with Laird Technologies, Inc. and he had a separate letter dated 7 March 2008 from the Company in respect of his appointment as an executive director.
As described above, Marty Rapp resigned from the Board and his employment terminated with eect from 31 August 2011.
Peter Hill stepped down from the Board with eect from 25 November 2011 but remains in employment.
The Companys policy on termination is to comply with the contractual terms and conditions set out in the service agreement.
The Company may, at its election, make a payment in lieu of notice.
The payment would be calculated as the total of the directors base salary plus the value of his benets, in each case by reference to the period of the unexpired notice of termination.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts.
They are appointed under letters of appointment which provide for a review after an initial three year term.
After the initial three year term, the appointment is reviewed and, in the past, the appointment would be renewed for a further three year term.
However, due to the change in the UK Corporate Governance Code, which requires annual re-election of directors, the Board decided that the term of appointment for a non-executive director will now be one year after an initial three year term.
Tony Reading, Andrew Robb and Dr William Spivey, whose terms came up for review in September 2011 were re-appointed for one year terms, subject to annual review thereafter.
Andrew Robb and Dr William Spivey will be retiring at the AGM on 4 May 2012.
The appointment of a non-executive director is subject to termination if he ceases to be qualied to act as a director of the Company: if he resigns by written notice: or he is not re-elected under the Companys Articles of Association.
Dates of appointment are shown on page 29.
Non-executive Directors The Board as a whole is responsible for setting the remuneration of the non-executive directors.
Non-Executive Directors Lairds policy is to establish and maintain a body of non-executive directors with a breadth of international skills and experience that is relevant to Lairds global businesses.
In this context, it is the Boards policy for the non-executive directors to be paid a level of fee that reects market conditions and is sucient to attract individuals with appropriate knowledge and experience.
Chairman Under an arrangement between the Company and Imperialise Limited, Nigel Keen is retained to act as Chairman of the Company.
Nigel Keen also acts as Chairman of the trustees of a Laird pension scheme for which he receives no additional remuneration.
Nigel Keens fees for his services, for which he must account to Imperialise Limited, are 175,000 per annum.
Following the resignation of the Chief Executive due to ill health on 25 November 2011, Nigel Keen is acting as Executive Chairman and his fees have been increased to a rate of 609,000 p. a. for a temporary period.
Imperialise is responsible for Nigel Keens National Insurance NI and was paid a sum equivalent to the NI on those fees of 30,106, for which it accounts to Her Majestys Revenue and Customs HMRC whereas for the other non-executive directors, who are paid through Lairds payroll, NI is paid directly to HMRC.
NI payments are not included in the table below.
Nigel Keens initial period of appointment as Chairman was for three years commencing 5 June 2000.
His term of appointment, was extended by the Board for three further three year periods commencing 5 June 2003, 5 June 2006 and 5 June 2009.
50 The appointment, which is subject to the rotation provisions of the articles of association, may be terminated by either party giving not less than six months notice.
