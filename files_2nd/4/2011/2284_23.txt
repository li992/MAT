Fixed elements of pay Base salary The Committee reviews base salaries for each Executive Director and senior executives annually taking into account theresponsibilities and performance of the individual, current market practice, pay in similar engineering businesses and companies of a comparable size and scale of operations.
TheCommittee was also mindful of pay levels amongst the employee population.
The salaries of the Executive Directors during 2011 are asfollows: Name Position Salary from 1 January 2011 S. C. Harris Chief Executive Officer 436,000 D. F. Landless Finance Director 278,500 Pension The Committee reviews the pension arrangements for the Executive Directors to ensure that the benefits provided are consistent with those provided by other similar companies.
Mr Harris is entitled to a salary supplement in lieu of pension ata rate of 22% of basic salary, of which 72,000 was waived from April 2011.
In addition, in the event ofdeath, a death in service benefit of eight times basic salary will become payable.
During 2011 the pension for Mr Landless was provided partly under the Groups UK contributory defined benefit pension scheme, which is closed to new members with increases inpensionable salary capped at 3% per annum, and partly through a defined contribution arrangement.
The Groups contribution to Mr Landless defined contribution arrangement in the period January to March 2011 was 16% of basic salary above the defined benefit scheme cap.

Variable elements of pay Annual bonuses The annual bonus provides the Executive Directors and other senior executives with the opportunity to receive an annual bonus wholly payable in cash based on achievement of certain performance targets.
In 2011 the annual bonus scheme for the Executive Directors was structured as follows: Group headline Group headline Actual bonus Maximum operating profit operating cash flow Personal objectives payable annual bonus Name % of salary % weighting % achieved % weighting % achieved % weighting % achieved % of salary S. C. Harris 130 70 70 10 10 20 15 124 D. F. Landless 100 70 70 10 10 20 13 93 Bodycote plc 45 Annual Report 2011 The Committee also has discretion to reduce the awards byupto 10% if the safety performance is less than targeted.
For 2012 the Committee has determined that the bonus opportunity for Executive Directors and senior executives will again be contingent on meeting targets relating to safety, operating profit, cash management and personal objectives.
No bonus will be paid for the cash management element unless the level of operating profit achieved is at least 95% oftarget.
Bodycote Incentive Plan BIP The Company operates the BIP under which Executive Directors and senior executives received a conditional award ofBodycote shares up to a maximum of 175% of base salary.
Vestings of awards are based upon two performance measures, over a three year period.
50% of the award is subject to a return on capital employed ROCE performance condition and 50% of the award is subject to an earnings per share EPS performance condition.
ROCE EPS Award year Threshold performance Maximum performance Threshold performance Maximum performance 2009 10% 14.6% 16.0p 28.0p 2010 11.1% 16% 19.8p 31.0p 2011 14.6% 20% 28.3p 39.8p 2012 18.7% 23% 36.2p 62.15p In the event that threshold performance for both EPS and ROCE is not achieved none of the conditional awards will vest.
Regardless of ROCE performance, should EPS at the end ofthe performance period be below 16p for any BIP awards made between 2009 and 2011 and below 31.1p for awards made in 2012, then no award shall vest.
The Committee intends to use the ROCE and EPS measures incombination for BIP Awards made in 2012.
Details of the awards made under the BIP are provided on page 47.
Following completion of the performance period on 31 December 2011, the Remuneration Committee has determined that 175% of the BIP awards made in2009 shall vest 2008: nil.
In reaching this conclusion, the Remuneration Committee took into account specific audit procedures carried out by the external auditors.
During the financial year the Remuneration Committee alsoapproved the introduction of the Bodycote Investment Incentive Plan which provided a long-term savings vehicle forsenior executives which aids retention whilst recognising the needs for flexibility inlong-term wealth planning.
Companycontributions are discretionary and vary year onyear.
Contributions for the Executive Directors are shown onpage 47.
Bodycote Co-investment Plan CIP The CIP provides a link between the Companys short and long-term incentive arrangements and permits executives to invest inshares up to a value equivalent to 40% of net basic salary.
The CIP provides for the grant of awards of matching shares toparticipants on an annual basis in a maximum ratio of1:1 to the gross investment made in deferred shares.
Deferred shares must be held for three years and matching shares are subject to an absolute Total Shareholder Return TSR target.
The threshold target for CIP matching awards isTSR growth of not less than 4% per annum compound inexcess of growth in the Consumer Prices Index CPI for athreshold matching ratio of 1:2.
10% per annum compound growth in excess of growth in theCPI will be required for avesting matching ratio of 1:1.
Details of the awards under the CIP together with awards made under the legacy arrangement known as the Bodycote Share Match Plan BSMP and the joining award made toMrHarris in October 2008 are noted on page 48.

Additional information Financial statements Governance Business review 46 Bodycote plc Annual Report 2011 Board report on remuneration continued Service contracts It is the Companys policy that Executive Directors have service contracts with a one-year notice period.
All the Executive Directors have service agreements which are terminable by one years notice by the employer at any time, and by payment of one years remuneration in lieu of notice bythe employer.
With the exception of David Landless, theExecutive Directors do not have a change of control clause.
David Landless service contract was agreed in accordance with what was considered best practice at the time of its execution in 2001 and provides for one years remuneration ona change of control if his employment is terminated.
To the extent that executive contracts are renewed, or new appointments made, the Committee will continue to adopt a policy of best practice when entering into service contracts.
In any case legally appropriate factors would be taken into account to mitigate any compensation payment, covering basic salary, annual incentives and benefits, which may arise on the termination of employment of any Executive Director, other than payments made on a change in control orfor payments in lieu of notice.
Mr Harris service agreement is dated 6 October 2008 and Mr Landless contract is dated 26 September 2001.
Shareholding policy In 2005, the Committee introduced a shareholding retention policy under which Executive Directors and other senior executives are expected, within five years of that date orcommencement of employment if later, to build up a shareholding in the Company.
In respect of Executive Directors the expectation is to hold at least 100% of basic salary.
As at 31 December 2011 the Committee is satisfied that the Executive Directors have fulfilled this requirement.
Fees retained for external non-executive directorships Executive Directors may hold positions in other companies asnon-executive directors.
Stephen Harris was the only Executive Director with such a position held at Mondi plc from 1 March 2011 and in accordance with Group policy he retained fees for the year of 59,035.
Non-Executive Directors The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors.
Remuneration for theChairman is determined by the whole Board excluding the Chairman.
Remuneration for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors takes into account the time commitments and duties and responsibilities involved.
The Chairman and each Non-Executive Director hold letters of appointment which have been agreed in accordance with best practice which set out the terms of his appointment, including membership of Board committees, the fees to be paid and the time commitment expected from the Director.
The letter also covers such matters as the confidentiality of information and Bodycotes share dealing code.
During the year letters of appointment for the Chairman and each Non-Executive Director were renewed, each for a period of no longer than three years.
Each is terminable under the Companys Articles of Association, the Act, by the Directors resignation or otherwise on six months notice if termination occurs before expiry of the term.
To determine the fees it pays to Non-Executive Directors, the Board takes into account the need to attract individuals of appropriate calibre and expertise, the fees paid to Non-Executive Directors by other companies of a similar size and scale of operations and the time commitment attached to each appointment.
The Board keeps fees under review.
The Chairman and NonExecutive Directors are not entitled to any pension or other employment benefits or to participate in any incentive scheme.

The transfer value at 31 December 2011 incorporates these changes.
The transfer value at 1 January 2011 does not include any allowance for CPI indexation.
For information, had the Trustee reviewed the transfer value basis prior to 1 January 2011, the transfer value quoted at 1 January 2011 would have been 627,000.
The inflation used above is a measure consistent with the CPI assumption used in the transfer value basis for the Scheme.
