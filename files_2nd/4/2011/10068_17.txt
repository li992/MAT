net Stock code: MRO 59 The source data for the graph on the previous page assumes that the 220 million of cash returned to shareholders in August 2007, following the McKechnie Aerospace and PSM Fasteners disposals, together with the 373.2 million that was approved to be returned to shareholders in August 2011 following the sale of Dynacast, was reinvested to purchase shares in the Company.
This results in an adjustment factor on the price and this factor is used in ongoing calculations of shareholder return for the Company, as ordinarily a return of capital would reduce the share price and an analysis of returns going forward would not reflect value already returned to shareholders.
The benefit of any cash distribution is thereby reflected within the shareholder return performance of the Company.
