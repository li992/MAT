Mark Wrightson, Remuneration Committee Chairman Committee Activities in 2011 Contents to this section Amlin employees have made a great contribution towards achieving our strategic objectives in what Chairmans introduction 80 has been a challenging year, as highlighted in both the Chairman pp12 and the CEOs statement The Committee 81 pp18.
Overall remuneration levels 82 There have been no significant changes in remuneration arrangements since those described a year Structure of directors and employees remuneration 82 ago, with changes only to the Profit Commission scheme as detailed later in this report.
Other minor changes have been made to remuneration policies and procedures to reflect changes in employment Fixed salary and benefits 84 retirement and pensions law.
Annual performance 85 Long-term performance 86 The Committee undertook a further review during the year of remuneration risk and acknowledged Non-executive directors fees, that no changes are required to the Companys remuneration arrangements and that current controls appointment and removal 87 remain appropriate.
Bonus paid in 2011 Our over arching principle is to provide appropriate levels of remuneration to our directors, senior executives and employees reflecting a contribution of the financial performance of the Group and the individuals achievements in meeting annual personal performance objectives.
It has been Executive Directors total Amlins long-standing practice to defer payment of bonuses in respect of the Profit Commission remuneration 000 scheme for Underwriters until the second and third years following the underwriting year for which 2,000.0 the bonus has been earned.
Profit Commission payments in respect of results of the 2008 and 2009 underwriting years have been made to the relevant directors and senior executives during 1,750.0 2011.
These bonuses therefore reflect rewards earned for prior performance.
Payments under the Group Bonus Scheme reflect the individual component only as no payments were made under 1,500.0 the business component.
1,250.0 Priorities for 2012 1,000.0 Public and regulatory focus on senior executive and financial services remuneration remains a key 750.0 issue both in the UK and the EU.
The Committee will continue to review all aspects of the Companys remuneration structures, policies and procedures to ensure that, as well as complying with regulation, 500.0 all these elements support the strategic objectives of the Company, and offer appropriate levels of incentive for the employees.

There was no material change in the classes in which Mr Carpenter participates between the 2010 and 2011 awards.
Awards were made in each of the years 2007 to 2011 inclusive, in respect of performance periods of five underwriting years commencing in the year each respective award was made.
Forecasts of rewards in respect of all performance periods are subject to change, particularly in respect of later performance periods.
Subject to that caveat, the forecast rewards based on earned premium and reserving as at 31 December 2011, for the periods stated to date, are as set out below.
Where a positive result on the syndicate is less than a shortfall against the demanding return targets on individual classes, no payment will be due as in the case of Mr Carpenter on each of the years as estimated to date.

As at 31 December 2011 the options held under these plans by executive directors, all of whom were directors throughout the year, and any changes during the year, are set out in the tables on the next two pages.
In addition each executive director was awarded 260 free shares in the SIP in April 2011 2010: 772.
SIP shareholdings are included in the directors shareholding interests set out in the Directors report.

For 2006 awards the average return on net tangible assets over the ensuing five year period exceeded the threshold for maximum vesting of 20%.
For2007 awards the average return on net tangible assets over the ensuing five year period was 19.4% and therefore only 97.6% of the award vested.

In this case the primary performance conditions only partly met in 2007 leading to a partial vesting of the award.
For the 2009 award the Committee concluded that a nil vesting was appropriate.
Use of unissued and existing shares for incentive plans The rules of all those of the Companys incentive plans which can result in the issue or transfer of shares to participants include limits on the overall number of unissued shares over which options may be granted.
The only employee schemes under which either unissued or treasury shares are committed to be issued are the executive share option schemes, the Sharesave plans and the schedules to the PSP and LTIP applying to awards to participants in Continental Europe.
New shares were also issued in 2007 to the trustee of the Share Incentive Plan as SIP Free Shares but in subsequent years such shares were purchased in the market.
Shares awarded under the PSP and LTIP are intended to be satisfied from shares held, or to be purchased, by the Groups ESOT unless overseas requirements dictate otherwise.
Grants of options over new and or treasury shares under any selective plan, after deducting any such options which have lapsed, are limited to 5% of the issued share capital in any 10 year period.
Grants over new treasury shares under any scheme are also limited to 10% over 10 years.
The percentages of the year end shares in issue, together with the equivalent percentages a year earlier, relating to each of these limits are shown in the table below.

It is intended that the balance will be purchased in the market by the ESOT, using funds advanced by the Company, before they are required.
The changes in the shares held by the ESOT during 2011 resulted from the exercises of options and vesting of awards over a total of 632,511 shares.
Total Shareholder Return performance The graphs below illustrate the total shareholder return performance of the Companys ordinary shares relative to the FTSE 350 and the FTSE All Share Insurance indices respectively Amlins shares are a constituent of both over the five years to 31 December 2011.
Comparisons are shown with both these indices as the performance of Amlins shares is affected both by the general UK stock market in companies of its size and by its insurance sector.
The graphs show the values, at each year end from 2006 to 2011 inclusive, of 100 invested in the Companys shares on 31 December 2006 compared with the values of 100 invested in the relevant index on the same date.
To produce a fair value, each point on the graphs is the average of the relevant return index over the 30 days preceding the relevant year end.
