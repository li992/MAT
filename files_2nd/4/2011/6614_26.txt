The remuneration is the difference between the amount the Executive Director is required to pay to buy the shares or ADS and the total value of the shares or ADS on the vesting date.
If the Executive Director chooses not to exercise the options on the vesting date he may exercise the options at any time during the next seven years, any subsequent increase or decrease in the amount realised will be due to movements in the share or ADS price between the initial vesting date and the date of exercise.
This increase or decrease in value is the result of an investment decision by the Executive Director and, as such, is not recorded as remuneration.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2011 and 9 March 2012 and the movements during the periods are shown in the table below.
The following table shows the gains on the exercises of the options set out above analysed between remuneration for the Executive Directors and the subsequent gains losses as a result of their investment decisions.

The remaining increases in their transfer values are, for both, the result of the increased valuation of the pension benefit accrued in the period, for Sir Andrew Witty, the reduced period of service to the assumed retirement age and, for Julian Heslop, his early retirement on 31 March 2011.
