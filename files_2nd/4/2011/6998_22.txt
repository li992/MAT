During the period the It is the Companys policy that a substantial proportion of the executive Committee worked with Deloitte LLP to review the remuneration Directors remuneration should be variable and performance related in arrangements to ensure that they reflected this policy and our long-term order to encourage and reward superior business performance and business strategy.
The Committee concluded that, while a number of shareholder returns and that remuneration should be linked to both elements of the remuneration arrangements remained appropriate, the individual and Company performance.
The following illustrates the structures in place at the time were not aligned with the philosophy of balance between fixed and variable remuneration based on the delivering upper quartile remuneration to executives if they achieve remuneration policy for 2011 12: above upper quartile performance for our shareholders.
A review of market practice also indicated that the maximum total compensation opportunity was not fully competitive, particularly at maximum levels, when compared to our key retail comparators.
In this context, and following discussions with major shareholders, an award multiplier was introduced to the Performance Share Plan PSP and the revised plan rules were adopted at the Companys AGM in July 2010.
The revised scheme allows executives to earn an incremental reward if performance is above upper quartile levels.
