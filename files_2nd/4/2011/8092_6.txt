GOVERNANCE Informa plc Directors Remuneration Report On behalf of the Remuneration Committee, the Board presents its report on Directors Remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2011.
Although it is not a requirement of Jersey company law to have the Directors Remuneration Report approved by shareholders, the Board believes that as a company whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange it is important in terms of its corporate governance for it to do so.
Accordingly a resolution to approve this Report will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
This report has been divided into separate sections for: 1 information which is unaudited: and 2 information on which the Companys auditor has reported as having been properly prepared.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee is responsible to the Board for 1 formulating and recommending to the Board remuneration policy and strategy for the Executive Directors and 2 reviewing individual remuneration packages of the Executive Directors, including terms and conditions of employment and any changes.
The Committee also reviews the general remuneration framework for the senior management of the Group and approves the operation of any Group share-based incentive schemes, including any Long-Term Incentive Plans LTIPs.
The Committees terms of reference are available on the Group website.
The membership of the Committee during 2011 was as follows, each of whom served for the whole year: Dr Pamela Kirby Chair of Committee Dr Brendan ONeill John Davis The Company Chairman, Derek Mapp, usually attends the meetings by invitation only but is not present when matters relating to his own remuneration are discussed.
The number of meetings of the Committee during 2011 and individual attendance by its members are shown on page 47.
None of the members who served on the Committee during the year had any personal financial interest other than as a shareholder of the Company or conflicts of interests arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board.
The principal activities carried out by the Committee during 2011 were: r determination of Non-Executive Chairmans and Executive Directors remuneration: r determination of the Executive Directors bonuses for 2010 and bonus targets for 2011: r LTIP awards: determination of performance conditions, and new awards for both Executive Directors and senior management: r determination that the performance conditions of the 2008 LTIP grant were not met, and therefore those awards lapsed: r approval of a new Deferred Share Bonus Plan for both Peter Rigby and Adam Walker: r consideration and approval of the Remuneration Report for the 2010 Annual Report: r monitoring of senior management remuneration: and r review of external remuneration consultants.
In determining the Executive Directors remuneration, the Committee consulted the Chairman about its proposals: no Executive Director played a part in any decision about his or her own remuneration.
After appointment in 2010, Towers Watson continued to provide advice to the Committee during the year.
A statement regarding the Companys remuneration consultants can be found at www.
Towers Watson do not provide any other material services to the Group.
Brendan ONeill is a member of the Towers Watson Inc board, the holding company of Towers Watson, and as such does not take part in any discussions regarding the selection of advisors, or their contract.
The Company Secretary, Rupert Hopley, who replaced John Burton during the year, and Emma Blaney, the Group HR and CR Director, also provided assistance to the Committee during the year.
Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 51 Informa plc Directors Remuneration Report CONTINUED Remuneration Policy The remuneration of the Executive Directors is designed to provide for a competitive compensation package which reflects the Groups performance against financial objectives and personal performance criteria.
Incentives reward above-average performance and are designed to attract, motivate and retain high-calibre executives.
The performance assessment of the Executive Directors and the determination of their annual remuneration packages are undertaken by the Committee.
There are five elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors: r basic annual salary: r benefits: r annual bonus: r share incentives: and r relocation, retirement and life assurance benefits.
The Companys policy is that a clear majority of the maximum potential remuneration of the Executive Directors should be performance-related.
As described further below, Executive Directors may earn an annual bonus and benefit from participation in a performance-based LTIP.
For 2011, all of the bonus earned by the Executive Directors was based on earnings per share EPS performance.
Their 2012 bonus targets have been set on the same basis.
Vesting of LTIP awards is subject solely to total shareholder return TSR performance as described below.
The information below sets out the details of performance-related remuneration to base salary and benefits for the Executive Directors paid or awarded in respect of the 2011 financial year.
These arrangements for bonus and LTIP awards reflect the Committees view that the best long-term interests of shareholders are achieved though incentivising the Executive Directors through a dual focus on EPS and TSR growth.
The Committee is able to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues when setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
In its judgement the remuneration policies for both Executive Directors and senior management do not raise environmental, social or governance operational risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
Senior management remuneration is set on a similar basis to the Executive Directors except often with lower basic salary and substantially lower LTIP elements but proportionately more variable bonus profit share provision.
The latter is usually tied directly to the annual profit performance of a business unit.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside of the Company provided that the Chairman determines that it is appropriate.
During 2011 Peter Rigby served as Non-Executive Chairman of Electric Word plc, for which he received and retained fees of 12,000.
Relocation Benefits As a result of the Companys redomicile to Switzerland in 2009, the Committee has determined that the Company would provide an ongoing relocation benefits allowance on the basis that the ongoing arrangements would be broadly cost-neutral to the Company, taking into account estimated savings that the Company would be able to realise as the result of the relocation.
The main benefit provided from the allowance relates to the provision of housing in Switzerland.
The costs of the provision of these benefits is contained in the benefits in kind allowances column of the table of Directors Emoluments on page 57 of this Report.
Reporting Currency As the Executive Directors are now required to reside in Switzerland they have entered into new service contracts under which they are paid in Swiss Francs CHF.
As a result, for clarity of reporting, all monetary benefits receivable by the Executive Directors are set out in this report in CHF.
However, the remuneration of the Directors in the financial statements is set out in Pounds Sterling GBP, the Companys reporting currency.
52 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 GOVERNANCE Informa plc Basic Salary The basic salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed by the Committee prior to the beginning of each year and upon a change of position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers pay practices in the Group as a whole and makes reference to objective external research which gives current information on remuneration practices in appropriate comparator companies.
Following a review at the end of 2011, and at the request of the Executive Directors, the Committee resolved that there would be no change to the Executive Directors remuneration package for 2012.
2011 2012 Salary salary Peter Rigby CHF 1,225,700 CHF 1,225,700 Adam Walker CHF 744,175 CHF 744,175 Other Benefits Each of the Executive Directors receives a general benefit allowance of CHF42,500 per annum together with private medical insurance cover and permanent health insurance cover.
Annual and Deferred Bonus The Committee continues to consider adjusted diluted EPS to be the most suitable financial measurement on which to base annual incentives and align the interests of the Executive Directors with those of the Companys shareholders as this measurement of performance can be directly influenced by the performance of the Executive Directors and is a key driver in generating returns to shareholders.
For 2011 the maximum annual bonus was 150% of basic salary dependent upon achievement of a sliding scale of challenging diluted adjusted EPS targets which were set at levels to encourage and reward the delivery of excellent levels of performance.
The bonus scheme is focused on the achievement of budgeted EPS.
Threshold performance requires achievement of 90% of budgeted EPS, below which no bonus is payable.
Achievement of 90% of budgeted EPS will result in a bonus of 50% of basic salary.
Achievement of 100% of budgeted EPS will result in a bonus equal to 100% of basic salary.
Achievement of 110% or more of budgeted EPS will result in a maximum bonus equal to 150% of basic salary, though any award in excess of 100% of basic salary will take the form of a conditional award of Company shares.
Any EPS achievement between 90% and 110% will result in a pro rata bonus between 50% and 150% of base salary.
EPS for bonus purposes is calculated as the adjusted fully diluted earnings per share number.
The EPS calculation will be adjusted to eliminate any benefit or deterioration that changes in foreign exchange rates have on Adjusted Operating Profit.
To achieve that both the Actual Adjusted Operating Profit and the Budget Adjusted Operating Profit are recalculated on a constant currency basis.
While the Committee will adhere to the simple objective calculation it reserves the right to adjust the calculation if it considers there has been a material change in circumstances, such as a major share issue or significant Mergers and Acquisitions activity.
Any award of bonus above 100% may only take the form of a conditional award of shares in the Company which will vest only if the Executive Director remains in employment throughout the deferral period of three years from the date of grant, subject to good leaver provisions.
The number of shares awarded will be determined by reference to the market value of the shares at the date concurrent awards under the LTIP are made.
Shares utilised for this purpose will be acquired by market purchase: newly issued shares will not be used.
In February 2011 the Executive Directors were awarded a bonus of 107.9% with respect to the 2010 financial year.
Of this, both Executive Directors received 100% cash bonuses and the remaining bonus of 7.9% will be payable in deferred shares which are exercisable from 2014, subject to the terms of the Deferred Share Bonus Plan the DSBP.
Under the DSBP award for 2010 Peter Rigby will receive 14,822 shares and Adam Walker will receive 8,999 shares.
More information regarding this is given on page 58.
Applying the sliding scale formula, a bonus of 113.6% of basic salary was awarded to each of Peter Rigby and Adam Walker for the 2011 financial year, reflecting a year of good financial performance.
For 2012, the annual bonus will again be determined based on a sliding scale of diluted adjusted EPS performance, with the maximum opportunity of 150% of basic salary for appropriately stretching levels of performance.
If achieved, any award in excess of 100% of base salary may only take the form of a conditional award of shares in the Company, which will vest only if the Executive Director remains in employment throughout the deferral period of three years, subject to good leaver provisions.
Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 53 Informa plc Directors Remuneration Report CONTINUED Long-Term Incentive Plan Since 2006 Executive Directors have been invited to participate in the Companys LTIP, which had been introduced and approved by shareholders in 2005.
Awards were made to the Executive Directors in 2009, 2010 and 2011 of 150% of basic salary.
A review of the total remuneration packages of the Executive Directors was undertaken at the end of 2011 with the assistance of Towers Watson.
It included an analysis of benchmark data from a comparator group of FTSE 51-150 companies, excluding those in financial services.
Following its review, while the Committee concluded that there could be grounds for revisions to the LTIP component of the packages, it was resolved that no changes be made for 2012.
Consequently awards of 150% of salary will be made to the Executive Directors in 2012.
2008 Awards The EPS-related performance conditions attaching to the LTIP awards made in 2008 had not been met as at 31 December 2010 and accordingly the 2008 LTIP awards lapsed in March 2011.
2009, 2010 and 2011 Awards For the LTIP awards made in 2009, 2010 and 2011, the following performance conditions apply.
These performance conditions will also apply to awards to be made in 2012: r one half of the shares under an award will vest based on the Companys TSR performance ranked against the TSR performance of the constituents of the FTSE 350 index excluding investment trusts.
In respect of this half of an award 20% will vest for ranking at median with 100% vesting for ranking at or above the upper quintile.
Any ranking below median results in none of the award vesting: r one half of the shares under an award will vest based on the Companys TSR performance ranked against the TSR performance of the constituents of the FTSE All Share Media Index.
In respect of this half of an award, 20% will vest for ranking at median with 100% vesting for ranking at or above the upper quintile.
Any ranking below median results in none of the award vesting: and r irrespective of the extent to which the TSR performance conditions have been met for the vesting of an award, an award will not vest unless a general financial underpin is satisfied.
If the Board is not satisfied that the underlying financial performance of the Company is reflected in the TSR determined result, it will have the ability to scale back vesting to zero if it considers it appropriate to do so.
Use of TSR as a primary performance measure is considered the best way to align the longer-term interests of management and shareholders, with the approach also being the most transparent way of ensuring that executives are incentivised to, and rewarded for, the delivery of above market returns to shareholders.
In addition, operating a general financial underpin also seeks to ensure that a keen focus is maintained on the underlying financial performance of the business.
The shares awarded to participants of the LTIP grants are satisfied through the Informa Group Employee Share Trust, currently administered by Nautilus Trust Company Limited in Jersey.
All-Employee Share Plans From January 2006 the Executive Directors, along with all other UK employees, were eligible to participate in the Companys pre-existing Share Incentive Plan the pre-existing SIP, introduced and approved by shareholders in 2005.
A new Share Incentive Plan new SIP was approved by shareholders for its adoption effective on 30 June 2009 and approved by HM Revenue and Customs HMRC on 6 July 2009.
The terms of the new SIP are the same in all material aspects.
Both SIPs are HMRC Approved All-Employee Share Incentive Plans which offer UK employees the opportunity to purchase up to 1,500 of shares in the Company per year out of pre-tax salary.
Eligible employees can join the SIP provided they have completed six months service with the Company.
Following the relocation of both the Executive Directors to Switzerland, as overseas employees and in accordance with the rules of the SIP, neither of the Executive Directors is able to continue to participate in the plan.
Consequently, both Executive Directors have ceased to contribute to the SIP and so have ceased to acquire shares through the plan.
Shares previously acquired under the SIP prior to the Executive Directors relocation remain in the SIP.
Peter Rigby holds a total of 1,820 shares and Adam Walker 669 shares in the SIP.
54 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 GOVERNANCE Informa plc The Company introduced a US Stock Purchase Plan SPP in 2008 which was approved by shareholders at the AGM in May 2008.
Eligible employees are invited to join the SPP on an ongoing basis once they have completed six months service with the Company.
The SPP provides a means by which the Groups US employees may purchase the Companys shares at a 15% discount to the market price.
No tax benefit is available under the SPP.
Eligible US employees can purchase up to $2,940 of shares per year out of post-tax salary.
Shares in Informa held in the SPP at the time of the Scheme of Arrangement becoming effective on 30 June 2009 were exchanged for shares in the Company: accordingly no new SPP was introduced at this date.
Share Options The Committee decided in 2005 to cease the granting of share options to Executive Directors.
Details of subsisting share options granted to Peter Rigby in 2004 and earlier are shown on page 58.
Existing grants were amended for the Rights Issue on 27 May 2009 and rolled over to the Company in June 2009.
The remaining share options held by Peter Rigby lapsed on 6 March 2011.
Share Ownership Guidelines Formal share ownership guidelines require the Executive Directors to build up, over a three-year period, a holding in the Companys shares equal to at least one and a half times annual basic salary.
Both Executive Directors met this requirement as at 31 December 2011.
Retirement and Life Assurance Benefits The Executive Directors receive a contribution of 25% of basic salary toward their retirement arrangements.
The Company also provides life assurance cover providing for the payment of a lump sum in the event of the insureds death in service.
In Switzerland the maximum pension contribution payable free of deductions is CHF 208,800.
For Peter Rigby the excess due to him is paid in cash after deducting incremental Swiss employer social security costs.
Further details of these entitlements are shown on pages 59.
Performance Graph The graph below shows the Companys performance, measured by TSR, compared with the performance of the FTSE All Share Media Index, also measured by TSR, in the five-year period ended 31 December 2011.
The FTSE All Share Media Index has been selected for this comparison because the Company is a constituent company of that index.

These contracts are under Swiss law but other than changes required to reflect local law and custom in Switzerland, the terms and conditions are essentially the same as those contained in their previous service contracts which had been entered into under English law.
There are no specific terms in relation to the service contracts concerning termination following a change of control or any special rules concerning equity awards following termination: the Executive Directors are subject to the same rules and awards under share schemes following a termination of employment as for all other participants of the relevant schemes.
In the event of early termination except for cause, their contracts provide for compensation equal to basic salary, benefits allowance and retirement benefit and, in the case of Peter Rigby only, bonus for the notice period.
The Companys policy in respect of protection from exposure to the risk of payment in the event of termination of an Executive Directors contract due to poor performance is to ensure that in the event of a new Executive Director being appointed that no bonus is payable under the service contract in the event of the Company making a payment in lieu of notice of termination.
This policy was followed in relation to the service contract of Adam Walker.
Each of the Non-Executive Directors has specific terms of appointment, terminable by three months notice.
The dates of the Directors original contracts are shown in the table below, although the contracts have been amended from time to time by letter agreement as required, including to reflect the Groups redomicile, the relocation to Switzerland of the Executive Directors and to reflect changes to salary or fee levels.
The contracts, which include details of remuneration, are available for inspection at the registered office and principal office, and will be available for inspection at the AGM.
