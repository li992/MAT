Remuneration Policy and Practice Our Remuneration Policy is designed to attract, retain and motivate a high quality pool of talented employees at all levels who are incentivised to deliver our corporate strategy through clear links between reward and performance without encouraging them to take undue risks.
We operate in a highly competitive international environment and continue to assign employees internationally to achieve the optimum balance of experience within the Group and to facilitate employee development.
We align the interests of shareholders and employees at all levels by, wherever possible, giving our employees the annual opportunity to build a shareholding in the Company through our employee share plans, with over 30 per cent of eligible employees participating in one or more plans.
Executive Policy and Practice We consider it critical to align the remuneration package for Executive Directors and our most senior executives with the Groups strategy and risk appetite.
We, therefore, believe our Executive Directors remuneration should be competitive but not excessive and, to incentivise them to maximise individual, functional and corporate performance, that they should be able to earn more from their performance related pay than from their fixed pay.
We aim to position our fixed elements of remuneration around the median paid by our comparator group of companies, which currently remains the FTSE 50 with secondary reference to the FTSE 30 both excluding companies in the financial and pharmaceutical sectors but which will be reviewed as part of the Committees consideration of overall remuneration philosophy.
By linking a significant proportion of our performance related remuneration elements to the value of our shares, we provide our Executive Directors with the opportunity to earn upper quartile total compensation if they produce enhanced earnings and above market returns for our shareholders.
Our policy also supports our strategy by linking the major elements of remuneration to performance criteria aligned with our KPIs.
The policy, however, includes both short-term and long-term incentives, the main elements being base salary, annual bonus, long term incentive plan LTIP, SMS and pension benefits.
To ensure our Remuneration Policy is firmly linked to our strategy and risk management, Executive Directors, together with other senior executives, are required to build a significant stake in the Company in accordance with our share retention guidelines.
This link is further supported through the setting of bonus and employee share plan targets that reflect key business imperatives, for example volume growth, cash conversion and growth in EPS and TSR all of which are key performance indicators used to measure strategy as discussed on page 11.
Executive Directors are remunerated in respect of their executive appointments under the terms of their service agreements and receive no additional fees for serving as Directors.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC|Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 65 Directors Service Arrangements Executive Directors Service Agreements The Companys policy is that Executive Directors service agreements are terminable on no more than one years notice and there isno entitlement to the payment of a predetermined amount on termination of employment in any circumstances.
The service agreement for Mr R Dyrbus was, however, entered into at the time of the demerger of the Company from the Hanson Group and theprovisions dealing with compensation on termination following a change of control in his service agreement reflect those arrangements.
There are no liquidated damages provisions for compensation on termination within Executive Directors service agreements, except for those set out in the table below.
The Executive Directors service agreements do contain provisions for payment in lieu of notice but these are at the Companys sole discretion.
We are unequivocally against rewards for failure.
Apart from the limited respects referred to above, the circumstances of the termination and an individuals duty and opportunity to mitigate loss are taken into account in every case.
Our policy is to stop or reduce compensatory payments to former Directors to the extent that they receive remuneration from other employment during the compensation period and that any such payments would be paid monthly in arrears.
Under the Rules of our LTIP and SMS, outstanding awards vest if a participant leaves for specified reasons, including death, retirement, redundancy, the business or company in which the participant is employed ceasing to be part of the Group or on a change of control.
In these circumstances a participants awards vest on a time pro rata basis subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance criteria with the balance of the awards lapsing.
If, however, thetermination of employment is not for one of thespecified reasons a participants full awards lapse.

Policy in Respect of Remuneration from External Board Appointments We recognise that external non-executive directorships are beneficial for both the Executive Director concerned and the Company.
At the discretion of the Board, Executive Directors are permitted to retain fees received in respect of any such non-executive directorship.
Each serving Executive Director is restricted to one external non-executive directorship and may not serve as the chairman of a FTSE 100 company.
Mrs A J Cooper is a Non-Executive Director of Inchcape PLC and is permitted to retain the 44,167 fees received from this position in the financial year.
Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors Within the 2.0 million limit set out in our Articles of Association, the Board determines the remuneration policy and level of fees for our Non-Executive Directors and, after recommendation by the Remuneration Committee, our Chairman.
In addition to base fees, additional fees are paid to the Chairmen of our Audit and Remuneration Committees and our Senior Independent Director.
After taking account of market practice, with reference to ourcomparator group together with the need toattract and retain high calibre individuals, these fees are reviewed, but not necessarily increased, on an annual basis.
With the exception of reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with their directorship of the Company, Non-Executive Directors receive no other material pay or benefits.
They are not eligible for bonuses, retirement benefits or to participate in the Groups employee share plans.
To align Non-Executive Directors interests with those of our shareholders, a proportion of their fees is applied to the purchase of shares in the Company, but not at a level that we believe could compromise their judgement or independence.
These shares are held by a nominee during the term of their directorship.
Non-Executive Directors Letters of Appointment The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements with the Company but the terms of their appointment, including the time commitment expected, are recorded in letters of appointment which are available for viewingat our registered office during normal business hours and both prior to and at the AGM.
In line with our annual review policy the Chairmans and Non-Executive Directors terms of appointment were reviewed and confirmed by the Board on 1 February 2011.
Under the terms of our Articles of Association, Directors are subject to annual re-election by shareholders.
There are no provisions regarding notice periods in their letters of appointment which state that theChairman and Non-Executive Directors will only receive payment until the date their appointment ends and, therefore, nocompensation is payable on termination.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC|Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 66 Directors Remuneration Report continued Remuneration Practices The main elements of the Executive Directors remuneration arrangements other than benefits in kind are summarised in the table below and are explained in more detail in the subsequent paragraphs.

Long Term Incentivise long-term Percentage of base salary: 3 elements: 3 years IncentivePlan delivery of EPS and TSR Chief Executive 200%, 50% EPS growth and align with interests Finance Director 150%.
Base Salary Base salaries are reviewed in September of each year following detailed consideration of a number of factors including individual responsibilities, performance and the market rate for the position.
Our policy is to set base pay within a range around the market median of the comparator group after consideration of market data provided by Towers Watson.
Consideration is given to the effect an amendment to an individuals base salary would have on their total remuneration package.
Base salary is theonly element of the package used to determine pensionable earnings.
This years review was conducted in the context of the need to apply appropriate restraint in pay levels whilst also being cognisant of what is a highly competitive international market for executive talent.
As a result of the review, it was decided that the Chief Executives base salary should be increased by 7.5 per cent in line with the Committees previously stated policy of bringing her fixed pay into line with the market median over time.
At its meeting in September 2011 the Committee increased the Chief Executives base salary to 860,000 from 800,000 and the Finance Directors base salary to 654,500 from 641,690, which was not increased at the previous review taking account of the Companys size, corporate performance, international profile, employee remuneration more generally and thecritical importance of their roles indriving future performance.
We believe there should be a cohesive remuneration structure across the Group.
Our approach for allemployees, including executives, is, therefore, to set remuneration that takes account of: market practice: economic conditions: theperformance of the Group, of teams and the individual: collective agreements that may apply: and any legal or regulatory requirements.
In setting the remuneration policy and levels for executives, the Committee considers the remuneration arrangements and employment conditions of the wider employee population within the Group.
The percentage increases for executives base salaries effective both 1October 2010 and 1 October 2011 were generally lower than the average for other employees of the Group located in thesame region.
Percentage of total actual remuneration for the financial year to 30 September 2011 Key Salary Mrs A J Cooper Pension Salary Supplement Benefits in Kind Bonus Mr R Dyrbus SMS LTIP 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Imperial Tobacco Group PLC|Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 67 Annual Bonus Our shareholders and other stakeholders place significant weight on our annual performance.
We, therefore, think it is appropriate tohave a major element of Executive Directors remuneration targeted at incentivising delivery of the Groups annual objectives and enhancing performance against key financial and non-financial targets in support of our KPIs as set out on pages 11 to 13.
For the financial year ended 30 September 2011 the potential maximum bonus was 200 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive, 150 per cent for the Finance Director and 120 per cent for the Group Sales and Marketing Director pro rata to date of retirement.
In support of our KPIs as used to measure strategy, detailed on pages 11 to 13, up to 75 per cent of the maximum annual bonus can be earned for achieving financial targets including growth in adjusted EPS and net revenue growth which is subject to market share underpins.
The remaining 25 per cent can be earned for performance against stretching, quantifiable strategic and non-financial targets, subject to achievement of a minimum threshold in respect of the financial targets.
During the year we delivered adjusted EPS of 188.0 pence.
When combined with net revenue growth this resulted in 27.5 per cent of the financial element vesting.
The strategic and non-financial targets support our growth strategy by driving performance against our key growth drivers, including cash conversion, volume targets incentivising sales growth in support of our cigarette volumes and our stick equivalent KPIs, as detailed on page 13, and targets relating to our key risks including anti-illicit trade activities supporting our focus on future foundations.
We consider the strategic and non-financial targets to be commercially confidential, however, they were met in part, with 50.0 per cent of this element vesting.
Any annual bonus earned up to 100 per cent of base salary in respect of the Chief Executive and Finance Director is paid in cash and is eligible for investment in our SMS SMS Eligible Bonus.
Any bonus payable in excess of this level is used to purchase the Companys shares which the Director is required to retain for a minimum of three years.
These shares are not eligible for investment in the SMS.
It is intended that the Executive Directors annual bonus for the year ending 30 September 2012 with be structured in broadly the same manner as outlined above although the operation of the annual bonus thereafter will be considered as part of the Committees review of the Companys remuneration philosophy.
Annual bonuses forExecutive Directors and certain key executives are subject to claw back, during the three years following the end of the financial year in which they are earned, in the event of gross misconduct by the employee ormisstatement of results where this had the effect of increasing the level of bonus that would otherwise have been paid.
No element of the bonus is guaranteed.
Share Interests and Incentives Whilst placing significant weight on our annual performance, our overall remuneration package aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and other stakeholders with those of management by incentivising the growth in the value of the business over the long-term.
To support this alignment, we have adopted a set of share ownership guidelines as we believe Executive Directors and other senior managers should be encouraged to hold a substantial portion of their personal wealth in our shares.
Over a period of five years from appointment Executive Directors are required to build a holding in the Groups shares to a minimum value broadly equivalent to three times base salary for our Chief Executive and Finance Director.
Other senior management are expected to investat a level equivalent to between once and twice base salary, dependent upon grade.
Failure to meet the minimum shareholding requirement is taken into account when determining eligibility for LTIP awards.
All Executive Directors currently exceed their required shareholding.
We also support this alignment by linking a significant portion of Executive Directors and senior managements remuneration to shares.
The value of their overall remuneration is, therefore, heavily dependent on the performance of our share price.
Our long-term incentives consist of two employee share plans: the SMS and the LTIP.
Share Matching Scheme The purpose of the SMS is to encourage the Groups senior managers, including Executive Directors, to hold shares in the Company.
Under the SMS, at the discretion of the Committee, senior managers are invited to invest any proportion of their SMS Eligible Bonus in our shares.
If those shares are held in an employee nominee facility forthree years and the participant remains an employee within the Group, they will be matched on a one-for-one basis.
To further incentivise our Executive Directors and our most senior managers we apply a performance criterion, as shown below, measurement of which is based on the same protocol as that applying to the LTIP and there is no opportunity to re-test.
Employees can exercise their vote in respect of shares held in the employee nominee facility by giving written instructions to the nominee.

6 Mr G L Blashill retired from the Board on 2 February 2011 and was not eligible to participate in the 15 February 2011 award.
There have been no changes in any Executive Directors contingent rights since 30 September 2011.
During February 2011 the SMS relating to annual bonuses earned in the financial year to 30 September 2007 matured.
The performance criterion was met in full.
In respect of annual bonuses earned in the financial year to 30 September 2010 our Executive Directors elected to invest the equivalent of their entire SMS Eligible Bonus in the form of our shares under the scheme.
These matched shares are shown within contingent rights arising above.
It is anticipated that in February 2012 the Executive Directors will again invest the equivalent of their entire SMS Eligible Bonus in the scheme.
The performance criterion, award policy and vesting schedules were reviewed by the Committee during the year.
The Committee confirmed they remain appropriate and that, therefore, it is intended that the same performance criterion will determine vesting of SMS awards made in the financial year ending 30 September 2012.
However, the operation of the SMS thereafter will be considered again as part of the Committees review of the Companys remuneration philosophy.
In respect of the February 2009 award, based on EPS to the end of the financial year the award will vest in full.

Imperial Tobacco Group PLC|Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 69 Long Term Incentive Plan The LTIP is a conditional award of shares to Executive Directors and other senior management.
Some, all, or none of these shares vest three years after grant dependent upon performance over the period.
All grants are at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and no employee has a right to receive an award.
Awards are equivalent to 200 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive and 150 per cent for the Finance Director, with awards at lower levels for other senior managers.
Current Structure The performance criteria for all awards is split into three elements which operate independently and can vest regardless of the performance in respect of the other elements.
The three elements are: First Element The performance criterion for 50 per cent of the award is based on average growth in adjusted EPS based on anagreed protocol, after adjusting for inflation over the period of the award Real Annual EPS Growth.
At the Committees request, our Auditors perform agreed upon procedures on the calculations.
If Real Annual EPS Growth equals 3 per cent, 12.5 per cent of this element vests.
This element vests in full if Real Annual EPS Growth equals or exceeds 10 per cent.
Between these two points this element vests ona straight-line basis.
Second Element A further 25 per cent of the award has a performance criterion based on a sliding scale depending on TSR relative to the FTSE 100 Index.
No vesting of this element occurs unless the Companys TSR ranks it in the top 50 per cent of the companies in this index.
Atthis performance threshold 30 per cent of this element vests.
This element vests in full if the TSR ranks the Company in the top 25 per cent of this index.
Between these thresholds this element vests on a straight-line basis.
Third Element The final 25 per cent of the award has a performance criterion based on a sliding scale depending on TSR relative to a bespoke comparator group comprising 12 tobacco and alcohol companies.
No vesting of this element occurs unless the Companys TSR exceeds that of the bottom six companies in the comparator group.
At this performance threshold, 30 per cent of this element vests.
This element vests in full if the TSR ranks the Company in the top three.
Between these thresholds this element vests on astraight-line basis.

SABMiller PLC To ensure our Executive Directors and senior managers are incentivised to drive our underlying performance and to ensure that corporate actions or fluctuations in exchange rates do not unduly affect comparative underlying performance, the Committee has agreed the following protocols: if a company in the comparator group is delisted during the performance period it will be replaced from the start of the performance period, in an agreed order, by Lorillard Inc or Molson Coors Brewing Company: if a company in the comparator group undertakes a rights issue during the performance period a cash neutral approach of selling a portion of rights to take up the balance of the rights commonly known as tail swallowing will be applied: and to remove the undue influence of exchange rate fluctuations, TSR calculations are measured in the currency in which each company is listed.
The TSR calculations, performed independently by Alithos Limited, use the share prices of each comparator group company, averaged over a period of three months, to determine the initial and closing prices.
Dividend payments are recognised on the dateshares are declared ex dividend.
The Committee considers this method gives a fairer andless volatile result as improved performance has to be sustained for several weeks before it effectively impacts on the TSR calculations.
During the year the Committee reviewed the performance criteria, award policy, comparator group and vesting schedules for LTIP awards and decided that the three elements remain relevant measures that drive and measure sustainable improvement in shareholder value and support our long-term KPIs, discussed on pages 11 to 13.
It is, therefore, intended that the same performance criteria and the same comparator group of companies for the third element will determine vesting of LTIP awards to be made in the year ending 30 September 2012.
The operation of the LTIP will, however, be considered again as part of the Committees review of the Companys remuneration philosophy.
Vesting of Awards On vesting, a participants option to acquire the relevant number of shares may be exercised at any time up to the seventh anniversary of the date the award vested.
The vesting process in a number of jurisdictions outside the UK is, however, amended to comply with local securities and tax legislation.
The performance period is set prior to the granting of each annual award and there is no opportunity to re-test if any of the performance criteria are not achieved.
Under the rules of the LTIP, should the Company be acquired the performance period would end on the date of acquisition.
Anyoutstanding awards would vest on a time pro rata basis subject to the achievement of the applicable performance criteria.
The Committee has absolute discretion to vary, but not increase, the extent to which any awards vest.
This ensures awards only vest, and vest at an appropriate level, if there has been an improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company, including the maintenance of long-term return on capital employed.

5 Exercisable, upon the payment of the option exercise price of 1 penny, between 3 November 2013 and 2 November 2020.
There have been no changes in any Executive Directors awards since 30 September 2011.
During the year, the October 2007 October 2010 award vested partially on 2 November 2010 being the first day the Company came out of a close period.
Based on EPS and TSR performance to the end of the financial year the first element vested in full, approximately 74.5 per cent of the second element vested and none of the third element vested.
The remaining shares under award lapsed.
In respect of the November 2008 November 2011 award, based on EPS and TSR performance to the end of the financial year approximately 80.4 per cent of the first element will vest on 26 November 2011, approximately 62.1 per cent of the second element will vest and the third element will lapse.

Interim measurement calculations prepared as at 30 September 2011 indicate that, in the event that only this level of performance were maintained over the relevant performance periods, the first element of the November 2009 November 2012 award would lapse, approximately 30 per cent of the second element would vest and the third element would lapse.
In respect of the November 2010 November 2013 award, the first element would lapse, 100 per cent of the second and 30 per cent of the third element would vest.

Annually we offer as many employees as practicable, together with our Executive Directors, the opportunity to join the Sharesave Plan.
Options over ordinary shares are offered at a discount of up to 20 per cent to the closing mid-market price of our ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange on the day prior to invitation.
The Plan allows participants to save up to 250 per month over a period of three years, and in the UK only three or five years, and then exercise their option over ordinary shares.
In common with most plans of this type, no performance conditions are applied.

Imperial Tobacco Group PLC|Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 72 Directors Remuneration Report continued Executive Directors Pensions Since 6 April 2006 A day the Groups UK pension policy, which applies to all current Executive Directors, provides the option to maintain membership of or, in respect of new employees, join the UK Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund the Fund orreceive a salary supplement in lieu of membership of the Fund.
The Executive Directors are all members of the Fund, the principal defined benefit scheme operated by the Group.
For members who joined prior to 1 April 2002 the Fund is largely non-contributory with a normal retirement age of 60.
The Fund allows members to achieve the maximum pension of two-thirds of their salary at normal retirement age, usually after 32years service.
Pension commutation to enable participants to receive a lump sum on retirement is permitted.
For death before retirement, a capital sum equal to four times salary is payable together with a spouses pension of two-thirds of the members expected pension at retirement.
For death in retirement, a spouses pension of two-thirds of the members pre-commutation pension is payable.
Dependent children will also receive allowances.
Pensions in payment increase annually by the lesser of 10 per cent and the increase in the Retail Prices Index, together with an option under the rules to surrender part of a pension in order for the annual increase to be in line with the increase in the Retail Prices Index to a maximum of 15 per cent.
New members of the Fund after 30 September 2010 accrue pension benefits in the Fund on a defined contribution basis.
Members who joined the Fund prior to 1 October 2010 continue to accrue pension benefits in the Fund on a defined benefit basis, as set out above.
All Executive Directors accrue pension benefits on the defined benefit basis.
From 6 April 2006 a new tax regime was introduced by HM Revenue & Customs HMRC which abolished most of the detailed limits previously imposed on pension schemes and replaced them with a simplified approach.
Each member now has a Lifetime Allowance LTA of 1.80 million for retirements in the tax year 2011 2012 and a tax, called the lifetime allowance charge, is levied at retirement if the value of their pension benefit from all sources exceeds this amount.
For any member whose total benefit value on 6April 2006 exceeded the LTA, transitional arrangements allowed them to register the higher value so that they would not be subject to a large retrospective LTA charge.
To qualify for this enhanced protection the member was required to opt out of Fund membership in respect of future service accrual in order to retain a final salary linked pension entitlement in respect of past service.
All Executive Directors earn benefits on the standard scale with a normal retirement age of 60.
Mr R Dyrbus has opted out of Fund membership in respect of future service accrual as a result of registering for enhanced protection with HMRC.
The detailed HMRC rules governing enhanced protection mean that it may not be permissible, in some rare circumstances, for the full final salary linked pension based on service up to 6 April 2006 tobe paid from the Fund.
In this event an additional pension will be paid by the Company through an unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme UURBS so that the full accrued benefit may be provided.
Mr R Dyrbus is in receipt of a salary supplement of 35 per cent of salary, which is in lieu of future pensionable service accrual and arises because his accrued pension on 6 April 2006 was well below the maximum pension of two-thirds of salary.
Mrs A J Cooper isalso in receipt of a salary supplement.
Prior to 6 April 2006 her pension benefits were limited by the effect of HMRCs earnings cap.
Although this cap was removed as from 6 April 2006, the Fund did not disapply it in respect of past pensionable service but maintained its own earnings cap going forward.
For service from 6 April 2006 onwards and for pensionable salary in excess of theFunds earnings cap, the standard Fund benefit is a pension at the lower accrual rate of 1 60ths with a 50 per cent spouses pension and member contributions of 5 per cent of this top slice of salary are payable.
As an alternative to extra pension accrual onthis top slice of salary through the UURBS, Mrs Cooper receives a salary supplement of 12 per cent of this amount.
In each case these salary supplements have been calculated by independent actuaries to reflect the value of the benefits of which they are in lieu and are discounted for early payment and for employers national insurance contributions.
The supplements are non-compensatory and non-pensionable.
The following table provides the information required by both the Listing Rules and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 the Regulations and gives details for each Executive Director of: the annual accrued pension payable on retirement calculated as if he she had left service at the year end any potential UURBS entitlement is included : the increase in accrued pension during the year, excluding any increases for inflation in respect of the disclosure required under the Listing Rules: and the transfer value of the increase in accrued pension calculated in accordance with the latest Regulations.
None of the Executive Directors has made additional voluntary contributions.
