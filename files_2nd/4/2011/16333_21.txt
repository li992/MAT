Introduction Remuneration report continued Composition and role of the Remuneration Committee continued Advice Wholly independent advice on executive remuneration and share schemes is received from New Bridge Street, an Aon Company.
Pensions advisory services were also provided to the Committee and the Group by Aon Hewitt Ltd. During 2011 insurance broking services were also provided to the Group by other subsidiaries of Aon Corporation which the Committee believes in no way prejudices New Bridge Streets position as the Committees independent advisers.
New Bridge Street is appointed by the Committee and, during the year, provided the Company with advice on the operation of the Companys LTIP and other share schemes, remuneration benchmarking services and an annual update on market and best practice.
In addition, the Committee consults the Chief Executive with regard to the remuneration and benefits packages offered to Executive Directors and members of the Executive Team during the year, except in relation to his own remuneration and benefits package.
This is determined by the Committee, which meets without him for this purpose.
Key activities during 2011 During 2011 the Remuneration Committee met five times.
The key activities were: February November Agreement of Chairmans fees for 2011 Overall review of Executive Directors remuneration market trends, regulatory developments, Review and approval of 2010 Remuneration report investor guidelines, salary surveys, disclosure trends, Approval of 2010 executive bonus awards risk management Setting of 2011 executive bonus targets Setting of Executive Directors remuneration packages Approval of 2008 LTIP award vesting for 2012 Grants of 2011 LTIPS Review of Chief Executives recommendations for Executive Team remuneration 2012 Approval of executive share option awards for 2011 Review of bonus scheme rules April introduction of clawback provision Agreement of fees for newly appointed Chairman Review of Divisional Managing Directors and Presidents Discretionary decision re LTIPs bonus scheme mechanisms Setting and approval of new Chief Executives Authorisation of changes in pension payments following remuneration statutory changes to annual and lifetime allowances July December Additional executive share option awards Approval of Chairmans fees for 2012 Approval of mid-year salary award for a newly appointed Executive Team member Linkage between remuneration, corporate objectives and shareholder interests Element of remuneration Objective Timescale Performance metric Base salary Aims to attract and retain key Continuous Delivery against key personal executives objectives Reflects the individuals role within Reflect individual role and the Group and their experience responsibilities Annual bonus Provides focus on delivering 12 months Based on annual targets for two exceeding annual budget of the Groups KPIs: operating cash flow and operating profit Rewards and helps retain key executives and is aligned to the Groups risk profile Long Term Rewards longer-term value Three years Relative Total Shareholder Return Incentive Plan creation.

The remuneration of senior managers is aligned with corporate objectives and the interests of shareholders in the same manner as that of the Executive Directors.
As is outlined in the table below, base salary levels are set by reference to the salaries paid in companies of a similar turnover and market capitalisation.
The linkages between the three elements of the Executive Directors remuneration packages with the Groups objectives and the interests of shareholders are outlined opposite.
When setting base salaries and the other elements of remuneration for the Executive Directors, regard is given to remuneration practices across the Group as a whole in order to ensure that a coherent structure applies.
Input is sought from the Chief Executive and the Group Human Resources Director to assist in this process.
Salary increases for Executive Directors are reflective of the levels of salary increases awarded to high performing Group employees.
The basic mechanism of the Executive Directors bonus scheme is the same as that utilised for the Executive Team, individual operating business Managing Directors and Presidents and for other functional directors, although the quantum of the bonus varies between these groups of employees.
Salaries The Executive Directors salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee and take effect from 1 January.
New Bridge Street prepared data on the total remuneration packages for Executive Directors with similar roles in two comparator groups of companies: 1 A specific group comprising 15 companies drawn from the LTIP TSR comparator group with a similar size to Ultra in 2011.
These companies were: WS Atkins Domino Printing Sciences QinetiQ Group Spectris Charter International Halma Renishaw Spirax-Sarco Engineering Chemring Group Logica Rotork Spirent Communications Cobham Oxford Instruments Senior and 2 A general group comprising 40 companies from across all sectors excluding Financial Services with a similar market capitalisation and turnover to Ultra.
In addition to the analysis presented by New Bridge Street, the Committee used a variety of other published salary surveys.
Specific factors taken into account by the Committee when determining each Executive Directors base salary are: the median level of base salary for a similar position within a like group of companies chosen on the basis of size and similarity of operations: the individual Directors performance: his responsibilities: and the relative levels of pay and employment conditions across the Group.
The Executive Directors salaries have been reviewed by the Committee which has determined that the following levels should be implemented with effect from 1st January 2012: 2012 Salary 2011 Salary % Increase 000 000 % 1 Chief Executive 420 400 5.0 Finance Director 305 290 5.2 2 Marketing Director 255 243 4.9 1 The salary shown is the annual equivalent salary for the Chief Executive following his appointment to that position with effect from 21 April 2011.
The annual equivalent salary of Douglas Caster, the previous Chief Executive, was 466,000 per annum for the period 1 January 2011 to 21 April 2011, although Mr. Caster worked a three-day week during that time and his salary was reduced accordingly.
2 The salary shown is for the incumbent Marketing Director, Andy Hamment, who will retire on 30 March 2012.
He will be succeeded in this role by Mark Anderson whose initial salary will be 180,000 per annum.
The Remuneration Committee has set this salary at a level below Mr Hamments, but plans to move Mr Andersons salary towards the market median.
Introduction Remuneration report continued Annual bonus scheme Bonus payments in 2011 were based upon the achievement of operating profit and cash flow targets.
These targets are derived from the annual budgets approved by the Board but adjusted where appropriate to provide an appropriate degree of stretch challenge and an incentive to outperform.
Operating profit and cash flow are two of the Key Performance Indicators by which the Group is measured.
Please refer to pages 12 and 13 for details.
The maximum bonus for Executive Directors was 100% of base salary.
In 2011 the bonus targets set by the Committee were a maximum of 25% of salary subject to the achievement of a 113.9m profit before tax and loss on fair value movements on derivatives and amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition, and a maximum of 75% of salary subject to achieving an operating cash flow of 143.0m after capitalised development costs, capital expenditure and purchase of long-term incentive plan shares.
The actual results for the year led to an aggregate bonus pay-out of 76.4%, of which 25% of salary was due to the profit before tax target being met in full and the balance was linked to achievement against the cash flow target.
The pay-out was below the maximum because the cash performance did not reach the maximum level when adjusted to normalise working capital movements during the year.
The structure of the bonus schemes for 2012 will follow the same logic as for 2011 with a maximum of 25% of salary being payable for the achievement of an agreed profit target, and a maximum of 75% being payable for achievement of an agreed operating cash flow target.
The relevant targets are determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The Committee has also decided that, from 2012, clawback provisions should be introduced to the annual bonus and share schemes.
The circumstances in which a clawback may be triggered are i fraud misconduct resulting in overpayment of a bonus to employees, or ii a material error resulting from fraud wilful misconduct in the manner in which the achievement of the bonus targets has been calculated, which results in overpayments to employees.
In practice, the Committee believes the targets attached to the bonus i. e. with a majority linked to operating cash flow, mean that the likelihood of such an event occurring is extremely low.
Directors Long-Term Incentive Plan and Employee Share Option Plans The Company operates the following three live discretionary share incentive plans which were all approved in 2007: the 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan 2007 LTIP : the 2007 Company Share Option Plan 2007 CSOP : and the 2007 Executive Share Option Scheme 2007 ESOS.
2007 LTIP The sole form of equity-based long-term incentive for Executive Directors is the 2007 LTIP.
They do not receive awards under the 2007 CSOP or 2007 ESOS schemes, which provide incentives for less senior employees.
Under the 2007 LTIP, conditional awards of shares are made annually to Executive Directors and selected other senior executives.
These awards normally vest three years after grant, subject to continued employment and the extent to which a performance condition has been met.
It is the Committees normal policy to grant annual LTIP awards to Executive Directors in the form of shares worth 100% of salary.
However, in certain exceptional circumstances the Committee may make awards of up to 150% of salary.
It is the opinion of the Committee that the LTIP scheme has helped to motivate senior executives to drive sustained above-market long-term growth in Ultras profits and to generate excellent returns for shareholders as a result.
Relative total shareholder return TSR applies to all new awards made under the 2007 LTIP going forward, as well as outstanding awards.
The Committee believes that the use of relative TSR has a number of advantages.
These include: aligning the performance objectives of the Executive Directors more closely with the interests of the shareholders: being an entirely objective measure of relative performance: reflecting the practice most commonly used by other quoted companies: and reducing the complexity and cost of calculating the vesting result.
TSR is one of the Key Performance Indicators by which the Group is measured.
Please refer to pages 12 to 13 for details.
60 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Remuneration report continued Detailed structure of TSR performance condition Under the TSR performance condition, TSR is based upon a comparison of the Companys average share price plus reinvested dividends during the quarter immediately prior to the start of the measurement period and its average share price plus reinvested dividends during the last quarter of the three year measurement period.
The resulting TSR will be compared with that achieved by a representative comparator group of companies.
The vesting rules under the 2007 LTIP are as follows: Ultras rank within the comparator group Percentage of award that vests Below median 0% Median 20% Upper quartile 100% Between median and upper quartile Pro-rata between 20% and 100% The Committee reviews the comparator group annually and makes such adjustments as it sees fit for example, to take account of companies which delist during the year.
The comparator groups for measuring relative TSR for the awards made in 2009, 2010, and 2011 were as follows: 2009 group Alba Domino Printing Sciences Psion Spectris BAE Systems Filtronic QinetiQ Spirax-Sarco Engineering Charter Halma Renishaw TT Electronics Chemring Group Hampson Industries Rolls-Royce UMECO Chloride Group Laird Group Rotork Vitec Group Cobham Meggitt Senior Volex Group Dialight Oxford Instruments Smiths Group VT Group 2010 group ARM Holdings Domino Printing Sciences QinetiQ Spirax-Sarco Engineering Babcock International Halma Renishaw Spirent Communications BAE Systems Hampson Industries Rolls-Royce TT Electronics Charter Laird Group Rotork UMECO Chemring Group Logica Senior VT Group Chloride Group Meggitt Serco Group Vitec Group Cobham Oxford Instruments Smiths Group WS Atkins Dialight Psion Spectris 2011 group ARM Holdings Halma Renishaw Spirent Communications Babcock International Hampson Industries Rolls-Royce TT Electronics BAE Systems Laird Group Rotork UMECO Charter Logica Senior Vitec Group Chemring Group Meggitt Serco Group WS Atkins Cobham Oxford Instruments Smiths Group Dialight Psion Spectris Domino Printing Sciences QinetiQ Spirax-Sarco Engineering Charter delisted on 13th January 2012 and was removed from the comparator group for 2012.

Introduction Remuneration report continued Detailed structure of TSR performance condition continued In addition to the main TSR condition, an underpin will apply to these awards requiring average annual growth in headline EPS growth of 7% over the relevant performance period.
In the event that this underpin is not met over a specific three-year LTIP measurement period, the level of vesting will automatically fall to zero.
Headline EPS will be defined as earnings per share after adjustments to exclude gains or losses on financial instruments and the amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition.
Growth in EPS is one of the Key Performance Indicators by which the Group is measured.
During 2011, the Committee reviewed the underpin to ensure that it remains in line with Ultras growth plan and does not encourage excessive risk taking.
It concluded that the EPS underpin continues to represent a high hurdle and remains suitable at the present time.
The extent to which awards vest will be verified independently by a third party.
The Committee exercised its discretion as provided under the rules of the LTIP over Mr Casters outstanding LTIP awards when he retired from his position as Chief Executive at the 2011 AGM.
The Committee decided that, in view of Mr Casters long service and significant contribution to the building of Ultra's success over a period of many years, he should retain his LTIP awards and that they would vest at the normal time and were still subject to the defined performance conditions.
All-Employee Share Plans The Executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the Companys Inland Revenue approved All-Employee Share Ownership Plan AESOP and the Savings Related Share Option Scheme on the same terms as other employees.
Under the AESOP, employees in the UK are offered the opportunity to buy shares up to the value of 1,500 per annum from pre-tax salary.
Shares are then held in trust on behalf of employees until the maturity date or until they leave the Company.
Under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, employees are entitled to save up to 1,200 per annum from net pay towards the purchase of options to buy Ultra shares after a period of either three or five years, depending upon the employees choice.
Senior Executive share ownership guidelines To increase the alignment of interests between senior executives and shareholders, the Committee has introduced a share ownership guideline under which all Executive Directors will be encouraged to retain at least 50% of the post-tax shares they acquire on the vesting of LTIP awards until a holding equivalent to 100% of base salary is achieved.
Pre-existing shareholdings will be taken into account.
