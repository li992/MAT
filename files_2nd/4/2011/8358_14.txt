52 Interserve AnnuAl report 2011 GovernAnce DIrectors remunerAtIon report Directors remuneration report DAvID tHorpe CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE Dear Shareholder I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committees annual report on directors remuneration.
The Groups management has delivered good results in 2011 against the background of challenging global economic conditions.
In particular, headline earnings per share has increased by 15.2 per cent and good progress was made on a number of strategic fronts.
Our share price increased by 39 per cent over the year, outperforming our sector by 47.7 per cent.
During the year the Remuneration Committee the Committee was again mindful of the general restraint on pay across the Group.
The salaries of the executive directors were increased by 2.5 per cent from 1 July 2011 which was broadly in line with the average increase in salaries across the entire business.
Our remuneration policy has been adjusted in a couple of respects.
Following the implementation of the final changes to the taxation of pension schemes, the Committee conducted a review of the pension arrangements for the most senior executives within the UK.
From July 2011 the employer contribution for the most senior executives was increased from 10 per cent to 15 per cent of basic salary subject to an employee contribution of 8 per cent and provisions were introduced to permit the employer contribution to be taken as a salary supplement by those whose pension savings reach the lifetime allowance.
The performance conditions for the annual variable pay arrangements have been set such that only a performance materially ahead of market expectations in terms of normalised earnings per share EPS would attract a significant payout of variable pay.
During the year I also undertook an exercise which confirmed that the mix of EPS and total shareholder return TSR performance conditions attached to the Companys Performance Share Plan was aligned to the Boards strategic ambitions, which are to grow EPS in a sustainable manner and to deliver long-term superior returns to shareholders.
The Committee has also specifically examined the alignment of the policy on long-term incentives to the Boards belief that the Company has the capability to double earnings per share over five years.
In consequence the policy under the Performance Share Plan has been amended so that the award level will be increased but at the same time subject to tougher EPS targets.
The Committee, however, remains mindful to strike an appropriate balance between incentivising senior management, providing stretching targets which support the Boards strategic ambitions whilst, at the same time, not encouraging excessive risk taking.
Accordingly, to help mitigate risk, tougher shareholding guidelines for executives have been introduced.
The modest increase to pension contributions and the increased Performance Share Plan award level brings total remuneration closer to but not in excess of mid-market levels for similar sized FTSE 250 businesses.
Executive pay remains a highly topical issue and the Committee continues to monitor best practice and regulatory guidance to ensure that our policy retains a good link between reward to executives and the performance of the business.
A resolution to approve this report will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and I very much hope that you will vote in favour.

4 Variable pay for 2011 was based on the achievement of normalised EPS i. e. basic earnings per share adjusted to remove the effects of IAS 36 Impairment of assets and IAS 39 Financial instruments, any return generated from the sale of any of the Groups PFI investments in excess of the internal rate of return set by the Board at the approval stage for that investment, and any other items determined by the Committee.
The performance conditions were set such that variable pay of between 10 per cent and 100 per cent of basic salary would become payable upon achievement of between 90 per cent and 115 per cent of budgeted normalised EPS.
A performance below 90 per cent of budgeted normalised EPS would result in no variable pay becoming payable.
The operation of the variable pay scheme for the 2011 financial year resulted in a payment of 100 per cent of basic salary for each executive director, the details of which are shown in the table above.
