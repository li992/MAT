Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual report & accounts 2011 Details of each individual element of the total reward package are given below: i.
Base salary The Committees policy is to position base salary for each director at the median level compared to market practice.
Base salaries are reviewed annually and are determined by taking into account the performance of the individuals, changes in their responsibilities and information from independent remuneration consultants on the levels of salary for similar jobs having regard to the size of the Company its turnover, market capitalisation and complexity.
The Committee also takes into account internal relativities and the total remuneration of the executives compared to the market.
Base salary is the only element of remuneration which is pensionable.
In addition, benefits are provided to executive directors in accordance with market practice.
For 2011, the Committee felt it appropriate to again freeze the CEOs salary and to grant a 5% increase to the CFO.
This delivered median positioning against the comparator group and reflects the increased scope of the role held by the CFO over 2010.
For 2012, the CEO and CFO will both receive salary increases of 3%, taking their salaries to 555,000 and 389,300 respectively.
This increase is in line with salary increases provided to the wider workforce.

Incentive arrangements annual Bonus Annual bonuses payable to executive directors in respect of 2011 comprised two elements.
The first element related to pre-exceptional profit before tax PBT, and the second element related to cash flow performance over the year.
The maximum annual bonus a participant can receive under the combined elements is 200% of salary.
Any bonus earned over 100% of salary will be deferred into shares, with 50% of the deferred amount released after one year and 50% released after two years subject to continued employment.
Under the PBT component, no bonus is payable for achieving below Threshold performance.
At Threshold performance, 25% of salary can be earned rising to 77% of salary for achieving a Target level of PBT performance with straight-line vesting between these points.
Above Target, the bonus is determined on a profit share basis whereby participants earn a bonus based on a fixed percentage of the Companys PBT.
In 2011, the profit share percentages for the CEO and CFO were 0.45% and 0.31% respectively.
In respect of the cash flow element of the bonus, executives can earn up to 40% of salary based on achieving pre-determined cash flow targets.
15% of salary is payable for achieving Threshold performance and 40% of salary is payable for achieving Maximum performance, with payments determined on a straight-line basis between these points.
No bonus in respect of the cash flow element will be paid below Threshold.
Cash flow targets are assessed again at the end of February 2012 to ensure that cash flow levels have been maintained beyond the December 2011 year end.
Cash flow is defined as the difference between reported Net Debt at the end of the financial year and the beginning of the financial year.
directors remuneration report continued A summary of the operation of the Annual Bonus Plan for 2011 is shown below: deferred shares Cash flow targets any bonus earned over 100% up to 40% of salary of salary, up to 100% salary annual bonus Profit share Cash % of PBT up to 100% salary Performance measures delivery mechanism The Groups performance against its financial targets, as it affected the payout of the bonus in respect of the performance year ending 24 December 2011, is shown in the table below: Key performance indicator actual performance in 2011 Bonus as % of salary M Ingle M Robson PBT 110m 92 90 Cash inflow 22m 40 40 Total bonus earned 132 130 Co-Investment Plan CIP 42 Under the Co-Investment Plan, in 2011 the CEO was eligible to invest up to the lesser of 650,000 shares and 150% of salary of his own shares into the plan for a period of three years.
At the time of award, 650,000 shares equated to 133% of salary.
The CFO was eligible to invest up to the same proportion of salary as the CEO.
Both the CEO and CFO invested the full amount.
In return for this commitment, each invested share is matched with up to two additional shares which vest subject to the achievement of stretching PBT growth targets over the three year vesting period.
The PBT targets are intended to focus managements attention on longer-term PBT growth than is addressed by the annual bonus, as this is key to unlocking shareholder value by generating sufficient profit growth to address legacy MFI issues.
The targets are set out in the table below: PBT growth Number of matching shares that vest 12% p. a.
2 Straight-line vesting between these points Straight-line vesting between these points 6% p. a.
0 Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual report & accounts 2011 Incentives for 2012 Annual Bonus In 2012 the bonus will continue to consist of a profit share and cash flow element.
Under the profit share component, the minimum Threshold level of PBT performance will be increased to 99m 80m in 2011 and the payout at this level of performance will be reduced to 10% of salary 25% in 2011.
The level of payout for Target PBT performance will remain at 77% as in 2011.
Above target PBT, the CEO will be eligible to earn 0.43% of PBT 0.45% in 2011.
The CFO will be eligible to earn 0.30% of PBT 0.31% in 2011.
The profit share bonus will vest on a straight-line basis between Threshold and Target performance.
Under the cash flow component, executives will again be able to earn up to 40% of salary subject to achieving predetermined cash flow targets on a sliding scale.
In addition to cash flow, the Committee will also consider the working capital management over the year measured by reference to stock and debtor days in reviewing the outcome under this element of the plan.
The maximum overall bonus opportunity will remain capped at 200% with any bonus earned in excess of 100% of salary being deferred into shares.
Co-Investment Plan The CEO will again be eligible to invest up to the lesser of 650,000 shares or 150% of salary, with the CFO eligible to invest an equivalent proportion of salary.
As per 2011, each invested share will be matched by up to 2 matching shares, dependent on PBT performance.
The PBT targets that will be used to determine the vesting of matching shares will be kept the same as for 2011, with 2 matching shares vesting for 12% p. a. PBT growth and 0.5 matching 43 shares vesting for 6% p. a. PBT growth.
Other existing arrangements The following incentive plans discretionary and all-employee are also at the Committees disposal.
These plans were not operated in 2011: Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP A new LTIP was adopted by the Company at the AGM in 2009 on broadly similar terms to our previous plan but with rules i. e. change of control and leavers brought into line with current corporate governance best practice.
Awards of restricted shares or share options may be made under the LTIP.
There is no intention to use the plan in 2012 for executive directors.
FreeShare Plan The FreeShare Plan was introduced in 2002.
Executive directors may participate in the plan on the same terms as all other eligible employees.
The plan is HMRC approved and is not subject to performance conditions other than continued employment.
Under the FreeShare Plan all eligible employees were invited to accept an allocation of up to 200 of the Companys shares in September 2002 and again in May 2003.
The shares are held in a Trust for a holding period being between three and five years after which the award of shares will vest and participants may withdraw their shares.
No further allocations have been made since those dates.
The FreeShare Plan will lapse in 2012, and will not be used going forward.
Pensions Executive directors can participate in the Howden Joinery Group Pension Plan the Plan.
The Plan is funded and HMRC approved.
With effect from 1 September 2006 the basis changed to a hybrid defined benefit, occupational pension plan.
Its main features are currently: directors remuneration report continued The defined benefit pension accrues on a Career Average Revalued Earnings CARE basis at the rate of 1 50th of actual pensionable pay in each year currently capped at 127,800 : post-retirement increases are linked to the increase in the retail prices index with a maximum of 2.5%: members contribute 8% of pensionable pay to the CARE plan: in addition to the defined benefit section, the Company will match any voluntary member contribution made to the defined contribution top-up section to a maximum of 8% of pensionable pay.
To recognise the impact of the change in the taxation of pensions on individuals, the member may opt to receive a salary supplement of 8% of salary in lieu of this defined contribution opportunity: life assurance cover of six times pensionable pay for those members with dependents and two times for those without dependents: pension payable in the event of ill health: and spouses pension on death in retirement of 2 3 of deceaseds pension.
Pensionable pay is limited to the members basic salary.
All plan benefits are subject to HMRC limits.
A pension supplement system operates concurrently with the Plan which recognises that pension entitlement in respect of the CARE part of the Plan has included maximum benefit restrictions which was 127,800 for 2011 being based on the Earnings Cap applied prior to April 2006.
This supplement is 30% of basic salary above the Plan Cap to reflect competitive market practice.
44 If a director chooses to opt out of membership of the pension plan, then the supplement payment will be 30% of total Basic Salary.
The CEO had a fully funded pension position in 2006 and hence has chosen to opt out of membership of the Plan and consequently receives a salary supplement.
Mark Robson continues to participate in the Plan.
service contracts All executive directors employment contracts have twelve months notice of termination on both sides.
In the event of termination by the Company, there will be no compensation for loss of office due to misconduct or resignation.
In other circumstances, executive directors may be entitled to receive compensation for loss of office which will be paid monthly for a maximum of twelve months.
Such payments will be equivalent to the monthly salary that the executive would have received if still in employment with the Company.
Executive directors will be expected to mitigate their loss within a twelve month period of their departure from the Company.
v. external appointments It is recognised that executive directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies and that exposure to such duties can broaden their experience and skills, which will benefit the Company.
Howden Joinery Group allows executive directors and other appropriate senior employees to accept a maximum of one non-executive appointment outside the Company, subject to permission from the Committee, provided this is not with a competing company nor likely to lead to conflicts of interest.
No such appointments are currently in place.
Executive directors may retain the fees paid to them in respect of their non-executive duties.
Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual report & accounts 2011 NON-exeCUTIve dIReCTORs RemUNeRaTION Non-executive director appointments are for an initial period of three years.
They are subject to re-appointment annually in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Non-executive directors do not have contracts of service or notice periods and are not entitled to any form of compensation in the event of early termination for whatever reason.
The remuneration of non-executive directors, other than the Chairman, is considered by the Chairman and the Chief Executive.
The Chairmans remuneration is determined by the Remuneration Committee while the Chairman is absent.
A review was conducted in 2010 to ensure that remuneration for non-executive directors reflects the time commitment and responsibilities of their roles.
The review resulted in no increase in the remuneration of the Chairman and non-executive directors.

The table above includes an accrued amount for the period from 1 October 2011 to 24 December 2011.
Further details of the pension supplement are given on page 44.

Therefore the basic salary figure noted for Mark Robson is lower to take account of that.
