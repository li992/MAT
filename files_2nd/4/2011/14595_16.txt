46 Spectris plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Directors Remuneration Report Letter from Russell King Chairman of the remuneration committee Dear Shareholder, As the chairman of the remuneration committee, I am pleased to present to you the 2011 Directors Remuneration Report of Spectris plc.
Remuneration strategy Your committee is acutely aware of increasing public scrutiny of executive pay and concern regarding unmerited payments.
At Spectris, the close linkage of reward to the performance of the company has always been a guiding principle underlying our executive remuneration.
The balance of remuneration for the executive directors is, therefore, such that a very significant part of their overall reward is conditional upon the Russell King attainment of demanding growth-related performance conditions over both the short and long term.
Chairman of the remuneration committee The key elements of the executive directors remuneration arrangements thus are: base salary and total package including benefits set at or modestly below the median of comparable UK quoted companies, subject to adjustment up or down to reflect the experience and performance of individual directors: on-target and maximum annual bonus of, respectively, 50% and 100% of salary, only payable on achievement of stretching profit before tax and individual objectives: annual awards under the companys performance share plan of up to 125% of salary, with vesting after three years based half upon total shareholder return TSR relative to the FTSE 250 index and half upon real growth in adjusted earnings per share EPS : and long-term investment in the continuing growth of the company, with any annual bonus achieved in excess of 60% and any performance share plan vesting having to be retained in Spectris shares until a minimum two times base salary shareholding is achieved.
The anticipated reward mix for the Chief Executive, group finance director and business group director is shown in the chart below.
This assumes Performance Share Plan awards with a value on grant equal to 125% of the directors basic salary leading to an expected vesting of 55% of the award 68.75% of basic salary and an annual bonus on-plan expectation of 50% of salary.
Base pay 41% Pension 10% Annual bonus 21% Performance Share Plan 28% 2011 remuneration The excellent financial performance of the company in 2011, with adjusted profit before tax PBT rising by 45% to record levels, enabled the top end of the profitability target range established for the annual bonus to be surpassed.
The company has also enjoyed good absolute and relative growth over the three years 2009 to 2011, with adjusted EPS increasing by 70%, the share price by 140% and the annual dividend by 44% over the period.
Consequently, the performance share plan awards maturing on 25 February 2012 are expected to show vesting at the upper end of both the EPS and TSR ranges.
21119.04 07 03 12 Proof 8 Spectris plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 47 Whilst only a snapshot in time, at the end of 2011 the performance share plan grants maturing in 2013 were on track for full vesting on both the EPS 173% growth over the two years 2010 and 2011 and TSR performance above upper quintile performance conditions.
The grants made in April 2011 are at a very early point in their three-year performance period, but with 43% growth in EPS during 2011 and TSR at above median to the end of 2011, they are so far on track to achieve some level of vesting.
The aggregate pre-tax pay achieved by each executive director in 2011 was as follows: Pension contributions Benefits 2011 Share 2011 2010 in lieu in kind Bonus award total Total Base salary supplements expenses outcome exercises 000 000 J E OHiggins 500 125 19 500 337 1,481 1,104 C G Watson 310 78 19 310 509 1,226 726 J C Webster 268 67 19 268 451 1,073 841 Future reviews As we have previously advised, it is your committees practice only to undertake detailed reviews of executive compensation every two years, or more, rather than annually.
The next such review will be effective 1 January 2013.
The committee had decided that a basic salary increase of 2.5% 5% for Mr Watson should be awarded to the executive directors at 1 January 2012.
However, in light of the current uncertain macroeconomic environment, the executive directors have requested that implementation of this increase should be deferred until such time as the outlook becomes clearer.
The next compensation review for the Chairman will take place on 1 January 2013 and the fees for the non-executive directors will also be reviewed by the Board at that time.
Your committee has become aware that the current maximum level of annual award under the performance share plan has, at 125% of salary, fallen materially behind market norms.
The operation of the plan will be reviewed during the coming year with the intention of submitting proposals to shareholders at the 2013 Annual General Meeting.
I hope that you will support the advisory vote on the 2011 Directors Remuneration Report which will be put to the Annual General Meeting.

These additional award shares are subject to application of the performance criteria attaching to the award.
The above awards were made as conditional rights to acquire shares structured as nominal cost options and the number of shares awarded was based on the mid-market closing price of the companys shares on the business day prior to the date of grant.
In respect of the 2011 award, for each of Mr OHiggins, Mr Watson and Mr Webster, the value of the award was equivalent to 125% of their base salaries at the date of grant.
Following satisfaction, in whole or part, of the performance criteria attaching to the awards as summarised on page 49, the directors may call for the release to them of the vested shares during the above-shown exercise periods.
The awards granted to Mr OHiggins, Mr Watson and Mr Webster in 2008 of 53,400, 34,900 and 31,700 award shares, respectively, became exercisable and were exercised by Mr OHiggins, in part, and by Mr Watson and Mr Webster, in full, during the year.
The awards had two performance conditions attaching to them.
The TSR target was met in full 50% of the award and the EPS target was met to 44.35% of the award.
In determining the level of vesting against the TSR target, the committee took into account the companys underlying financial performance.
The awards were satisfied from the companys treasury shares.
