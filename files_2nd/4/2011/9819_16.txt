Derek Andrew retired from the Scheme on 28 February 2011 and elected to take a tax free lump sum of 450,000.
The 1 October 2011 accrued pension is for his remaining pension entitlement.
The value of this 450,000 is effectively included into the transfer value as at 2 October 2010 but not at 1 October 2011 and explains the change in transfer value.
2 The change in accrued pension during the year reflects that inflation over the period has been 5.6%, being the measure of RPI to September 2011.
Given Derek Andrew retired from the Scheme before the year end, no allowance for inflation has been made in this figure.
For Derek Andrew we have calculated the change in the accrued pension to 28 February 2011 before the reduction for early payment and the tax free lump sum.
David Thompsons pension has increased over the year but only by marginally more than the rate of RPI hence the small change in accrued pension net of inflation.
3 The Transfer Values at 1 October 2011 are calculated in accordance with the cash equivalent transfer value basis adopted by the Trustee on 7 September 2011, after taking advice from the Scheme Actuary.
4 The figures as at 2 October 2010 for Alistair Darby have been restated to reflect his decision to choose 80th accrual from 1 May 2010.
5 From 1 May 2010 Directors were provided with the option of a 25% salary supplement as an alternative to continued membership of the Scheme.
No Director has yet taken this option.
Additional information: a Normal retirement age is 60.
Early retirement can be taken from age 55 provided the Group gives its consent.
The accrued pension will then be reduced to take account of its early payment.
b On death before retirement a lump sum is payable equal to the Directors contributions including those made via salary sacrifice.
Some or all of this lump sum may be used to provide a statutory minimum spouses pension.
On death after retirement the spouses pension payable is two-thirds of the members pre-commutation pension for David Thompson, 60% for Ralph Findlay and Alistair Darby and, in respect of Stephen Oliver, 60% of his post-1 January 2002 service and 50% of his pre-1 January 2002 service.
c The normal contribution rate for Directors retaining existing benefits is 13.5%, paid by way of salary sacrifice.
d There are no discretionary benefits.
