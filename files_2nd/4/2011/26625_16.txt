The Remuneration Committee has reviewed remuneration governance building on the robust governance framework already in place and taking steps to achieve full compliance with the FSA Remuneration Code.
Further information is set out at section 2.
The following developments are important in understanding compensation costs in this period in comparison with the prior period: Integration of GLG: Discretionary investment managers such as GLG typically have higher compensation to revenue ratios.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the GLG compensation arrangements, aligned these with Man where appropriate for competitive positioning and achieved a combined ratio which appropriately reflects the balance of the firms business at 37%.
GLG prior year figures: GLG is included for the full current nine month financial period ended 31 December 2011.
With the acquisition of GLG in October 2010 the prior year figures for the year ended 31 March 2011 included only 5.5 months of GLG compensation.
Bonus period: Man has moved from a 31 March to a 31 December year end and introduced a calendar year bonus period.
The performance and bonus period for 2011 is 12 months to 31 December 2011 whereas the financial period is nine months to 31 December 2011 9M 2011 in the table R2 plus an accrual for the three month period to 31 March 2011 this accrual is included in 12 month FY2011 period in table R2.
The comparable bonus period for Man employees for 2010 is based on 9 months to 31 December 2010.
Man defers a significant proportion of remuneration up to 50% for senior staff this period to strengthen shareholder alignment and staff retention with awards subject to a period of future service.
As a result the cost of these awards is recognised over the service period.
The amortisation of prior year share awards is included in table R2.
1.4 Overview of key compensation metrics To facilitate comparison with the prior year, inter-period comparisons included in table R2 have been calculated on an annualised basis, due to the change in the financial reporting period.
The inter-period comparison does not capture the full impact of incoming GLG staff joining during FY 2011.

Salaries were reviewed but, for the fourth year, there was no increase.

3.2 Executive director remuneration policy Executive directors remuneration has a direct alignment with shareholders.
This focuses on deferrals into shares and options and long-term incentives with performance measures that are critical value drivers for the Company.
In addition to share and option plan participation, executive directors own 1.5% of Company shares.
The Company operates in the alternative investment management sector and is listed on the London Stock Exchange, whilst the majority of its competitors are unlisted.
The recruitment and retention of talent is critical and for this reason it is important that the remuneration structure is competitive and enables the Company to attract and retain high calibre executives and employees within this specialised sector.
It is market practice in the alternative investment management industry for the total remuneration package of executives to contain a high proportion of variable pay which is consistent with the return to shareholders.
For this reason, awards of Company shares under the Companys incentive plans are a significant proportion of the executive directors total remuneration.
This harmonises the interests of executive directors with the Groups shareholders through the promotion and encouragement of share ownership, and is subject to achieving return on equity and growth targets.

Man Group plc Report and accounts 69 for the nine month period ended 31 December 2011 3.3 Annual performance bonus and deferral Executive directors and senior executives are eligible for an annual performance bonus, which is non-pensionable.
Although the Remuneration Committee does not consider it appropriate to establish any maximum percentage of base salary payable by way of performance bonus, bonuses for employees including executive directors are determined by reference to the pre-tax profit after making certain adjustments, including a charge for the surplus capital held by the Group.
Executive directors are awarded bonuses from the same bonus pool as employees which is subject to the governance and risk management set out in the employee section on page 123.
The executive directors and employees had a twelve month performance evaluation and bonus period ended 31 December 2011.
Performance bonuses for executive directors are discretionary.
In considering the appropriate level of bonus for each director, the Remuneration Committee considers: a Strategy assessment measured by the extent to which the individual has contributed towards achievement of the Companys strategic objectives: b Financial assessment measured by the extent to which the Group has achieved its financial targets: and c Qualitative assessment measured by the extent to which the individual has achieved their agreed personal objectives for the year.
With economic uncertainty and volatile trading conditions we acknowledge the Company performance, measured by the Key Performance Indicators KPIs, has experienced a downturn.
For the 9M 2011 period, funds under management have reduced by 15% with a consequential reduction in profitability albeit the Company remains soundly profitable, strongly capitalised and well positioned strategically with progress in accomplishing the following strategic objectives: a Integration of GLG to broaden the range of alternative investment styles we offer to investors: b Continued development of AHL, GLG and Man Multi-Manager to generate investment performance: c Successful launch of innovative new products e. g. Nomura Global Trend in Japan: and d Focused expansion worldwide, with the build out of investment management in Asia and our sales presence in the US.
To align executive directors with shareholders, there is a three year mandatory deferral of a proportion of the annual performance bonus into Company shares.
The value of this mandatory share deferral for prior years has reduced with the share price.
The share price for the prior year award in 2011 was 2.475: these shares will be released at 31 March 2014 and are currently valued at 1.257 31 12 11, a 49% reduction in value.
This deferral is matched by a long-term incentive award in the Performance Share Plan which only vests if performance conditions are achieved see section 3.4.
A further element of the performance bonus is deferred and awarded under the Deferred Bonus Share and Option Plan DBSOP.
In previous years this has been awarded as options over shares with an exercise price set 10% above the market price at grant.
The premium pricing ensures that a return is delivered to the shareholders before the award has value for the executive directors.
Mindful of the current share price, this year the Remuneration Committee will make reduced DBSOP awards as a conditional award in shares for the Finance Director and will award the Chief Executive a reduced overall DBSOP award partially as a conditional award in shares and partially in 10% premium priced options.
These awards will be made after the close period.
The Remuneration Committee has sought to weight the annual performance bonus with a smaller proportion as cash bonus and a larger proportion as mandatory share deferral and conditional compensation so that executive directors have the same interests as shareholders with the quantum of payout at the end of the three and four year vesting periods directly reflecting the share price achieved.
Conditional compensation has been included below at its economic value but since it is subject to performance and service conditions awards this could lapse with nil value as is the case for 2008 awards vesting this year see tables R12 and R13.
Table R8 shows remuneration for the a current 12 month performance and bonus period ended 31 December 2011 and b prior 9 month performance and bonus period ended 31 March 2011.
Remuneration Committee decisions on performance compensation were made for these periods.

These awards are subject to meeting performance and or service conditions which may or may not be met.
The actual amount of remuneration awarded this year, which is eventually received, is subject to these conditions.
Prior period FY11 remuneration which is subject to performance conditions, based on subsequent performance, is likely to have a significantly reduced value to the economic value at grant.
The economic value of performance-based share awards is the face value at the time of grant, multiplied by a performance factor which represented the expected percentage vesting of awards.
A binomial lattice valuation factor has been applied to this expected vesting percentage to estimate the economic value taking account estimated share price volatility, dividend yield and correlation between vesting outcome and share price.
Share and option grants for calendar year 2011 will occur in 2012 after the close period.

1 Eligibility Executive directors are eligible to participate in the Performance Share Plan PSP and Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS.
The PSP and ESOS limit the annual individual awards to 1x and 2x salary respectively.
In prior years the Remuneration Committee has approved maximum awards be granted to executive directors.
In the light of the Company performance, the Remuneration Committee has considered it appropriate to scale back the value of 2012 grants under both the PSP and the ESOS.
Accordingly, for the 2012 financial year the basic PSP award has been reduced from 1x salary to 0.75x for the Chief Executive and 0.5x for the Finance Director: the ESOS award has been reduced from 2x salary to 1.5x for the Chief Executive and 1x for the Finance Director.
All share and option awards are conditional and subject to forfeiture if an executive director resigns or the service contract is terminated for misconduct.
2 Dilution Man share plans comply with the current ABI Guidelines on headroom which provide that overall dilution under all plans should not exceed 10% over any ten year period in relation to the Companys issued share capital, with a further limitation of 5% in any ten year period for discretionary plans.
Share plan awards are within these limits.
3 Performance and service conditions The PSP has a four-year service period.
Both the PSP and ESOS have a three-year performance period with vesting subject to achieving performance conditions.
There are no re-testing opportunities should performance measures not be met at the end of the third year.
The performance conditions are Key Performance Indicators KPIs, namely, Net Management Fee Income Growth NMFIG and Adjusted Return on Equity AROE.
The three year performance period has been chosen as appropriate for business and the period over which growth and returns should be achieved.
The growth measure of NMFIG is a critical long-term value driver for Man.
Net management fee income is the product of two components, namely the funds under management and the net management fee margins.
Net management fee margins are after deduction of all fixed costs and variable costs not attributable to performance fees.
The net margin excludes adjusting items and net finance income costs.
The return performance condition measures the efficiency with which we invest or return our capital.
The adjustment to the ROE measure is to calculate equity excluding the Boards determination of any surplus capital not currently being utilised in the business.
The surplus capital is additional capital in excess of a the minimum regulatory capital of the Group Pillar 1 capital adjusted by the Individual Capital Guidance percentage agreed with the FSA plus any specific add-on, plus b a capital planning buffer set by the FSA, plus c a Board cushion as set by the Board from time to time to give operating flexibility.
Notional interest incurred on surplus capital is deducted in calculating AROE.
Capital strategy is a matter for the Board: executive directors can only influence the policy within the Board framework The Remuneration Committee has previously considered using relative return performance measures.
However, since the Committee is not aware of any listed companies of substantial size whose main business activities are comparable in nature and scale to that of Man Group, such measures were not considered appropriate.
The Committee therefore sets performance conditions to target absolute returns for its shareholders that are designed to be both challenging and appropriate given the regulated nature of the Companys business.
4 Performance conditions for 2012 PSP and ESOS grants Whilst the lower vesting targets remain unchanged for 2012 awards, the upper targets have been reviewed in the light of current market conditions and the Company forecast.
The outcome has been to bring the upper NMFIG target back to 30% as per awards granted in 2009 and 2010 before the GLG acquisition.
The AROE upper target has been brought down to 17.5% recognising that industry expectations on AROE have been recalibrated.
This follows a detailed review by the Remuneration Committee of vesting probabilities.
The Remuneration Committee believes that these upper targets are stretching and have been set to deliver shareholder value over the three-year performance period.
These awards have not been made at the date of this Annual Report but will be made after the close period.

6 Remuneration outcome for 2008 The performance conditions are stretching.
There was nil vesting in the current financial period for PSP and ESOS awards granted in 2008 at the completion of the three-year performance period and these awards have lapsed in 2011.
This is the second year when ESOS has had nil vesting.
The impact has been to reduce the 2008 compensation income for the Chief Executive and Finance Director as set out in tables R12 and R13.

3.5 Share ownership requirements The Chief Executive is required to maintain a shareholding of 200% of base salary.
The Finance Director and Chief Operating Officer are required to maintain a shareholding of 100% of base salary.
Vested PSP and ESOS can be taken into account in applying this test but unvested awards are not eligible for inclusion.
Executive directors are required to build up this shareholding on joining the Board or after a reduction in share price as share and option plan awards vest.
All executive directors meet the minimum shareholding requirement as shown in table R14.
Non-executive directors are encouraged to build a shareholding.
The shareholdings of directors are set out in table R34 on page 133.
Man Group has always sought to facilitate significant share ownership by directors and senior management, principally through plans which encourage and assist the purchase of shares with their own funds or by way of bonus deferral.
The Board and employees worldwide together own an estimated 12.2% of the Companys share capital, directly or through employee trusts established and funded for this purpose.
The Board alone directly holds 1.5% of the issued capital.
The Employee Trusts are included in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
