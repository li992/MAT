Overview This section of the Remuneration Report is not required to be audited.
In its 2011 annual review the Remuneration Committee concluded that the current remuneration strategy and structure remain appropriate and provide strong alignment with the creation of shareholder value and an appropriate balance between long-term and short-term reward.
The reward programme is compatible with the Companys approach to risk, and reinforces the Companys values and behaviours dened in The IMI Way.
The committee is encouraged by the excellent results achieved by the business and regards performance related pay as a critical element of remuneration and a driver of success.
Against a global backdrop of political, economic and market instability, IMI management has achieved a record segmental operating performance and adjusted earnings per share growth and upper quartile relative shareholder returns.
A review of remuneration decisions and proposals is set out below: Base salaries: modest increases of up to 2.8% in executive salaries have been made for 2012 taking into account s in particular the financial performance of the businesses, economic uncertainties in some of our markets, external benchmarking and internal relativities within the wider senior management team and general employee population.
Annual Incentive Plan: 2011 Annual Incentive Plan weighted as 85% on financial performance and 15% on a range of s non-financial measures including personal objectives.
The 2012 bonus metrics are confirmed as profit before tax and exceptional items, Group adjusted EPS, organic revenue growth percentage, cash conversion percentage and some non-financial measures, based on health and safety, ethics and compliance and personal objectives.
Risk review: a remuneration strategy and structure risk review was carried out in 2011 with the Independent Advisor to s the committee.
This review will continue on an annual basis to ensure alignment with strategy and performance drivers.

The Remuneration Committee continued 2.6 Non-executive directors remuneration The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined, after reference to external benchmarks, by the Chairman and the executive directors.
The policy on non-executive remuneration is to pay an appropriate level on a comparative basis for their time and work on the Board and its committees.
They do not participate in any bonus or employee share schemes of the Company and no part of their remuneration is conditional upon the performance of the Company.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is shown in the table on page 63.
Annual remuneration in 2011 was as follows: Non-executive directors fee 52,500. s Additional fee for chairing a committee 10,000. s Additional fee for the senior non-executive director 5,000. s Non-executive directors fees are reviewed annually but were not increased in 2012. s 2.7 Terms of appointment of the Chairman and the non-executive directors Letters of appointment set out the key duties and expectations for the non-executive Chairman and the independent non-executive directors.
They include appropriate time commitments, provisions for induction and familiarisation with the businesses and wider senior management team and require approval for other directorships and potential conicts of interest.
The dates and unexpired terms of the letters of appointment for the non-executive directors, which are available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting and at the Companys registered ofce, are as follows: Date of letter Unexpired term Date of appointment of appointment at 01.01.12 as a director K S Beeston 07.01.12 1 year 2 months 08.03.05 A M Frew 07.01.12 1 year 2 months 02.03.06 T M Gateley 01.09.11 1 year 5 months 01.11.03 R Quarta 01.09.11 2 years 5 months 01.06.11 R J Stack 01.09.11 2 years 5 months 13.06.08 The normal period for initial appointment and first renewal is three years.
After six years, renewal is usually considered on an annual basis and this currently applies to Kevin Beeston.
However, in 2011 Terry Gateleys term was extended until the Annual General Meeting in 2013, to ensure he continues to be available as senior independent director to support the new Chairman.
Appointments are made under a letter of agreement subject to removal under the Companys articles of association, and all directors will be submitting themselves for annual re-election at the Annual General Meeting in accordance with the new UK Corporate Governance Code.
There are no provisions for the Company to give notice or pay compensation in relation to the early termination of the appointment of the Chairman or any non-executive director.
There is a provision in the appointment letters to the effect that a non-executive director is normally expected to give at least one months prior notice of termination to the Company and, in the case of the Chairman, three months notice.
3.0 Executive directors remuneration and terms of appointment This section of the Remuneration Report is not required to be audited.
3.1 Statement of policy The Company aims to ensure that remuneration generally, and incentives in particular, provide strong alignment between individual performance, business performance and shareholder interests.
The remuneration policy also recognises that the Company operates in global and highly competitive markets with the vast majority of its activities outside the UK.
The policy is to provide competitive remuneration packages to attract, motivate, reward and retain executives of the calibre required, and to align their interests with those of shareholders by relating a significant element of the remuneration package to performance.
During 2011 the committee reviewed the structure and metrics of the incentive arrangements for the executive directors from a risk perspective and concluded that they were aligned with appropriate risk-taking and shareholders interests.
50 Board reports BUSINESS OVERVIEW GROUP OPERATING REVIEW RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS BOARD REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Remuneration Committee considers it to be important to maintain the exibility to respond to individual circumstances.
However, its normal approach has been to pay salaries within appropriate market competitive ranges, combined with realistic potential for above-market total compensation if performance is outstanding.
In setting the remuneration of each executive director, the Remuneration Committee takes into account their role and responsibilities, skills and individual performance and makes reference to market rates as evidenced by published studies and comparisons with international UK-based groups of a similar size and complexity.
In connection with this the committee considered benchmarking data prepared by New Bridge Street.
The committee uses such data with caution in view of the risk of an upward ratchet of remuneration levels.
The Remuneration Committee also has received information about and had regard to pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group.
The committee has the discretion to take account of environmental, social and corporate governance matters when setting the remuneration of the executive directors.
The policy of the committee is to set performance conditions for incentives which are both stretching but also reasonably attainable in the environment in which the Company is then operating.
3.2 Key elements of executive packages The key elements of the executive packages and their purposes are set out in the table below.
Elements of executive packages Purpose Base salary Recognise value of the role and the individual.
Annual incentive bonus Performance-based reward for annual performance across a range of financial and non-financial measures.
Share Matching Plan Drive share ownership and co-investment of bonus into shares to increase alignment with shareholders interests.
Performance Share Plan Encourage and reward long-term performance and shareholder value.
Pension provision or allowance Allowance or long-term savings arrangement.
benefit in kind and allowances Medical, company car and fuel or allowances, relocation allowances and an allowance for tax advice.
3.3 Base salary Salary reviews for the executive directors are conducted annually with increases, if any, normally effective from 1 January.
Salaries are set by the Remuneration Committee taking into account the executives role, responsibilities and individual performance and pay conditions elsewhere in the Company and external benchmark data looking at UK listed companies of similar size, complexity and international presence.
The normal policy is to pay salaries within appropriate market competitive ranges for each role.
The salaries for the 2011 financial year were reviewed in December 2010 and the committee decided that it was no longer appropriate to continue the freeze adopted since the 2008 review.
Increases for January 2012 were agreed in December 2011 to reect the outstanding financial performance of the Group, uncertain economic conditions, comparative market data and the need to balance internal relativities.
The committee made the following changes to take effect from 1 January 2012 as shown in Table A on page 52.
In making these decisions the committee took account of the salary increases that have been and will be awarded to employees across all levels and in all parts of the IMI Group.

52 Board reports BUSINESS OVERVIEW GROUP OPERATING REVIEW RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS BOARD REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3.4 Chief Executives remuneration The following charts show the xed and performance-related elements of the Chief Executives remuneration at both target and maximum based on the proposed 2012 incentive arrangements assuming maximum personal investment in the Share Matching Plan and excluding the impact of changes in share price.
This supports the committees policy that a significant proportion of remuneration should be performance-related and that the Company rewards Executives for investing in and retaining shares within IMI.
The mix of remuneration for the other executive directors is broadly comparable, although their maximum bonus potentials are lower.
The Remuneration Committee considers the quantum of the Chief Executives remuneration to be appropriate and commensurate with the growing performance of the Company, changes to the pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group and strong alignment with the creation of shareholder value.
Chief Executives target remuneration Chief Executives maximum remuneration 25% Fixed pay 15% Fixed pay salary salary 75% Variable pay 85% Variable pay annual incentive bonus annual incentive bonus and long-term incentive and long-term incentive awards awards 3.5 Annual Incentive Bonus Executive directors participate in an Annual Incentive Bonus see Table B on page 54.
The Annual Incentive Bonus supports the business strategy by driving and rewarding performance against annual financial, strategic and operational goals which are consistent with the medium to long term strategic needs of the business also taking into account individual behaviour and contribution.
The 2011 Annual Incentive Bonus metrics were weighted as follows: 85% on financial performance and 15% on a range of non-financial measures including personal objectives.
Achievement of the 2011 Annual Incentive Bonus can be seen in Table B on page 54.
The structure for the 2012 Annual Incentive Bonus will remain similar to 2011, which has now been in place for several years.
However, now that Return on Sales is an embedded discipline and to encourage focus on organic growth, the Return on Sales metric has been replaced with an Organic Revenue Growth metric.
A further additional feature for 2012 is the inclusion of Group adjusted EPS within the financial measures.
EPS was chosen as an appropriate measure because it rewards absolute growth in underlying earnings.
The 2012 Annual Incentive Bonus will be weighted as follows: 80% on financial performance and 20% on a range of non-financial measures including personal objectives.
Weighting of Annual Incentive Bonus metrics 2011 Weighting of Annual Incentive Bonus metrics 2012 5% 10% profit before tax profit before tax 5% 5% 5% Return on sales Group adjusted EPS 5% 35% Cash conversion Organic revenue 15% growth Health, safety & 15% 55% environment Cash conversion IMI Way compliance Health, safety & 15% environment 15% 15% Personal objectives IMI Way compliance Personal objectives IMI plc Annual Report 2011 53 BOARD REPORTS REMUNERATION REPORT 3.
Executive directors remuneration and terms of appointment continued 3.5 Annual Incentive Bonus continued Maximum bonus is only payable if the stretching targets set by the Remuneration Committee are met.
All the bonus metrics have a sliding scale calibration and on-target performance will result in a payment of 50% of the maximum bonus.
The Annual Incentive Bonus maximum is shown in Table B below.
There are no changes proposed for the 2012 Annual Incentive Bonus maximum.
The alignment of Annual Incentive Bonus payments to the executive directors with Group profit before tax is illustrated in the chart below.

The Remuneration Committee was then able to choose, at its discretion, to make a contribution into the ERP on their behalf.
Following changes to UK tax legislation during 2011, no further contributions will be made.
The Remuneration Committee always reserves the right to apply discretion in awarding bonuses and performance shares and may exercise this freedom should an executive not achieve their share ownership guideline within a reasonable period.
The committee retains power to reduce or withhold annual bonus payments in exceptional circumstances and in line with best practice it has reserved the power to seek claw-back of bonuses in certain cases where the bonus should not have been paid in the first place see section 7.1 for further details on discretionary powers.
54 Board reports BUSINESS OVERVIEW GROUP OPERATING REVIEW RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS BOARD REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3.6 Share Ownership Guidelines The executive directors and senior executives are subject to share ownership guidelines.
To the extent that an individual does not meet their shareholding guideline, up to 50% of the annual bonus award is required to be invested in shares and a matching award will be made under the Share Matching Plan SMP at a lower level of maximum match.
If the individual meets the shareholding guideline, then the investment of their bonus in shares is encouraged through participation in the SMP with matching at a higher level.
The shareholding guidelines were increased in 2009 to 125% of salary for all the executive directors to be achieved by those in ofce at the time by 30 June 2011 or, for new appointments, within a five year period after joining the Board.
All of the executive directors met the guidelines at the year end.
The levels of holdings at the end of 2011 relative to basic salaries calculated using the average share price in December 2011 were as follows: Executive director Level of share ownership M J Lamb 402% D M Hurt 362% S Toomes 153% R M Twite 226% I W Whiting 633% 3.7 Long-Term Incentive Plans The Company operates two long-term share incentive plans for executive directors: The Share Matching Plan formerly the Deferred Bonus Plan which is a performance-based investment arrangement: and The Performance Share Plan which is a conventional long-term performance incentive plan.
1 Share Matching Plan The Share Matching Plan SMP runs in conjunction with the Annual Incentive Plan and is linked to the achievement of the share ownership guidelines for executive directors and senior executives.
Under the SMP individuals may invest up to 100% of their maximum annual bonus potential into shares: the limit being set on an annual basis by the Remuneration Committee.
The committee intends to allow such a level of investment in 2012.
By investing in the SMP, matching shares may be earned, which vest after three years, subject to the achievement of stretching performance conditions.
Current policy is that awards made under the share matching arrangements, where settled in shares, will be satisfied through shares purchased in the market but the committee retains the exibility to use new issue and treasury shares.
Matching awards allow for a higher level of match up to 200% for shares that are purchased through the voluntary investment of bonus or other monies.
The lower levels of match up to 125% for the Chief Executive and 100% for other executive directors apply to annual bonus that is to be compulsorily paid in shares, being up to 50% of the bonus according to whether, and if so, the extent to which, an executive has not met their share ownership guideline.
The matching share awards are subject to improvement in Economic Value Added EVA over a three year period.
The calculation of EVA is based on segmental operating profit after tax with appropriate adjustments, less a capital charge on the invested capital in the business reecting IMIs cost of capital.
Further details of the performance conditions attaching to existing awards are set out in the notes to the table on page 65.
The 2008 Deferred Bonus Plan DBP awards vested in 2011 at 97% of maximum.
2009 SMP awards are due to vest in March 2012 at 95% of maximum.
Economic uncertainties at the time of commencing the 2009 plan made it difficult to forecast EVA and led to the 2009 SMP awards being made based on exceptional metrics which included one third total shareholder return on the same relative basis as for the 2009 Performance Share Plan awards, one third profit before tax measured annually and one third annual priority targets aligned to annual incentive targets measured annually.
The level of vesting reects the excellent operational performance over the period and the upper quartile relative total shareholder return against the comparator group.
In line with best practice, the committee retains power to claw-back awards in exceptional circumstances see section 7.1 for further details on discretionary powers.

2 Performance Share Plan The Performance Share Plan PSP aligns the interest of executives and shareholders through the delivery of awards in shares and provides a retention tool for key executives.
The PSP allows for share-based awards worth up to a maximum of 100% of annual salary.
The vesting of awards is subject to the satisfaction of stretching performance conditions over a three year period.
The current policy is for PSP awards, where settled in shares, to be satisfied through shares purchased in the market but the committee retains the exibility to use new issue and treasury shares.
The 2009 PSP awards are due to vest in March 2012 at 100% of maximum.
The performance conditions for the PSP awards are shown below: Grant Vest Performance Conditions Maximum earnings per share EPS 50% 2007 2010 relative total shareholder return TSR 50% earnings per share EPS 50% 2008 2011 relative total shareholder return TSR 50% 2009 2012 relative total shareholder return TSR 100% return on operating capital employed RoOCE 25% 2010 2013 earnings per share EPS 50% relative total shareholder return TSR 25% return on operating capital employed RoOCE 25% 2011 2014 earnings per share EPS 50% relative total shareholder return TSR 25% organic revenue growth CAGR 25% 2012 2015 earnings per share EPS 50% relative total shareholder return TSR 25% 3.7.
2.1 Total Shareholder Return performance condition Total Shareholder Return TSR is well understood and accepted as a performance measure for long-term incentives and links rewards to shareholder value.
PSP awards granted under the plan in 2009 were also subject to a single performance condition in respect of relative TSR because economic uncertainties made it difficult to set a realistic three year earnings per share target.
IMIs relative TSR performance at the end of the three year performance period ended 31 December 2011 placed it at the top end of the upper quartile of the comparator group and as a result the 2009 PSP awards will vest in full in March 2012.
TSR Performance 225% 200% 175% 150% 125% Median to top 25% TSR 100% Company TSR 75% 50% 25% 0% -25% -50% 2009 2010 2011 Three year performance period ended 31 December... 56 Board reports BUSINESS OVERVIEW GROUP OPERATING REVIEW RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS BOARD REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 25% of the 2011 and intended 2012 PSP awards are subject to a TSR performance condition.
TSR is dened as the movement in the share price during the performance period on a local currency basis with adjustments to take into account changes in capital structure and dividends which are assumed to be reinvested in shares on the ex-dividend date.
The vesting schedule for the element of awards subject to the TSR performance condition is as follows: Ranking Vesting Upper quartile top 25% or above 100% Between median and upper quartile Pro-rata between 25% and 100% Median 25% Below median 0% To ensure that TSR reects improvement in the underlying performance of the Company the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the financial performance of the Company over the performance period warrants the level of vesting as calculated under the TSR condition.
In the event that the Remuneration Committee is not satisfied in this respect on the vesting of a PSP award it has committed to disclose the factors that it reviewed and give a commentary on the exercise of its overriding discretion.
The TSR comparator groups for awards made in 2008 to 2011 are shown below: Name Country Name Country Amada Japan Johnson Matthey United Kingdom Atlas Copco A Sweden Manitowoc United States BBA Aviation United Kingdom Meggitt United Kingdom Bodycote International United Kingdom Metso Corporation Finland Borgwarner United States NSK Japan Cobham United Kingdom Parker-Hannin United States Cookson Group United Kingdom Pentair United States Eaton United States Rotork United Kingdom Emerson Electric United States Sandvik Sweden Fanuc Japan Seco Tools B Sweden Flowserve Corp United States SKF B Sweden GKN United Kingdom SMC Japan Halma United Kingdom Spectris United Kingdom Heidelberg Druck Germany Spirax-Sarco Engineering United Kingdom Honeywell United States Sulzer AG Switzerland IDEX Corp United States THK Japan Illinois Tool Works United States Tyco International United States Ingersoll-Rand United States Weir Group United Kingdom Invensys United Kingdom Yaskawa Electric Japan Country is shown as country of primary listing.
Note: Enodis, Tomkins, FKI and Charter had been included in the comparator group but delisted between 2008 and 2011.
The 2012 comparator group will be the same as it was in 2011 subject to any delisting.

2.1 Total Shareholder Return performance condition continued The graph below compares the Companys total shareholder return over the five years ended 31 December 2011 with that of the FTSE All Share Industrial Engineering Index and the FTSE All Share Index.
The FTSE All Share Industrial Engineering Index was chosen as a comparator index because it is the industry share index in which the Company is classied and provides a reasonable benchmark for assessment of its relative performance.
The FTSE All Share Index was chosen as it is a relevant broad equity market index.
Over the past five years the total shareholder return has underperformed the FTSE All Share Industrial Engineering Sector Index by 24.6% and outperformed the FTSE All Share Index by 94.4%.
2.2 EPS performance condition EPS was chosen as an appropriate measure because it rewards absolute growth in underlying earnings and because the Remuneration Committee believed it worked well in combination with TSR which is a comparative measure.
The performance condition for one half of the 2011 PSP awards and the intended 2012 PSP awards will be based on the Companys compound annual earnings per share growth over a three-year period.
The Remuneration Committee sets the EPS targets in respect of each annual award at the level it considers appropriately stretching given the conditions in which the Company is operating.
The vesting schedule for the awards subject to the EPS performance condition proposed to be granted in 2012, which is the same as for the 2011 awards, is as follows: Compound EPS growth Vesting 15% per annum 100% Between 6% and 15% per annum Pro-rata between 25% and 100% 6% per annum 25% Less than 6% per annum 0% As for 2011 awards, the EPS measure for intended 2012 PSP awards will be based on adjusted basic earnings per share which includes adjustment for the elimination of the after tax cost of restructuring, acquired intangible amortisation and impairment, financial instruments, but including economic hedge contract gains and losses, and excluding any other items meeting the denition of an exceptional item as dened in the Group Accounting Policies.

2.3 Return on Operating Capital Employed performance condition Return on Operating Capital Employed RoOCE was adopted as a performance measure for a portion of PSP awards in 2010 to incentivise sustained working capital improvement.
The vesting of the other 25% of the 2011 PSP award will depend on IMIs average RoOCE over the three years from the year of grant.
For 2011 awards RoOCE has been dened to exclude intangible assets and calibrated as follows: Average RoOCE Vesting 85% 100% Between 65% and 85% Pro-rata between 25% and 100% 65% 25% Less than 65% 0% Given the focus on organic revenue growth, and the acceptance that strong margin discipline is rmly embedded across the Company for the 2012 PSP grant the RoOCE element will be replaced with a 3-year compound growth in organic revenue.
2.4 Organic revenue growth % 2012 PSP performance condition Organic revenue growth % CAGR is being adopted for the 2012 PSP to encourage focus on organic growth.

4.1 UK SAYE plan The Company operates a HM Revenue and Customs approved savings-related share option scheme which is open to the majority of the Groups UK employees, including the UK-based executive directors, and allows the grant of options to all participants at a discount of up to 20% below the market price.
Such schemes are not subject to performance conditions and offer tax incentives to encourage employees to use their own money to purchase shares in their employers business or group.
4.2 Share Incentive Plan SIP UK executive directors also participate in an All Employee Share Ownership Plan which is open to the majority of the Groups UK employees.
Subject to shareholder approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of a new plan to replace the expired original, shares to a value equal to the lesser of 3,000 and 0.6% of each participants basic salary will be acquired in 2012 at market value by the Trustee of the plan in respect of their participation during 2011.
The plan is not operated subject to specic performance conditions.
Eligible employees are able to invest up to 1,500 annually in a tax-efficient manner in purchasing partnership shares under the plan.
Each of the UK executive directors makes the maximum contribution from their salary towards partnership shares under the plan.
Matching shares may be awarded in respect of partnership shares acquired under the plan although the policy to date has been not to award any matching shares.

All Employee Share Plans continued 4.3 Global Employee Share Purchase Plans New all-employee share plans intended to encourage employee investment in IMI shares were approved by shareholders at the 2011 Annual General Meeting and save as you earn type plans were launched in the USA and Germany with extension into China planned for 2012.
4.4 Share Option Plan A share option plan for senior employees was established in 2009 and shareholder approval of this plan was given at the 2011 Annual General Meeting in order to introduce the exibility to satisfy awards using new issue and treasury shares.
No directors or others who receive PSP awards receive such share options.
Share dilution This section of the Remuneration Report is not required to be audited.
The Association of British Insurers has set recommended guidelines on the number of new issue and treasury shares that can be used under a companys share plans.
The guidelines are 10% of the issued share capital in any 10 year period for all share plans, with an inner limit of 5% in 10 years for executive schemes.
IMI operates within these limits and its standing as at 31 December 2011 was 2.90% and 1.79% respectively.
Pension entitlement This section of the Remuneration Report is not required to be audited.
The IMI Pension Fund was closed to all employees in respect of future service from 31 December 2010 and alternative pension arrangements were established including an Executive Retirement Plan ERP, which was intended to be a tax efficient long-term savings vehicle for UK senior managers to save for retirement outside the registered pensions regime.
Discretionary contributions were made to the ERP in 2010 and 2011 but it has been rendered tax ineffective for future contributions and possible alternative provisions are being kept under review.
6.1 Pension benets provided for 2011 service Under the rules of the ERP which was introduced in 2010, UK based directors and senior managers were able to waive their pension benets and bonus entitlements.
The Remuneration Committee was then able to choose, at its discretion, to make a contribution into the ERP on their behalf, which is an unregistered dened contribution arrangement structured as an offshore trust.
Such contributions to the ERP in respect of executive directors are determined on a basis that is intended to be cost neutral to the Company.
At the 2010 AGM shareholders approved changes to the rules of the SMP and PSP that permit these awards to be settled in the form of employer contributions to the ERP.
Executive directors are entitled to receive a taxable cash allowance instead of pension benets.
With the Remuneration Committees approval the executive directors may, at their discretion, redirect part or all of their allowance into any dened contribution pension arrangement in the country in which they are contracted.
The value of the pension allowance for 2011 can be viewed below.
Value of pension allowance M J Lamb 252,000 35% of salary D M Hurt 138,250 35% of salary R M Twite 133,117 35% of salary I W Whiting 120,750 35% of salary S Toomes 67,375 35% of salary since appointment To reect particular requirements in Switzerland, the Company is establishing a pension arrangement there for S Toomes.
The details of this arrangement are being nalised, but it is expected to be mainly dened-contribution in nature, although there will be a dened benefit element as is required by law in Switzerland.
The Company contributions to this arrangement will be deducted from the pension allowance described above and the contributions will be less than the 60 Board reports BUSINESS OVERVIEW GROUP OPERATING REVIEW RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS BOARD REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS pension allowance, it is expected the arrangement will be backdated to 1 June 2011 and further details will be included in next years report.
6.2 Pension benets for past service M J Lamb, R M Twite and S Toomes were previously active members of the dened benefit IMI Pension Fund.
M J Lamb opted out with effect from 6 April 2006: R M Twite opted out with effect from 1 February 2007 and S Toomes from 31 August 2010.
As a result they retain past pensionable service up to these dates and the value of this is shown in the table on page 66.
The nature of these benets is more complicated than the pension benets provided in respect of 2011, but the key elements are summarised below: The normal retirement age under the Fund is 60 for M J Lamb, and 62 for R M Twite and S Toomes.
M J Lamb may s elect to retire from employment with IMI and receive a pension at any time after age 57 without any actuarial discount, and R M Twite and S Toomes may retire from employment with IMI any time after age 60 without actuarial discount.
On death after retirement, a dependants pension is provided equal to two-thirds of the members pension for s M J Lamb and 50% of the members pension for R M Twite and S Toomes.
Should M J Lamb die within the first five years of retirement, a lump sum is also paid equal to the balance of five s years pension payments.
For R M Twite and S Toomes, the dependants pension is increased to 100% of the members pension for the remainder of the five year period.
Pensions in payment, in excess of any guaranteed minimum pension, are increased each year in line with price s ination up to a maximum of 5% in respect of pension built up before 1 January 2006, and 2.5% in respect of pension built up after 1 January 2006.
M J Lambs past pension benets generally continue to be linked to final salary ination averaged over the past three s years and equivalent benets to those provided for under the Fund rules immediately prior to closure are preserved in relation to ill-health retirement, death in service and early retirement at the Companys instance.
The difference between these benets and those automatically provided under the Fund, the EPM benets, will be assessed as at 31 December 2011 and each subsequent year end until death in service, retirement on ill-health grounds or retirement at the Companys instance and there may be a payment to the Fund to augment Fund benets or a payment in lieu to M J Lamb or his estate or by way of contribution to the ERP or another pension arrangement shortly after each year end until a final augmentation or payment is made following death in service or relevant early retirement event.
As at 31 December 2011 no EPM benets were payable.
I W Whiting is eligible for benets under three arrangements in the USA.
The first is a dened contribution arrangement, the IMI 401 k Plan.
The second is a dened benefit arrangement, the Control Components Inc Employees Pension Plan.
His pension from this plan is payable from age 65 without further increase.
The third is also a dened benefit arrangement, the IMI Americas Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.
His pension from this plan is payable from age 65, subject to completion of 10 years service with the Group, without further increase.
On retirement I W Whiting has the option of exchanging part of his pension to provide for a spouses pension payable on his death after retirement.
The policy regarding pension arrangements for new executive director appointments will be exible to take account of the individual position, the cost of pension arrangements to the Company, including in particular the cost of dened benets, and the alternative forms of pension provision.
However, the norm would be not to offer dened benets to new executive directors.
Termination Clauses This section of the Remuneration Report is not required to be audited.
Consistent with the policy on service contracts, the executive directors service contracts are subject to termination on one years notice by the Company or the executive directors.
Contractual retirement age for UK-based executive directors is 65 and for Switzerland-based executive directors, 60.
These contracts do not include any specic provision for compensation payable upon early termination save that, as a consequence of the closure of the IMI Pension Fund on 31 December 2010, the Company has made alternative contractual arrangements in lieu of certain contractual entitlements to pension benets, which, but for the closure, would have been provided through the IMI Pension Fund to all members in the same membership category as the Chief Executive.
The alternative contractual arrangements for all these members include augmentation of Fund benets to the level that would have been provided save for the closure or payment in lieu in respect of benets arising on early IMI plc Annual Report 2011 61 BOARD REPORTS REMUNERATION REPORT 7.
Termination Clauses continued retirement by reason of redundancy or other termination at the Companys instance.
Had such benets arisen for the Chief Executive as at 31 December 2011, the estimated cash cost to the Company would have been approximately 5.1m.
The payment in lieu computation is designed to be neutral to the Company on a net of tax basis and compared with the cash contributions that would otherwise have been expected to provide the benets through the Fund.
It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee to limit any compensation which might be paid in the event of early termination of an executive directors contract to the legal minimum, taking into account mitigation and other relevant factors.
The dates of the contracts and period to normal retirement age for those serving as executive directors during the year are as follows: Date of Date of Period to legal Date joined appointment service retirement age as Group to Board contract Notice period at 31.12.11 M J Lamb 31.10.86 18.07.96 01.01.11 12 months 13 years D M Hurt 01.05.06 01.07.06 01.10.06 12 months 9 years 5 months S Toomes 18.02.85 01.06.11 01.09.11 12 months 21 years 5 months R M Twite 26.09.88 01.02.07 01.02.07 12 months 20 years 5 months I W Whiting 18.07.05 01.09.10 01.01.10 12 months 17 years 7.1 Discretionary Powers The committee retains power to reduce or withhold Annual Incentive Bonus payments and awards under the long-term incentive share plans in exceptional circumstances as described below.
In line with best practice it has also reserved the power to seek claw-back of bonuses in certain cases where the bonus should not have been paid in the first place.
Claw-back conditions feature in all incentive share plan schemes and annual incentive bonus rules.
Exceptional circumstances would include the requirement to restate the accounts of the Companys group, for example, for a correction of an error as dened by IAS8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors, in circumstances where, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the original overstatement in the accounts has resulted, or would result, either directly or indirectly, in either a participants awards vesting or Annual Incentive Bonus result, to a greater degree than would have been the case had that misstatement not been made: or where a participant is found guilty of any serious criminal offence as determined in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee arising out of or in connection with the participants ofce or employment with a participating company.
External appointments This section of the Remuneration Report is not required to be audited.
Executive directors may accept one external appointment with the consent of the Board, and are normally allowed to retain fees from external non-executive directorships.
M J Lamb was appointed a non-executive director of Severn Trent Water plc on 29 February 2008 and received fees in the year to 31 December 2011 of 46,350 2010: 42,500.

2008 PSP awards vested in 2011 at maximum.
c 2009 awards were entirely based on comparative TSR with the vesting scale as described in b above and will vest in 2012 at maximum.
d 2010 and 2011 awards were based on TSR and EPS measures with the vesting scales as described in b above for 25% and 50% of awards, respectively, and, as to the other 25%, upon RoOCE with vesting on a linear scale from 24% originally 25% before adjustment made in 2011 following the acquisition of Z&J of maximum to maximum for RoOCE of between 24% and 30% originally 25% and 32% before adjustments made in 2011 following the acquisition of Z&J.
e SOP awards shown were made to I W Whiting and S Toomes prior to their appointment as executive directors and are not subject to performance conditions.

2 For M J Lamb and R M Twite the increase in the accrued pension during the year reects the increase under the IMI Pension Fund, which is generally in line with ination.
No allowance has been made for the value of benets that may be derived by the payment of additional voluntary contributions.
3 Or as at date of appointment if later.
4 S Toomes was appointed as a director on 1 June 2011 and the gures shown in the table relate to the period from 1 June 2011 to 31 December 2011.
As S Toomes has been a director for less than one year the increase in accrued pension relative to annual ination and the value of this increase relative to annual ination is not applicable.
5 Figures have been converted using exchange rates of 1:$1.55 as at 31 December 2011 1:$1.57 as at 31 December 2010.
Due to rounding the pension shown as at 31 December 2011 is 1,000 pa higher than that previously shown at 31 December 2010.
The actual increase is less than 500 pa and this is entirely due to the change in exchange rates over the year as in $ terms I W Whitings pension has not changed over the year.
The transfer values that would be payable from the IMI Pension Fund at the relevant date are also shown in the table, together with the transfer value at the end of the year of the increase in the accrued pension over the year net of ination.
The transfer value shown is the estimated capital value of the future pension payments in retirement, determined by the Funds Trustee in accordance with the appropriate statutory requirements.
In respect of I W Whitings benets under US pension arrangements, the transfer value quoted is based on the method and assumptions used by the Company to account for the costs associated with its US dened benefit pension schemes see note 19 to the financial statements on pages 108 to 114.
Under the method and assumptions used by the Company to account for the costs associated with its dened benefit pension schemes, the aggregate value of the accrued benets as at 31 December 2011 for the executive directors was 11.77m 2010: 8.96m.
