[ 82 ] Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2011 Dear Fellow Shareholder, I am pleased to introduce the Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 September 2011 which has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and approved by the Board.
This is a year in which executive pay generally has been under intense public scrutiny, with various reform proposals made from across the political spectrum.
The Committee is sensitive to these public concerns, and understands the importance of its role in striking the right balance between protecting shareholders interests by not allowing payment in the absence of performance, but conversely by providing reward to management where there has been genuine achievement.
Committee activities The Committee met four times during the year to consider the normal cycle of approvals.
Other than implementing the changes made in FY2010, there has been no material change to Lonmins remuneration policy or practices in FY2011.
As a result, while we had various informal contacts with investors, there were no formal consultations during the year.
As always, we are available and happy to discuss remuneration matters with our shareholders.
Strategic alignment of our pay programme It is important that our executives are focussed on doing the things that will make a difference to Lonmin in both the short and longer term.
The annual bonus plan, the BSC, has for some years incentivised strategically important business metrics and there is a clear alignment between the Corporate KPIs on pages 10 and 11 of the Business Review and both the FY2011 and FY2012 BSC metrics.
Safety is one of the biggest risks in our business, and this is one of our BSC metrics.
Our long term incentive plan performance hurdles are based on the combined results of the BSCs over three financial years together with the delivery of value to shareholders measured by our Relative Total Shareholder Return RTSR, providing a further tie to our strategy.
Our shareholding requirements and deferred pay system provide further long term alignment of management with shareholders in respect of both risks and rewards.
FY2011 pay reflects performance The corporate elements of the FY2011 BSC saw 43.0% points being earned out of the overall 80% available at target.
There is full disclosure of each bonus metric on page 93.
FY2011 was a year heavily affected by the safety stoppages in April following a series of fatalities, and the illegal strike at Karee in May.
Generally, our processing results were good and our capital development met target, but we missed our original production targets and unit costs were higher than we hoped as a result.
Most of the long term incentives that were due to vest this year failed to hit their minimum targets as a result of matters discussed in prior years reports, and hence failed to pay anything out.
The Committee has considered these outcomes and chose not to exercise discretion.
The Committee hopes that both management and shareholders will benefit in future.
Proposed future changes We do not propose any material changes to the structure or levels of pay in FY2012.
As the BSC incentivises key strategic KPIs, we do not publish the details of targets in advance, but no material changes to the metrics themselves are contemplated.
AGM This report is subject to an advisory vote at the AGM on 26 January 2012, and I have no hesitation in recommending the report to you.
We will be happy to answer questions at the AGM and will, as always, be interested in your input at any time.
Yours faithfully, Jim Sutcliffe Chairman, Remuneration Committee Directors Report Business Review Directors Report Governance Financial Statements Operating Statistics Shareholder Information 2011 Annual Report and Accounts Lonmin Plc [ 83 ] Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2011 ROLE, STRUCTURE AND ACTIVITIES OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE Role of the Remuneration Committee The Committee has powers delegated to it by the Board as set out in terms of reference available on the Companys website.
These were last updated in November 2005.
The Committees main responsibilities are to: determine and agree with the Board the Companys executive remuneration strategy and policy: determine individual remuneration packages and terms of employment within that policy for the Executive Directors and fifteen other senior executives collectively known as the Purview Group : oversee the operation of the Companys incentive schemes, including designing and setting performance conditions for annual bonus and long term incentive schemes: consider major changes in employee remuneration in the Group select and appoint consultants to advise the Committee: report to shareholders through annual reports: and make recommendations to the Board on the fees offered to the Non-executive Directors, after taking independent professional advice: all of which it carries out on behalf of the Board.
Composition of the Remuneration Committee The Committee comprised the following independent Non-executive Directors during the year and to the date of this report: Member From To Jim Sutcliffe Chairman 28 January 2009 To date Michael Hartnall 8 May 2003 To date Jonathan Leslie 2 July 2009 To date Karen fide Segundo 20 July 2011 To date Mr Hartnall chaired the Audit & Risk Committee until 20 July 2011, and Mr Leslie chairs the Safety & Sustainability Committee, which provides the Committee with useful context.
Dr fide Segundo has extensive executive experience in the natural resources sector.
Mr Sutcliffe has been chief executive of a number of businesses, including a FTSE100 company, in which roles he had responsibility for designing and implementing remuneration systems in support of those companies strategic objectives.
The Board feels that the collective experience of its members enables the Committee to offer a balanced view on executive remuneration issues.
Meetings of the Committee are attended by the CEO, the EVP External Affairs & Human Capital and the Company Secretary who acts as secretary to the Committee, none of whom do so as of right and who do not attend when their own remuneration is being discussed.
The meeting in November 2010 was also attended by the then HR Director.
The Committee meets with the CEO and in private after meetings.
Advisors to the Remuneration Committee During the year, the Committee was materially assisted in its work by: Advisor Appointed by Services provided to the Committee Other services provided to the Company  LLP Committee General advice on Support management in devising London office remuneration matters remuneration proposals IFRS2 valuations of share schemes PwC South Africa provides specialist support to the internal audit function see page 76 Herbert Smith LLP Company Advice on employment General UK legal advice law and share schemes KPMG Audit Plc Committee Assurance in the form of External auditor and certain other limited, specific checking services see page 77 procedures on the results of the BSC The Committee is confident that none of these cross-relationships generates an unmanageable conflict of interest and that the sums payable in respect of each service do not compromise the objectiveness and impartiality of the other.
The Committee also receives views and recommendations from the CEO, the Company Secretary and the EVP : External Affairs & Human Capital in relation to executive remuneration save in relation to their own pay and on governance matters.

The Committee Chairman presents a summary of material matters to the Board and minutes of Committee meetings are circulated to all Directors.
The Committee reports to shareholders annually in this report and the Committee Chairman attends the AGM to address any questions arising.
Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group The Committee is provided with information on pay across the Groups workforce generally and during FY2011 has undertaken a detailed review of the bonus arrangements in place throughout the business.
When debating pay reviews for the Executive Directors, the Committee is provided with both UK and SA inflation data and also insight into the increases being offered to the Groups workforce and other staff members.
Risk alignment The Committee has considered the alignment of the performance-related pay systems with the Companys key risks, and believes that the design of the pay systems incentivises effective risk management, including in relation to environmental, social and governance risks.
The risk of the pay systems themselves causing perverse incentives has also been reviewed by the Committee.
The Annual Share Award Plan ASAP contains a claw back mechanism, discussed more fully on page 86.

In addition, when it is contemplating change, the Committee consults widely with key institutional investors and their representative bodies.
At the AGM held in January 2011, the advisory vote on the remuneration report received the support of 97% of those voting, with holders of less than 1% of the register abstaining or withholding their votes.
The Committee Chairman and the Secretary have responded to a number of queries from shareholders during the year.
REMUNERATION POLICY Non-executive Directors The Board reviews Non-executive Directors fees every two years to ensure that the Company can continue to attract and retain individuals of the highest calibre and that the fees offered are in line with market norms.
As policy, the base fee for the first year of each Directors appointment is paid in advance, recognising the significant time commitment associated with the induction process.
From the end of that year, all fees are paid monthly in arrears.
Executive Directors and senior executives The Committees remuneration policy seeks to address four objectives: Provide a structure and level of pay which attracts and retains executives of the right calibre to execute the Companys strategic plans in the face of severe skills shortages in the South African mining industry: Provide clear and straightforward incentives on a consistent basis, to reward delivery of key strategic objectives within agreed risk parameters: Ensure that there is fairness in the Companys pay arrangements such that all reward has been properly earned but, equally importantly, payment results where this is justified by performance.
We believe that fairness in our pay practices is a powerful tool in retaining employees: and Align the remuneration programme with the interests of the Companys shareholders.
Different elements of executive pay are delivered over the short and longer terms, which recognise each individuals personal contribution: Fixed pay Performance-related pay Annual Long term delivered over three years Annual Share Award Plan ASAP Balanced Scorecard BSC Bonus Base pay share settled Plan cash settled 80% linked to corporate KPIs Benefits car, life and other health Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP 20% linked to personal objectives insurances share settled dependent on 3 year Value matched and deferred for three combined BSC performance and years in an award under the Annual Pension contribution or salary Relative Total Shareholder Return Share Award Plan supplement Shareholding obligation places material amount of personal wealth at risk Each element of the remuneration package has different characteristics, and plays an important role: Base pay and benefits Purpose Policy How it operates Attract and retain executives of the Base salary reflects market median levels, Base pay is paid monthly in cash right calibre to execute the subject to experience and performance Base pay for UK executives is Companys strategic plans Executive Directors and UK senior executives supplemented with a car plus fuel are benchmarked against other UK listed or cash allowance in lieu, private companies of comparable size and, where medical insurance, income appropriate, relevant international mining protection insurance and life companies assurance and the option of annual Other senior executives in South Africa are medicals benchmarked against South African Senior executives based in South market practice Africa have a total cost to company TCTC package which covers base pay and all benefits.

The FY2011 BSC design was fully aligned with the corporate strategy and KPIs, and the design was checked against the corporate risk register by the Committee.
The metrics, targets and outcomes are summarised on page 93, and no material change to the structure of the BSC is proposed for FY2012.
Historically, the Company required executives to invest half of their after-tax bonus in Lonmin shares, to be held in trust and at risk of forfeiture for three years.
Following a ruling by the South African Revenue Service in relation to local income tax legislation, this structure was neither cost effective for the Company nor tax efficient for participants.
At the 2011 AGM shareholders approved the ASAP which improves the ease of administration and preserves the tax efficiency of our pay arrangements in South Africa.
Employees are now provided with a cash bonus at half the original level, together with an award under the ASAP equal in value to the gross annual cash bonus.
Annual Share Award Plan ASAP Purpose Policy How it operates Emphasise alignment with Enables Company to mandate investment Previous bonus halved for ASAP shareholders interests and provide into Lonmin shares by executives participants a mechanism for claw back Pre-grant performance condition as award Award made of equal gross value to size determined by BSC performance Annual Bonus earned in year Rules provide for claw back in the event No post-grant performance of a restatement of the results for the year conditions for which the associated bonus was Vesting on third anniversary assessed during the three year holding period As noted above, the ASAP is a new plan which will operate for the first time in November 2011.
The combination of the reduced annual bonus and the ASAP has the same economic effect and cost as the previous arrangements.
The ASAP supersedes the DABP which will no longer be operated, save in respect of existing awards.
Details of the outstanding entitlements under the DABP are shown in the Appendix.
Directors Report Business Review Directors Report Governance Financial Statements Operating Statistics Shareholder Information 2011 Annual Report and Accounts Lonmin Plc [ 87 ] Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2011 REMUNERATION POLICY continued Executive Directors and senior executives continued Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and Stay & Prosper Plan S&P Purpose Policy How it operates Incentivise long term value creation, Median performance should lead to median Annual awards over shares, subject and alignment with shareholders pay: upper quartile performance should lead to performance conditions for interests to potential upper quartile total reward Executive Directors.
In line with No formal limit on grant size is contained in South African practice, only 50% of the LTIP rules, but the Company has given awards are subject to performance a commitment that in normal circumstances conditions for executives below these would be limited to 150% of base pay board level Our current policy is that awards are settled Vesting percentage is based on a through the issue of new shares performance metric combining the corporate elements of the BSC averaged over 3 years and RTSR over three years see page 89 Vesting can range from zero to 100% Maximum reward will only occur if every item on the corporate BSC for each of the 3 years meets stretch and RTSR exceeds PGM peer group median by 10% pa The Committee believes that it is vital to offer long term incentives to those best placed to deliver value for shareholders, so that they have a direct personal financial interest in so doing.
The annual granting of LTIP awards to the Executive Directors and other executives is also intended to provide participants with the opportunity to earn sufficient reward, subject to delivering value to shareholders, such that they are motivated to stay in the Groups employment.
As these awards are settled in shares, participants have a further link to shareholder value.
For historic reasons, awards to managers in our South African operating companies are made under the S&P, a separate plan from the LTIP.
The Executive Directors are not permitted to participate in the S&P.
Since the introduction of S&P in 2005 a number of decisions have meant that its design and operation has converged with that of the LTIP, from which it now differs solely in the treatment of awards following a change of control of Lonmin Plc.
Should such an eventuality arise, S&P awards crystallise in full but are only payable on their normal vesting date, subject broadly to continued employment.
As with the LTIP, S&P awards are linked to a notional number of shares, 50% of which vest subject to continued employment and 50% of which are linked to performance targets EBIT until 2008 and for 2009 and later grants the same performance targets as the LTIP.
S&P participants receive shares or cash based on the market value of that proportion of the total award that vests at the end of three years.
Our current policy is that such awards are settled through the issue of new shares.
Shareholding obligation Purpose Policy How it operates Alignment with shareholders Executives are expected to amass Target shareholding including vested interests by requiring executives over five years and then maintain a but unexercised share incentives to hold material personal wealth material holding of Lonmin shares should be equal in value to: in Lonmin shares 300% of base salary CEO 200% of notional base salary CFO 100% of notional base salary Exco members 50% of notional base salary Other executives Lonmins business is inherently long term.
In 2010 the Committee was asked by shareholders to consider whether the remuneration programme had sufficiently long term characteristics, and specifically whether the period over which reward is earned or paid should be longer than the three year vesting periods generally used.
The Committee considered extending either the performance and or vesting periods of our LTIP, but ultimately felt that the most powerful incentive for the actions of the Directors to be aligned with shareholders interests is for them to build and retain personally significant investments in Lonmin shares, and increased the target levels to those above.
com [ 88 ] Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2011 REMUNERATION POLICY continued The role of benchmarking Benchmarking is useful in identifying facts for a debate about the positioning of our pay relative to market, and identifying the risk of losing strong performers as a result of prolonged payment below market.
Strategic alignment of the pay programme The pay elements detailed above combine to provide a clear incentive for the delivery of operational results and therefore of value to shareholders, in line with the Committees overall objectives.
Change is only made where there is a clear rationale, in order to preserve clarity over the performance expected of participating executives.

Threshold is the first point at which any element of bonus is payable, and forms the minimum level of achievement for which any part of the LTIP awards can vest.

The Committee is satisfied that there is a strong incentive for the prudent management of risk.
Directors Report Business Review Directors Report Governance Financial Statements Operating Statistics Shareholder Information 2011 Annual Report and Accounts Lonmin Plc [ 89 ] Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2011 REMUNERATION POLICY continued Performance conditions As noted above, long term incentives awarded to the Executive Directors are wholly subject to performance conditions, with half of each award made to executives below Board level subject to the same conditions.
The alignment of these with the corporate strategy is of obvious importance, and the Committee considers the relevance of proposed performance conditions prior to granting awards.
RTSR has always been used by Lonmin as a performance condition.
This measure ensures that the remuneration earned by the executives reflects the actual returns delivered to shareholders through the successful delivery of our strategy.
In addition, the Committee believes that the relative nature of this test provides a measurable and objective reflection of true performance for shareholders in light of the variability introduced into reported results by metal prices and exchange rates particularly between the South African Rand and the US Dollar.
Following meetings with key institutional shareholders in 2010, the Committee decided to introduce a new performance condition for the future.
After exploring a number of options, the Committee concluded that metrics which best incentivise medium-term value creation existed within the corporate element of the BSC.
Moreover, the BSC has been and will be constructed to tie closely to the Companys overall strategy and has served the Company well through stimulating delivery of key targets.
It is of course the sustained delivery of annual performance that delivers long term success.
After further shareholder consultation, the Committee adopted a performance condition which is based on both the corporate elements of the BSC targets and RTSR, which the Committee regards as the ultimate goal, in each case measured over three year periods.
LTIP and S&P awards made in 2010 and 2011 used this performance condition, and it is expected that it will continue to be used in subsequent years.
The matrix below illustrates the vesting outcomes as a percentage of the face value of the award, with full interpolation between the points shown for the 2010 and 2011 LTIP and S&P awards: % of face value vesting RTSR result Factor Average BSC performance over three years BSC result Threshold Threshold Target Stretch Max Factor 0.0x 0.5x 1.0x 1.5x RTSR performance Median 5% pa 0.0x 0% 0% 0% 0% Median 5% pa 0.5x 0% 8.33% 16.66% 25% Median 1.0x 0% 16.66% 33.33% 50% Median 5% pa 1.5x 0% 25% 50% 75% Median 10% pa 2.0x 0% 33.33% 66.66% 100% Factors are multiplied and, as maximum is 2.0 x 1.5 3, the result is then divided by 3 to derive the vesting percentage.
The matrix shows that the result is more geared to RTSR than to the BSC even with every BSC item delivering at stretch, with median RTSR the plans deliver only half the face value.
On the other hand, it allows the Company to recognise at a low level, in difficult times, the hard work that needs to be done for quite long periods before the result is recognised in the share price.
We also believe that the use of annual bonus targets as part of our long term incentive programme helps mitigate the risk that results in one year are at the expense of succeeding years.
Performance conditions are assessed using independently verified data.
The results of the BSC are only declared after assurance on the underlying data has been provided by KPMG, and RTSR is assessed by PwC using data normalised into US Dollars, sourced from Datastream or other independent providers.
Historic performance conditions As seen, LTIP and S&P awards have a three year performance and vesting period.
As a result, the Committee oversees a number of historic performance conditions, using a variety of metrics as detailed below: % of Basis of component of Year of award performance conditions Performance conditions Performance award released 2008 reached 50% RTSR TSR relative to a group of Threshold median 20% maturity in FY2011 20 comparator companies Target 75th percentile 70% Stretch 90th percentile 100% 50% EBIT EBIT: audited profit for FY2010 Threshold 0% Stretch 100% 2009 50% RTSR TSR relative to a group of Threshold median 20% 20 comparator companies Target 75th percentile 70% Stretch 90th percentile 100% 50% Share Price Lonmin Plc share price on Threshold 20% London Stock Exchange Stretch 100% www.
com [ 90 ] Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2011 REMUNERATION POLICY continued Historic performance conditions continued Prior to 2009, to create a more direct linkage between profitability and the remuneration of the Companys executives and managers, EBIT, based on the audited financial results of the Company, was used as a performance condition.
During 2009 market conditions made forecasting EBIT three years forward exceptionally challenging, and the Committee perceived that there was a significant risk that forecasts might prove to be materially incorrect, potentially resulting in gross unfairness either to the plan participants or shareholders.
After considering a range of possible performance conditions, the Committee decided to use an absolute share price target in 2009, which was felt to be a fair metric in that it reflected the value of shareholders investments in Lonmin and appropriate to the Companys needs.
The Committee does not wish to disclose the EBIT or share price targets in advance for commercial and regulatory reasons, but has committed to do so in full after the relevant performance periods end see page 94 for vesting events in FY2011.
Comparator groups of companies for RTSR The Committee regularly reviews the comparator group used for assessing RTSR to ensure that it remains relevant to the Companys stated strategy and therefore aligns executives appropriately with shareholders.
For awards made to 2009, the Committee used a group of twenty metals and mining companies to provide a broadly-based global mining group with whom the Company was likely to be in competition for executive talent.
These companies are as follows: African Rainbow Minerals Exxaro Resources Rio Tinto Anglo American First Quantum Minerals Stillwater Mining Anglo Gold Ashanti Gold Corp Teck Cominco Anglo American Platinum Gold Fields Umicore Antofagasta Impala Platinum Vale Aquarius Platinum Johnson Matthey Xstrata BHP Billiton Norilsk Nickel In measuring RTSR, Lonmins relative position in the group is calculated, and reward only accrues if Lonmin is placed at median or higher.
The proportion of the award vesting results from where Lonmin ranks relative to other companies, with full vesting only occurring if we rank first or second.
For awards made from August 2010 onwards, comparison is to a smaller more relevant group of the five other primary PGM producers, with whose businesses Lonmin is directly comparable, four of whom also operate principally in South Africa: Anglo American Platinum Impala Platinum Stillwater Mining Aquarius Platinum Northam Platinum Using a ranking approach with only five peers would be extremely sensitive to individual companies results and could give rise to perverse outcomes.
We therefore determine Lonmins TSR relative to the median of the Group and express this as an annual underor out-performance percentage.
Share schemes limitations No executive share options have been granted since 2003.
Save for the historic Sharesave Scheme, no options have been granted at a discount.
No options or awards of any kind have been granted to Non-executive Directors.
Dilution The rules of the Companys employee share plans limit the total commitment to issue new shares across all plans to 10% of the issued share capital.
As the Company does not operate all-employee schemes due to exchange controls and for other local South African reasons, shareholders have agreed on a number of occasions that the whole of this 10% can be used for discretionary share plans.
In practice, the total commitment is well within the 5% inner limit that would otherwise apply.
Historic Executive Share Options Schemes ESOS options are satisfied with new-issued shares.
Awards under the LTIP and historic DABP Matched Awards are satisfied either with shares purchased in the market by the Companys employee benefit trust or the issue of new shares.
Awards under the S&P are currently settled in new issue shares, but could be settled in cash at the Committees discretion.
The table below shows the Companys current commitment to issue new shares in respect of its long term incentive schemes assuming 1 all performance conditions are met, 2 all award holders remain in employment to the vesting date and 3 all awards are settled in new issue shares, in line with the Committees current policy: % of Vested Other % of issued share Granted shares issued Lapsed equity issued issued share At 30.09.10 capital m m m m At 30.09.11 capital Undiluted issued share capital 202.3 0.4 202.7 Shares under awards 3.4 1.68 1.7 0.4 0.7 4.0 1.97 Fully diluted issued share capital 205.7 206.7 Limit: 10% in 10 years 20.2 20.3 Remaining headroom 16.8 16.3 Directors Report Business Review Directors Report Governance Financial Statements Operating Statistics Shareholder Information 2011 Annual Report and Accounts Lonmin Plc [ 91 ] Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2011 REMUNERATION POLICY continued Non-Group directorships It is both the Companys policy and generally a requirement of the individuals contract of employment that the Executive Directors may only take up non-executive directorships or similar appointments with the approval of the Board.
The Board would not normally agree to an Executive Director taking on more than one non-executive directorship of a FTSE 100 company or the chairmanship of such a company.
No Executive Director currently holds any non-executive directorship or other appointment outside the Group.
Whilst it would be considered on a case-by-case basis, any individual holding such a role would generally be permitted to retain any fees or other payments relating to that appointment.
Notice periods, service contracts and other contractual arrangements The Company complies fully with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code regarding service contracts.
Executive Directors contracts of employment require lengthy notice of termination from the employee, creating advantage for the Company by having early warning of the need to appoint a successor.
As policy, the Company has committed to give 364 days notice of termination to the executives, but may opt to pay in lieu of any unworked period of notice.
These payments would comprise only base salary and contractual benefits.
The Committee is responsible for deciding any payment to be made when an Executive Directors employment ends and has regard to the provisions of the Code and other best practice in this area.
In doing so, the Committee must balance the need to avoid payment for failure with the Companys legal obligations under the contract.
The ability of the Company to impose restrictions on the departing executive, including the non-solicitation of key staff, is important and relevant provisions are included in their contracts.
The Committee would therefore address the position of any departing executive on the individual terms of the case.
Policy stability The Committee does not anticipate any material changes to the structure of executives remuneration packages in FY2012.
As a result, aside from inflation-linked salary or TCTC increases, the Executive Directors potential earnings have not changed since FY2008.
REMUNERATION IN FY2011 Directors remuneration The total cash remuneration paid to all Directors in FY2011 was 4,278,470 2010: 4,039,441.
Non-executive Directors Non-executive fees were reviewed in July 2011 in the light of an independent market review, and no increases were felt to be warranted.
Key: C Chairman, S Senior Independent Director, M Member Note: Fees in FY2010 for Len Konar relate to the period 11 March to 30 September 2010 and for Cyril Ramaphosa to the period 13 July to 30 September 2010.

Pay elsewhere in the Group increased at that date by between 6% management payroll and 8% unionised manual workers.

1 As is usual in South Africa, TCTC includes the cash value of certain benefits which would have been itemised separately for a UK employee.
To ensure that shortor long term incentives do not reflect these items, Simon Scott has a notional salary equal to 80% of his TCTC used for these purposes.
2 Benefits in kind for the UK remunerated Executive Directors comprise cars, fuel, healthcare and medicals.
The costs of life assurance and income protection insurance are not reflected as the Company is the named beneficiary of these policies.
Ian Farmers total benefits include costs of 121,743 relating to his secondment to South Africa comprising housing allowance, home leave family visits and local private medical insurance.
3 Ian Farmer and Alan Ferguson each opted for their pension entitlements to be paid in cash.
The figure disclosed for Ian Farmer is in relation to this cash payment and the pension supplement explained below.
4 As noted on page 86, the Executive Directors bonus opportunity has been halved from that in FY2010 but the Company will make an ASAP award of equal gross value.
5 Other for Ian Farmer is dividend equivalents paid in cash on the vesting of share awards.
For Alan Ferguson, the amount is the total of dividend equivalents paid on vesting of share awards 8,799 and payments made on redundancy 1,260,190 which is discussed further below.
In addition to the amounts in the table, the Executive Directors received long term share incentives as detailed elsewhere in this report.
The Directors total emoluments for the year do not include any fair value share option award charges.
6 FY2011 data for Alan Ferguson relates to the three-month period 1 October to 31 December 2010.
7 FY2010 data for Simon Scott relates to the four days from 27 to 30 September 2010.
8 Although the Groups reporting currency is US Dollars, these figures are stated in Sterling.
Ian Farmer and Alan Ferguson are paid in Sterling whilst Simon Scott is paid in Rands.
The conversion uses the average ZAR:GBP rate for FY2011 of R11.1498.
9 No Director received any expense allowances during the year.
Termination payment As anticipated in this report in 2009 and 2010, Alan Fergusons employment ended through redundancy on 31 December 2010, when the role of the CFO was relocated to Johannesburg.
The payments made to him are reported in the table above, but in summary were one years pay in lieu of notice being the Companys contractual obligation to meet his salary and contractual benefits, a one off non-pensionable cash payment of 125% of base salary based on his personal performance through the period of transition from London to Johannesburg, payment for accrued but untaken holiday, contractual consideration for restrictive covenants and Statutory Redundancy Pay.
The Committee did not apply mitigation in view of his exceptional performance and the circumstances of the termination of his employment.
Since the redundancy of his role in the UK required that a successor in South Africa be identified, appointed and settled into the role, notice had not been served on him in advance of the date on which the UK-based post became redundant.
Purview Group In addition to the Executive Directors, the remuneration of fifteen other senior executives, the vast majority of whom are employed in South Africa, fall within the purview of the Committee.
The base salaries UK employees or TCTC SA employees for those employed at the end of FY2011 fell within the following bands: Salary bands Number of executives FY2011 FY2010 100,000 to 150,000 3 150,000 to 200,000 7 7 200,000 to 250,000 6 4 250,000 to 300,000 2 3 300,000 to 400,000 1 Exchange rate used 1 R11.1498 Purview Group executives participate in the same short and long term incentive arrangements as the Executive Directors, although with lower grant levels.
Half of their LTIP awards are subject to the same performance conditions but with the vesting of the other half dependent solely on continued employment, in recognition of local practice and the severe competition for executive talent in South Africa.
Directors Report Business Review Directors Report Governance Financial Statements Operating Statistics Shareholder Information 2011 Annual Report and Accounts Lonmin Plc [ 93 ] Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2011 REMUNERATION IN FY2011 continued Pensions Former defined benefit pension scheme arrangements The Company closed its defined benefit pension scheme in June 2007, and has subsequently wound this up on an orderly basis.
All UK employees who were active members when the scheme was withdrawn have been provided with a salary supplement for five years from that date in partial compensation for the loss of the link to future salary growth for their accrued benefits.
Ian Farmer benefits from this provision and currently receives a non-pensionable and non-bonusable salary supplement of 33,900 per annum.
The Company also increased the levels of insurances provided for this group, to reflect the loss of the spouses and ill-health early retirement pensions provided by the scheme.
Current pension arrangements UK based executives are provided with a pension supplement, which may be taken as a pension contribution to a defined contribution plan or in cash.
The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme for the benefit of its UK employees.
No Executive Directors are members of this scheme, and Ian Farmer and Alan Ferguson received payments equal to 30% of salary, which they elected to take as cash.
In South Africa the Company and Group participate in an industry wide defined contribution pension plan.
The Company withholds 8.8% from Simon Scotts TCTC, which is remitted as a Company contribution to this plan.
No element of any Directors remuneration other than base salary is pensionable.
Except as disclosed above, the Company has given no undertakings to arrange or bear the cost of any other pension benefits for any Director.
No former Director enjoys pension benefits in excess of those that would have been provided, in accordance with the historic provisions of the trust deeds and rules, to all members of the relevant former scheme.
Life assurance As a former member of the UK defined benefit pension scheme, Ian Farmer is provided with life assurance benefits of eight times salary, for the reasons noted above, as a contractual benefit.
Alan Fergusons and Simon Scotts contracts of employment provide for life assurance benefits of four times annual salary.
All of these benefits are fully insured.
Annual bonus FY2011 required a continuing focus on the Companys cost base, while delivering increased production targets and minimising the risks to the Company safety, development, transformation objectives.
The BSC was therefore designed to ensure the Company focused on delivering these strategic objectives, which largely reflect the corporate Key Performance Indicators shown on pages 10 and 11.

The scorecard incentivises production rather than sales to eliminate the impacts that would otherwise result from unsold stocks at year ends.
All corporate results were agreed to supporting data by KPMG and the Committee has subjected the scorecard to a detailed assessment before authorising payment.
The Committee considered whether the formulaic result was appropriate, decided it was and made no discretionary changes.
com [ 94 ] Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2011 REMUNERATION IN FY2011 continued Bonus payments to the Executive Directors The bonus payments to be paid to the Executive Directors equate to 58.5% of the target level of bonus and, as explained on page 86, 48.8% of their annual salary.
As noted on that page, ASAP awards will be made at the time that the bonus is paid with a face value equal to the gross value of the FY2011 bonus payment.
Long term Incentives LTIP Awards On 3 August 2011, LTIP awards were made to Ian Farmer, Simon Scott and a number of senior executives.
The closing midmarket share price on that date was 1235p but the strike price, being the average for the final twenty working days of June 2011 in line with the Companys protocols, was 1456p.
Ian Farmers award 58,223 shares was equivalent to 150% of base salary and Simon Scotts award 22,481 shares equal to 100% of his notional base salary.
Vesting of these awards is subject to the achievement of the performance conditions detailed on page 89.
Details of the awards are included in the table of Directors share interests on page 96.
Maturities A number of awards reached maturity on the third anniversary of their dates of grant during the year.
The details of the performance targets were not published at the time the awards were granted, and the Company committed to full retrospective disclosure: DABP On 5 December 2010 the 2007 DABP matched awards matured.
The performance condition is explained in detail on page 99, and was: RTSR element 50% of performance award Lonmin finished below threshold and therefore this portion of the award did not vest EBIT element 50% of performance award this required that underlying audited EBIT for FY2010 be between $1,000 million at threshold, for which 20% would vest, $1,270 million at target 60% vesting and $1,430 million stretch, at which 100% would vest with straight-line interpolation between these points.
Lonmin finished below threshold and therefore this portion of the award did not vest Retention element for managers other than the Executive Directors 100% of retention award as this required only continued service, this portion of the outstanding awards vested in full LTIP Small tranches of awards matured on 1 February 2011 and 8 May 2011 in which no Executive Director participated, which had a common performance condition: RTSR element 50% of award Lonmin finished below threshold and therefore this portion of the award did not vest EBIT element 50% of award this required that underlying audited EBIT for FY2009 be between $925 million at threshold, for which 20% would vest, $1,175 million at target 60% vesting and $1,325 million stretch, at which 100% would vest with straight-line interpolation between these points.
Brokers EBIT forecasts for FY2009 when these performance targets were set ranged from $614 million to $1,440 million with a consensus of $1,172 million.
Lonmin finished below threshold and therefore this portion of the award did not vest A further tranche of LTIPs matured on 29 July 2011 with a different condition: RTSR element 50% of award Lonmin finished below threshold and therefore this portion of the award did not vest EBIT element 50% of award this required that underlying audited EBIT for FY2010 be between $1,000 million at threshold, beyond which some portion of the reward would vest and $1,595 million stretch, at which 100% would vest with straight-line interpolation between these points.
Brokers EBIT forecasts for FY2010 when the performance targets were set ranged from $722 million to $2,225 million with a consensus of $1,433 million.
Lonmin finished below threshold and therefore this portion of the award did not vest S&P A small tranche of awards matured on 1 February 2011 which had the same EBIT performance condition as the LTIP award maturing on the same date, and this therefore did not vest.
A tranche of awards maturing on 28 March 2011 were subject to a performance condition comprising a matrix of production and unit costs, but the minimum level of production required was 1 million Platinum ounces in concentrate, and as a result these awards lapsed.
Finally, a tranche of S&P awards matured on 29 July 2011, using the same EBIT performance conditions as the relevant LTIP award.
The retention components for managers other than the Executive Directors of all of these awards 50% of total vested in full.

2 The cash bonus amount is the pre-tax amount payable in respect of the year.
3 As noted on page 86, ASAP awards have the same economic effect as bonus deferral but address cost and tax inefficiencies.
4 The value of the LTIP awarded in the year is stated at fair value assuming the BSC multiplier is at the target level and using a valuation consistent with IFRS for the RTSR multiplier.
However, as noted on page 89 if the threshold conditions are not achieved, no payment will be made.

1 The value is calculated using the closing middle market quotation for Lonmin shares at 30 September 2011 1051p.
2 The closing middle market quotation for the Companys ordinary shares, as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List, was 1051p on 30 September 2011, and the price ranged between 1051p and 1983p during the financial year.
3 When awards vest, shares are transferred to the participant.
To maintain a close alignment with shareholders interests, cash equal to the dividends that would have accrued on these shares during the performance period is also paid.
During FY2011, in addition to the shares vesting above Mr Farmer received 20,525 and Mr Ferguson received 8,799 in line with this policy.

The graphs below show the value, at 30 September 2011, of 100 invested in Lonmins shares five years previously, compared with the current value in Sterling terms of the same amount invested at the same date in the FTSE 100 index and the median of the PGM peer group detailed on page 90, assuming dividends were reinvested in each case.
The Company is a constituent member of the FTSE 100 and the PGM peer group is used to assess the delivery of value to shareholders relative to directly comparable companies in the LTIP.
The Board believes that these comparisons most fairly illustrate the Companys performance.
com % [ 98 ] Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2011 REMUNERATION IN FY2011 continued Directors shareholdings As noted on page 87, Executive Directors and other executives are subject to a shareholding obligation.
The Board continues to recommend that Non-executive Directors also hold Lonmin shares, with a target value of 100% of their base fees.
In this way, shareholder value becomes a paramount principle underlying all Board decisions, since real personal wealth is at stake.
The Directors in office during the year held or hold beneficial interests in the Companys shares as set out in the table below.
Using the closing share price on 30 September 2011 of 1051p, the levels of share ownership as a percentage of pay were: Market value of Target shareholding at shareholding 30 September At 30.09.11 At 30.09.10 as a % of 2011 as a or earlier date or later date base salary % of base of retirement of appointment base NED salary base Director Shares Shares fee NED fee Ian Farmer 79,712 65,323 300 148% Michael Hartnall 4,888 4,888 100 103% Len Konar 100 Jonathan Leslie 4,900 4,900 100 103% David Munro 7,700 7,700 100 162% Roger Phillimore 22,750 22,750 100 478% 1 Cyril Ramaphosa 100 Simon Scott 200 Mahomed Seedat 30,621 30,621 100 644% Karen fide Segundo 2,108 2,108 100 44% Jim Sutcliffe 4,536 4,536 100 95% Former Director Alan Ferguson 49,126 33,748 n a 1 Mr Ramaphosa is a major shareholder in and chairman of Shanduka Group, which controls Incwala.
This latter company has an 18% equity interest in Lonmins principal South African operating subsidiaries, which comprise all of the Groups operational activities and substantially the whole of the Groups assets.
As a result, Mr Ramaphosa has a very significant, but indirect, personal interest in Lonmins business.
There were no changes in the serving Directors interests from 30 September 2011 to the date of this report.
Directors service contracts and letters of appointment The three Executive Directors employed during the year had service contracts in near identical terms.
These provided that employment was terminable on 364 days prior written notice given by either the Company or the individual 182 days in the case of notice given by Alan Ferguson or Simon Scott except for gross misconduct or in certain other circumstances which may result in dismissal.
In the event that employment is terminated by the Company without notice but not for reasons of gross misconduct, the Directors are entitled to receive a payment equivalent to the value of the annual base salary and contractual benefits which would have been earned during the unworked notice period.
The contracts are dated 6 April 2006 Ian Farmer, 20 February 2007 Alan Ferguson and 7 July 2010 Simon Scott.
The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts, but have letters of appointment from the Company: Non-executive Directors Date of appointment Date of letter of appointment Letter of appointment expires Michael Hartnall 8 May 2003 12 January 2007 Letters of appointment generally Len Konar 11 March 2010 17 March 2010 provide for a fixed term to the first Jonathan Leslie 4 June 2009 4 June 2009 AGM following appointment, and David Munro 10 August 2007 19 August 2007 then subject to re-election by Roger Phillimore 11 September 1997 23 January 2007 shareholders a term running until Cyril Ramaphosa 13 July 2010 18 October 2010 the AGM three years from that date, Mahomed Seedat 1 January 2011 27 January 2011 subject to the Companys Articles Karen fide Segundo 29 April 2005 22 April 2005 of Association Jim Sutcliffe 10 August 2007 11 August 2007 No compensation is payable to Non-executive Directors for loss of office.

Jim Sutcliffe Chairman, Remuneration Committee Directors Report Business Review Directors Report Governance Financial Statements Operating Statistics Shareholder Information 2011 Annual Report and Accounts Lonmin Plc [ 99 ] Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2011 APPENDIX Older long term incentive arrangements Deferred Annual Bonus Plan DABP From 2004, Executive Directors were offered the opportunity to participate in the DABP, under which a minimum of one-third of the after tax bonus was invested in the DABP, with the option to invest any greater amount up to the whole of their net bonus.
These funds were used to make market purchases of Lonmin shares.
The executive received a Matched Award which, subject to the attainment of performance conditions, could enable up to 1:1 matching of the shares bought, on an after tax basis.
The performance conditions used historically are detailed below.
These measures were chosen because the Committee felt they best reflected both the key imperatives on management at the relevant time and also provided an equal focus on the delivery of value to shareholders over the longer term.

In return, a 2:1 Matched Award was made.
Half of the shares subject to the Matched Award vested at the end of the performance period, subject to the employee remaining with the Group and to the extent that the related Invested Shares had been retained.
Vesting of one quarter of the Matched Award shares was subject to an RTSR performance condition, and the final quarter subject to an EBIT target.
Executives were able to apply the remainder of their bonus to acquire Invested Shares without risk of forfeiture with a 1:1 match, subject to satisfaction of the same RTSR and EBIT performance conditions, equally weighted.
The outcomes of these performance conditions are detailed on page 94.
For bonuses paid in 2008, the Remuneration Committee determined that the DABP would be operated on the same basis that applied to voluntary deferral in 2007, save that the Committee determined that an absolute share price target would be substituted for the EBIT target, as explained on page 90.
In 2009 and 2010 the matching aspect of the Plan has not been used.
As noted on page 86, the DABP has now been superseded by the ASAP and the Company does not currently envisage granting any DABP Matched Awards in future.
Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS These legacy schemes expired in March 2007 and, although an option scheme is contained within the rules of the Shareholder Value Incentive Plan, the Committee has not made, and does not intend to make, any grants under that scheme.
Awards made since 1994 have been subject to performance conditions.
Details of these conditions for the Companys various tranches of executive share options that remain outstanding are as follows: Options granted in or after 1998 but before 2002: TSR must exceed the total return of the Mining Sector of the FTSE Actuaries Share Indices over any consecutive thirty six month period.
Options granted in or after 2002: TSR must exceed the total return of the Mining Sector of the FTSE Actuaries Share Indices in one of the periods of three, four, five or six years following the date of grant, in each case relative to a fixed base year.
The performance conditions attaching to the ESOS options have been fulfilled and all these options are exercisable.
Savings-Related Share Option Scheme Sharesave The Company historically offered Sharesave to all UK-remunerated employees, which potentially included Executive Directors.
Participants entered into savings contracts and in return were granted an option over the Companys shares, to be acquired using the value of their cash deposits at the end of the contractual savings period.
The option price could, at the Committees discretion, be at a discount of up to 20% to the prevailing mid-market price at the date of invitation.
With the exception of the 2005 options, the Company historically granted all such options with a 20% discount.
The Sharesave Scheme expired in March 2007 and the final tranche of options matured in February 2011. www.
