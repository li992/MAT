The Committee sets performance conditions each time an award is made under the long-term incentive plans.
EPS APBT growth and TSR are the two performance measures previously applied to the LTIP, the DISP and, should it be used, the Share Option Plan SOP.
EPS and APBT growth remain substantially within the control of management and therefore the Committee continues to consider it an appropriate measure of the underlying financial performance of the Company.
TSR measures the return on a notional investment in a company over a given period.
TSR is determined by regard to the index measuring the growth in a companys shares price over a period, with the index assuming any dividends paid are reinvested in that companys shares on a net basis on the ex-dividend date.
TSR can be a useful measure of a companys performance relative to other companies.
The vesting schedule above shows how each half of an award could vest at the end of the relevant three-year performance period under the EPS and the TSR performance conditions.
Partners Performance Multiplier Plan awards for the 2009, and those in 2010 and 2011, have a stretching EPS and APBT performance condition respectively.
