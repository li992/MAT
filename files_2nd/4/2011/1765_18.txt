This shows that achieving strong performance on the in-year measures is important but, to maximise the value of their incentive package, executives need to drive growth in long-term EPS and share price.

Financial performance: Against the backdrop of a difficult business environment and the Groups strong performance in recent years, 2011 was particularly challenging.
At the Group level, EPS was close to stretch performance, year-end cash was above target and the stretch target for average cash was achieved.
As referred to on page 14, the Groups order intake performance was below target.
At the operating group level, Programmes & Support missed its stretch profit target, achieved stretch performance on both cash targets, but missed the order intake target.
International achieved its stretch profit target, missed year-end cash targets, delivered on-target performance for average cash, but missed the order intake target.
BAE Systems, Inc. achieved stretch performance for both cash targets, achieved between threshold and 1 on-target levels for EBITA, but missed order intake targets.
For incentive purposes, the effect of the research and development tax credit on EPS performance was limited to reflect prior year impacts only.
Non-financial performance: Page 13 sets out the Executive Committees top ten objectives for 2011 and the assessment of performance against these, whilst pages 55 to 59 provide more detailed information on the performance against the specific objectives relating to business conduct and safety.
Business conduct: The Group targeted the successful implementation of the 23 recommendations of the Woolf Committee which was completed in May 2011.
Deloitte has assured BAE Systems statements on Progress against Recommendations on the Groups website.
Safety: The Group has continued to drive improvement of safety management, using its Safety Maturity Matrix SMM as the mechanism to measure and drive performance.
Within BAE Systems, Inc. and Programmes & Support all sites designated to achieve Level 5 highest level were confirmed as having achieved this.
Australia did not meet its plan to achieve Level 5 at its nominated sites.
The Group achieved an 11% reduction in Lost Work Day Case Rate which did not meet the target of 20% set by the Corporate Responsibility Committee.
Other objectives: Of the remaining top ten Group objectives for 2011, good progress has been made and the Committee agreed an overall assessment of 75% of maximum.
This sets the starting point with further adjustment, up or down, depending on the assessment of overall performance and leadership behavioural performance of the individual executive.
Accordingly, the Committee determined the payout under the 2011 annual incentive plan as follows: 2011 annual incentive payout Ian King Linda Hudson Peter Lynas % of target 137.2% 131.2% 139.0% % of base salary 154.4% 147.6% 104.3% Amount 1,443,383$1,490,621406,731 In addition: the growth in EPS over the three years to 2011 was approximately 7.57% pa. Consequently: the SMP award granted in 2009 earned a 0.85 match: and of the 50% of the awards of shares granted in March 2009 under the EPS portion of the PSP, 42.42% vest.
the Companys TSR for the 50% of awards of shares granted in March 2009 under the TSR portion of the PSP was below the median position when compared against the comparator group of 18 other defence and aerospace companies, and the related awards accordingly lapsed.

Performance conditions for grants of awards made prior to 2012 are detailed on pages 95 and 96.
Clawback arrangements have operated in respect of the Performance Share Plan and Share Matching Plan from the 2010 awards onwards, and will operate for grants under the Share Option Plan from its inception.
The arrangements are intended to cover situations, for example, where results are restated or otherwise turn out to be materially inaccurate or where the executives employment can be terminated for cause.
PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN PSP Key features for PSP awards in 2012: awards of shares are granted based on a percentage of salary and share price at the date of grant: the shares are subject to satisfaction of three-year performance conditions: TSR half the PSP award will be based on a Total Shareholder Return TSR performance condition PSP and the other half on an Earnings per EPS Share PSP performance condition.
For US participants, the first half of the award will be based on long-term operating cash performance measured at the level of the US businesses, reflecting an increased emphasis from shareholders on cash flow generation: TSR in addition, there is a further test on the PSP element to ensure that the TSR performance is supported by the underlying performance of the Company: shares under award after satisfaction of the performance condition vest at the end of year three.
Awards that vest are exercisable in three tranches between the third and seventh anniversary of vesting.
For US participants, the awards are automatically delivered at the end of years three, four and five, subject to the performance condition being achieved: and shares under award attract dividends prior to vesting.

For performance between median and upper quintile, the proportion of options exercisable will be calculated on a straight-line basis.
Rationale for performance measure: major investors regard TSR as an important indication of both earnings and capital growth relative to other major companies in the same sector.

RESTRICTED SHARE PLAN RSP Key features of awards in 2012: conditional awards of shares are granted based on a percentage of salary and share price at the date of grant: the shares are subject only to the condition that the participant remains employed by the Group at the end of the vesting date three years after the award date : and shares under award attract dividends prior to vesting.
The RSP is not subject to a performance condition as it is designed to address retention issues principally in the US.

RESTRICTED SHARE PLAN RSP The RSP is the time-vesting long-term incentive plan element applicable to senior executives in the US.
Approved by shareholders at the 2011 AGM, it does not have performance elements attached to it other than time-vesting conditions as it seeks to mirror US remuneration practices where performance-related LTIP awards only typically make up around one-third of the overall long-term incentive package for a US executive.
