Business overview Business review Risk and responsibility Governance Financials statements Shareholder information GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT Since I took over the Chairmanship of the Remuneration Committee the Committee in May 2011, executive pay has been continuously in the spotlight.
There has been significant scrutiny from the media and soul-searching within companies on the issue.
External governance guidelines and principles have been revised to reflect changing conditions in the financial sector, where companies have been inundated by recommendations from remuneration advisers and criticism from the public and the media.
I am pleased to say that my predecessor left me in a solid position as regards the governance of remuneration within the Company.
Since early 2010, extensive work has been done to develop risk management processes that ensure rewards are appropriately aligned with both shortand long-term performance and do not encourage excessive In this section, we risk-taking in the Group.
All of our major business units now describe the Companys take account of risk-adjusted profit Economic Profit in the calculation of bonus pools.
Outcomes from these bonus remuneration practices pools are linked to balanced scorecards for all senior executives that have objectives which encourage improved during 2011 and its risk management.
This approach has been adopted in line with FSA guidelines and the evolving requirements of policies for 2012 and Solvency II.
future years with No significant change or restructuring has been made to particular emphasis on the remuneration or incentive structure for the executive directors in 2012.
However, the current long-term incentive the remuneration plan, the Old Mutual Strategic Incentive Plan OMSIP, was designed to incentivise a change in the strategic direction arrangements for the and restructuring of the Group over three to four years and executive directors.
the targets used for awards under the OMSIP were agreed for a two-year period 2010 and 2011 only.
Accordingly, Russell Edey revised targets for annual long-term incentive awards have Chairman of the Remuneration Committee been agreed, as described later in this report, to provide an appropriate level of reward for sustained financial performance within agreed risk parameters.

This was the third year in arow that no vesting had occurred on the long-term incentive plan Q In 2012, there will be full vesting of long-term incentives for executive directors and employees across the Group, based on the achievement of the three-year performance targetssetin2009 Q Neither short-term nor long-term incentive award levels were increased for executive directors for 2012.
These actions and results are in line with the Committees approach to ensure that executive pay does not become inflated or distorted and that it is directly linked to Group performance.

Conversely, when performance over the measurement period does merit incentive payouts, they are made.

0 31 Dec 31 Dec 31 Dec 2008 2009 2010 Source: Datastream Remuneration policies Remuneration policy for executive directors The Company embraces the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code relating to directors remuneration and complies with its provisions.
The following are the guiding principles that the Committee has applied during 2011 and intends to apply during 2012: Q To take account of appropriate benchmarks, while using such comparisons with caution and recognising the risk of an upward ratchet of remuneration levels with no corresponding improvement in performance.
Large UK insurers and members of the UK FTSE100 index, with particular reference to the subset by market capitalisation, provide the benchmarks for UK-based executive directors Q To be sensitive in determining, reviewing, monitoring and approving matters under its remit in relation to pay and employment conditions around the Group, where relevant Q To make a significant percentage of total maximum potential rewards in the form of share-based incentives in order to align the executive directors interests closely with those of shareholders Q To provide an opportunity for remuneration packages to be in the upper quartile of the comparator group through payments under short-term and long-term incentive schemes if superior performance is delivered Q To focus attention on the main drivers of shareholder value by linking performance-related remuneration to clearly defined objectives and measurable targets Q To design remuneration arrangements that will attract, retain and motivate individuals of the exceptional calibre needed to lead the Groups development.
The Committee has regard to risk-related metrics in reviewing the executive directors short-term performance and it received and considered a report from the Group Risk and Actuarial Director, which had been approved by the Board Risk Committee, in evaluating the short-term performance outcome for 2011.
It also has discretion to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance ESG issues, to the extent relevant, when setting their remuneration.
It ensures regulatory requirements relating to remuneration matters are met and that remuneration policies are consistent with, and promote, effective risk management.
The Committees policy is influenced by the need to be competitive with other international financial services groups, while avoiding any excess.
This includes its approach to setting the fixed elements of remuneration at or below appropriate median levels.
It reviews this policy regularly and continues to consider it to be appropriate.
Old Mutual plc 113 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Overview of executive directors remuneration The Committee reviews the structure of the executive directors remuneration packages annually to satisfy itself that the balance between fixed and variable remuneration and short-term and long-term incentives and rewards remains appropriate.
The overall make-up of the remuneration packages for the executive directors is as follows: Element Description Basic salary Reviewed each January, taking into account market benchmarks and the level of increases awarded to all Group employees.
Benets The policy is currently to pay an allowance of 35% of basic salary to cover any benets elected, with any balance paid in cash.
Life cover of 1,000,000 and disability cover capped at an annual basic salary of 140,000 are also provided.
Short-term incentive Payable subject to achievement of agreed financial targets and agreed scorecard objectives.
The policy is currently to make a maximum award of 150% of basic salary, 50% in cash and 50% deferred in Company restricted shares for three years, subject to claw-back.
Long-term incentive The policy is currently a maximum award of 250% of basic salary.
Vesting is subject to agreed performance targets as set out in the section of this report entitled Long-term incentives, subject to claw-back.
The following chart depicts the overall make-up of the executive directors respective remuneration packages for 2012, assuming on-target delivery on short-term incentives and an expected value for long-term incentives: 1 SPHU 9VILY[Z 7OPSPW YVHKSL` Q HZPJ ZHSHY` Q LULMP[Z Q HZO ::0 Q LMLYYLK ::0 Q 3:07 Executive directors remuneration in 2012 Basic salary and benets With effect from 1 January 2012, Julian Roberts basic salary was increased by 2.35%, from 850,000 to 870,000, and Philip Broadleys basic salary was increased by 2.65%, from 565,000 to 580,000.
This compares with similar increases for other employees across the Group, ranging from 3% for staff in the UK, Europe and the US to in excess of 5% in South Africa, in line with the local market.
Before making the decision on the increases for the executive directors, the Committee considered the salary increases for other employees in the Group as set out above, and had regard to those increases.
Benefits equivalent to 35% of basic salary will continue to be payable either as contributions to agreed benefits or monthly in cash, and life cover and disability cover will continue to be provided.
Pensions Julian Roberts and Philip Broadley will not be contributing to any employer-provided pension scheme of the Group during 2012.
The Company will not be making contributions to any such scheme on their behalf.
Short-term incentive The short-term incentive policy to be applied during the year is described above and there have been no changes to the policy from 2011 to 2012.
The respective weightings attached to the Group metrics and scorecard objectives, shown as a percentage of basic salary, for the executive directors short-term incentives for 2012 are as follows: Elements Julian Roberts Philip Broadley Group targets Maximum Maximum EPS 56.25% 37.50% RoE 56.25% 37.50% Group targets sub-total 112.50% 75.00% Scorecard objectives 37.50% 75.00% Total 150.00% 150.00% 114 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Business overview Business review Risk and responsibility Governance Financials statements Shareholder information In addition to Group targets, the executive directors, as with all senior executives, are measured annually against a balanced scorecard, that sets out objectives in four categories: i Financial: ii Strategy, Operations and Risk: iii Customer: and iv People and Culture.
In his role as Group Finance Director, Philip Broadley is responsible to the Board for all financial matters, including management control over the Group internal audit, Group compliance and Group risk functions.
The scorecard elements of his short-term incentive therefore have a higher weighting than the Group Chief Executive and line management executives, as there is more emphasis on the financial risk, governance and capital management objectives that are crucial to success in his role.
Long-term incentives The Committee approved a change in structure of long-term incentive awards for executive directors in 2010, after extensive consultation with shareholders.
This included the use of a one-off award, which was specifically related to the strategic review and rationalisation of the Group, and regular annual share incentive awards, subject to agreed financial targets for awards granted in 2010 and 2011.
2012 Award Targets Accordingly, revised targets for annual long-term incentive awards have been agreed by the Committee from 2012 onwards, taking into account the market context of the Company and advice received, which emphasised the need for long-term metrics to be: Q Transparent, clear and simple for both shareholders and executives Q Stretching but attainable so that executives are appropriately rewarded for delivery and not paid for failure Q Aligned with shareholder interests.
Various approaches were considered and, given the current context and strategic intention of the Group, the following approach was agreed to be most appropriate: Q The primary target will be based on cumulative growth over three years in Adjusted Operating Profit AOP on a constant-currency basis.
This was chosen to incentivise significant growth in operating profit across the Groups principal business units.
An adjustment to this outcome will be made based on the relative total shareholder return TSR over the three-year period, calculated 50% against the FTSE100 index and 50% against the JSE ALSI.
This takes into account relative performance against other listed companies.
TSR will be averaged at the start Q4 2011 and end Q4 2014 of the three-year performance period.
Q In addition, discretionary downward adjustments to the formulaic outcome on the AOP metrics will be considered by the Committee where: there are any negative financial impacts or underperformance in the Group not adequately reflected in AOP, giving the Committee discretion to take broad performance into account: or there is under-performance in the management of Group risk or the agreed risk appetite levels are exceeded.
This enables the Committee to factor in the requirement of the FSA and ABI to take account of company risk as a factor in performance measurement.
The level at which the awards vest will be determined by reference to the total aggregate AOP in constant currency achieved over the three-year period, shown in the table below.
AOP Targets Aggregated over three years Threshold Maximum AOP bn 2.9 3.5 % Vesting 0% |Interpolated| 100% Multiplied by Relative TSR Performance Relative TSR vs index Multiplier Threshold 4% or more below index 0.85 Target equal to index 1.00 Maximum 4% or more above index 1.15 Relative TSR performance against the above ranges, with a multiplier being set on a straight-line basis between the points.
The maximum award for the executive directors, inclusive of the TSR multiplier above, remains at 250% of basic salary at the date of award.

Vesting of one-third of each award was subject to attainment of RoE and EPS targets at each tier as set out below, with pro-rata vesting between tiers, after tier one had been attained.
Targets were tested on a once-only basis after three years from the year prior to the grant.

One third of each award vests at each tier.
Old Mutual plc 117 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED 2010 and 2011 OMSIP awards The OMSIP was implemented for the executive directors and certain other senior members of management in 2010 under the Old Mutual plc Performance Share Plan Restricted Shares, to align long-term incentives to the strategy announced in March 2010.
The 2010 OMSIP award was made in two parts as follows: Q The first part was a one-time award based on rationalising objectives and debt reduction Q The second part was an annual award based on key financial objectives in relation to the restructuring of the Group.
The 2011 awards used the same financial targets as the annual awards granted in 2010.
Targets for 2010 and 2011 are set out below.
The awards made to the executive directors under the OMSIP in 2011 had a face value of 250% of basic salary.

Quality of execution including risk, reputation and other non-financial impacts 3.
Amount available to reduce debt from the proceeds of rationalisation.
At the end of the three-year measurement period, the Committee will assess the sum of the evaluations of the individual initiatives when determining total achievement of the rationalising objectives component, and may exercise its discretion to reduce the vesting level of the award when factoring in total achievement toward debt reduction and any new information arising which suggests a different performance assessment.
The Committee assesses achievement of the individual initiatives once each has been completed.
The sale of the US Life business was agreed to be a rationalising objective and during 2011 the sale was completed.
The Committee evaluated this achievement against the three measurement criteria listed above and determined that this initiative was 100% achieved.
The Committee will include this assessment, with assessments of any other initiatives that are completed during 2012, when it makes its final assessment of the total achievement of the rationalising objectives for vesting purposes early in 2013.

Threshold performance is aligned with Old Mutuals cost of equity and the maximum is aligned with performance in excess of the historic upper-quartile performance within the insurance sector.
The 2010 OMSIP award will vest based on performance over the period 2010 to 2012 and the Committee will report the outcome in 2013.
The 2011 OMSIP award will vest based on performance over the period 2011 to 2013 for AOP over the four-year period 2010 to 2013 and the Committee will report the outcome in 2014.

Employee share plans A summary of the employee share plans currently operated by the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries can be found on the Old Mutual plc website.
Change of control Under the rules of the Company share plans in which the executive directors are participants, in the event of a change of control of Old Mutual plc: Q Forfeitable shares awards and share options granted under the Old Mutual plc Share Reward Plan SRP would vest in full as awards granted under the SRP represent deferred short-term incentive awards that have already been earned Q Performance shares and share options granted under the Old Mutual plc Performance Share Plan PSP would vest: i to the extent that the performance criteria to which such awards or options are subject have been met: and ii on a pro-rata basis to reflect the reduction in the length of the original performance period, although the Committee does have discretion to disapply the length of service pro-rating for compassionate reasons Q Share options granted under the Old Mutual plc 2008 Sharesave Plan SAYE would become exercisable to the extent of the savings accumulated.
The Committee has reviewed the operation of the share incentive schemes, including how discretion is exercised and the grant levels currently applicable, and considers these to be appropriate to the Companys circumstances and prospects.
120 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Business overview Business review Risk and responsibility Governance Financials statements Shareholder information Employee Share Ownership Trusts The Group operates a number of Employee Share Ownership Trusts ESOTs through which it collateralises some of its obligations under its employee share plans.
At 31 December 2011, 200,472,120 shares in the Company were held in ESOTs as shown below, and 175,801,192 shares in the Company were held under award to be settled by these ESOTs.
Old Mutual plc shares Trust Country held in trust Capital Growth Investment Trust Zimbabwe 1,261,986 Mutual & Federal Broad-Based Trust South Africa 5,630 Mutual & Federal Management Incentive Trust South Africa 24,855,847 Mutual & Federal Senior Black Management Trust South Africa 4,952,721 Mutual & Federal Namibia Broad-Based Trust Namibia 12,709 Mutual & Federal Namibia Management Incentive Trust Namibia 211,520 Mutual & Federal Namibia Senior Black Management Trust Namibia 168,296 Old Mutual plc Employee Share Trust Guernsey 36,427,689 OMN Broad-Based Employee Share Trust Namibia 748,201 OMN Management Incentive Trust Namibia 2,086,497 OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Trust South Africa 17,358,840 OMSA Management Incentive Trust South Africa 78,944,918 OMSA Share Trust South Africa 33,437,266 Total 200,472,120 The strategy for all non-BEE-related ESOTs has historically been to ensure that sufficient shares were acquired to match at least 90% of the obligations of each share incentive grant.
However, as a result of the requirements of the Companys BEE transactions in South Africa and Namibia, it was necessary to place shares allotted as part of the transactions in the relevant BEE employee share trusts immediately, in order to cover the total annual share grant allocations likely to be made to black participants in terms of the BEE transactions up to 2014 and 2016 respectively.
The general practice of the ESOTs save for BEE-related trusts is not to vote the shares held at shareholder meetings, although beneficiaries of restricted share awards or forfeitable shares awards may in principle give directions for those shares to be voted.
However, with respect to the OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Trust, the OMSA Management Incentive Trust, the OMN Broad-Based Employee Share Trust, the OMN Management Incentive Trust, the Mutual & Federal Management Incentive Trust, the Mutual & Federal Senior Black Management Trust, the Mutual & Federal Broad-Based Trust, the Mutual & Federal Namibia Management Incentive Trust, the Mutual & Federal Namibia Senior Black Management Trust and the Mutual & Federal Namibia Broad-Based Trust, the Trustees may, because of BEE considerations, vote any unallocated shares held in these trusts as well as those shares held in respect of any unexercised share options.
The beneficiaries of any restricted shares allocated by these BEE employee share trusts are entitled to vote their relevant shares.
Share options excluding nil-cost options granted under the Companys Sharesave Plans, the SRP and the PSP are currently intended to be settled by the issue of new shares rather than using shares held in an ESOT and there are currently 49,577,295 shares held under option in this respect.
In respect of the vesting of share options on 8 April 2012, certain unapproved share options originally granted to UK employees in 2009 may be cash-settled on exercise, rather than settled with newly issued shares.
Dilution limits For the purposes of calculating dilution limits, any awards that are satisfied by transfer of pre-existing issued shares such as shares acquired by market purchase through ESOTs and any shares comprised in any share option that has lapsed are disregarded.
The Company has complied with these limits at all times.
At 31 December 2011, the Company had 1.68% of share capital available under the 5%-in-10-years limit applicable to discretionary share incentive schemes and 6.08% of share capital available under the 10%-in-10-years limit applicable to all share incentive schemes.

3 Awards are subject to a claw-back provision under which the Committee may reduce the number of shares under option or award if financial results or business performance for which the director is responsible is found to have been materially incorrect or misleading or if undue risk was taken, resulting in financial loss to theCompany.
4 As a result of the EPS and RoE based performance targets being met, the share options and forfeitable shares awards granted under the PSP on 8 April 2009 will vest on 8 April 2012.

9 On 4 April 2011, 93,104 shares were released to Mr Roberts in respect of the deferred short-term incentive restricted share award originally granted in April 2008.

122 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Business overview Business review Risk and responsibility Governance Financials statements Shareholder information Company share price performance The market price of the Companys shares was 135.50p at 30 December 2011 and ranged from a low of 98.05p to a high of 144.80p during 2011.
Executive directors shareholding requirements During the year, the Committee reviewed and amended the guidelines on shareholdings by the executive directors of the Company.
Under these, the Group Chief Executive is now expected to build up a holding of shares in the Company equal in value to at least 200% formerly 150% of his annual basic salary within five years of appointment and the equivalent figure for other executive directors is 150% formerly 100% of their annual basic salaries.
For the purposes of the calculations, share options and forfeitable shares awards are excluded.
The following table shows shares owned outright including holdings by connected persons : Personal Minimum shares held at number of 31 Dec 2011 Salary at Price at Percentage shares Personal as a 31 Dec 2011 30 Dec 2011 holding required shares held at percentage p required to be held 31 Dec 2011 of basic salary Julian Roberts 850,000 135.50 200% 1,254,613 1,128,633 180% Philip Broadley 565,000 135.50 150% 625,461 412,178 99% Calculated using the market price of Old Mutual plc shares on 30 December 2011, namely 135.50p, and the basic salaries of the executive directors at 31 December 2011.
Further information Terms of engagement executive directors The terms of engagement of the executive directors are considered by the Committee to provide a proper balance of responsibilities and security between the parties.
The following is a summary of the main provisions: Provision Service contract Julian Roberts 23 January 2009, as amended on 22 November 2011 Contract dates Philip Broadley 10 November 2008, as amended on 22 November 2011 Julian Roberts 12 months by either the Company or the director Notice Period Philip Broadley 12 months by the Company and 6 months by the director Tailored to reflect the Companys contractual obligations and the obligation Compensation for loss of ofce on the part of the employee to mitigate loss Compensation payable on early termination No contractual provision Terms of engagement Chairman and non-executive directors Patrick OSullivan entered into an engagement letter with the Company in August 2009 as amended in December 2011 setting out the terms applicable to his role as Chairman from January 2010.
Under these terms, subject to: a 12 months notice at any time given by either the Company or Patrick OSullivan, b his being duly re-elected at Annual General Meetings, and c the provisions of the Companys Articles of Association relating to the removal of directors, his appointment is for an initial term of three years, renewable thereafter for a further three years subject to the same provisos, followed by up to three additional one-year terms.
The other non-executive directors are engaged on terms that may be terminated by either side without notice.
However, it is envisaged that they will remain in place on a three-year cycle, in order to provide assurance to both the Company and the non-executive director concerned that the appointment is likely to continue.
The renewal of non-executive directors terms for successive three-year cycles is not automatic, with the continued suitability of each non-executive director being assessed by the Nomination Committee.
The Board has determined that, with effect from January 2012, non-executive directors engagements will be extended on an annual basis for a maximum of three years from the end of their second three-year cycle.
Old Mutual plc 123 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED The original dates of appointment and the dates when the current appointments of the non-executive directors are due to terminate are as follows: Date current Date of original Date of current Current term appointment appointment appointment as director terminates Mike Arnold 1 Sep 2009 1 Sep 2009 1st 1 Sep 2012 Eva Castillo 2 Feb 2011 2 Feb 2011 1st 2 Feb 2014 Russell Edey 24 Jun 2004 24 Jun 2010 3rd 24 Jun 2013 Alan Gillespie 3 Nov 2010 3 Nov 2010 1st 3 Nov 2013 Reuel Khoza 27 Jan 2006 27 Jan 2012 3rd 1st year 27 Jan 2013 Roger Marshall 5 Aug 2010 5 Aug 2010 1st 5 Aug 2013 Bongani Nqwababa 1 Apr 2007 1 Apr 2010 2nd 1 Apr 2013 Nku Nyembezi-Heita 9 March 2012 9 March 2012 1st 9 March 2015 Lars Otterbeck 14 Nov 2006 14 Nov 2009 2nd 14 Nov 2012 Shareholder approval of the Remuneration Report An advisory vote on the Remuneration Report will be put to shareholders at the AGM on 10 May 2012.
