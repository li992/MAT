overview business review governance financial statements Ferrexpo plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 57 Incentive plans A substantial proportion of Executive Directors remuneration is based on performance via the LTIP and the Short-Term Incentive Plan 'STIP', as described below.
LTIP aims to motivate participants to deliver appropriate longer-term returns to shareholders.
STIP aims to focus management efforts on delivery of annual business priorities, based on a scorecard of key performance indicators relating to both Company and individual performance.
The Board intends to continue to operate the LTIP and STIP for the Executive Directors and senior executives in 2012 while keeping under review their motivational effectiveness.
LTIP The LTIP framework was approved by shareholders at the 2008 AGM.
The LTIP provides for annual awards of performance shares and options up to an aggregate limit of 200% of salary in normal circumstances.
Total outstanding awards granted under the Plan from its inception in 2008 until the end of 2011 are equivalent to 0.16% of issued share capital.
Actual awards are made on the basis of a similar number of shares to participants at comparable levels in the organisation.
None of the awards granted to Executive Directors in 2011 exceeded 100% of salary.
These awards are in the form of performance shares which vest according to the extent to which Ferrexpos three-year TSR matches or outperforms that of a comparator index see below.
The Committee has chosen relative TSR as the primary long-term incentive measure as it considers this to be the most objective external measure of the Companys success.
The Committee reviewed the constituents of the comparator index and their weightings prior to the grant of 2011 LTIP awards and decided to increase the number of focused iron ore miners in the comparator group see table below from 4 to 10 companies, and retain the aggregate weighting of 40% on this component.

TSR is calculated on a common currency basis to ensure that comparisons with international comparators listed overseas are fair.
As described in the 2010 Remuneration Report, the TSR share-price averaging period was extended from three to six months for LTIP awards granted in 2011 and subsequent awards to help improve the comparison of the management long-term incentive in relation to potential short-term movements in Ferrexpos share price or the share price of comparator companies.
The Committee has discretion to review the comparator index if any of the constituent companies is affected by corporate events such as mergers and acquisitions.
The Committee also reviews the constituents and their weightings prior to the start of each LTIP cycle in order to ensure that they remain appropriate.
The index will be adjusted in 2012 to reflect the listing of Glencore International plc and any eventual merger of Glencore with Xstrata plc.

Executives will be encouraged to retain their vested LTIP shares on an after-tax basis until the applicable guideline level is achieved.
STIP The STIP applies to the members of the Executive Committee, excluding Mr Zhevago.
The STIP is a discretionary annual bonus scheme.
For 2011, the maximum STIP opportunity for members of the Executive Committee ranged up to 150% of salary.
Key performance indicators KPIs for 2011 were set at the start of the year for each member of the Executive Committee and were weighted to reflect the contribution of each executive to the achievement of that KPI.

overview business review governance financial statements Ferrexpo plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 59 Service agreements, notice periods and termination payments The Executive Directors are employed under contracts of employment with Ferrexpo AG, a Group company.
The principal terms of the Executive Directors service contracts which have no fixed term are as follows: Current basic fee Name Position Date of contract Notice period p. a.
Six months from the employee: 1 Kostyantin Zhevago CEO 1 November 2008 six months from the employer US$240,000 Six months from the employee: Chris Mawe CFO 7 January 2008 12 months from the employer CHF626,160 1 Kostyantin Zhevagos basic fee of US$240,000 is donated at his request to Ukrainian charities.
The Remuneration Committee sets notice periods for the Executive Directors at 12 months or less, which reduces the likelihood of having to pay excessive compensation in the event of poor performance.
The policy on termination payments is to pay no more than what may be stipulated in an individuals service agreement.
The Executive Directors service contracts contain a provision exercisable at the option of the employer to pay an amount on early termination of employment equal to the respective notice period.
If the Company elects to make a payment in lieu of notice, the Executive Director will also be entitled to receive all components of his remuneration, allowances and expenses for the extent of the notice period.
In so far as it relates to the STIP, this entitlement is unique to Chris Mawe among the Directors of the Company, and reflects the practice in the Company at the time when Chris Mawe was appointed.
It is the Committees policy to review contractual arrangements prior to new appointments in the light of developments in best practice.
The payment in lieu of notice clauses will be invoked when the speed and certainty afforded by such clauses are thought to be in the best interests of the shareholders.
Benefits in kind Under his service agreement, Kostyantin Zhevago is entitled to 25 working days paid holiday per year.
He is also entitled to furnished accommodation in Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe if necessary for the performance of his duties which cost US$100,000 in 2011, and up to US$5,000 per annum for professional tax advice.

The Chairman and Non-executive Directors do not participate in any of the Companys long-term incentive or short-term incentive schemes, nor do they accumulate any pension entitlement.
