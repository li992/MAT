by the Committee: businesses being well positioned in the economic slowdown and that last year the increase was circa 4.5% which was consistent with the aggregate average salary increases generally in the Group over the two-year period 2009 10 and 2010 11.
Pennon Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 45 Governance Directors remuneration report continued Remuneration policy In 2009 the Committee undertook a review of the Companys remuneration policy and with advice from Towers Watson Limited the Committee concluded that the current policy remained appropriate.
This policy which will be applied in 2011 12, and is also currently intended to be applied in each subsequent year, is to provide a remuneration package for Executive Directors which is adequate to attract, retain and motivate good quality executives and which is commensurate with the remuneration packages provided by companies of similar size and complexity.
The key guiding principles of this policy are to: design an overall package to be competitive and to take account of the markets in which the Groups businesses operate support the overarching business strategy for the Group adopt incentive arrangements designed to reward performance and align the interests of the Executive Directors with those of shareholders reinforce the incentive element of the package by maintaining base salaries for Executive Directors at the relevant market median have a remuneration package which is fair and consistent with other companies in the sector and which provides incentives for outperformance.
The policy in respect of Non-executive Directors fees is set out on page 51 in the Non-executive Directors remuneration section.
In setting executive remuneration the Committee not only takes account of employment market conditions, but seeks to ensure that there are coherent pay and benefit structures across the Group which are consistent with the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and Senior Management.
From summary reports on workforce remuneration and terms and conditions of employment by the Executive Directors with regard to their respective business areas, the Committee has regard to the general levels of responsibility, qualifications and experience required throughout the Group in setting salary and other benefits of the Executive Directors and Senior Management.
The Committee also ensures that the incentive structures do not raise environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
A number of individual performance objectives specifically relate to achieving non-financial targets as outlined on page 47.
The balance between maximum performance-related remuneration receivable and direct remuneration i. e. excluding pensions, car benefit and health cover is the same as last year with one-third direct and two-thirds performance-related.
This is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.
The Company also has a Shareholding Guideline which applies to Executive Directors and Senior Management.
It is structured to demonstrate their commitment to the future success of the Group.
Executive Directors are expected to build up their shareholding over a five-year period to a value which is at least equivalent to their basic annual salary.
Elements of remuneration Fixed Variable Performance-related Base Salary Short-term Annual: Long-term three years: Pension Final Salary Defined Benefit Annual Incentive Bonus Plan Maximum 100% Performance and Co-investment Plan PCP or cash alternative of basic salary with 50% paid in cash and 50% future performance over three years in shares deferred for three years Other car benefit and health cover Assessed against corporate financial total shareholder return performance criteria performance and individual personal 50% linked to water and waste comparator achievements relating to a range of group and 50% linked to relative FTSE 250 operational and compliance targets.
with an underpin relating to operational and economic performance 46 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Governance Financial statements The following is a detailed summary of the elements of remuneration set out above: i Basic salary and benefits these are set out on page 52 for each Executive Director and are not related to performance.
The Committee reviews salaries annually taking account of market data available from independent remuneration consultants.
A pay freeze was applied in 2009 10 and last year the general increase was circa 4.5%.
When reviewing base salaries the Committee takes account of the performance of the individual Executive Directors which the Committee assesses with the advice of Ken Harvey, Chairman of the Company.
Other benefits, not mentioned below, include four times salary life assurance cover: a fully expensed car or a cash alternative: and health cover.
ii Performance-related bonus annual performance related bonuses are awarded in accordance with the Groups Annual Incentive Bonus Plan the Bonus Plan and are based on the achievement by the Executive Directors of overall corporate and individual objectives set by the Committee.
The maximum bonus achievable under the Bonus Plan for Executive Directors for 2010 11 was 100% of basic salary.
To achieve the maximum percentage bonus allocated in respect of the corporate targets of earnings per share and profit before tax it is necessary for the Company to achieve a specified level of superior outperformance.
Half of any bonus awarded is in the form of Ordinary shares in the Company which must usually be held for a period of three years before release Deferred Bonus Shares.
During this period the Directors, in respect of the Deferred Bonus Shares, are entitled to receive any dividends declared by the Company.
No additional performance conditions applicable to the release of the Deferred Bonus Shares, apart from maintaining continuous service with the Company, are considered appropriate by the Committee in view of the stretching performance conditions applicable to achieve the initial award of the Deferred Bonus Shares.
The Committee, in setting the performance objectives for Executive Directors, takes account of corporate performance on environmental, social and governance ESG matters.
Objectives set embrace appropriate ESG parameters which are important to the success of the Group and which seek to ensure that the Group meets a number of its ESG targets as set out in the Group corporate responsibility report on pages 28 to 31 of the Business review.
The Committee in setting such objectives and in determining its remuneration policy overall ensures that the relevant incentives to Directors and Senior Management aligns their interests with shareholders and raise no ESG risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
As reported last year the Bonus Plan is now operated in conjunction with the Companys Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS on the basis that the aggregate pre-tax value of the awards made under both the Bonus Plan and the ESOS would be the same as they would have been if the Bonus Plan had been operated alone, as in earlier years.
This is achieved by providing for Deferred Bonus Shares awarded to be forfeited by the Directors up to the same value as that of any gain made in respect of options exercised by the Directors pursuant to the ESOS at the end of the three-year restricted period.
Only the HMRC approved part of the ESOS was operated in 2009 10 which enabled options over Ordinary shares in the Company to be granted to Directors to the value of 30,000 at the then prevailing price.
No further options will be granted to the Executive Directors pursuant to the Bonus Plan until the existing options either are exercised or lapse at the end of the three-year restricted period.
Details of the options are set out in the table in paragraph d on page 56.
Set out below is a summary of the performance targets determined by the Committee for each Executive Director for 2011 12.
These are similar to the targets applied for 2010 11.
Colin Drummond A bonus of up to 40% for outperformance of Group earnings per share against budget: up to 40% calculated by reference to outperformance of the profit before tax and net debt budgets of Viridor: and up to 20% for personal objectives relating to key business targets for Viridor.
David Dupont A bonus of up to 40% for outperformance of Group earnings per share against budget: up to 40% for outperformance against budget relating to net debt and net interest of the Group and profit before tax of South West Water and Viridor: and up to 20% for personal objectives relating to Group financing and other Group initiatives.
Chris Loughlin A bonus of up to 40% for outperformance of Group earnings per share against budget: up to 20% for personal objectives relating to implementing South West Waters new strategies and projects and meeting compliance targets: and up to 40% calculated by reference to the average bonus earned by the other Executive Directors of South West Water which relate to outperformance against the operating costs, profit before tax, capital expenditure and net debt budgets of the company: the position the company achieves in the Service Incentive Mechanism of water and sewerage companies established by Ofwat: the achievement of a range of service standards set for the company by Ofwat: and personal objectives relating to key initiatives, projects and compliance targets for South West Water.
Pennon Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 47 Governance Directors remuneration report continued The achievements of the Executive Directors against their individual performance objectives are assessed by the Committee following the financial year-end when the audited results of the Company and performance against the parameters set are known.
This enables the Committee to apply largely objective criteria in determining the level of bonus if any which should be awarded, with the advice of the Chairman of the Company, Ken Harvey.
iii Long-term incentive plan A Performance and Co-investment Plan PCP was operated by the Company during the year for Executive Directors and Senior Management.
The purpose of the PCP is to award shares to participants subject to the achievement of stretching performance conditions measured over three years.
Awards under the PCP, in the form of a conditional right over Ordinary shares in the Company, were made by the Committee in July 2010 and, for Executive Directors, the award was over shares worth 100% of basic salary.
In accordance with its discretion pursuant to the rules of the PCP, the Committee made the vesting of the awards also subject to the fulfilment of a co-investment condition whereby Executive Directors were required to invest and hold shares in the Company equal to 20% of the value of their award over the Restricted Period being a period of three years from the date of the award.
The percentage requirement for Senior Management was suitably scaled back.
The number of shares subject to each award in the event of vesting will be increased by such number of shares as could have been acquired by reinvesting the dividends which would otherwise have been received on those shares prior to vesting or exercise.
The PCP awards made in July 2010 will vest based on the Companys total shareholder return TSR performance over a three-year performance period against two different comparator groups as set out below.
This is the same performance criteria that was applied to the PCP awards made in July 2009 and July 2008.
TSR measures the value created for shareholders through increases in share price and the payment of dividends and was applied by the Committee because, based upon advice received from remuneration consultants, Deloitte LLP, it believes that this is an appropriate measure to align the interests of the Executive Directors with those of shareholders: up to 50% of an award will vest according to the Companys TSR performance measured against an index made up of the following six listed water and waste comparator companies: Northumbrian Water Group Sch Environnement Severn Trent Shanks Group Suez Environnement United Utilities These are the Companys key listed sector comparators.
Water Waste index Vesting Above the index 15% 50% Equal to the index 15% Straight-line vesting in between above positions Below the index 0% up to 50% of an award will vest according to the Companys ranked TSR performance against the constituents of the FTSE 250 index excluding investment trusts.
This is the FTSE index to which the Company belonged at the time of the award.
48 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Governance Financial statements FTSE 250 index Vesting At or above the 75th percentile 50% Above 50th percentile 15% Straight-line vesting in between the above positions At or below the 50th percentile 0% In addition to the above TSR conditions, before any award is capable of vesting, there is an Underpin condition whereby the Committee needs to be satisfied that the underlying operational and economic performance of the Company is at a satisfactory level.
This evaluation includes consideration of ESG factors and safety performance, as well as financial performance.
Whilst the Committee intends currently to apply similar performance conditions including the Underpin to any future PCP awards, they are reviewed on an annual basis to ensure that the conditions continue to be appropriate and suitably stretching for future awards.
For the first PCP awards made in August 2007 following shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting in July 2007 the same performance measures were used as set out above save that the sector comparator group included Biffa and Kelda Group instead of Sch and Suez.
As these companies subsequently fide-listed, the Committee in respect of the 2007 award at the end of the three-year Restricted Period in August 2010 had discretion to include them in the calculation of the index up to the date of fide-listing or other earlier date at its discretion and exclude them from that date onwards or adopt an alternative approach.
The Committees view was that there was no particular reason to exercise its discretion to make any change to the comparator group constituents and therefore the TSR performance was considered with the two fide-listed companies being excluded in their entirety.
The calculation of TSR performance over the three-year performance period being 1 April 2007 to 1 April 2010 for the PCP awards made in August 2007 was undertaken by Deloitte LLP for the Committee.
The table below summarises the calculation: Comparator group Portion of award Rank Percentile rank Final Vesting level 7.2% outperformance Waste Water Index 50% against index 31.9% FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts 50% 69th out of 194 64.8% 35.4% Total vesting 67.3% The Committee was satisfied that the Underpin condition referred to above had been met and therefore approved the vesting of 67.3% of the award as calculated by Deloitte together with shares equivalent to the value of dividends declared during the Restricted Period on such shares with the remaining 32.7% lapsing.
iv Other share schemes Executive Directors are entitled to participate in the Companys Sharesave Scheme and Share Incentive Plan.
Both are all-employee plans to which performance conditions do not apply.
v Service contracts In accordance with Company policy, all Executive Directors have service contracts subject to one years notice.
They are due to expire when Executive Directors reach their normal retirement age of 60 unless extended by agreement between the Director and the Company.
No provision is made for termination payments under the service contracts.
In the event of termination by the Company of any Executive Directors service contract, the Board would determine what payments if any should be made to the Director depending on the circumstances of the termination.
The dates of the contracts are: Colin Drummond 5 March 1992 David Dupont 2 January 2003 Chris Loughlin 16 May 2006 Colin Drummond reached his normal retirement date on 22 February 2011 but has continued in employment with the Company in the same position as Chief Executive, Viridor, and as a Director of the Pennon Group Board.
His service contract with the Company continues subject to one years notice.
Pennon Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 49 Governance Directors remuneration report continued vi Provision for pensions During the year Colin Drummond and David Dupont participated in the Pennon Group Pension Scheme and the Pennon Group Executive Pension Scheme.
These are funded defined benefit schemes which, dependent on length of service at normal retirement date, could amount to two-thirds of final pensionable pay, with the exception of service to 5 April 2006 where an Earnings Cap applied in these Schemes to these two Directors.
Both were provided with additional pension benefits under an unapproved funded Supplementary Pension Scheme of the Company in order to bring their pension benefits up to a level which would have been provided under the other schemes as if the Earnings Cap had not applied.
With effect from 6 April 2006 the Earnings Cap no longer applied to pension schemes as part of the simplification of taxation of pensions legislation.
The Committee accordingly decided to provide all of the Directors future service pension benefits above the Earnings Cap level from the Pennon Group Executive Pension Scheme.
The Supplementary Pension Scheme was therefore closed and the accrued benefits were paid out to its members in April 2006.
The pensionable pay for Executive Directors consists of the highest basic salary in any consecutive 12-month period of service within five years of retirement.
Bonuses are not included in pensionable pay.
Colin Drummond from 22 February 2011 and Chris Loughlin receive an annual payment payable by monthly instalments equivalent to 30% of each of their annual basic salaries in lieu of the provision of pension benefits.
In determining remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors, the Committee gives full consideration to their impact on the pension schemes funds and costs of providing individual pension arrangements or payments in lieu of pension provision.

50 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Governance Financial statements Non-executive Directors and the Chairman Non-executive Directors remuneration excluding that of the Chairman, Ken Harvey consisting of fees only as set out below, is determined by the Board of Directors, including the Chairman, but in the absence of the other Non-executive Directors.
It is usually reviewed each year to take account of market changes in Non-executive Directors fees.
In reviewing the fees, the Board takes into account market information on Non-executive Directors fees.
Following no increase in 2009 10 the fees were reviewed last year and increased by circa 4.5%.
The base Non-executive Director fee in the year was 37,500 per annum.
The Audit, Remuneration and Corporate Responsibility Committee chairs were paid fees of 10,000, 7,000 and 7,000 per annum respectively and Committee members received 4,000 each.
For this and subsequent years the policy expected to be applied in respect of Non-executive Director fees will be to set fees around the median level compared with the market, which the Board believes is appropriate to attract and retain suitably experienced Non-executive Directors.
The Chairmans remuneration is set by the Remuneration Committee.
Following no increase in 2009 10 the Chairmans fee was reviewed last year and increased by 4.5% by the Committee.
The policy of the Committee to be applied to the Chairmans fee for this and in subsequent years is the same as that for the Non-executive Directors as set out above.
In addition to a fee the Chairman receives a fully-expensed car benefit and health cover.
No other benefits or remuneration are received by the Chairman.
The Non-executive Directors excluding the Chairman have contracts for services setting out their terms and conditions of appointment which are subject to the Articles of Association of the Company and which may be extended by agreement between the Company and the Non-executive Directors.
No provision is made for any termination payment under these contracts.
The Chairman has a contract for services dated 1 April 2005 which is subject to 12 months notice to provide the Company with reasonable security with regard to his ongoing service.
No provision is made for any termination payments under this contract.
The contracts for services of the Chairman and the Non-executive Directors reflect corporate governance best practice and, together with the Executive Directors service contracts, are available for inspection at the Companys registered office during normal business hours.
The dates of the Non-executive Directors contracts are: Director Date of contract Expiry date of contract Martin Angle 28 November 2008 30 November 2011 Gerard Connell 30 September 2003 30 September 2012 Dinah Nichols 10 June 2003 11 June 2012 The above contracts do not contain any notice periods.
