The Committees full terms of reference were revised in November 2010 in the light of recent best practice and corporate governance developments.
They are available on the Companys website or from the Company on request and are summarised below: To make recommendations to, and determine on behalf of the Board, remuneration packages for the executive directors in accordance with current best practice: To give advice and make recommendations on the framework and broad policy for all aspects of the remuneration of senior management and on the overall policy for total compensation for all other employees: and To determine policy and advise on equity participation schemes, employee share trust matters, pensions and other benefits.
Consultants to the Committee The Committee has authority to appoint such advisers as it sees fit.
Hewitt New Bridge Street a brand of Aon Hewitt Limited, part of Aon Corporation Inc HNBS acts as adviser to the Committee and a representative usually attends Committee meetings.
HNBS advises the Committee on all remuneration issues including the vesting of long-term incentive arrangements.
During the year  provided information and advice on pension issues and share awards.
57 BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Directors and governance Remuneration report continued The Group continues to use HNBS to advise on other matters including remuneration matters in general.
The firm also assists with the total shareholder return TSR performance measurement and the implementation of employee share schemes and, through its Radford brand, provides the Group with advice on matters specific to the US employment market.
The Group also uses Mercer Ltd and  to advise on remuneration issues, particularly in relation to pension schemes.
Matters considered by the Committee A summary of the main matters considered at the Committee meetings since the date of the last Annual Report and actions taken is as follows: Benchmarking the remuneration of the Executive Directors with assistance from HNBS: Following this exercise, consideration of executive director remuneration and long-term incentive awards for 2011 12 including setting parameters for achievement of bonus and share incentive awards: Assessing Group performance against various criteria for annual bonuses and long-term incentive schemes in respect of the year to 31 March 2011: Approval of awards under the Companys long-term incentives and all-employee share plans: Proposed the inclusion of a clause in the various share plan agreements to permit the claw back of awards where appropriate, to be in place in advance of any future share awards to be made under the various plans: Reviewing the overall level of employee salary increases to be applied from 1 June 2011, reviewing the structure and setting the parameters and objectives for the 2011 12 bonus and share incentive awards for employees: Reviewing the impact of new pension legislation and considering any changes for directors and other employees affected: Approval of a share trading plan for the executive directors: Approval of the remuneration report: and Review of Committee and adviser effectiveness.
Remuneration policy The policy for remuneration for executive directors is to enable the Company to offer a package of rewards that: Is sufficiently competitive to enable the Company to attract and retain the management talent it needs to ensure BTG is successful: Supports the achievement of the Companys strategy by delivering the potential to receive significant rewards linked to the long-term performance of the Company: Provides executives with alignment with shareholders and helps to retain them by delivering a significant element of remuneration in shares: and Is flexible enough to cope with the Companys changing needs as it grows and the strategy evolves.
Performance-related remuneration is in the form of an annual bonus, part of which is awarded in shares, deferred for three years.
Share options and performance shares are awarded to directors and may also be awarded to Leadership Team members and certain other senior members of staff.
Performance-related remuneration forms a significant proportion of the total executive directors remuneration and is subject to demanding performance conditions.
The intention is that approximately 50% of executive directors remuneration should be fixed and 50% variable.
58 Directors and governance BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Directors and governance The balance of fixed and variable remuneration is illustrated below for the two executive directors.
The table is a theoretical model showing the on-target value of annual bonus and the fair value of PSP and ESOP awards assuming PSP awards have a fair value of 55% of salary and ESOP awards have a fair value of 20% of salary : Fixed Annual Long-term remuneration bonus incentives % total % total % total Louise Makin 49% 20% 31% Rolf Soderstrom 49% 20% 31% The Committee believes that the bonus opportunity, partly paid in deferred shares with forfeiture provisions, together with other elements of the long-term incentive plans, provides a balanced market-competitive package for the executive team.
However, the Committee keeps such targets under regular review in order to ensure they remain appropriate.
The Committee continues to believe that: The overall remuneration package must be market-competitive: Shortand long-term variable pay should be the most significant proportion of overall remuneration with a greater emphasis on long-term rather than short-term remuneration: Significant rewards should be available for delivering the Groups shortand long-term objectives and achieving sector-leading returns for shareholders: The structure of the remuneration package should continue to provide significant lock-in for the executive team: and Executive directors should be required to build significant shareholdings of 100% of base salary in the Company to increase alignment with shareholders.
Remuneration levels for the executive directors are reviewed annually with assistance from HNBS who provide data on levels of remuneration among two comparator groups as well as on level of salary increases in the wider economy.
The two comparator groups used comprise a general industry group of companies selected on the basis of market capitalisation and a sector group of companies within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors.
In line with the Association of British Insurers Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee will ensure that the incentive structure for executive directors and senior management will not raise environmental, social or governance ESG risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
More generally, the Committee will ensure that the overall remuneration policy does not encourage inappropriate operational risk-taking.
Components of the remuneration package Base salary: Base salary is reviewed annually taking account of the incumbents responsibilities, the performance of the individual and market data from independent sources.
As part of their consideration, the Committee reviews information from management on planned salary changes and bonus levels for the rest of the Group.
The Committee does not aim to target a precise statistical point when setting salaries for executive directors: rather it aims to position salaries at a broadly mid-market level having regard to the factors above.
For 2011 the Committee, having taken advice from HNBS, determined the following salary increases: As from Percentage As from 1 April 2010 increase 1 April 2011 % Louise Makin 436,452 5 458,275 Rolf Soderstrom 283,694 5 297,879 These increases are broadly in line with the level of increases awarded in the rest of the Group, which were generally in the range of 35%.
59 BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Directors and governance Remuneration report continued Benefits and pension: Benefits mainly comprise the provision of medical benefits and permanent health insurance.
Louise Makin is a member of the Group defined benefit pension plan which provides for a pension based on the level of pension contributions by the member and length of service see page 64 of this report and note 29 on pages 110 to 113 for further information.
She also has a separate defined contribution Executive Pension Plan to which the Company makes contributions.
Rolf Soderstrom is a member of the Protherics defined contribution pension plan.
Annual bonuses: The Company operates an annual bonus incentive scheme in which all members of staff, including executive directors participate.
The intention of this bonus is to link incentives more closely to Group performance over the short to medium term.
Bonuses are calculated based on personal and business performance.
For the year ended 31 March 2011 bonuses were subject to a maximum of 100% of base salary for executive directors and up to 75% for other staff.
Half of the bonus earned by the executive directors and a smaller percentage for certain senior staff is deferred under the Companys Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP into a conditional award over shares, to be held for three years.
Other than in good leaver circumstances these will normally be subject to forfeiture on a timepro-rated basis should they leave the Company during the deferral period.
Bonus targets were set at the start of the financial year for both Louise Makin and Rolf Soderstrom based on the achievement of certain objectives.
These included the achievement of targets for a trading profit measure up to 37.5% of potential bonus, cash generation 37.5% and growth 25% in the business.
For the first two categories the Committee defined threshold, target and stretch levels.
In judging performance against against the growth measure, the Committee takes account of progress in a number of areas of the business.
The level of bonus payable is dependent on the degree to which each target is exceeded.
The trading profit measure, used for both bonuses and long-term incentives, is a normalised measure relating to earnings before amortisation of intangibles, restructuring and acquisition costs, fair value adjustments on foreign exchange forward contracts, intercompany loans and movements in derivatives.
The target level of performance for operating cash and trading profit was the achievement of budget.
Threshold and stretch were 6.2m and 10.8m either side of budget for cash and 6.2m and 10.8m either side of budget for trading profit.
Payout between the various performance levels being calculated on a straight-line basis.
The on-target and maximum level of bonus payable are 50% and 100% of base salary, respectively.
The Committee agreed that it would be inappropriate to include the results of Biocompatibles in calculations to assess the achievement against bonus targets for the year.
The Company achieved operating cash outflow of 28.9m, after adjusting for acquisition and restructuring payments, and trading profit of 3.0m, both being between the target and stretch performance levels.
Trading profit is calculated as loss before tax 7.9m, amortisation of intangibles 8.2m, restructuring and acquisition costs 3.8m less the fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts, derivatives and intercompany loans 1.1m.
Following a review of performance against targets, the Committee determined that the following bonuses be payable for the period: Bonus payable in deferred Percentage Bonus payable shares under Total value bonus payable in cash the DSBP of bonus Director % Louise Makin 70 152,758 152,758 305,516 Rolf Soderstrom 70 99,293 99,293 198,586 60 Directors and governance BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Directors and governance The Committee has set business performance objectives for the executive directors for 2011 12 which focus on trading profit, operating cash and individual KPIs.
There are threshold, target and stretch levels of financial performance for trading profit and cash.
The Committee uses its judgement in assessing performance against individual KPIs.
No bonus is payable unless a profit threshold is achieved.
The maximum level of bonus payable is 100% of base salary.
Long-term incentive arrangements: Executive directors and senior managers, together with all other employees, are eligible to participate in the Companys share schemes as operated from time to time.
The Company currently operates the Performance Share Plan 2006 PSP and the Executive Share Option Plan 2009 ESOP.
The Committees current policy is that executive directors should receive annual awards under both plans as this: Places significant weight on longer-term performance given the strategy to transition the business from an R&D-focused biotech company to an earnings-driven specialist healthcare company: and Ensures that packages for the executive directors include a strong emphasis on the absolute growth in shareholder value by the use of share option grants.
Performance share plan Recipients of awards under the PSP are entitled to receive annual awards of shares with a face value of up to 100% of base salary.
The awards made in 2010 11 have performance conditions based on a combination of a trading profit target as described on page 60 and total shareholder return TSR measured over three financial years.
The Companys TSR is compared with that of a peer group comprising FTSE 250 companies excluding investment trusts, companies in the financial services sector banking, insurance, broking, fund management etc.
and companies in the consumer discretionary sector non-food retail, media, leisure, gambling with opening and closing TSR values averaged over three months prior to the start and end of the performance period.
Trading profit targets for the awards made during 2010 11 were based on cumulative targets measured over a three-year period with a range of performance levels between threshold and stretch.
Trading profit will be measured on a normalised basis over the three-year period in the range 24m to 60m.
The Committee intends to make awards for 2011 12 to both executive directors equal to 100% of salary.
The Committee intends to set performance conditions for the awards that will be a combination of the same TSR and trading profit measures as used in 2010 11.
Details of the conditions will be disclosed in next years report.
Executive share option plan The Company operates a share option plan under which grants of options may be made to executive directors and other employees at the invitation of the Committee.
Participants may be granted awards of options, the vesting of which will normally be dependent upon performance conditions measured over a period of not less than three years.
Awards will typically be limited to 100% of base salary, although, in exceptional circumstances, there will be an individual limit on each award of 150% of base salary.
Performance conditions for awards made in 2010 11 were the same as for the PSP awards described above.
The Committee has agreed to make awards for 2011 12 of 100% of base salary to Louise Makin and Rolf Soderstrom under the ESOP.
These will be subject to the same performance conditions as for the 2011 12 PSP awards.
61 BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Directors and governance Remuneration report continued Other plans The Company operates an HMRC-approved save-as-you-earn scheme, open to all eligible employees including executive directors who open an approved savings contract, to enable them to purchase shares in the Company.
The options are exercisable after three years at a price not less than 80% of the market value of the shares at the date of grant.
The Scheme provides an international section to allow for the participation of European and Australian employees.
The Company also provides a US Internal Revenue Service s423 Plan for its US employees and a restricted share scheme in order to award nil paid shares to employees below Board level.
External appointments The Board believes that it may be beneficial to the Company for executives to hold nonexecutive directorships outside the Group.
Any such appointments are subject to approval by the Board and the director may retain any fees payable.
Louise Makin received fees from her position at Premier Foods plc of 67,500 during the year to 31 March 2011 2010:61,375.
Rolf Soderstrom does not currently hold any outside directorships.
Service contracts The Companys policy on directors service contracts is that, in line with the best practice provisions of the Code, they should be terminable by the Company on a maximum of one years notice and contracts do not provide for pre-determined compensation in the event of termination or provision for enhanced payments in the event of a takeover of the Company.
The Company may terminate the contracts of the executive directors with immediate effect by making a payment in lieu of notice.
Any payments made would be determined by reference to normal contractual principles with mitigation being applied wherever relevant or appropriate.
The directors contracts do not provide for an automatic entitlement to bonus or share awards.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts, but have letters of appointment for an initial period of three years, which may be renewed by mutual agreement, normally for a further three-year term.
The terms of appointment provide for a notice period in the event of early termination of six months for the Chairman and three months for other non-executive directors, other than if they are not re-elected at an AGM.
Details of contracts and letters of appointment, for directors serving at the date of this report, are as set out below.
Date of Notice Date of expiry appointment period of current contract Executive Louise Makin 19 October 2004 12 months N A Rolf Soderstrom 4 December 2008 12 months N A Non-executive John Brown 1 January 2008 6 months 31 December 2013 Peter Chambr 26 September 2006 3 months 25 September 2012 Giles Kerr 1 October 2007 3 months 30 September 2013 Melanie Lee 29 November 2010 3 months 28 November 2013 Ian Much 1 August 2010 3 months 31 July 2013 James OShea 2 April 2009 3 months 1 April 2012 Non-executive directors fees The Chairman, in consultation with the executive directors, is responsible for proposing changes to the non-executive directors fees.
The Senior Independent Director, in consultation with the executive directors, is responsible for proposing changes to the Chairmans fees.
In each case this follows advice on appropriate fee levels supplied by HNBS.
In proposing such fees, account is also taken of the time commitments of BTGs nonexecutives.
The decision on fee changes is taken by the Board as a whole.
Individual 62 Directors and governance BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Directors and governance non-executive directors do not take part in discussions on their remuneration.
Non-executive directors do not receive benefits or pension contributions from the Group and do not participate in any Group incentive scheme.

Members are able to retire at any time from age 60 onwards and under current legislation, if members continue to work beyond age 60, they may continue to pay contributions and enhance their pension entitlement, subject to a maximum of 40 years pensionable service.
Pension payments post retirement are increased annually by inflation for pensionable service earned up to 5 April 2006 and inflation subject to a ceiling of 2.5% for pensionable service earned after that date.
Members may take early retirement, once they have achieved 55 years of age, although any pension paid will be subject to an actuarial reduction.

Share options and performance shares were granted for nil consideration.
The awards are subject to the performance conditions as set out on page 61.
Sharesave options were granted on the condition that participants agree to enter into a monthly savings contract.
The price used for calculating the number of shares awarded under the PSP and DSBP was based on average of the closing share prices over the five days immediately prior to the award date.
Share options are awarded using the closing mid-market price on the date prior to the date of grant.
Awards are normally satisfied using new issue shares.
BTGs share plans comply with recommended guidelines on dilution limits and the Company has always operated within these limits.
Assuming none of the extant options lapse and will be exercised and, having included all exercised options, the Company has utilised 3.0% of the 10% in ten years and 2.8% of the 5% in ten years in accordance with the Association of British Insurers ABI guidance on dilution limits.
The Committee, with advice from HNBS, is responsible for assessing whether the relevant performance conditions have been achieved.
