50 ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Governance Report on remuneration This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 the Act and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008, the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and the UK Corporate Governance Code.
As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Companys AGM at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on certain parts of the Directors remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the relevant regulations.
This report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information The Remuneration Committee The members of the Remuneration Committee the Committee are the Groups four Non-executive Directors, Neil England Chairman, Michael Hartley, Iain Paterson and Linda Jensen following her appointment on 7 July 2011.
Malcolm Wall served as Committee Chairman until 7 July 2011 and stepped down from the Board with effect from 31 August 2011.
He was succeeded in that role by Neil England.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for: Recommending to the Board the remuneration and terms and conditions of employment of the Chairman who absents himself from discussions regarding his own remuneration, Executive Directors and key members of senior management: Measuring subsequent performance as a prelude to determining the Executive Directors and key managers total remuneration on behalf of the whole Board: Determining the structure and quantum of short-term remuneration: and Granting awards under the ITE Groups Performance Share Plans and options under the various ITE Group Share Option Schemes outlined below.
During the year, the Committee consulted with New Bridge Street Consultants, for advice on executive remuneration and the operation of the various ITE Group share schemes.
Neither New Bridge Street Consultants, nor any other part of the New Bridge Street Consultants group, provides any other services to the Company.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available on the Companys corporate website.
Remuneration policy The Companys principal remuneration policy aim is to ensure that the compensation offered is appropriate to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and staff with the ability and experience to deliver the Companys strategy and grow the business, having regard to the prevailing economic conditions and competition for such people in the markets in which the Company operates.
In formulating its policies the Committee has regard to, and balances the following factors: a the remuneration packages offered to executives in companies competing in the same markets as the Company: b the remuneration practice in the markets in which the executive is principally based: c the need to align the interests of the executive with those of the shareholders: d the performance of the individual executive and of the Company as a whole: and e any amounts payable to executives in respect of services performed for the non-controlling interests of the Company.
The Committee Chairman liaises with the Groups independent remuneration adviser and others to ensure that pay and employment conditions in the Group as a whole are taken into account in determining salary levels, benefits, pension provision, bonus payments and long-term incentive opportunity when framing the executive remuneration policy.
In line with the Association of British Insurers Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee will ensure that the incentive structure for Executive Directors and senior management will not raise environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
More generally, the Committee will ensure that the overall remuneration policy does not encourage inappropriate operational risk-taking.
In addition, the Committee regularly reviews the executive remuneration policy to ensure that it takes due account of market practice, best practice and the specific circumstances of the Company.
The remuneration packages of the executives comprise base salary and benefits, a performance-related bonus and longer-term share-based incentive arrangements.
A significant proportion of Executive Directors remuneration is, therefore, performance related.

Policy criteria for various components Base salary Base salary levels are reviewed annually by the Committee taking into account each Executive Directors role, experience, performance and the markets in which they perform their duties.
The base salaries for Russell Taylor and Neil Jones, and the consultancy remuneration for Edward Strachan are regularly reviewed and are subject to benchmarking exercises against industry and sector comparators.
During the year under review, Russell Taylors base salary was increased to 400,000 pa from 1 February 2011 and Neil Jones base salary was increased to 235,000 pa from 1 October 2011.
These increases are broadly in line with the average annual increase awarded to UK based employees.
A further one year consultancy agreement was entered into with Kyzyl Tan Eurasian Advisors Limited Kyzyl Tan in respect of Edward Strachans services, resulting in a new base salary and consultancy fee payable to Kyzyl Tan from 1 April 2011 of 300,000 pa in aggregate.
The reduction in consultancy fee relates to a reduction in the scope of services provided by Kyzyl Tan.
Details of the Executive Directors base salaries for the year commencing 1 October 2011 are also set out under Directors service contracts on page 52 of this report.
Variable bonus Russell Taylor, Neil Jones and Edward Strachan together with a number of other members of senior management participate in performance-related annual bonus schemes Executive Bonus Plan, which recognise Company objectives to deliver growth of headline profit before tax.
For the financial year commencing 1 October 2011, Russell Taylors and Neil Jones maximum annual bonus potential provided under the Executive Bonus Plan will be 100% and 90% of base salary respectively.
The Remuneration Committee considers that the increase in Neil Jones maximum bonus opportunity to 90% of base salary is justified due to his good performance and growing experience in the role.
Edward Strachans annual bonus opportunity through the Companys consultancy agreement with Kyzyl Tan is on the same basis as the Executive Bonus Plan.
As indicated in the previous section, the Company entered into a one year contract with Kyzyl Tan on 1 April 2011.
For the financial year commencing 1 October 2011, Edward Strachans bonus is capped at 100% of the Kyzyl Tan consultancy fee and his remuneration as a Director for the remaining six month period of the contract to 31 March 2012.
The maximum bonus potential for Mr Taylor, Mr Strachan and Mr Jones is split between financial targets 80% and personal targets 20%.
The financial element of the bonus in 2011 was based upon the achievement of headline profit before tax.
The target was based on the annual budget approved by the Board, but adjusted to provide an appropriate degree of stretch and an incentive to outperform.
A range for headline profit before tax was set of 40 million to 46 million after excluding profits and costs attributable to the MVK acquisition, to be calculated on a straight-line basis from 0% of potential at 40 million to 100% of potential at 46 million.
The actual results calculated on this basis were for headline profits before tax of 48.6 million and the maximum potential bonus for the financial element was earned by the Executive Directors.
After taking account of their personal targets Russell Taylor, Edward Strachan and Neil Jones earned 94%, 97% and 97% of their respective potential bonus awards.
From 2011 payments under the Executive Bonus Plan will be subject to claw back in the event of a fraud or material misstatement of results being identified in relation to the year in which the bonus is earned.
Long-term incentives In recent years the Company has operated performance share plans and share option schemes as its share based arrangements.
52 ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Governance Report on remuneration continued Performance share plans The Company has operated the ITE Group plc Employees Performance Share Plan 2004 and the ITE Group plc Key Contractors Performance Share Plan 2004.
Awards can be made to executives and senior management over shares worth up to 100% of base salary each year, and under the latter scheme to key individuals who are not Group employees.
Awards were granted in January 2011 to Executive Directors up to 100% of salary subject to aggregate three year headline earnings per share targets.
Further information regarding these targets can be found on page 55.
The performance targets were chosen by the Committee to incentivise management to deliver sustained fully diluted headline earnings per share performance over the next three financial years.
In line with past practice, it is proposed that awards for the year commencing 1 October 2011 be made to Executive Directors in January 2012.
The targets calculated as above for these awards are for aggregated fully diluted headline earnings per share of 53p for a 30% award and 59p for a 100% award to be earned over the three financial years ending on 30 September 2014.
Between 30% and 100% vesting will be calculated on a straight-line basis.
The targets were calculated as follows: Adjusting the fully diluted headline earnings per share figure achieved in the financial year ended 30 September 2011 to remove the biennial effect Applying a compound increase of 7% to establish a threshold target for each of the three years Applying a compound increase of 13% to establish a full vesting target for each of the three years Aggregating the target figures for each year to produce the aggregated fully diluted headline earnings per share targets for threshold vesting 30% and for maximum vesting 100%.
Shareholding guidelines Executive Directors are required to retain shares of a value equal to 25% of the after-tax gain made on the vesting of awards under the Plans, until they have built up a shareholding of a value equivalent to at least 100% of annual base salary.
Further details of Directors interests in the ordinary shares of the Company are set out on page 43 of this report.
Share option plans The Company has operated the ITE Group plc 2009 Discretionary Share Option Scheme.
It is not intended that Executive Directors will participate in the 2009 Discretionary Share Option Scheme.
Pensions The Company offers a stakeholder pension to its employees but currently makes no Company contribution under this scheme.
Since his appointment as Chief Executive Officer in May 2008, the Company makes a contribution equal to 10% of Russell Taylors base salary to his personal pension scheme.
Directors service contracts Executive Directors Russell Taylor Chief Executive and Neil Jones Finance Director have UK contracts of employment which reflect market and best practice for senior management serving in the UK and have no fixed term.
Notice periods and base salary details for all Directors are outlined in the tables set out below.
Other than the contribution to Russell Taylors pension scheme described above, there are no contributions to pension schemes.
The standard terms provide for medical insurance and life insurance but provide for no other benefits in kind such as company cars.
In the event of early termination of an Executive Directors contract, it is the Committees policy that subject to the provisions of each contract the amount of compensation if any paid to the Executive Director will be determined by reference to the relevant circumstances that prevail at the time.
The Committees objective will be to avoid rewarding poor performance.
Furthermore, the Committee will take account of the Executive Directors duty to mitigate their loss.
Edward Strachans remuneration as a Director from 1 October 2011 is 37,000.
In addition, he is remunerated as a consultant through the Companys agreement with Kyzyl Tan.
This contract with Kyzyl Tan is due to expire on 31 March 2012.
The base consultancy fee under this agreement for the year commencing 1 October 2011 is 263,000.
Kyzyl Tan is entitled to a bonus based upon similar targets and criteria as the Executive Bonus Scheme, which is capped at 100% of Kyzyl Tans base consultancy fee and Edward Strachans remuneration as a Director pro rated for the six months to 31 March 2012.
Under the Kyzyl Tan contract, Edward Strachan is required to reside in the markets where his management responsibilities are based and Kyzyl Tan is entitled to an annual living away from home allowance of up to $60,000 for its employee.
A new contract for the period 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013 has recently been entered into with Kyzyl Tan in respect of Edward Strachans services for a base annual consultancy fee of 252,000 with an annual bonus potential of 75% of this fee.
The reduction in consultancy fees reflects a reduction in the scope of services to be provided from 1 April 2012.
Consistent with market practice, there are no service contracts or other employment arrangements with any of the Executive Directors with fixed terms or notice periods in excess of one year or terms which would expose the Company to compensation payments in excess of one years total remuneration.

56 ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Governance Report on remuneration continued 1 For the long-term PSP awards granted in June August 2009 that are exercisable from 31 December 2013 to 30 December 2019, there are two performance targets applying.
Half of the award is subject to a performance target based on the Groups absolute earnings per share during the 2012 13 financial year as follows: EPS for the 2012 2013 financial year Percentage of one half of award that vests Below 14p Nil 14p 25% Between 14p and 17p Between 25% and 100% calculated on a straight-line basis.
17p or more 100% The other half of the award is subject to a performance target comparing the Companys total shareholder return against the FTSE All-Share Media Sector between 1 June 2009 and 31 December 2013.
25% of this portion of the award vests if ITE is at the median, with full vesting for upper quartile performance.
Between median and upper quartile, an award vests on a straight-line basis between 25% and 100% based on rankings plus interpolation between intermediate rankings.
The cost of all share awards charged to the profit and loss account for the year ending 30 September 2011 was 1.7 million 2010: 1.4 million.
The ITE share incentive plans operate within a standard 10% in ten year dilution limit.
This provision takes account of all potentially dilutive awards made by the Company under any of its share incentive plans.
This is because as with other London Stock Exchange companies the Company does not operate any form of share incentive on an all employee basis and therefore does not have an internal dilution limit of 5% in ten years for discretionary schemes.
The Committee continues to be of the view that this approach, which has been previously agreed with shareholders, remains appropriate and that, therefore, it would be inappropriate to introduce a dilution limit that relates to awards under discretionary executive schemes only.
However, the Committee will keep the dilutive impact of the share incentive schemes under regular review to ensure that the interests of shareholders are taken into account.
The maximum number of additional ie in addition to the existing 13,565,121 in issue new share issues possible under the ten year dilution limits in the option trust deeds is 11,291,753.
Additionally the Employees Share Trust ESOT can hold up to 5% of the Companys issued share capital against share awards.
