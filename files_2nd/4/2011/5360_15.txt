These awards were made in April 2008 and vested in April 2011.
At 31 December 2010, the awards were a percentage share of a pool where the actual number of shares that would vest was indeterminable until the date of vesting and performance conditions were tested.
The numbers shown under the exercised column represent the actual number of shares that vested in respect of the individuals percentage share.
These awards were made after consultation with major shareholders and were approved by shareholders at the 2008 AGM.
The one-off nature of these awards was designed to incentivise management to deliver performance that would lead to a significant increase in the value of the Company.
Under the performance condition selected, the market value of the Company measured by share price growth plus dividends paid over a three year period had to increase by a minimum of 31 per cent before vesting would start.
In the event, the level of increase achieved was 51 per cent and 2.15 per cent of the net increase formed the basis of a pool which participants would share in.
The value of this pool was approximately 5 million, or just under three million shares.
One other senior executive shared in the pool.
These awards vested in full as a result of the excellent performance, as reflected in the share price which increased from 66.5 pence on the date of award to 158 pence on the date of vesting.
Holders of these awards did not receive any discretionary share incentive awards in 2009.
The two sets of awards for each individual shown in the table above are in respect of awards made in 2010 and 2011.
The former has a date of vesting in 2013 and the latter in 2014.
The EPS and TSR performance conditions attaching to 50 per cent each of the 2011 awards are the same as those for the awards that will be made in 2012, as shown in the charts on page 43.
The TSR performance condition applying to 50 per cent of the 2010 award is entirely the same in all respects as the 2011 and 2012 awards, but the EPS condition, applying to the remaining 50 per cent, is different.
Owing to the EPS result in 2009 EPS of 2.8 pence, which reflected challenging general economic conditions at the time, the EPS condition required EPS in the financial year ended 2013 of between 6.5 pence and 7.5 pence, for between 0 per cent and 100 per cent of this part of the award to vest.
These conditions were reported in last years Remuneration report which was approved by shareholders at the 2011 AGM.
