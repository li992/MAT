We have also taken full account of recent Company performance.
During the year we consulted with shareholders on the key proposals, and further details of our revised policy are set out in the report below.
In summary, the Committee have decided to make the following key changes: a Reduce the face value of performance share awardsgranted annually to 300% of salary for Executive Directors compared to past practice of400% of salary : Salary 31% b Adjust the vesting schedule for the total shareholder Pension 8% return TSR element of performance share awards Performance-related annual bonus 19% tobe more in line with market practice: Performance-related long-term incentives 42% Cable&Wireless Worldwide 2010 11 Annual Report 49 Base salary salary.
