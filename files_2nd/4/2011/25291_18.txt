FY12 is the second including Deferred Share transition year, therefore the awards made under this plan in Awards June 2011 are based upon the benchmark approved by the Remuneration Committee, based upon advice provided by PwC.
The Annual Award Pool, which will be up to 30% of cash profit, will be used as a limit on the aggregate variable compensation that can be awarded over a five year rolling period beginning with the FY12 financial year i. e. the awards made under the Omnibus and Balance Sheet Carry Plans in June 2012 will be calculated based upon 30% of Cash Profit for FY12.
The Committee continues to consider 30% to be an appropriate limit for ICG having reviewed market data provided by PwC.
Cash profit is defined as pre-incentive operating profit including net provisions adjusted for unrealised gains, unrealised paymentsin-kind and fair value movement on derivatives.
Annual Award Pool is 30% of cash profits for the most recently ended financial year, it will be measured over a five year rolling period starting in FY12 and is a cap on the aggregate value of variable compensation awarded.
The 30% may be exceeded in any year but must not be exceeded on an aggregate average basis over five years.
In exceptional circumstances, it may be appropriate for the Committee to allocate a greater percentage than the envisaged 30% in order to maintain the retention value of an individuals remuneration package.
Carried Interest on third party funds is not regarded as variable compensation costs of ICG, and therefore does not form part of the Annual Award Pool.
Intermediate Capital Group plc 74 Report of the Remuneration Committee continued 1 Remuneration policy for FY12 continued 2 Remuneration for FY11 explained At the end of each performance year the Committee will be asked The Omnibus Plan and Balance Sheet Carry Plan, as described to approve the final Annual Award Pool as well as the final awards on pages 74 and 75 were approved at the Annual General Meeting and payments for executive directors and other members of in July 2010. executive management within their remit.

The benchmark level of information in each years remuneration report in order to ensure remuneration was arrived at by PwC following an extensive review that the operation of the Annual Award Pool is transparent across comparable organisations and available market data.

Intermediate Capital Group plc Omnibus Plan The first awards under the Intermediate Capital Group plc Omnibus Plan the Omnibus Plan were made in the FY11 financial year.
The Omnibus Plan provides for three different award types to be made over Company shares: Deferred Share Awards, PLC Equity awards and FMC Equity awards.
Deferred Share Awards This Omnibus Plan provides a vehicle for any deferred element of the Annual Bonus.
Annual Bonus This scheme is designed to reward employees for increasing ICG profits, managing the cost base, employing sound risk and business management.
All employees are eligible to participate.
Bonuses will be determined on a discretionary basis at the end of the performance year.
There will be mandatory deferral into Company shares of 50% of any amount of an executive directors bonus that exceeds 100,000 40% for all other staff.
The deferred element will vest in equal amounts after one, two and three years.
Dividend Equivalents will accrue to participants during the vesting period.

The value of the Annual Award Pool for the FY11 awards would have been 57 million based upon 30% of FY11 cash profit.
The Remuneration Committee are awarding nearly 20% less than this amount in June 2011, as this is a transition year.
Intermediate Capital Group plc Intermediate Capital Group plc 76 Report of the Remuneration Committee continued 2 Remuneration for FY11 explained continued Executive directors pension arrangements Under their service agreements, each executive director is paid an additional gross annual amount to be paid into any one or more pension plans of his choice up to a maximum annual amount equal to 15% of basic annual salary.

Annual Report & Accounts 2011 77 Our business 01-07 Business review 08-41 Funds and portfolio 42-56 Governance Accounts 85-119 Carried Interest on third party funds There are a number of carried interest schemes operated by the Group.
Carried interest is a share of the profits of a successful fund that is paid to the Company as a manager of the fund and certain employees who are involved in the management of the fund.
These funds are managed by the Company for external investors, and no payments are made to carried interest holders until these investors have been returned their initial capital contribution and an internal rate of return IRR of 8% the Hurdle on the whole of the fund.
Once the returns exceed the Hurdle, a high proportion of these cash flows 80% are allocated to carried interest holders, until they have received 20% of all aggregate cash flows from the fund known as catch up.
Carried interest holders then receive 20% of any further returns.
The Company currently operates carried interest on the following funds: ICG Mezzanine Fund 1998: ICG Mezzanine Fund 2000: ICG Mezzanine Fund 2003: Intermediate Capital Asia Pacific Mezzanine Fund 2005: ICG European Fund 2006: Intermediate Capital Asia Pacific Fund 2008: ICG Minority Partners Fund 2008: and ICG Recovery Fund 2008.
Carried Interest on third party funds will continue unchanged and generally new allocations of interest will be made as new funds are raised.
Old Remuneration Schemes Medium Term Incentive Scheme payments in respect of FY11 As detailed last year, the MTIS does not form part of ICGs new compensation structure, and no further points have been awarded in respect of investments made after 31 March 2010.
Payments will continue to accrue to participants up until March 2012 when the scheme closes in respect of points awarded in previous years.
Payments under this scheme based upon a proportion of cash realisations from our portfolio, subject to the satisfaction of the performance condition.
The payment from the MTIS this year is the maximum of 20%, since the full performance target has been achieved.
Share options in FY11 There are a number of share option schemes currently in existence at the Company.
No new awards have been made under these schemes in the year but the awards made in previous years are still in existence until they either lapse or are exercised.
The schemes are: The ICG 2001 Approved Executive Share Option Scheme.
Options may only normally be exercised between three and 10 years after the date of grant if performance targets are met.
For awards made in the 2009 10 financial year to staff below the level of partner, no performance conditions applied.
The ICG 2001 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme, the provisions of which are substantially similar to those of the ICG 2001 Approved Executive Share Option Scheme.
The Key Executive Retention Share Plan KERSP.
This which was adopted on 23 May 2005, under which an amount up to 15% of the value of the MTIS pool could be distributed to key executives in the form of share options with an exercise price equal to nil, subject to achievement of a performance condition measured from the date of grant to the vesting date.
The Committee considers that performance conditions attaching to the options granted were appropriate.
No value is delivered to participants if performance is below threshold performance.
Intermediate Capital Group plc 78 Report of the Remuneration Committee continued 2 Remuneration for FY11 explained continued Shareholder dilution For all awards made during the 2010 11 financial year and subsequent financial years, ICG has and intends in the future to use market purchased shares to satisfy any equity settled incentive awards.
The Committee has set a dilution limit for FMC Equity Awards the FMC Equity Pool of 20% of the issued share capital of the FMC that may be made the subject of FMC Equity Awards.
Employee Benefit Trust The Company established the Intermediate Capital Group plc 2002 Employee Benefit Trust which may be used to hold shares and cash in conjunction with employee incentive schemes established by the Company from time to time.
Shareholding requirements In addition to the alignment between the executive directors and Senior employees and shareholders provided by the Balance Sheet Carry awards, PLC Equity Awards, FMC Equity Awards and Deferred Share Awards, further alignment will be provided by a minimum shareholding policy of two times salary for executive directors and one times salary for other senior employees.
A period of up to two years from 1 April 2011 will be permitted to build up to the required shareholding.
Compliance with these shareholding guidelines will be assessed by the Committee and may have an impact on the future remuneration of executive directors and Partners.
Following the end of the period for executive directors to build up their shareholding, the extent to which the shareholding guidelines have been satisfied by each executive director will be set out in the remuneration reports for subsequent years.

The maximum performance hurdle for the MTIS has been achieved this year, therefore 100% of amounts awarded under MTIS for 2010 11 will be paid to participants.
In 2009 10 only 97.5% of the performance hurdle was achieved and in 2008 09 the minimum performance hurdle was not achieved.
In accordance with the rules of the MTIS, once the threshold performance hurdle has been met in a subsequent year, catch up payments will be made for any prior years where a full payout has not been made.
Accordingly the directors will be paid the remaining 2.5% of the MTIS portion of their bonus for 09 10 and 08 09 The 97.5% of catch up of MTIS for 08 09 was paid in June 2010.

Carried interest on third party funds The Company has established for its executives, including the executive directors, carried interest arrangements under which between 60% and 80% of the carried interest negotiated by the Company in respect of managed funds raised since 21 January 1998 is available for allocation to its executives.
Although these arrangements are not a long term incentive scheme as the costs of these arrangements are borne by the investors in such funds the Company sought, and obtained, approval from its shareholders for such arrangements at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 21 January 1998.
Reconfirmation of the approval of the carried interest arrangements was obtained from shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 27 May 2003.
It is not possible to put a monetary value on these interests, as they are dependent upon the performance of the relevant funds in the future.
No amounts will be payable until the third party investors in the funds have had all their capital returned, plus a minimum return.
The allocation of carried interest entitlements as at 31 March 2011 was as follows: Intermediate ICG ICG ICG ICG Capital Asia ICG Intermediate Minority ICG Mezzanine Mezzanine Mezzanine Pacific European Capital Asia Partners Recovery Fund Fund Fund Mezzanine Fund Pacific Fund Fund Fund 1998 2000 2003 Fund 2005 2006 2008 2008 2008 Executive directors 13.4% 12.9% 19.6% 22.1% 22.6% 21.7% 43.1% 23.8% Former executive directors 27.5% 16.0% 9.6% 9.4% 2.8% 0.7% 1.2% 1.4% Other executives 20.6% 27.9% 39.1% 43.5% 54.6% 57.6% 35.7% 54.8% ICG 38.5%43.2%31.7%25.0% 20.0% 20.0% 20.0% 20.0% Total 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Intermediate Capital Group plc Intermediate Capital Group plc 82 Report of the Remuneration Committee continued 4 Remuneration Committee Advisors to the Committee Composition and operation  LLP PwC has been appointed by the The Committee is authorised by the Board to determine and Committee and advises the management of ICG on remuneration agree the framework for the remuneration of the Chairman of the issues.
