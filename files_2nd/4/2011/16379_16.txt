During 2011 the Committee comprised Paul Walsh, who became Committee Chairman in May 2011 on the retirement of Jeroen van der Veer, Michael Treschow, Ann Fudge and from May 2011 Kees Storm.
While it is the Committees responsibility to exercise independent judgement, the Committee does request advice from management and professional advisers, as appropriate, to ensure that its decisions are fully informed given the internal and external environment.
The Committee appointed Deloitte LLP to provide independent advice on various matters it considered in 2011.
During the year, Deloitte also provided specific tax, technology consultancy and corporate finance services to Unilever.
The Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that there were appropriate safeguards against such conflicts.

Executive Directors Our aims and guiding principles The overriding aim of the Committee is to ensure that the remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors support the The Committee typically reviews, at least on an annual basis, the longer-term objectives of Unilever and, in turn, the longer-term impact of different performance scenarios on the potential reward interests of shareholders.
opportunity and pay-outs to be received by Executive Directors and the alignment of this with the returns that might be received This means that we must ensure that: by shareholders.
The Committee believes that the level of the fixed elements of the remuneration package offered to remuneration that can be delivered in the various scenarios is Executive Directors are sufficiently competitive to attract and appropriate for the level of performance delivered and the value retain highly experienced and talented individuals while that would be created for shareholders.

The Committee performance that Unilever requires: and periodically monitors pay and employment conditions of other performance measures selected support Unilevers business employees within Unilever to ensure alignment and consistency strategy and the ongoing creation of sustained shareholder with remuneration of senior management and Unilevers value.
The Committee believes that Unilevers risk management processes provide the necessary controls to prevent inappropriate risk taking.
For example, when the Committee reviews the structure and levels of performance-related pay for Executive Directors and other members of the ULE, it considers whether these might encourage behaviours incompatible with the long-term interests of Unilever and its shareholders or that may The Committees guiding principles are therefore that the raise any environmental, social or governance risks.
