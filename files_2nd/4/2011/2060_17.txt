Sir Frank Chapman, Martin Houston and Ashley Almanza were members of the BG Pension Scheme BGPS and the BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme BGSBS during the year.

External appointments To broaden the experience of Executive Directors, they are able to accept one external appointment as a non-executive director of another companyprovided that permission is sought from the Board in advance.
Any external appointment must not conflict with the Directors duties andcommitments to BG Group.
Any fees from such appointments may be retained by the individual Executive Director.
The Chief Executive, SirFrank Chapman, was appointed as a non-executive director of Rolls-Royce Holdings plc on 10 November 2011 and he receives anannual fee of75 000 in connection with this appointment.
None of the other Executive Directors currently holds such an appointment.
Change of control As described on page 74, the Executive Directors service contracts contain change of control provisions.
For the purposes of these provisions, a change of control is deemed to occur if the Company becomes a subsidiary of another company: or if 50%ormore of the voting rights of the Company or the right to appoint or remove the majority of the Board of the Company become vested in anyindividual or body or group of individuals or bodies acting in concert: or if all or substantially all of the business, assets and undertakings of theCompany become owned by any person, firm or company other than a subsidiary or associated company.
A change of control is also deemed tooccur if the whole of the issued capital of BG Energy Holdings Limited or a substantial part of the undertaking of that Company including its subsidiaries is transferred to another company, unless that transferee company is a subsidiary of the Company, or a company ultimately owned bysubstantially the same shareholders as are the ultimate owners of the Company.
However, a change of control does not occur if and only if through a process of reconstruction the Company becomes a subsidiary of another company owned by substantially the same shareholders as are the shareholders of the Company.
The Executive Directors service contracts provide that any payments made pursuant to these provisions will be made, less any deductions the employer is required to make.
Any such payments shall be in full and final settlement of any claims the Executive Director may have against the employer or any associated company arising out of the termination of employment, except for any personal injury claim, any claim in respect of accrued pension rights, or statutory employment protection claims.
Non-Executive Directors The Board aims to recruit Non-Executive Directors of a high calibre, with broad commercial, international or other relevant experience.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed by the Board on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee.
Their appointment is for an initial term of three years, subject to election by shareholders at the first AGM following their appointment and annual re-election thereafter.
The terms ofengagement of the Non-Executive Directors are set out in a letter of appointment.
The basic annual fee paid to Non-Executive Directors is 77 500.
Additional fees are also payable, for example, for membership of, or chairing, aCommittee of the Board and for acting as Senior Independent Director.
The current remuneration policy for Non-Executive Directors requires thatfees are reviewed every two years, taking into account time commitment, competition for high-quality non-executive directors and market movements.
The next review will be effective 1 July 2012.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Companys share schemes, incentive schemes or pension schemes.
To facilitate the alignment of the interests of the Non-Executive Directors with those of shareholders, the Group has put in place a Non-Executive Directors share purchase programme through which Non-Executive Directors may elect to invest a proportion of their fees, net of tax and onaregular basis, to acquire BG Group shares on the open market.
The first deductions were made under this programme in January 2010. www.
