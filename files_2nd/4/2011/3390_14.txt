Business overview Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 39 Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 October 2011 This report sets out the information required by the Companies Act 2006, and Regulation 11 and Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008.
The Report also satis es the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and describes how the Board has applied the principles and complied with the provisions relating to directors remuneration in the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The Directors Remuneration Report will be submitted to shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting on 21 March 2012.
The Companies Act 2006 requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on certain parts of the Directors Remuneration Report and to state whether, in their opinion, those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the applicable accounting regulations.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for the audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION Remuneration Committee During the year under review the Remuneration Committee comprised: Mr I F R Much Committee Chairman Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss The Rt Hon Lord Freeman Mr P C F Hickson Mr Hickson, the Non-Executive Chairman of the Board, was considered to be independent on appointment.
Mrs V Murray was also appointed as a member of the Committee on her appointment as a non-executive director on 1 November 2011.
The Committees principal responsibilities are: determining, agreeing with the Board and reviewing from time to time the overall policy for the remuneration of the Chairman, the executive directors, the Company Secretary, members of the Executive Committee and the first tier of senior management below the Executive Committee, and their individual remuneration packages and any changes thereto: reviewing the market competitiveness of the remuneration policy and arrangements: overseeing salary levels and remuneration packages for the second and third tiers of management: approving the terms and conditions of employment, and any changes thereto, of the executive directors: approving any compensation payments for executive directors: approving the design of, and determining targets for, any performance-related pay schemes operated by the Group: reviewing the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and the Companys shareholders: providing oversight of potential remuneration-related risks arising across the Group: and overseeing any major changes in employee bene ts structures across the Group.
With the exception of Mr Hickson, whose remuneration is determined by the Committee, none of the Committee members has any personal financial interest in the matters reserved for the Committee nor do they have any con icts of interest arising from cross-directorships, and they are not involved in the day to day running of the Groups business.
Therefore, they are regarded by the Board as independent.
Mr Hickson does not participate in any discussions regarding his own remuneration.
The Committee met six times during the year.
The Chief Executive attends meetings by invitation but no executive director or other employee is present during discussions relating to their own remuneration.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Companys website or on request from the Company Secretary.
Advisers During the year, the Committee retained New Bridge Street an Aon Hewitt company to advise on remuneration and incentive-plan related matters.
The Company received no other services from New Bridge Street, or any other part of the Aon group of companies, during the year.
The Committee consults internally with the Chief Executive and the Company Secretary.
Remuneration policy for executive directors The Committees policy is to provide executive remuneration packages which are competitive, but not excessive, by reference to market rates across comparator companies, which take into account the individual contribution and performance of each executive, and which re ect the performance of the business against financial objectives.
Remuneration packages comprise the following elements: i base salary and bene ts, including pensions: ii annual bonuses linked to the Groups financial performance and personal objectives: and iii awards of share-based incentives linked to the long term growth of the Group.
The Committee aims to align the interests of executive directors and senior executive with those of shareholders, by ensuring that a signi cant proportion of remuneration is performance-related.
This is achieved through the performance-related elements of annual bonuses and share-based incentives.
Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2011 40 Corporate governance Directors Remuneration Report continued There were a number of important in uences on the Committees key decisions during the year: The Group completed two major acquisitions, Mecar S. A. and Roke Manor Research Limited, towards the end of the 2010 financial year, and in April 2011, the acquisition of the General Dynamics Armament and Technical Products Detection Systems business now Chemring Detection Systems, Inc. was announced.
The acquisition of Mecar has resulted in a signi cant increase in the Groups sales to non-NATO countries, and Roke has substantially augmented the Groups engineering capabilities in electronics, software and systems engineering.
The Chemring Detection Systems acquisition creates substantial opportunities to enhance the Groups existing IED detection capabilities.
These three new businesses have increased the Groups revenue by over 149 million on an annualised basis and, as a result, the operational complexity of managing the Group has intensi ed.
These important factors were taken into account when the Committee adjusted salary levels for the executive directors with effect from 1 April 2011.
Prospects within the defence sector were reasonably optimistic in the first half of the year.
This was re ected in highly challenging earnings per share and cash ow targets set by the Committee for the annual bonus plan for the year ended 31 October 2011 and the equally demanding earnings per share targets set for the awards made under the Chemring Group Performance Share Plan in January 2011.
However, the immediate outlook for the sector became increasingly uncertain towards the end of 2011.
This has been an important in uence on the Committees thinking on a number of issues during the last few months, resulting in: the imposition of a salary freeze for the executive directors for 2012: the award of zero bonuses for the year ended 31 October 2011: and reduced earnings per share growth targets for Performance Share Plan awards to be made during 2012.
Full details on the Committees key decisions are set out below.
Comparator groups The constituents of the sector-based comparator group utilised by the Committee for remuneration benchmarking purposes during the year were as follows: Bodycote plc Melrose PLC Senior plc Charter International plc Morgan Crucible Company Spectris plc Domino Printing Services plc QinetiQ Group PLC Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Fenner PLC Renishaw plc Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Halma plc Rotork PLC The Committee also considered a general comparator group of forty nine FTSE companies with a similar market capitalisation and turnover of half to double that of the Group.
Base salaries and bene ts The executive directors base salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee, and adjustments made, if appropriate, taking into account individual performance and comparable salary levels in the comparator groups set out above.
The Committee refers to published salary surveys and data provided by its remuneration advisers, New Bridge Street, and also reviews the remuneration information presented in the annual reports of companies in the comparator groups.
The Committee has considered two annual salary reviews since the last Directors Remuneration Report was published: 2011 adjustment effective 1 April 2011 : As explained above, a key consideration for the Committee when it carried out the salary review in early 2011 was the enhanced complexity of the most senior executive roles following the expansion of the Group.
The Committee also took into account the outstanding and sustained Group performance over a number of years and the demand for talented executive management with a proven track record in the industry.
The Group has a relatively small executive management team, and the current members of this team have been critical to the Groups recent success.
The Committee was keen to ensure that these individuals were motivated to remain with the Group.
Accordingly, salaries for the executive directors were increased by 9.4% with effect from 1 April 2011.
Revised salaries were, therefore, Dr Price 525,000 and Mr Rayner 328,125.
2012 adjustment effective 1 April 2012 : In light of the increasingly dif cult immediate trading outlook for the Group, given the current worldwide pressure on defence budgets, the Committee has determined that there should be no adjustment to the executive directors salaries for 2012.
The executive directors salaries will, therefore, remain at the levels outlined above for 2012.
Mrs Ellards base salary was increased from 180,000 to 200,000 on her appointment as an executive director on 7 October 2011.
The executive directors base salaries will next be reviewed on 1 April 2013.
The Committee also considers and approves the base salaries for twenty seven other senior executives, and reviews salaries for the next two tiers of management at each of the Groups businesses.
In addition, the Committee receives information on general pay levels across the Group.
The Committee therefore has due regard to salary levels across the Group in applying its remuneration policy.
The main taxable bene ts for executive directors are fully-expensed company cars and private medical insurance.
Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2011 Business overview Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 41 Annual bonuses During the year under review, the Company operated an annual performance-related bonus plan for the executive directors, with key characteristics as follows: a maximum bonus potential for the executive directors of 100% of base salary: three quarters of the bonus potential linked to two separate financial performance conditions, namely earnings per share and cash ow with equal weighting.
The conditions, which are set by the Committee, take into account a number of factors including budget, market expectations, long term growth prospects and the previous years out-turn.
No bonus is payable for achievement of less than 90% of target, with bonuses being earned thereafter on a straight-line basis up to the maximum for 110% or better achievement of target: one quarter of the bonus potential may be achieved in connection with the satisfaction of personal objective criteria set at the beginning of the financial year.
These comprise a mixture of short term and longer term objectives linked to the delivery of the Companys strategic plan.
No part of this element of bonus is payable unless threshold performance of both the financial conditions described above is achieved.
The personal objectives set for the executive directors during the year were linked to the following strategic objectives: improvements in the Groups operational ef ciency capture of key new programmes and delivery of new product development required for future organic growth expansion of the Groups non-NATO activities consolidation of previous acquisitions: 40% of any bonus payable is deferred as a conditional award of the Companys shares, with vesting subject to continued employment save in good leaver scenarios three years from the award of bonus: and the payment of any bonus remains ultimately at the discretion of the Committee.
The issues experienced by the Group right at the end of the financial year, resulting in delays in revenue, meant that the tough pre-set targets on earnings per share and cash ow were missed and no bonus was payable in respect of these elements.
Although many of the personal objectives were successfully achieved, nothing is payable under this element of the bonus plan unless threshold performance is achieved under both the earnings per share and cash ow measures.
In summary, the Committees belief in rigorous target setting meant that despite the Group achieving 5% year-on-year underlying earnings per share growth and successfully implementing a number of key strategic developments for the longer-term bene t of the Group, no bonuses were payable to the executive directors for performance in the year under review.
The Committee has consistently set highly challenging bonus targets for the achievement of maximum bonuses.
Despite the outstanding levels of earnings per share growth and returns to shareholders delivered by the Group in recent years, the executive directors did not receive maximum bonuses in any of the four years prior to the year under review, as evidenced by the chart below.

Clawback provisions exist in the bonus plan, which will enable the Company to clawback the deferred shares prior to vesting in the event of subsequent discovery of material misstatement of the Companys financial results for the financial year in respect of which the deferred shares were awarded.
Bonuses will continue to be determined by a mixture of earnings per share, cash ow and personal objectives.
Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2011 42 Corporate governance Directors Remuneration Report continued Long term incentives Performance share plan The Company operates the Chemring Group Performance Share Plan for the executive directors and other key members of the senior management team who in uence the performance and prospects of the Group.
The key features of the plan are currently as follows: conditional awards can be made of the Companys shares worth no more than 150% of base salary each year under normal circumstances 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances : awards will vest three years after grant subject to the extent to which a demanding performance condition has been achieved over a single three year performance period with no ability to re-test the performance condition.
The performance condition is based on the growth of the Companys earnings per share in excess of RPI over three consecutive financial years.
The Committee considers an earnings per share condition to most closely align the interests of participants with those of the Companys shareholders: the vesting schedules for awards granted to date are as follows: Total earnings per share growth per annum not compounded over three financial years Awards to executive directors Threshold vesting Full vesting Awards made prior to 23 January 2007 100% of salary RPI 5% p. a.
Awards made on 24 January 2007 100% of salary RPI 7.5% p. a.
Awards made on or after 23 January 2008 100% of salary RPI 10% p. a.
25% vests for RPI 25% p. a. for awards awards up to 100% of salary up to 100% of salary Awards made on or after 125% of salary 23 January 2010 RPI 25% p. a. for any additional RPI 30% for awards awards over 100% of salary up to 125% of salary RPI 10% p. a.
25% vests for RPI 25% p. a. for awards awards up to 100% of salary up to 100% of salary Awards made on or after 150% of salary 19 January 2011 RPI 25% p. a. for any additional RPI 35% p. a. for awards awards over 100% of salary up to 150% of salary For awards of up to 150% of base salary, 100% will vest at RPI 25%, with the additional 50% vesting on a straight-line basis between RPI 25% and RPI 35% No shares vest for growth below the threshold vesting target.
Vesting is calculated on a straight-line basis for growth between the threshold and full vesting targets: earnings per share is calculated on a fully diluted and normalised basis, as speci ed by the Committee prior to grant: and market purchase shares or new issue shares including treasury shares may be used to satisfy awards.
To the extent that new issue shares or treasury shares are used, these will count towards the usual share usage dilution limits 10% in ten years for all schemes and 5% in ten years for discretionary executive schemes.
Participation in the plan is extended at the discretion of the Committee to the executive directors and senior management of the Group, both in the UK and overseas.
The following awards were made under the plan during the year: Total number of Number of participants Date of award shares awarded receiving awards 19 January 2011 693,720 36 24 October 2011 17,492 1 Total 711,212 37 Restated to re ect subdivision of 5p ordinary shares into 1p ordinary shares Details of the awards made to executive directors during the year are set out on page 46.
Clawback provisions apply to all awards under the plan from 2011 onwards, which will enable the Company to clawback awards prior to vesting in the event of subsequent discovery of material misstatement of the Companys financial results, and after having first clawed back any unvested deferred shares awarded as part of the annual bonus for the financial year in which the results were misstated.
The Committee has historically set highly challenging earnings per share targets, re ecting the Boards con dence in the strong growth prospects for the Group but also the Committees rm commitment to align the interests of shareholders with the executive management through the use of signi cant levels of potential variable pay triggered by exceptional levels of performance.
In considering the performance condition for awards which will be made in 2012, the Committee has remained consistent with its commitment to tough target setting.
However, with defence budgets around the world under signi cant pressure, growth prospects for the Group are considerably more uncertain and this is re ected in the lower target growth range selected by the Committee.
Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2011 Business overview Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 43 The following vesting schedule will therefore apply for awards made in 2012: Total earnings per share growth per annum not compounded over three financial years Value of award that will vest Less than 3% p. a.
100% to 150% of base salary Given the uctuating nature of in ation over recent years, the Committee feels that it is more appropriate going forward to set a robust target that is expressed as a simple growth percentage rather than a target expressed as RPI x%.
The Committee believes that this simpler structure will be more transparent for both shareholders and executives.
The Committee is satis ed that, although lower than for previous awards, this target range is still highly challenging given the current prospects for the Group and for the sector.
The Committee reviews, from time to time, the basis of the performance condition but continues to believe that the earnings per share metric mostly closely aligns the interests of executives and shareholders, and therefore remains an appropriate metric for the Group.
During the year under review, the Company purchased 300,000 2010: 634,400 treasury shares at a cost of 1.5 million for use in the plan.
456,855 shares were transferred from treasury to participants in the plan during the year on vesting of the awards made on 23 January 2008.
The executive directors are expected to build-up, over a five year period following appointment, and maintain a shareholding in the Company equivalent to one years base salary.
All of the executive directors currently hold shares in excess of this requirement.
Other participants in the plan are expected to retain a shareholding equivalent to up to 50% of their base salary following vesting of the awards.
Other schemes The Company operates all-employee savings-related share schemes in the UK The Chemring Group 2008 Sharesave Plan and the US The Chemring Group 2008 US Stock Purchase Plan.
There are no performance criteria for these arrangements, and options are issued to all participants in accordance with UK HM Revenue and Customs and US Internal Revenue Service regulations.
The Company complies with the dilution guidelines contained within the ABI Principles of Remuneration.
At 31 October 2011, awards outstanding and issued under all share schemes during the previous ten years amounted to 3.07% of the ordinary share capital of the Company.
At 31 October 2011, awards outstanding and issued under executive share schemes during the previous ten years amounted to 2.67% of the ordinary share capital of the Company.

Performance graph The following graph shows a comparison of the Companys total shareholder return TSR over the last five financial years against a broad equity market index, as required by the Regulations.
The FTSE 250 Index has been selected by the Committee for this comparison because it provides the most appropriate measure of performance of listed companies of a similar size to the Company.

Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2011 Value 44 Corporate governance Directors Remuneration Report continued Pensions The executive directors were members of the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme the Staff Scheme until 6 April 2010.
This is an approved final salary scheme, which is contracted out of the State Second Pension, and which provides, at retirement, a pension of up to two-thirds of salary, subject to Inland Revenue limits.
The pension arrangements for the executive directors under the Staff Scheme 1 80ths accrual rate only as far as the notional earnings cap were well below market norms.
The Committee therefore agreed that with effect from 6 April 2010, the executive directors would cease to participate in the Staff Scheme, and would instead, for all future service, receive a salary supplement of 20% of base salary.
Service contracts The executive directors all have rolling service contracts, as follows: Date of commencement Notice period S L Ellard 7 October 2011 12 months D J Price 4 April 2005 12 months P A Rayner 27 August 1999 12 months The contracts may all be terminated by the Company without notice, by making a payment in lieu of notice equal to the sum of the salary due for the unexpired notice period plus the fair value of any contractual bene ts.
The contracts for Mrs Ellard and Dr Price provide that any such sum may be paid in instalments, and in these circumstances there is a requirement to mitigate loss.
Mr Rayners contract does not include such a provision.
It is the Committees general policy that all new executive directors appointed in the future will have service contracts with the Company which are terminable on a maximum of twelve months notice.
The service contracts will contain provisions permitting the Company to make any termination payments by instalments, and will require directors to mitigate their loss in such circumstances.
Policy on outside appointments With the speci c approval of the Board in each case, executive directors may accept external appointments as non-executive directors of other companies, provided that they do not detract from their responsibilities to the Group, and may retain any related fees paid to them.
Mr Rayner and Mrs Ellard do not currently hold any such external appointments.
Dr Price is currently serving as a non-executive director of AZ Electronic Materials S. A. for which he receives and retains an annual fee of 55,000.
Non-executive directors Mr Hicksons letter of appointment provides for a three year appointment at a xed fee of 170,000 per annum.
The appointment may be terminated on six months notice by either party.
It is anticipated that Mr Hickson will devote four to five days each month to his role, subject to the overriding requirement that he allocates suf cient time to the role as is reasonably necessary for the proper performance of his duties.
The other non-executive directors are all appointed for three year terms under letters of appointment covering, amongst other items, their terms of appointment and expected time commitment.
The appointments may be terminated earlier by and at the discretion of either party upon three months written notice.
The Rt Hon Lord Freeman is currently serving his second three year term as a non-executive director, which will expire on 25 May 2012.
Mr Evans current appointment as a non-executive director will terminate on 30 March 2012, and he has advised the Board that he intends to retire and will not therefore seek reappointment at the Annual General Meeting on 21 March 2012.
Mr Much and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss are currently serving their third terms, under letters of appointment which have been extended on a rolling basis.
Mrs Murrays first three year term will expire on 31 October 2014.
Following a review of time commitment and market rates, the basic fees for the non-executive directors were adjusted during the year.
The basic fee payable to each of the five non-executive directors is now 55,000 per annum.
The Rt Hon Lord Freeman and Mr Much each receive an additional fee of 8,000 per annum, in respect of their Chairmanship of the Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee respectively.
Mr Much also serves as the Senior Independent Director but he receives no additional fee for this role.
Fees for the non-executive directors have been xed for the next three years.
The Company provides private medical insurance for Mr Evans, Mr Hickson and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss, and their respective spouses.
The non-executive directors do not participate in the Companys pension, bonus or share-based incentive schemes.
However, Mr Evans does receive a pension from the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme, which he accrued during his former employment with the Company.
