QinetiQs policy is that Executive Directors should have service agreements with a rolling term providing for a maximum of one years notice.
Consequently, no Executive Director has a contractual notice period in excess of 12 months.
In the event of early termination, this ensures that compensation is restricted to a maximum of 12 months basic salary and benefits.
The Committee will generally consider mitigation to reduce the compensation payable to a departing Executive Director.
