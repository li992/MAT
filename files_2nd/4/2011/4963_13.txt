66 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011 Remuneration Committee report The Committee has sought to ensure that the variable elements of management remuneration achieve an appropriate balance between short-term financial and operational performance, progress towards the Groups strategic objectives and alignment with the returns to shareholders.
Tim Barker Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Introduction The debate in respect of executive remuneration and in particular the transparency of reporting has continued in earnest during 2011.
The Remuneration Committee the Committee has welcomed this and has actively contributed.
We recognise the need to build trust in the remuneration process through transparency and accountability and we are therefore supportive of many of the proposals currently being suggested by the Government following the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills reviews of narrative reporting and executive remuneration.
In particular we welcome proposals that promote clear and concise reporting as evidenced by our nomination for Best Remuneration Disclosure in the ICSA Hermes Transparency in Governance Awards 2011.
We are also considering implementing further measures to promote greater transparency within the Group.
Some disclosures, particularly if they are overly prescriptive, may have unintended consequences or be subject to invalid comparisons between companies.
We therefore think that it is essential to give companies flexibility to present information in a way that is relevant to their business and compensation structures.
The Committee strongly supports proposals that enhance the link between performance and executive remuneration and also improve the clarity of reporting of the same.
We believe that the measures of performance to which executive reward is linked should be based on the specific companys circumstances and also individual contribution, so cannot be measured solely in terms of share price or earnings growth.
This is particularly so in challenging market conditions and in companies such as Drax, where shareholders recognise that earnings volatility is inescapable.
The Committee further developed this approach during the last remuneration review whereby performance measures applicable to the Bonus Matching Plan BMP for executives and senior management were adjusted to include both operational and strategic measures.
Our aim was to align more closely remuneration with key strategic goals specific to Drax, in particular the development of a much more sustainable business with reduced reliance on coal, a greater focus on biomass and increased retail sales.
A relative Total Shareholder Return TSR measure was also retained to ensure continued alignment of executive reward with the interests of shareholders.
All participants in the BMP are subject to the share ownership guidelines as set out on page 75.
The Committee has striven to maintain a balanced remuneration structure which recognises both short-term performance and the achievement of long-term strategic objectives.
Financial and operational performance continue to be critical components in the Committees determination of remuneration for executive directors and senior staff as it is these factors that primarily determine the returns to shareholders in the short-term.
Indeed, the business performed well in both of these areas during 2011 against a backdrop of volatile commodity markets.
Remuneration for executives also takes into account progress in the Groups two key strategic initiatives: to convert Drax Power Station into a predominantly biomass fuelled generating asset, subject to securing the necessary regulatory support, and the programme for the expansion of Haven Power Limited.
The Committees assessment was that excellent progress was made during 2011 in achieving these objectives.
The Committee is satisfied that remuneration incentives are compatible with the Groups risk policies and systems, including those relating environmental, social and governance risks.

Financials Governance Business review 68 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011 Remuneration Committee report Agenda Each year the Committee agrees an annual work schedule.
The regular scheduled matters considered by the Committee in 2011 were: review of the performance of the Group by reference to the 2010 Balanced Corporate Scorecard Scorecard, including the application of the discretionary factor: ratification of the measures and weightings of the 2011 Scorecard: 2010 annual bonus awards to directors and senior managers by reference to the Scorecard and individual performance against personal objectives: agreeing personal objectives for directors and senior managers for 2011: review of base salary and overall remuneration packages for executive directors and senior managers: review of the Chairmans remuneration: granting of awards under executive and all employee share plans: consideration of vesting of awards under executive share plans no such awards vested during 2011 : and review of advisers and the fees paid to them.
In addition, with the assistance of its advisers, the Committee considered current trends in executive remuneration with particular reference to consultation on executive remuneration by the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills.
The Committee considered the Companys own remuneration policy and practices in that context.
It concluded that the structure and level of executive remuneration in the Company continued to be appropriate.
The Committee also considered the provision of pension benefits to executive directors in the light of changes in personal taxation.
It decided not to make any change to the provision of pension benefit, save to give executives the option to be paid in cash in lieu of pension contributions for amounts in excess of the annual personal allowance of 50,000.
Remuneration policy During the year the Committee reviewed and updated its terms of reference to ensure that they were sufficiently flexible and appropriate to meet the different requirements necessary to motivate and retain senior managers in all Group companies.
The objectives of the remuneration policy are: to enable the Company to recruit, retain and motivate the talent needed to achieve its business objectives: to strengthen teamwork by enabling all employees to share in the success of the business: to ensure alignment of executive and shareholder interests: and to develop an approach which emphasises Total Reward.
The core principles of the remuneration policy are to: pay market rates of total remuneration: adopt different pay and benefit structures for different operating entities in the Group as appropriate to each entitys markets, workforce and location: ensure that there is an appropriate link between performance and reward: award annual bonuses which are linked to the delivery of the annual Business Plan targets including the achievement of strategic objectives and personal performance: and ensure that long-term incentives are linked to TSR and to the delivery of Business Plan targets including the achievement of strategic objectives.
69 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011 During the year under review the remuneration package of executive directors and senior managers was made up of: Fixed Variable Annual performance bonus Base salary A mix of cash and deferred shares Long-term incentive comprising conditional shares under the BMP Pension Performance over three years Benets in kind Car allowance, private medical etc All employee share plans Each executive director received total remuneration in respect of the year from 1 January to 31 December 2011 to the value set out in the following table: Dorothy Thompson Tony Quinlan Peter Emery Paul Taylor Salary 000 508 345 284 225 Annual bonus 000 497 312 257 216 Pension contributions 000 101 69 57 39 Benefits in kind 000 90 85 18 15 Vested shares under long-term incentive plan Deferred shares Total remuneration 1,196 811 616 495 The table on page 70 shows the mix of remuneration that applied in 2011 for executive directors between variable and fixed, and short-term and long-term remuneration.
Components of remuneration The main components of current executive directors remuneration are summarised as follows: Retail and Chief Finance Production Trading Executive Director Director Director Salary Salaries were benchmarked in 2010 against two comparator groups, firstly: utilities, power generators and selected other industrial companies, and secondly: commercial companies with comparable market capitalisation, turnover and employee numbers.

The BMP opportunity is based on fair value assuming the annual bonus pays out at target and the fair value of a BMP performance share is assessed at 45% of its face value.
The following paragraphs provide more detail in relation to each of the components of remuneration for executive directors.
Base salary Executive directors base salaries and benefits are reviewed each year with any changes taking effect from 1 April.
The review takes into account individual performance and market competitiveness, recognising that there is no obvious comparator to Drax in the market.
The Committee also takes into account the level of general pay increases within the Company.
The pay increase agreed on behalf of staff covered by collective bargaining arrangements is subject to a three year agreement with increases on 1 January of each year of the agreement, at RPI plus 0.3%.
The increase is subject to a cap of 4.9%, which was therefore the level of the general pay increase on 1 January 2011.
The agreement continues until 31 December 2012.
The average pensionable pay of an executive director is nine times the average of pensionable pay for employees within the collective bargaining unit.
In the light of the benchmarking exercise and the other factors considered, the Committee agreed that with effect from 1 April 2011: Dorothy Thompsons base salary should be increased by 2% to 510,000 Tony Quinlans base salary should be increased by 2% to 346,800 Peter Emerys base salary should be increased by 2% to 285,600 The Committee consider these salary levels to be appropriate taking into account all of the factors set out.
Paul Taylor was appointed to the Board on 1 September 2011 at an annual base salary of 240,000.
Pensionable salary is derived from base salary only.
71 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011 Annual performance bonus The Group operates an annual bonus scheme.
Bonuses are based on both Group and individual performance against objectives and are designed to reward short-term performance.
The Committee determines Group performance measures using a Scorecard for which the Board sets challenging performance targets as part of the Business Plan approval process.
Each element of the Scorecard has a low, target and stretch measure and is given a percentage weighting.
No score is attributed if performance is below the low target and maximum score is attributed to stretch target performance.
In 2011, the Scorecard had the following elements and weightings: Elements Weighting Financial targets Underlying earnings per share: and 20% 1 Cash flow and controllable costs.
10% Production targets Safety and plant and operational performance.
20% Strategic and Business Plan objectives Regulatory securing appropriate support for co-firing of sustainable biomass: 10% Development of technical and sourcing plans to increase the level of biomass generation subject to regulatory support: 15% Commercial and development targets for retail business: 10% Development of plans for compliance with Industrial Emissions Directive IED post 2016 5% Volume of commercially advantaged fuel combustion: and 5% Value added through commodity trading.
5% Notes: 1 Cash flow for the year excluding the impact of short-term investments, prior to payment of equity dividends.
In setting these measures and weightings, the Committee recognises that the short-term financial performance of the Group is substantially determined by commodity prices, and especially the dark green spread, over which management has limited control.
The Committee, nevertheless, believes that the variable elements of pay should be sufficiently linked to financial performance to ensure that there is alignment with the interests of shareholders.
The Committee considers that the annual bonus measures and weightings achieve an appropriate balance between financial performance measures and other key performance measures that are more directly in the control of management.
The Committee assesses corporate performance against each of these measures, and has a discretion to adjust the overall score by a factor between 0.75x and 1.25x i. e. 25% to reflect performance and unexpected developments that are not directly included in the Scorecard, leading to an overall percentage score.
Following this process, the Committee assessed the corporate score for 2011 at 146%.
The Committee exercised its discretion to adjust the corporate score by a factor of 1.03x, resulting in a final corporate score of 150%.
A summary of the assessment is set out in the following table: Elements Financial targets Stretch target achieved for underlying earnings per share.
1 Between target and stretch target achieved for cash flow.
Stretch target achieved for controllable costs.
Production targets Stretch target achieved for total recordable injury rate.
Between target and stretch target achieved for all other safety and operational targets, except for planned outage rate, which achieved between low and target because of additional outages associated with plant modifications for biomass trials which were not included in the original plan.
Strategic and Business Plan objectives Between target and stretch target achieved for regulatory objectives.
Overall, slightly below target was achieved for development of biomass plans, which reflected the inability to demonstrate a viable investment case for the development of dedicated biomass plant.
Between target and stretch target was achieved for commercial and development targets for the retail business.
Target was achieved for IED plans.
Target was achieved for volume of commercially advantaged fuel combustion.
Stretch target was achieved for value added from commodity trading.
Notes: 1 Cash flow for the year excluding the impact of short-term investments, prior to payment of equity dividends.
Financials Governance Business review 72 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011 Remuneration Committee report The Board determines personal performance objectives for each executive director.
The Committee assesses performance against these objectives and applies an individual performance multiplier of between zero and 1.5.
To determine the actual bonus awarded to each executive director, the target bonus is multiplied by the corporate score and by the personal score, subject to a cap of two times the target bonus.
For bonus awards in 2011, the target bonus for the Chief Executive and the other executive directors was 65% and 60% of base salary respectively.
The maximum bonus was 130% and 120% respectively.
75% of any bonus award is paid in cash and 25% is deferred in shares that vest after three years and are forfeited if the executive leaves the Group other than as a good leaver before the shares vest.
The target and maximum bonus percentages for 2012 for the Chief Executive and the other executive directors are the same as in 2011, and bonus measures and targets have been set using a similar process to that used previously.
The corporate scorecard weightings are 30% financial, 15% safety and production, 5% retail and 50% strategic and Business Plan.
The weightings are set out in the following table: Target weighting Financial performance 1 Group underlying earnings per share 20% 2 Cash flow and controllable costs 10% Total financial 30% Safety, production and retail Safety and production targets 15% Retail sales volume 5% Total safety, production and retail 20% Strategic and Business Plan Regulatory objectives 5% Biomass co-firing development 20% Biomass procurement targets 10% IED compliance plan development 5% Other 10% Total strategic and Business Plan 50% Total weighting 100% Notes: 1 Calculated using underlying earnings, being profit attributable to equity shareholders adjusted to exclude the after tax impact of unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts, and exceptional items see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
2 Cash flow for the year excluding the impact of short-term investments, prior to payment of equity dividends Conditional share awards under the Bonus Matching Plan The Group operates the BMP as a long-term performance share plan.
Awards under the BMP have been made in 2009, 2010 and 2011.
Under the BMP executive directors and other senior executives receive an annual grant of conditional shares to a value of up to 1.5 times the amount of the executives annual bonus for the prior year.
No payment is made for the shares.
However, vesting is subject to service and performance conditions.
In respect of existing awards, 33% of awards granted to those members of senior management who are not members of the Executive Committee will vest on the third anniversary of grant provided that the participant is still employed by the Group.
Awards granted to members of the Executive Committee and the balance i. e. 67% of the awards granted to other members of senior management will vest on the third anniversary of grant provided the participant is still employed by the Group and subject to achievement of performance conditions determined by the Committee and described below.
73 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011 The TSR condition 50% of such part of any awards that are subject to performance conditions shall vest subject to a condition relating to the Companys TSR over the three year period measured from the start of the financial year in which an award is granted relative to the TSR over the same period of the companies comprising the FTSE51150 the Comparator Group.
TSR is the return received by a Drax shareholder through appreciation in the share price, plus dividends assumed to be reinvested in Drax shares.
The TSR condition provides for vesting as follows: Vesting of Matching Awards granted to Vesting of Matching Awards granted to Company rank within the comparator group Executive Committee members other participants Within upper quartile 100% 100% At median 15% 33% 1 1 Below median 0% 33% Notes: 1 Subject normally to continuing service up to the third anniversary.
The Scorecard condition 50% of the BMP award subject to performance conditions will vest by reference to the Companys performance against the average outcome from the Scorecard over the three year performance period the Scorecard award.
The Scorecard award will vest by reference to the average of the outputs of the Scorecard for each of the three years reported on during the performance period, commencing at the start of the financial year in which the BMP award is made.
The averaging calculation is capped although the annual result on which the three year calculation will be made will not, for this purpose, be so capped.
It is then proposed that the Scorecard award will vest at the end of the three year performance period as follows: Average Scorecard outcome % of Scorecard Award vesting 1 0% 1 1 15% 1 1.5 100% Notes: 1 Straight-line vesting between 15% and 100% for average result between 1 and 1.5.
In addition, at the end of the three year performance period the Remuneration Committee will ratify each of the annual results going into the average Scorecard calculation and has the discretion to adjust the final outcome based on events over the period to ensure an outcome that is consistent with the underlying performance progression of the business.
In exercising its discretion the Committee will pay particular regard to progress against the strategic objectives incorporated in the Scorecard including sustainable development of biomass generation and the development of the Haven Power supply business.
In addition, the Committee must be satisfied that there has also been a demonstrable and sustainable improvement in the Companys performance over the period.
In determining this, the Committee will take into account all relevant factors but in particular will consider improvement in the Companys financial, production and trading performance.
Pension Executive directors are entitled to non-contributory membership of the Groups defined contribution pension plan.
The employers contribution for executive directors is 20% of base salary.
Alternatively, at their option, executive directors may either have contributions of the same amounts made to their personal pension schemes or cash in lieu of pension at the stated rate and subject to normal statutory deductions: or a combination of pension contributions up to 50,000 per annum with the remainder as cash in lieu of pension.
Details of pension contributions for executive directors and of payments in lieu are included in the Directors emoluments table in Part 2 of this report.

3 Covers car allowance and second base expenses only.
The cost of other benefits such as BUPA and additional life cover is not easily predicted because they are subject to price variation the amount of which depends on personal circumstances at the time during the year.
4 Annual contribution by the Company to the directors pension plans or cash in lieu.
All employee share plans The Committee operates a Savings-Related Share Option Plan SAYE and a Share Incentive Plan SIP, both of which are approved by HM Revenue & Customs and must be operated on an all employee basis.
The executive directors may participate in each plan upon the same terms as other employees.
The plans are the main vehicles for aligning staff with TSR.
SAYE The SAYE provides for the grant of options which, at the Committees discretion, may be offered at a discount of up to 20% to the market price of a share determined in accordance with the rules of the plan linked to a savings contract which pays interest at a statutory rate.
The plan was operated in 2006 and again in 2010 and 2011, so that subject to the statutory upper aggregate limit of 250 per month on an individuals savings under all SAYE plans a participating employee could choose to save for either or both periods of three or five years.
In each year of operation, options have been granted at the permitted discount of 20% to the prevailing share price determined in accordance with the plan rules resulting in option prices of: 2006 636.00 pence per share 2010 310.50 pence per share 2011 321.00 pence per share Options may be exercised upon successful completion of the three or five year savings contract to which they are linked.
75 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011 The five year contracts under the 2006 Plan matured on 1 July 2011.
The market price of Drax Group plc shares from the maturity date up to the end of the exercise period peaked at 581.50 pence per share, which was well below the option price of 636 pence per share.
Therefore all options under this plan lapsed on 31 December 2011.
Details of the SAYE options held by the executive directors are shown in the table in Part 2 of this report.
On 14 February 2012, the Committee agreed that invitations to the SAYE be made again in 2012, following the preliminary results announcement.
The 20% discount to the market price is applied and participants will be able to take out SAYE contracts over three and five years and contribute in total no more than 250 per month.
SIP In any one tax year, the Committee may operate the SIP for the benefit of participants using any combination of the following elements: award Free Shares up to 3,000 in value : allow the purchase of Partnership Shares up to 1,500 in value subject to an overriding maximum of 10% of salary : allocate free Matching Shares in a maximum ratio of two Matching Shares for each Partnership Share : and allow the investment in shares of dividends received in respect of SIP shares.
The table below details how the SIP has been operated between 2006 and 2009: 2006 2007 2008 2009 1 SIP Free Share Award Participants received Participants received 2,500 worth of shares in Participants received 2,000 worth of shares each year.
Partnership Share Participants were allowed to invest up to the maximum permitted of 1,500 subject to an overriding Award maximum of 10% of salary in each year.
Matching Share Partnership Shares matched on a one-for-one basis in each year.
1 Award Notes: 1 The SIP Trustee was funded by the Group to purchase the required Free and Matching Shares in order to avoid any dilution.
In accordance with the plan rules, shares taken up by an employee are allocated to a trustee which holds them on behalf of the employee.
Under normal circumstances, the employee will receive the shares from the trustee without incurring a tax liability once the shares have been held in trust for five years.
The employee is entitled to receive dividends paid in respect of the shares held in trust.
Details of the shares allocated to executive directors under the SIP are shown in the table in Part 2 of this report.
The SIP has not operated since 2009.
Provision of shares for share plans dilution All equity-based plans are funded through the issuance of shares, or through the purchase of shares in the marketplace through a trust, subject to an overall dilution limit for all employee share plans of no more than 10% of share capital in any ten year period and a limit of 5% of share capital in any ten year period for the Companys discretionary share plans e. g. BMP.
The current estimated dilution from subsisting awards, including executive and all employee share awards, is less than 0.5% of the shares in issue at the date of this report.
Share ownership guidelines The Company has share ownership guidelines for executives participating in its performance share plans.
They are 100% and 50% of base salary for executive directors and other senior manager BMP participants, respectively.
Those who receive shares by virtue of share plan awards or who receive deferred bonus shares must retain 50% of the net that is, after income tax and national insurance contributions shares received until the applicable guideline is reached.
No shares have vested since the introduction of the relevant performance share plan.
Financials Governance Business review 76 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011 Remuneration Committee report Service contracts Executive directors service agreements are of indefinite duration, terminable at any time by either party giving 12 months prior notice except that the contracts of Peter Emery and Paul Taylor are terminable by them providing six months notice to the Company.
Under each of the executive directors service agreements other than the Chief Executives, Drax has the right to make a payment in lieu of notice of termination, the amount of that payment being the salary and benefits that would have accrued to the executive director during the contractual notice period.
The following table shows for each person who has served as a director of the Company at any time during the year ended 31 December 2011, the commencement date and term of the service agreement or contract for services, and details of the notice periods.
No service agreement now includes any operative provision for the payment of compensation upon early termination.
Any compensation payable in those circumstances would need to be negotiated at the time and in the light of the circumstances.
Notice period Notice period by the Company by the director Contract start date Contract term months months Tim Barker 14 February 2012 3 years 1 1 Charles Berry 17 April 2011 3 years 6 6 Tim Cobbold 27 September 2010 3 years 1 1 Peter Emery 14 June 2004 Indefinite duration 12 6 1 Mike Grasby 15 December 2005 6 years 1 1 David Lindsell 14 February 2012 3 years 1 1 Tony Quinlan 1 September 2008 Indefinite duration 12 12 Paul Taylor 1 September 2011 Indefinite duration 12 6 Dorothy Thompson 26 September 2005 Indefinite duration 12 12 Tony Thorne 29 June 2010 3 years 1 1 Notes: 1 Mike Grasby retired as a director on 13 April 2011.
Directors service agreements and contracts for services are available for inspection at the Companys registered office during normal hours of business and will be available at the place of the AGM from 10.30am until the close of the meeting.
External appointments The Committee recognises that executive directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies and that such appointments can broaden their knowledge and experience to the benefit of the Group.
The policy is that an executive director who accepts an external appointment having had the prior approval of the Board should retain the fees payable in respect of the appointment.
Dorothy Thompson is a non-executive director of Johnson Matthey plc and received 50,000 in fees for that appointment during 2011.
Non-executive directors The Chairman and non-executive directors receive fees in respect of their services.
They do not receive any pension or benefits in kind, nor are they eligible for any annual performance bonus or any of the share-based reward plans.
The Chairmans notice period is six months whilst the other non-executive directors have a notice period of one month.
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Committee whilst that of the other non-executive directors is determined by the Chairman and the executive directors.
This is designed to: recognise prevailing market rates for the Chairmans and non-executive directors fees in other listed companies of a similar market value or turnover to Drax: reflect the responsibilities and time commitment: and attract and retain individuals with the necessary skills and experience to contribute to the future growth of the Company.
Chairman The Committee determined that the Chairmans remuneration should be increased from 200,000 to 220,000 per annum with effect from 1 April 2011.
