Summary of proposed remuneration arrangements for the year ending 31 March 2012 The Remuneration Committee the 'Committee reviews remuneration arrangements annually to ensure they remain suitable in the light of both internal and external factors.
This year, the Committee concluded that the key elements of the existing arrangements remained aligned with the core principles of Experians remuneration policy and Experians long-term business strategy, and therefore no changes to the overall structure of the remuneration package were required.
The Committee agreed the following key changes for the year ending 31 March 2012: Performance targets: in the light of the improving economic conditions in which Experian is operating, the stretch of performance targets has been increased.
Claw back: in response to the general increased focus on the ability to claw back remuneration which has been paid on the basis of financial results which subsequently are found to have been misstated, the Committee is introducing two measures: - vesting of awards made under the Experian Performance Share Plan and matching awards made under the Experian Co-investment Plans will only occur if the Committee is satisfied that the vesting is not based on financial results that have been materially misstated: and - in the event of an executive receiving an annual bonus which is subsequently found to have been based on materially misstated financial results, bonus opportunity for that executive may be reduced accordingly in the following financial year.
Salaries: these have been increased in line with salaries for the wider employee population.

The Remuneration Committee: members, role and frequency of meetings 68 Details of the Committee members, the scope of their role and frequency of meetings can be found in the corporate governance statement.
Working with advisers In making its decisions, the Committee consults with the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, the Group HR Director, the Global Reward Director and the Head of Executive Compensation who are invited to attend meetings of the Committee as appropriate.
The Chief Financial Officer is also consulted in respect of performance conditions applying to short and long-term incentive arrangements.
No executives are present when their own remuneration arrangements are being discussed.
The Committee has access to independent consultants to ensure that it receives objective advice.
In 2007, Deloitte LLP Deloitte were appointed by the Committee as independent advisers and they continued to act during the year ended 31 March 2011.
Deloitte also provided unrelated advisory and tax services to the Group during the year.
Kepler Associates Kepler were also appointed by the Committee in 2007 and, during the year under review, provided advice and valuation data for Experians executive remuneration arrangements and also provided advice on target calibration for the short and long-term incentive plans.
Kepler do not provide any other services to the Group.
Linklaters LLP provided legal advice in respect of incentive plan design and interpretation.
Remuneration philosophy and principles Experians remuneration philosophy is that reward should be used to drive long-term, sustainable business performance.
In this regard, the Committee aims to have in place remuneration principles for Experian which are consistent with its business objectives and are designed to: drive accountability and transparency and align remuneration with the interests of shareholders: provide a balanced portfolio of incentives which align both short-term one-year and longer-term three-year performance such that sustainable growth and value are delivered for our shareholders: apply demanding performance conditions to deliver sustained profitable growth across the Group, thereby aligning incentives with shareholders interests, setting these conditions with due regard to actual and expected market conditions: pay market-competitive base salaries: provide competitive performance-related compensation which influences performance and helps attract and retain executives by providing the opportunity to earn commensurate rewards for the achievement of outstanding performance, which leads to long-term shareholder value creation: and deliver competitive benefits to underpin the other components of the remuneration package.
Consistent with these principles, the Committee compares the Experian remuneration arrangements with those of other relevant organisations and companies of similar size and scope to Experian.
The remuneration arrangements are also reviewed in light of changing market conditions, which have continued to be challenging over the year under review.
Performance-related incentives are targeted at upper quartile levels for the achievement of stretching objectives.
Experian is committed to performance-related pay at all levels within the organisation and the Committee takes into consideration the remuneration arrangements throughout Experian when determining those for the executive directors.
The performance measures used in Experians incentive plans are all financial, with growth in profit being the key measure used.
This 10 measure was selected as it reflects one of Experians key strategic objectives driving profitable growth.
The performance management process, which is used throughout Experian, assesses executives against both financial and non-financial performance objectives.
Performance against these individual objectives ultimately supports growth in profit and so the Committee believes it is appropriate that this remains the key measure for the Groups incentive plans.
For the long-term incentive plans, external consultants are used to calculate whether, and the extent to which, the performance conditions have been met.
Governance Report on directors remuneration 77 38 The management of the Groups specific business risks is governed by its risk management framework and is inherent in the way in which Experian operates.
As a result of this operational focus on risk management, the Committee is satisfied that the incentive arrangements do not encourage excessive risk taking and therefore it is not considered necessary to have a direct link to risk in the performance measures used.
In addition, as outlined above, claw back provisions have been introduced to minimise risk within the remuneration arrangements.
With respect to Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee is satisfied that environmental, social and governance risks are not raised by the incentive structure for senior management and this does not inadvertently motivate irresponsible behaviour.
Remuneration of executive directors The following graphs illustrate the remuneration package for the executive directors, split between fixed and variable pay, at target and maximum levels of performance.
The combined potential remuneration from annual bonus and share-based incentives i. e. variable pay outweighs the fixed elements excluding pension and benefits at both levels of performance.
Expected value of executive directors Expected value of executive directors remuneration at target performance remuneration at maximum performance 100% 100% 80% 80% 60% 60% 40% 40% 20% 20% 0% 0% Variable: long-term Variable: long-term Variable: short-term Variable: short-term Fixed Fixed Service contracts Each executive director has a rolling service contract which can be terminated by the Group giving twelve months notice.
In the event of termination of the directors contract, any compensation payment is calculated in accordance with normal legal principles, including the application of mitigation to the extent appropriate in the circumstances of the case.
Further details are provided in the section entitled 88 Executive directors service contracts.
Fixed remuneration Base salary and benefits Before making a final decision on individual salary awards, the Committee assesses each directors individual performance and experience as well as average pay increases awarded to other employees in the Group.
To assess the appropriate salary for a role, benchmark data, sourced from external remuneration consultants, is provided to the Committee.
Executive directors salaries are benchmarked against those of executive directors from the companies in the FTSE 100 Index along with other global comparators, reflecting the markets from which Experian recruits talent.
These include, but are not limited to, international companies of a similar size and geographic scope, companies in the financial services and related industries and companies with significant operations in the same markets as Experian.
The Committee reviewed salaries in early 2011 and, taking into account the factors described above, approved increases as detailed overleaf.
These increases are in line with those awarded to the wider employee population.
78 Experian Annual Report 2011 Report on directors remuneration continued Salary to Salary from Percentage 31 March 2011 1 April 2011 increase Don Robert US$1,450,000 US$1,500,000 3.4% Paul Brooks 475,000 490,000 3.2% Chris Callero US$930,000 US$960,000 3.2% In addition to base salary, executive directors receive certain benefits-in-kind including a car or car allowance, private health cover and life assurance.
These are set at market competitive levels for each role.
Pensions In the UK, a defined contribution plan is available for all employees, with an employer contribution rate in normal circumstances of up to 20% for the most senior executives.
Retirement age is 65 but benefits can be taken from age 55 onwards.
The UK defined benefit arrangements are closed to new entrants, subject only to exceptions approved by the Committee on a case by case basis.
Members who were in the arrangements at the date of closure continue to accrue benefits.
The retirement age is 60 for directors and the arrangements provide a pension of up to two-thirds of final salary, ill health and dependants pensions and life assurance.
A Secured Unfunded Retirement Benefits Scheme SURBS provides unfunded pension benefits for executives affected by the 1989 HMRC earnings cap.
The SURBS was closed to new entrants in April 2006.
In the US, Experian provides a Personal Investment Plan 401k which all US employees, including directors, are eligible to join.
This is a defined contribution arrangement to which participants are able to contribute up to 50% of salary, up to a maximum salary and participant contribution limit established by the IRS, each calendar year.
Variable remuneration Annual bonus and Co-investment Plan Annual bonuses are awarded for achieving profit growth targets.
The Committee believes this is appropriate as it reflects one of Experians 10 key strategic objectives driving profitable growth.
The maximum bonus opportunity for executive directors is 200% of base salary.
However, this level of annual bonus is only payable if Experians financial performance surpasses stretching profit growth targets, designed to deliver exceptional results to shareholders.
During the year, Kepler advised on the calibration of these targets using benchmarks that reflect stretching internal and external expectations.
The benchmarks used include: broker earnings estimates, earnings estimates for competitors, straight-line profit growth consistent with median upper quartile shareholder returns, latest projections for the current year, budget and strategic plan.
Since 2009, executive directors have been offered the opportunity to defer receipt of between 50% and 100% of their annual bonus and invest it in Experian shares invested shares under the Experian Co-investment Plan the CIP.
The invested shares are matched with an additional award of shares matching shares with the maximum match being calculated on the basis of two matching shares for each invested share 2:1 basis.
The release of invested shares and matching shares is deferred for three years and the release of the matching shares is subject to performance conditions which are measured over a three-year period.
Performance conditions are determined by the Committee in advance of grant.
Dividend equivalents accrue on these awards.
If a participant resigns during the three-year period they forfeit the right to the matching shares and the associated dividends, although they would be entitled to retain any invested shares.
Matching awards under the CIP may vest early in the event of a change of control.
CIP awards in respect of the year ended 31 March 2010 The executive directors elected to defer 100% of their annual bonus earned in respect of the year ended 31 March 2010 into the CIP and matching shares were awarded on a 2:1 basis.
Details of the awards made in June 2010 are given in the table entitled GUS and Experian 86 Co-investment Plans and Experian Reinvestment Plans.
The release of 50% of the matching shares is subject to the achievement of a growth in PBT performance condition, measured over three years a 1:1 match vests for growth in PBT of 5% p. a. on average, increasing to a 2:1 match vesting for growth in PBT of 11% p. a. on average.
The other 50% of the matching share awards will vest subject to the achievement of a three-year cash flow target a 1:1 match vests for cash flow of US$2,900m increasing to a 2:1 match vesting for cash flow of US$3,300m.
These performance targets are illustrated in the graphs opposite.
Governance Report on directors remuneration 79 CIP awards in respect of the year ended CIP awards in respect of the year ended 31 March 2010 50% of an award 31 March 2010 50% of an award 2:1 2:1 1:1 1:1 5% 11% US$2,900m US$3,300m Experians average annual PBT growth over three years Experians cash flow over three years The Committee has selected these two performance measures as they reflect two of Experians key strategic objectives driving profitable growth and optimising capital efficiency.
Annual bonus in respect of the year ended 31 March 2011 The Committee set stretching targets for the annual bonus in respect of the year ended 31 March 2011 which required broadly upper quartile levels of performance with reference to relevant external benchmarks in order for maximum bonus to be earned.
In what continued to be a testing and uncertain business environment for both Experian and our clients, the Group delivered an exceptional performance and as a result of this a bonus of 196.7% of salary is payable to the executive directors in respect of the year ended 31 March 2011.
CIP awards in respect of the year ended 31 March 2011 The three executive directors have elected to defer 100% of their bonus earned in respect of the year ended 31 March 2011 into the CIP.
It is intended the same performance measures will be used for the matching awards to be made this year as for the awards made in June 2010 i. e. growth in PBT and cash flow.
The Committee has reviewed the performance targets associated with these measures in the light of the improved economic conditions in which Experian is operating and has determined that these should be made more stretching than in recent years.
Both performance conditions will be measured over a three-year period.
For the 50% of the matching share awards subject to the growth in PBT performance condition, a 1:1 match will vest for growth in PBT of 7% p. a. on average, increasing to vesting of a 2:1 match if PBT growth of 14% p. a. is achieved.
For the 50% of the matching share awards subject to the cash flow performance condition, a 1:1 match will vest for cash flow of US$3,000m, increasing to vesting of a 2:1 match if cash flow of US$3,400m is achieved.
These performance targets are illustrated in the graphs below.

Annual bonus and CIP in respect of the year ending 31 March 2012 It is intended that annual bonus arrangements and the operation of the CIP for executive directors will remain unchanged for the year ending 31 March 2012.
For matching shares awarded under the CIP, the final performance measures and targets will be determined shortly before the awards are made in June 2012 and will be disclosed at the appropriate time.
However, the Committee undertakes to ensure that any targets, whilst they must be seen as achievable to retain and motivate executives during the deferral period, are sufficiently stretching in order to deliver significant shareholder value.
Experian Performance Share Plan the PSP Under the PSP, shares are awarded to participants subject to the achievement of performance conditions, which are measured over a three-year period.
The maximum award under the PSP is normally 200% of base salary, although up to 400% of salary may be awarded under exceptional circumstances.
Any vesting occurs three years from the date of grant.
Performance conditions for awards under the PSP are determined by the Committee in advance of grant.
Awards under the PSP may vest early in the event of a change of control.
PSP awards made in the year ended 31 March 2011 87 Details of PSP awards made to executive directors in June 2010 are given in the table entitled Performance Share Plan.
75% of these awards are subject to a growth in PBT performance condition, measured over a three-year period 25% vesting for growth in PBT of 5% p. a. on average, increasing to 100% vesting for growth in PBT of 11% p. a. on average.
The Committee considers this to be an appropriate performance measure as it reflects one of Experians key strategic objectives driving profitable growth.
The remaining 25% of the awards made in June 2010 are subject to a TSR performance condition, with vesting according to the percentage extent to which Experians TSR out-performs the TSR of the FTSE 100 Index, measured over a three-year period 25% vesting for TSR performance equal to that of the FTSE 100 Index increasing to 100% vesting for TSR performance which out-performs the FTSE 100 Index by 25% or more.
The Committee determined that TSR was an appropriate performance measure as it represents value delivered for shareholders relative to Experians peers.
These performance conditions are illustrated in the graphs below.

The Committee has reviewed the performance targets associated with these measures in the light of the improved economic conditions in which Experian is operating and has determined that the growth in PBT measure should be made more stretching than in recent years.
For the 75% of any award subject to the growth in PBT performance condition, 25% will vest for growth in PBT of 7% p. a. on average, increasing to vesting of 100% if PBT growth of 14% p. a. on average is achieved.
It is intended that the remaining 25% of any award will be subject to the same relative TSR performance condition as applied to the awards made in June 2010.

Experian Share Option Plan ESOP Grants were last made to executive directors under the ESOP in June 2009.
Following a review of the remuneration package for executive directors in 2010, the Committee concluded that no grants would be made under this plan in 2010 and has agreed this will also be the case for 2011 other than in exceptional circumstances.
The maximum award under the ESOP is normally 200% of base salary, although up to 400% of salary may be awarded under exceptional circumstances.
Use of the ESOP in the future will remain under review by the Committee.
Details 85 of outstanding awards under the ESOP and the associated performance conditions are set out in the table entitled 'Share options'.
Experian sharesave plans All executive directors and employees of the Company, and any participating subsidiaries in which sharesave or a local equivalent is operated, are eligible to participate if they are employed by the Group at a qualifying date.
As an example of these plans, the UK Sharesave Plan provides an opportunity for employees to save a regular monthly amount, over either three or five years which, at the end of the savings period, may be used to purchase Experian shares at up to 20% below market value at the date of grant.
Shares released to participants in the year ended 31 March 2011 Experian Reinvestment Plans Awards to executive directors under the 2004 and 2005 cycles of the GUS Co-investment Plans were reinvested in awards under the Experian Reinvestment Plans at demerger to ensure that directors remained fully aligned to the performance of the demerged business.
Matching awards of shares were made under these plans, the release of which is subject to the achievement of performance conditions, the retention of reinvested shares and continued employment.
The vesting of 50% of the matching awards was subject to achievement against a sliding scale growth in PBT performance condition.
30% of this part of the award would vest for average growth in PBT of 7% p. a. over a three-year period, increasing to 100% of this part of the award vesting for average PBT growth of 14% p. a.
This part of the matching award vests in two equal tranches, on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant.
The remaining 50% of the matching award vests in three tranches, 50% on the third anniversary of grant, 25% on the fourth anniversary of grant and 25% on the fifth anniversary of grant, subject to continued employment.
% of shares vesting % of shares vesting 82 Experian Annual Report 2011 Report on directors remuneration continued As reported last year, the Committee tested the PBT performance condition, at the end of the performance period in March 2009, and determined that Experians average annual growth in PBT over this period was 13.2% and, as a result, 92% of the awards subject to this performance condition will vest on the applicable vesting dates.
Details of the number of shares which were released to the executive directors during the year ended 31 March 2011 are given in the table entitled GUS and Experian Co-investment Plans and Experian 86 Reinvestment Plans.
GUS Co-investment Plan The executive directors elected to defer their entire bonus for the year ended 31 March 2007 into Experian shares, under the GUS Co-investment Plan, and as a result were eligible to receive an award of matching shares which would vest after three years, subject to the retention of the invested shares and continued employment.
These awards vested on 29 June 2010 and details of the number of shares 86 released to each director are given in the table entitled GUS and Experian Co-investment Plans and Experian Reinvestment Plans.
Performance graph The Committee has chosen to illustrate the TSR for GUS plc until demerger and Experian plc for the period since listing on 11 October 2006 to 31 March 2011 against the FTSE 100 Index.
The FTSE 100 Index is the most appropriate index against which TSR should be measured as it is a widely used and understood index of which Experian is a constituent.
Value of 100 invested in GUS Experian Value of 100 invested in GUS Experian and the FTSE100 on 31 March 2003 and the FTSE100 on 31 March 2006 350 160 300 140 250 120 200 100 150 80 100 60 March 03 March 04 March 05 March 06 March 07 March 08 March 09 March 10 March 11 March 06 March 07 March 08 March 09 March 10 March 11 Performance as GUS to 6 October 2006 Performance as Experian from 6 October 2006 FTSE100 Index The above graphs show that, at 31 March 2011, a hypothetical 100 invested in GUS, and subsequently Experian, would have generated a total return of 339 compared with a return of 210 if invested in the FTSE 100 Index on 31 March 2003, and a total return of 146 compared with a return of 118 if invested on 31 March 2006.
Shareholding guideline The Committee believes that it is important that executives build up a significant holding in Experian shares to align their interests with those of shareholders.
Therefore, the Committee has established guidelines under which the CEO should hold the equivalent of two times his base salary in Experian shares and other executive directors one times their base salary including invested shares held under the CIP.
Each of the executive directors meets these guidelines.
Value of 100 invested in March 2003 Value of 100 invested in March 2006 Governance Report on directors remuneration 83 Meeting obligations under share-based incentives Obligations under Experians employee share plans may be met using either shares purchased in the market or, except for rolled-over awards under certain GUS schemes, newly issued shares.
The current policy is that, where possible, all awards will be satisfied by the purchase of shares, or from shares previously purchased, by the employee trusts or by shares held in treasury.
This policy will remain under regular review.
The rules of the Experian share plans are in line with the guidelines set out by the ABI regarding dilution.
Remuneration of non-executive directors The Boards policy on the remuneration of non-executive directors is that: fees should reflect individual responsibilities and membership of board committees: remuneration should be in line with recognised best practice and be sufficient to attract, motivate and retain high calibre non-executives: remuneration should be a combination of cash fees paid quarterly and Experian shares see below to help align the interests of nonexecutive directors with those of shareholders.
Non-executive directors do not receive any benefits-in-kind with the exception of the Chairman who receives private healthcare and the use of a company car.
The fees of the non-executive directors were reviewed with effect from 1 October 2009, taking into account market practice in FTSE 100 companies, anticipated number of days worked, tasks and responsibilities.
In addition, fees for the Senior Independent Director, Sir Alan Rudge, were reviewed with effect from 15 September 2010 on his appointment as Deputy Chairman.
The current fees are shown in the table below and these will next be reviewed in October 2011.
Non-executive directors fees from 1 October 2009 Base fee 120,000 Plus additional fees for: 1 Senior Independent Director 22,000 2 Deputy Chairman Senior Independent Director 80,000 Chair of Audit Committee 35,000 Chair of Remuneration Committee 27,000 Notes 1 Until 15 September 2010 2 From 15 September 2010 The Chairmans fee, from 1 April 2010, was 350,000.
This will next be reviewed in April 2012.
Experian requires its non-executive directors to build up a holding in the Company's shares equal to their annual fee.
One quarter of their net annual fee is used to purchase Experian shares each year until they reach this holding: such shares are included in the table entitled 89 Directors interests.
Any tax liability arising from these arrangements is the responsibility of the individual director.
Non-executive directors do not participate in any Experian share plans.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts but each has a letter of appointment with no provision for any termination payment.
Each appointment is for a renewable three-year term, subject to election re-election by shareholders, but may be terminated by either party on one months written notice six months notice in the case of the Chairman.
