An ordinary resolution for the approval of this Report will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting AGM.
The Companys Auditors are required to audit certain of the disclosures provided in this Report.
Where disclosures have been audited, they are indicated in this Report.
The Auditors opinion is included in their Audit Report on page 35.
Remuneration The Board has resolved that a remuneration committee is not appropriate for a company of this size and nature.
Remuneration is therefore regarded as part of the Boards responsibilities to be addressed regularly.
All Directors are non-executive and all participate in meetings of the Board at which Directors remuneration is considered.
The Board seeks advice, inter alia, from the Company Secretary, Invesco Asset Management Limited, when considering the level of Directors fees.
Since 1 April 2007, Directors remuneration has been as follows: Chairman 44,000 pa: Chairman of the Audit Committee 27,000 pa: Senior Non-Executive Director 27,500 pa: and Other Directors 24,200 pa. Policy on Directors Remuneration The Boards policy is that the remuneration of non-executive Directors should be fair and reasonable in relation to that of other investment trusts and to the time incurred and responsibility undertaken.
Fees for the Directors are determined by the Board within the limits stated in the Companys Articles of Association.
The maximum currently dictated by the Companys Articles of Association is 250,000 in aggregate per annum.
The Directors are not eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share options or other incentives or benefits.
It is intended that this policy will continue for the year ending 31 March 2011 and subsequent years.
Service Contracts All Directors have letters of appointment which are available for inspection at the Registered Office of the Company.
Under the Articles of Association of the Company, the terms of the Directors appointment provide that a Director shall be subject to election at the first AGM after appointment and that, at every AGM, one third of the Directors shall retire by rotation and no Director shall hold office for more than three consecutive years without retiring by rotation.
The terms of the appointment letters also provide that a Director may be removed from office by notice in writing.
