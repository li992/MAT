134 Directors remuneration report Directors remuneration report Dear Shareholder I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committees report on directors remuneration for the year to 31 December 2011.
This report is the first prepared since I became Chairman of the Remuneration Committee in June 2011.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank my predecessor, Bridget Macaskill, for her contribution to the Committee over the last eight years.
I would also like to welcome Kai Nargolwala, who joined the Committee on 1 January 2012.
Our aims The primary aims of our remuneration policy remain unchanged: To attract and retain the high calibre executives required to lead and develop the Group, and To reward executives for delivering our business plans and generating sustainable growth and returns for shareholders.
In order to achieve the first of these aims, the Committee reviews remuneration packages regularly, taking account of individual performance and contributions, and information about the reward offered by the UK and overseas organisations with which we compete for executive talent.
In order to achieve the second of these aims, the Groups reward arrangements are robustly connected to the achievement of its key financial objectives and support its approach to risk management.
The Group believes that increasing new business profitability, IFRS profitability and cash generation simultaneously will create sustainable growth.
The combination of measures used to determine annual bonuses rewards the achievement of all three of these objectives, attained whilst maintaining adequate levels of capital and adhering to the Groups risk appetite.
The performance measure for our Group long-term incentive plan is Total Shareholder Return the combination of share price growth and dividends paid.
This performance measure ensures that the interests of our executives are closely aligned with those of shareholders.
Rewarding strong performance The financial results presented earlier in this Annual Report show that the Group delivered increases in new business profits, IFRS profits and cash generation during 2011.
This growth outstripped both the stretching targets set by the Committee at the start of 2011 and market expectations, notwithstanding challenging global market conditions.
These results were achieved whilst maintaining better than adequate levels of capital and working within the Groups risk appetite.
The 2011 bonuses awarded to executive directors recognise this outstanding achievement.
Our 2011 results built on the strong performance over recent years which has delivered significant value to our shareholders.
Over the last three financial years, Prudentials share price and dividend payments have grown: 1 invested in Prudential in January 2009 was worth more than 2 at the end of December 2011.
This return for shareholders has significantly outperformed that produced by our peers in the international insurance industry.
Since the growth of our share price and dividend payments relative to an index of our peers determines the vesting of Group Performance Share Plan awards, the awards made in 2009 will be released in full.
Reviewing the structure of remuneration for the future The structure of remuneration arrangements for Prudentials executive team has remained substantially unchanged since 2006.
During the course of 2012, the Remuneration Committee will undertake a review of these arrangements to ensure that the Groups reward structure continues to give the Company a competitive advantage in the international talent market and that it aligns the pay of executives with the Groups business strategy and ambitions.
This review will take account of the new regulatory requirements of Solvency II and evolving guidelines, regulations and legislation.
Information about any resulting proposals and changes will be provided in the Committees report for 2012.
The UK Government has put forward proposals aimed at increasing the information available to shareholders in the remuneration report.
We have anticipated the likely changes and, in the spirit of transparency, have included additional information on the compensation for our directors in 2012 in this years report.
You will see that we are continuing to ensure that our total remuneration packages remain competitive.
The structure of remuneration for 2012 is substantially the same as that in 2011 and it will reward the delivery of the Groups business priorities and returns to shareholders.
I trust that you will support the policies outlined in our 2011 report.

3 In 2009 and 2010 a scrip dividend equivalent and in 2011 a DRIP dividend equivalent was accumulated on these awards.
4 The table above reflects the maximum number of shares 150 per cent of the original awarded which may be released to Mike Wells under the JNL Performance Share Plan.
This maximum number of shares may be released if stretch performance targets are achieved.
5 At 31 December 2011, Prudentials TSR performance was 168.7 per cent of the TSR performance of the peer index.
On this basis, it is anticipated that awards granted under this plan in 2009 will vest in full.
This will result in 120,898 shares vesting for Rob Devey, 92,022 shares for Michael McLintock, 316,328 shares for Nic Nicandrou, 196,596 shares for Barry Stowe and 299,074 shares for Tidjane Thiam under this plan.
Dividend equivalents will be released on these vested shares.
6 At 31 December 2011, the performance period of the 2009 BUPP awards came to an end.
Over the performance period the new business profit, IFRS profit and cash remittance achieved by the Asian business meant that it is anticipated that 86.50 per cent of the award will vest.
This will result in 170,055 shares being released to Barry Stowe under this plan.
Since the UK BUPP uses the same TSR performance measure as the GPSP, it is anticipated that 120,897 shares will be released to Rob Devey under this plan.
No current executive director participated in the 2009 JNL BUPP.
Business-specific cash-based long-term incentive plans Details of all outstanding awards under cash-based long-term incentive plans are set out in the table below.
The performance period for all M&G Executive LTIP awards is three years while the performance period for all JNL LTIP awards is four years: Face value of Face value of conditional conditional awards share awards outstanding at Conditionally Payments outstanding at 1 January awarded made 31 December Date of end of Year of initial 2011 in 2011 in 2011 2011 performance award 000 000 000 000 period Michael McLintock M&G Executive LTIP 2008 1,141 2,990 31 Dec 10 M&G Executive LTIP 2009 1,830 1,830 31 Dec 11 M&G Executive LTIP 2010 987 987 31 Dec 12 M&G Executive LTIP 2011 1,318 1,318 31 Dec 13 Total cash payments made in 2011 2,990 Mike Wells JNL LTIP 2007 699 858 31 Dec 10 JNL LTIP 2008 756 756 31 Dec 11 JNL LTIP 2009 894 894 31 Dec 12 JNL LTIP 2010 906 906 31 Dec 13 Total cash payments made in 2011 858 Note Under the M&G Executive LTIP, the value of each unit at award is 1.
The value of units changes based on M&Gs profit growth and investment performance over the performance period.
For the 2008 award of 1,141,176 units, the unit price at the end of the performance period was 2.62.
This resulted in a payment of 2,989,881 to Michael McLintock.
For the 2009 award of 1,830,189 units, the unit price at the end of the performance period was 2.96, which will result in a payment of 5,417,359 to Michael McLintock during 2012.
In the 2010 Annual Report, the value shown for Michael McLintocks 2010 M&G Executive LTIP award was the expected value rather than the face value of the award.
This has been amended in the table above.
See page 142 for a description of the JNL LTIP.
Performance over the period from 2007 to 2010 resulted in a payment of 857,617 to Mike Wells in 2011.
Performance over the period from 2008 to 2011 will result in a payment of 826,975 to Mike Wells during 2012.
The awards above were made before Mike Wells became an executive director.
Mike Wells was not made a 2011 JNL LTIP award and it is anticipated that no further awards will be made to him under this Plan.
The sterling face value of Mike Wells JNL LTIP awards have been calculated using the average exchange rate for the year in which the grant was made.
The face value of conditional share awards outstanding on 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2011 was $5,600,000 and $4,200,000 respectively.
