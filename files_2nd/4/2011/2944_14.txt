2011 Bonus Plan In 2011, Executive Directors had the opportunity to earn up to 100 per cent of their basic salary through the bonus plan comprising up to 25 per cent for personal objectives and 75 per cent for financial objectives.
Awards under the personal element are based on delivery against clear objectives closely aligned to the strategic aims of the Company.
The personal objectives of the Executive Directors were agreed by the Remuneration Committee at their 2 December 2010 meeting and assessed at 23 February 2012 to establish the extent to which they had been met.
The objectives and a summary of the extent to which they were met are shown below and resulting bonuses are shown in the table above.
John McDonough Progress the Groups strategy in line with the Groups published objectives including the rescaling of the UK Construction business and supporting growth in the Groups international businesses and UK support services.

The financial element is determined by outstanding performance against stretching targets based on growth in earnings per share.
The 2011 Bonus Plan limits the amount of any award that may be taken in cash to 50 per cent of the bonus earned overall.
The balance is deferred into shares of the Company that are held in trust and vest after two years.
The number of shares allocated is determined by the price prevailing at the date of bonus award and, by using this mechanism, the value individuals receive at the point of vesting is aligned to the value delivered to shareholders over the same period.
The bonuses awarded to the Executive Directors in respect of 2011 are shown in the remuneration table above half of these benefits being paid in cash in 2012 and the balance deferred to March 2014 except as noted above.
Tax and National Insurance is calculated on the deferred element based on the value of the shares at the vesting date and paid at that point.
For bonuses in respect of 2012 onwards the requirement to defer extends to three years with a claw-back provision that allows the Group to recover all or part of the deferred element of the bonus in relation to circumstances of corporate failure over the three-year deferral.
Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 51 Similar deferral mechanisms excluding claw-back have operated in respect of earlier years.
During 2011 the following deferred bonus shareholdings vested: Bonus year Number of shares Richard Adam 2008 108,800 Richard Howson 2009 14,337 John McDonough 2008 168,640 The price prevailing on the above shares at the date of award was 250 pence 2008 bonus and 318.6 pence 2009 bonus.

Pension benefits In April 2009, the Company closed the Carillion B and Staff Pension Schemes to future accrual and the Executive Directors who were members of this scheme became deferred pensioners, their deferred benefits being based on pensionable salary and service at the date of closure.
Pension accrual in respect of service after 2009 has been on a defined contribution basis and benefits are delivered through the Carillion 2009 Pension Plan.
This is a trust-based, contracted-in defined contribution plan set up for former members of the closed defined benefit schemes.
Pension benefits for Executive Directors who were not members of the defined benefit arrangements are delivered through the Carillion Pension Plan which is also a trust based, contracted-in defined contribution arrangement.
Defined benefit pensions accruing during 2011 to Executive Directors in their capacity as Directors of Carillion plc are set out below.

Executive Directors are required to pay 10 per cent of the earnings cap.
As Richard Adam had used all of his Life Time Allowance on tax free pension accrual at April 2011, he elected to receive the contribution the Group would have made to the Carillion Pension Plan on his behalf as a taxable allowance instead, as provided for in the terms of his contract.
The contributions made to defined contribution pension plans on behalf of the Directors are set out in the table below.

The Company agreed with the Trustees of the Carillion pension schemes to continue to operate an earnings cap after April 2006 when the external cap was removed.
The Carillion cap commenced at the level of 110,000 for the tax year 2006-07 and rose in line with the published increases in HMRCs Life Time Allowance up until 2011 in line with the table below.
Future increases are at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Year Cap 2010-11 132,700 2011-12 132,700 All the Executive Directors will be subject to this cap on salary in respect of their pensionable pay.
Bonus and other benefits received by Executive Directors do not count towards pensionable pay.
In addition, a salary supplement of 33.6 per cent is paid in respect of earnings over the internal cap in place of the contributions the Company would have made towards pension provision had the cap not been in place.
Salary supplements are taxed at source.
No compensation was provided in respect of the change to the Annual Allowance effective from 6 April 2011: the pension benefit structure for Executive Directors remains unchanged.
To the extent that the joint contributions to the pension plans exceed 50,000 for individuals and they consent to the arrangement, the Company will divert excess contributions into gross pay subject to tax and national insurance contributions.
