The Remuneration Committee is committed to establishing appropriate, open and transparent remuneration policies.
These are a key element in driving business performance and in aligning the interests of senior management and shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee sets the profit targets and performance objectives for the bonus scheme and for the equity incentive schemes, taking into account the guidelines of investor bodies, shareholder views and the need to drive the business forward successfully.
The key elements of the remuneration of an executive director are set out below.
There is a strong link between business performance and remuneration because the performance-linked elements depend on the performance of the Company.
Bonus payments are only made to the extent that the profit target is met and individual objectives are achieved.
No bonus payments are made if the minimum profit target is not achieved.
Awards under the equity incentive schemes will vest only if the Companys share price increases by more than a given percentage whilst market volatility can affect the share price, ultimately it is successful business performance which drives the share price on a long-term basis.
The Committee takes account of the wider economic environment in making its decisions.
In December 2011 the Committee decided to defer its review of basic salaries to take account of the current economic climate.
At its February 2012 meeting the Committee decided that from 2013 the effective date of the annual salary review should be moved from 1 January to 1 April to facilitate clearer alignment between performance and salary reviews.
Gerard Ryan joined as Chief Executive Officer Designate on 17 January 2012 and the terms of his remuneration were approved by the Committee in line with the current policy.
His initial awards under the Performance Share Plan and the Approved Company Share Option Plan the CSOP will together have a value of 150% of his basic salary, which is the maximum awarded to a new executive director at initial appointment.
For future years the normal annual limit of 100% of basic salary will apply.

Introduction This is the Directors Remuneration Report of International Personal Finance plc the Company which has been prepared pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 420 of the Companies Act 2006 the Companies Act and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008.
In accordance with Section 439 of the Companies Act, a resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the annual general meeting AGM of the Company to be held on 24 May 2012.
The detail in this report sets out how the remuneration principles have been applied in 2011.
Unaudited information The following information, comprising details of the Remuneration Committee, the statement of the Companys policy on directors remuneration, the directors service agreements and the performance graph, is unaudited.
The Remuneration Committee Members Throughout 2011 the Committee consisted of John Lorimer and Nicholas Page under the Chairmanship of Tony Hales.
Further details are set out in the report on the Remuneration Committee in the corporate governance statement.
Other matters Kepler Associates Kepler has been formally appointed by the Committee as its remuneration adviser.
Kepler is independent and does not provide any other services to the Group.
The fees paid to Kepler in respect of work carried out in 2011 totalled 41,935.
The Chief Executive Officer normally attends and speaks at meetings of the Committee other than when his own remuneration or any matter relating to him is being considered.
No director is involved in determining his her own remuneration.
The Company Secretary, Rosamond Marshall Smith, is Secretary to the Committee and attended the meetings of the Committee in 2011: as a solicitor she provides legal and technical support to the Committee.
The Human Resources Director Helen Thornton also attended the meetings of the Committee and provides advice to the Committee.
60 International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 IPF01 005 | AR 2011 | 07 03 2012 | Proof 8 IPF01 005 | AR 2011 | 07 03 2012 | Proof 8 Directors Remuneration Report Statement of the Companys policy on directors remuneration Key principles of the remuneration policy The remuneration policy applied by the Committee: is cognisant of the need to attract, motivate and retain talent via remuneration at appropriate market levels: and recognises the need for prudence and effective risk management in its reward structures.
The remuneration policy is therefore founded on the following principles: target total remuneration reflecting effective performance will be around market median, with reference to an assessment of comparable positions from a cross-section of companies drawn from a combination of: relevant broad equity index, similar market capitalisation and broadly comparable sectoral profile: where performance has been demonstrated at a consistently high level, total remuneration above market median will be appropriate to attract and retain key talent: the fixed component of remuneration should be sufficient to allow for a fully flexible bonus plan: there will be no minimum bonus guarantees: flexible elements of total remuneration at executive director and senior management level are designed to ensure clear links to long-term performance, with suitably demanding targets aligned with the objective of creating sustainable shareholder value.
This means that a significant proportion of bonus will be deferred, and all sharebased incentives will be subject to an appropriate vesting period, as determined by the Remuneration Committee: no element of remuneration will be designed or applied in a way that is inconsistent with the Companys values and goals, or in a way that encourages the taking of inappropriate risk: and remuneration plans will be straightforward and easy to administer.
It is the Committees policy to consult with major shareholders before making significant changes to the remuneration policy.
Annual salary, benefits and fees The executive directors remuneration consists of a basic salary, an annual bonus subject to performance conditions and with a deferred share element, participation in a long-term incentive plan and other benefits, namely pension contributions, life insurance of four times basic salary at date of death, a car allowance and long-term disability cover.
Medical cover is provided for the executive directors and their immediate families.
Benefits in kind are not pensionable.
The Committee normally reviews the executive directors remuneration annually with effect from 1 January.
In December 2011 the Committee decided that, in view of the current economic climate, the effective date of the annual salary review should be deferred until 1 March 2012.
In making this decision the Committee took into account the pay and employment conditions within the Group and the fact that the annual review of salaries within the Group was being deferred until 1 March 2012.
At its February 2012 meeting the Committee decided to maintain the Finance Directors salary at its current level.
It also decided that from 2013 the effective date of the annual salary review should be moved from 1 January to 1 April to facilitate clearer alignment between performance and salary reviews.
The weighted average of the Chief Executive Officers basic salary to average median employee basic salary is: Czech Group UK Poland Republic Slovakia Hungary Mexico Romania 23 8 21 23 28 21 33 27 W eighting takes account of purchasing power in Central Europe, Mexico and Romania.

Their business expenses are reimbursed by the Company.
The basic non-executive fee is 50,000 a year.
The Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee receives an additional 15,000 and the Senior Independent Director Chairman of the Remuneration Committee receives an additional 20,000 a year.
The Chairmans salary was reviewed in May 2011 following consideration of market comparables and increased to 170,000 a year.
Bonus and Deferred Share Plan An annual bonus of up to a maximum of 100% of salary is payable to the executive directors by reference to pre-tax profit and achievement of individual performance conditions which include, where applicable, appropriate environmental, social and governance matters provided a minimum profit target is achieved.
The bonus does not form part of pensionable earnings.
For 2011 a balanced scorecard approach was used whereby 50% of the bonus was calculated on pre-tax profit and, subject always to a minimum profit threshold, the remaining 50% calculated against stretching performance objectives based on the following areas: growth and development: culture and leadership: operational effectiveness: people: customer experience: and brand and reputation.
Awards for achievement of performance objectives are expressed as a percentage of the award for profit and so will scale up or down according to the profit achievement.
No bonus is payable unless a minimum profit threshold is achieved.
The bonus is payable partly in cash, and partly in deferred shares which will vest at the end of a three-year period, subject to the director not being dismissed for misconduct, under the International Personal Finance plc Deferred Share Plan the Deferred Share Plan.
There are also provisions for clawback in the event of a restatement of the Companys accounts or material misjudgement of performance.
The Committee believes that this deferral into shares strengthens the alignment with shareholders interests.
The Deferred Share Plan was amended by the Company in general meeting on 11 May 2011 to include a matching element.
The match would be one-for-one for executive directors and one-for-three for the Senior Management Group.
Matching awards will vest only to the extent that the performance condition is satisfied, namely growth in TSR on the same basis as for the International Personal Finance plc Performance Share Plan as set out in the section Performance Share Plan below.
Equity Incentive Schemes In addition to the Deferred Share Plan, the Company currently operates three equity incentive schemes for directors and employees.
These are: The International Personal Finance plc Performance Share Plan the Performance Share Plan : The International Personal Finance plc Approved Company Share Option Plan the CSOP : and The International Personal Finance plc Employee Savings-Related Share Option Scheme the SAYE Scheme.
Performance Share Plan Executive directors and senior management all participate in this plan.
The policy is for annual awards of up to 100% of basic salary to be made to executive directors and of up to 75% to senior managers.
In the case of the Chief Executive Officer Designate the first grant following his appointment, to be made in March 2012, will be an award of 150% of basic salary less the value of the award to be made under the CSOP.
The awards, generally made as nil cost options over a specific number of shares, will vest after a three-year performance period with vesting determined by absolute TSR performance targets as set out in the table below and by employment conditions.
TSR growth over three-year performance period Percentage of award that will vest Less than 30% growth Nil 30% growth 33% Between 30% and 60% growth Between 33% and 100% on a straight-line basis 60% growth or more 100% 62 International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 IPF01 005 | AR 2011 | 07 03 2012 | Proof 8 IPF01 005 | AR 2011 | 07 03 2012 | Proof 8 Directors Remuneration Report 50% of vested awards will be released after the end of the performance period, with 50% deferred for an additional 12 months.
The Committee believes that absolute TSR is a simple and objective measure of shareholder value creation and appropriate for the Company, given the lack of comparable listed companies.
In addition to meeting the TSR target, for any shares to vest the Committee will need to satisfy itself that the absolute TSR performance is a fair reflection of performance, specifically with regard to the Companys TSR relative to the median TSR of the FTSE 250.
CSOP The CSOP is an HM Revenue & Customs approved scheme.
The use of these options may enable part of a UK-based executive or senior managers rewards from share plans to be received with relief from income tax and national insurance contributions within the thresholds permitted by HM Revenue & Customs, which allows options over shares with a value of 30,000 at the time of option grant to be held by an individual under the CSOP at any time.
Where an individual who receives CSOP share options also participates in an award made under the Performance Share Plan, the award under the Performance Share Plan is scaled back appropriately to reflect the grant of CSOP share options, and grants made under both plans have the same performance conditions for vesting.
SAYE Scheme The executive directors together with other UK Group employees may participate in the SAYE Scheme, which has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs.
Participants save a fixed sum each month for three or five years and may use these funds to purchase shares after three, five or seven years.
The exercise price is fixed at up to 20% below the market value of the shares at the date directors and employees are invited to participate in the scheme.
Up to 250 can be saved each month.
This scheme does not contain performance conditions as it is an HM Revenue & Customs approved scheme open to employees at all levels.
Service agreements Executive directors service agreements provide for both the Company and the director to give one years notice.
No director has a service agreement containing a liquidated damages clause on termination: in the event of the termination of an agreement, the Company seeks mitigation of loss by the director concerned and aims to ensure that any payment made is the minimum which is commensurate with the Companys legal obligations.
Other directorships The Company will normally permit an executive director to hold one non-executive directorship and to retain the fee from that appointment, subject to the prior approval of the Board.
No executive director currently holds such a position.
Shareholding policy Directors and senior managers are expected to acquire over a five-year period from 1 January 2011 or from appointment a beneficial shareholding as follows: Number Category of shares Chairman 45,000 Chief Executive Officer 250,000 Other executive directors 150,000 Non-executive directors 15,000 Senior Management Group 40,000 Other senior managers dependent on seniority 12,000 6,000 Senior management remuneration The Committee also determines the structure and level of pay of the Senior Management Group and Company Secretary.
Half of the Senior Management Group currently have salaries ranging from 125,000 to 150,000 and half have salaries ranging from 150,001 to 195,000. www.

Pensions Background The Company has established two pension schemes.
These are the International Personal Finance plc Pension Scheme the Pension Scheme and the International Personal Finance Stakeholder Pension Scheme the Stakeholder Scheme.
New employees are eligible to join the Stakeholder Scheme.
Following a pensions review, in 2010 the Pension Scheme was closed to future accrual and all the active members became deferred members.
They were offered membership of the Stakeholder Scheme with effect from 1 March 2010. the Pension Scheme is a defined benefit scheme with two sections: cash balance and final salary.
The Company will continue to fund the cash balance pension pot or final salary built up by members up to 28 February 2010.
Benefits will increase from 1 March 2010 until normal retirement date broadly in line with inflation up to a maximum of 5% a year: and the Stakeholder Scheme is managed by Legal & General Assurance Society Limited.
Employees contribute a minimum of 5% and the Company contributes a percentage of basic salary, depending on the employees seniority.
It was also decided by the Committee as part of the pensions review that the standard rate of company pension contribution for any executive director should be 20% of basic salary, but that existing executive directors already receiving higher contributions should continue to do so unless and until it became appropriate to make a change.
At the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, part may be paid as a cash allowance.
