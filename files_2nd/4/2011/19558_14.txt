In the event that the Remuneration Committee proposes to make an upward adjustment, the Remuneration Committee will seek to consult with shareholders in advance.
The Executive Share Option Scheme 2001 the 2001 Scheme The 2001 Scheme was authorised by shareholders at the AGM in 2001 and comprises a scheme approved by HMRC and a schedule under which options which do not fall within the HMRC approval limits may be granted.
The 2001 Scheme reached the end of its ten year agreed life span in May 2011, although options granted up to and including May 2011 continue to be exercisable in the normal fashion, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions attaching to them: ie options granted under the 2001 Scheme are normally exercisable not earlier than three years following the date of grant and not later than ten years from the date of grant with exceptions for good leavers.
The exercise of options is subject to the achievement of a performance target related to the increase in the Companys earnings per share compared with a stated percentage above inflation, measured by the Retail Prices Index all items RPI over a fixed three year period.
The ability to re-measure performance over a later period if not met within the initial three year period was removed in 2004 subject to one transitional grant whereby the performance could, if necessary, be re-measured over an extended period of four years.
Options are currently satisfied by the issue of new shares within the ABIs dilution limits.
The performance target that applies to options granted between 2001 and 2005 requires that the Companys earnings per share must increase over the period of three consecutive financial years by an average of at least 3% p. a. above inflation as measured by the RPI.
Options granted from 2006 onwards are subject to a tiered approach whereby, in respect of any grant, the first one-third of the number of shares under option is subject to the above RPI 3% p. a. target with an escalating performance requirement in respect of the remaining two-thirds as follows: Second one-third of the number of shares RPI 4% p. a.
Final one-third of the number of shares RPI 5% p. a.
As explained above the 2001 Scheme was replaced when it reached the end of its agreed ten year lifespan in May 2011 by the PSP.
The Sharesave Scheme the Sharesave Scheme Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Sharesave Scheme, which is an HMRC approved scheme open to all employees of nominated participating companies who have a minimum of three months service at the date of invitation.
The Sharesave Scheme was adopted by shareholders in 1998 with a ten year life and, following shareholder approval, replaced in 2008 with an updated scheme.
The Sharesave Scheme is linked to a monthly savings contract and options are granted at a maximum 20% discount to market price.
The most recent invitation was limited to three year savings contracts, although the rules currently allow three or five year savings contracts to be offered.
The Share Incentive Plan the SIP At the AGM on 7 May 2003, shareholders approved the introduction of the SIP.
This is a share purchase plan approved by HMRC available to all employees including the Executive Directors.
The SIP is aimed at encouraging employee share ownership and an interest in the Companys performance.
Employees invest in Savills shares by making contributions from their gross salary subject to a current statutory annual limit of 1,500 125 per month.
If the shares are held in the SIP for five years no income tax or NICs are payable when they are released to the participant.
The SIP was launched in May 2004.
There are other elements of the SIP authorised by shareholders but it is not the present intention to offer these elements.
Ordinary shares audited Interests in the share capital of the Company beneficially held by the Directors as at 31 December 2011 are detailed below: At 31 December 2011 31 December 2010 Martin Angle Jeremy Helsby 604,849 604,849 Timothy Ingram 24,000 24,000 Charles McVeigh Simon Shaw 1,091 655 Peter Smith 20,000 20,000 As at 14 March 2012, no Directors have bought or sold shares since 31 December 2011, with the exception of Simon Shaw who participates in the SIP and as such has acquired 105 shares through the SIP since 31 December 2011.
It is the Boards policy that each Executive Director should aim to hold at least 105,000 shares valued at 31 December 2011: 343,980 in the Company except for the Group Chief Executive who should own at least 150,000 shares valued at 31 December 2011: 491,400.
Directors are expected to build holdings to this level over time, principally through the retention of shares released to them after settling any tax due following the vesting of share awards.
Above these limits the Board takes the view that the Directors may retain or sell shares as they see fit.

Performance graph The total shareholder return delivered by the Company over the last five years is shown in the chart below.
Over this period the Company has delivered total shareholder return of -10% per annum FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts : 1% per annum: FTSE 350 Super Sector Real Estate: -17% per annum.
Savills was ranked 136th by performance in the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts and ranked 7th by performance in the FTSE 350 Super Sector Real Estate over the five years to 31 December 2011.
The Directors believe that the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts is the most appropriate index against which to compare total shareholder return TSR over the medium term as it is an index of companies of similar size to Savills.
Savills TSR relative to that of the FTSE 350 Super Sector Real Estate Index is also shown, as this Index better reflects conditions in real estate markets over recent years.
