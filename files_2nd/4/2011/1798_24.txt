Our governance Remuneration report Introductory letter Dear Shareholder I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committees report on Directors remuneration for 2011.
As you are aware, the Committee carried out a comprehensive review of the Companys remuneration arrangements during 2010 and a number of important changes were implemented in 2011 following shareholder consultation and approval.
These were set out in last years report, which received a strong vote in favour at the 2011 AGM.
Whilst we will continue to monitor our remuneration practice to ensure we have the correct alignment with the business strategy, Company performance and shareholder interests, the Committee does not envisage making any further changes at this stage.
This years report sets out the proposed policy for 2012, together with the required disclosures on payments made in 2011.
In this context I would like to stress that we are committed to ensuring that rewards for executives are closely aligned to the interests of shareholders through having share price performance reflected clearly in our long-term incentive programmes.
Also, that all our incentive arrangements are underpinned by challenging performance targets, which are reviewed annually, to ensure that there is a transparent link between performance and reward.
We have also endeavoured to reflect the economic background in which the Company operates and the approach taken on pay for employees across the Group.
With challenging conditions in many of our markets and cost pressures impacting many of our businesses, there is an inevitable focus on remuneration budgets.
However, it is important to strike the right balance between ensuring that the level of remuneration is market competitive and motivational and, at the same time, ensuring it is affordable.
I believe we have set that balance correctly.
As the incoming Committee chairman, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Robert Walvis, who stepped down as chairman in July, for his contribution over the past eight years.
During this time significant changes have taken place in the scale and geographical reach of the Companys operations, the pay market and the scope of governance responsibilities.
Throughout this period, the Company has maintained a balanced and measured approach to pay which has meant that we have been able to recruit and retain the senior management talent we need to successfully achieve our strategy, whilst at the same time maintaining remuneration levels well within market norms.
As the new Committee chairman, my intention is to maintain this philosophy.
I hope you will support the resolution at the AGM seeking approval of this remuneration report.
Yours sincerely Iain Ferguson Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 82 Balfour Beatty Annual report and accounts 2011 Our governance issue for the Company, particularly in relation to the type of Introduction work the Group is engaged in and the need to ensure that in This report has been prepared in accordance with Section 420 of allof its systems and working practices, the highest safety and the Companies Act 2006 and Schedules 5 and 8 of the Large and ethical standards are maintained.

The intermediate points are the spot values on the Companys financial year-ends.
As in previous reports, the RemCo has chosen to compare the TSR on the Companys ordinary shares against the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts principally because this is a broad index of which the Company is a constituent member.

The closing market price on the date of exercise was 312.0p and the value realisable on exercise was382.
It is the Companys current intention that awards will be satisfied by shares purchased in the market.
ii For the awards in April 2009, April 2010 and June 2011, the performance periods are the three years ending 31 December 2011, 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2013 respectively.
50% of each award is subject to an EPS growth target.
The maximum number of shares subject to this performance condition will only vest if EPS growth exceeds the retail prices index RPI by 39% for the April 2009 award and 36% for the April 2010 award and if EPS growth exceeds 45% for the June 2011 award.
If EPS growth exceeds RPI by 9% for the April 2009 award and 6% for the April 2010 award and if EPS growth exceeds 15% for the June 2011 award, then 25% of this part of the awards will vest.
For growth in EPS between these points, vesting will be on a pro-rata basis.
No shares will vest from this part of the award if EPS growth exceeds RPI by less than 9% and 6% for the April 2009 and April 2010 awards respectively or if EPS growth is less than 15% for the June 2011 award.
The other 50% of each award is subject to a total shareholder return TSR target under which the TSR of the Company is compared to a comparator group at the start of the performance period.
For the 2009 and 2010 award, the comparator group was based on a bespoke group of companies as previously disclosed.
For the 2011 award, the comparator group was the FTSE 51-150 excluding investment trusts.
The maximum number of shares subject to this performance condition will only vest if the Companys TSR is in the upper quartile of the comparator group.
If the Companys TSR is equal to that of the median of the comparator group, then 25% of this part of the award will vest.
No shares from this part of the award will vest if the Companys TSR is below that of the median of the comparator group.
For TSR performance between median and upper quartile, vesting will be on a pro-rata basis.
There is no provision for re-testing of either of the performance conditions.
iii The average middle market price of ordinary shares in the Company for the three dealing dates before the award dates, which was used for calculating the number of awards granted, was 449.17p for the 2008 award, 354p for the 2009 award, 302.63p for the 2010 award and 317.78p for the 2011 award.

iv The performance period for the awards made in April 2009 was completed on 31 December 2011.
The growth in EPS for this period did not exceed the RPI 9% required for threshold vesting.
The Companys TSR for this period ranked below the median of the comparator group.
The combined effect of these performance measures is that each participants conditional award will lapse on 15 April 2012. v The performance period for the awards made in April 2008 was completed on 31 December 2010.
The growth in EPS for this period with adjustments in relation to the rights issue for EPS in 2007 and PPP asset disposals and the acquisition of Parsons Brinckerhoff for EPS in 2010 exceeded RPI by 19.75%, exceeding the RPI 15% required for threshold vesting.
The Companys TSR for this period ranked just below the median of the comparator group.
The combined effect of these performance measures is that 18.4% of each participants conditional award vested on 15 April 2011.
Ian Tyler, Duncan Magrath, Andrew McNaughton, Anthony Rabin and Peter Zinkin also received 5,038, 2,460, 2,060, 2,750 and 2,750 shares respectively in lieu of the dividends which would have been payable on the shares which vested.

He has however participated in the defined contribution section of the Fund since 1 January 2011, and the Companys contributions to this arrangement are shown in Note iii to the first table on page 92.
