com Directors Remuneration Report Introduction This Remuneration Report sets out the groups policy and structure for the remuneration of executive and non-executive directors together with details of directors remuneration packages and service contracts.
The report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 Quoted Companies: Directors Remuneration Report to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 and shareholders will be invited to approve this report at the Annual General Meeting on January 26 2012.
Remuneration committee During the year the remuneration committee comprised JC Botts chairman, MWH Morgan, The Viscount Rothermere and DP Pritchard independent.
On May 18 2011, The Viscount Rothermere retired as a member of the committee and DP Pritchard was appointed in his place.
All members of the committee are non-executive directors of the company.
The Viscount Rothermere and MWH Morgan are also directors of Daily Mail and General Trust plc DMGT but have no personal financial interests in the company other than as shareholders, and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
For the year under review, the committee also sought advice and information from the companys chairman, managing director and finance director.
The committees terms of reference permit its members to obtain professional external advice on any matter, at the companys expense, although none did so in 2011.
The group itself can take external advice and information in preparing proposals for the remuneration committee, but no material assistance from a single source was received in 2011.
Remuneration policy The group believes in aligning the interests of management with those of shareholders.
The two consistent objectives in its remuneration policy since the companys inception in 1969 have been the maximisation of earnings per share and the creation of shareholder value.
The first objective is achieved through a comprehensive profit sharing scheme that links the pay of executive directors and key managers to the growth in profits of the group or relevant parts of the group.
This scheme is completely variable with no guaranteed floor and no ceiling.
To support the policy of profit sharing, the group is divided into a number of profit centres.
The manager of each profit centre is paid a profit share related to the profit centres profit growth.
Each profit centre is in turn part of a larger business group and each business group manager has a profit share based on the business groups profit growth.
Profit sharing encourages directors and managers to grow their businesses, to manage costs tightly, to launch new products and to search for acquisitions that would fit well with their businesses.
All executives on profit shares are aware that if profits rise, so does their pay.
Similarly if profits fall, so do their profit shares.
The profit shares of executive directors and senior managers make up much of their total pay.
For example, of the total remuneration of the ten executive directors who served in the year, 89% was derived from profit shares.
The second objective is encouraged through the 2010 Capital Appreciation Plan CAP 2010.
CAP 2010 was approved by shareholders at the 2010 Annual General Meeting and is a highly geared performance-based share option scheme which not only directly rewards the growth in profits of each executives businesses but also links more closely equity reward with the delivery of shareholder value.
CAP 2010 aims to mirror the success of CAP 2004 for both shareholders and employees by delivering exceptional profit growth over the performance period.
Further details of CAP 2010 are set out on page 40.
Shareholders approved CAP 2004 in February 2005.
The CAP 2004 profit target was achieved in 2007, a year ahead of expectations, and exceeded again in both 2008 and 2009 resulting in the second and final tranche of options vesting, subject to the additional performance condition also being met by the individual businesses.
A more detailed explanation of CAP 2004 is given on page 42.

com The company also has an executive share option scheme which was approved by shareholders in January 1996.
The performance criteria under which options granted under this scheme may be exercised are set out on page 43.
This scheme expired in 2006, and no options have been issued under it since February 2004 although options previously granted may be exercised before various dates to February 2014.
The directors believe that these profit sharing and share option arrangements are responsible for much of the companys success since 1969.
These arrangements align the interests of the directors and managers with those of shareholders and are considered an important driver of the companys growth strategy.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the board based on the time commitment required by the non-executive, their role and market conditions.
The remuneration of the groups employees is reviewed on an annual basis with consideration given to local pay conditions, an individuals performance and the performance of the business that employs them.
The remuneration committee approves the overall remuneration increases for employees and in addition reviews the remuneration structure and value of senior management and key employees.
Remuneration of executive directors It is the groups policy to construct executive remuneration packages such that a significant part of a directors compensation is based on the growth in the groups profits contributed by that director.
The details of the remuneration packages of individual directors are set out below.
Base salary and benefits The base salary and benefits are generally not the most significant part of a directors overall compensation package.
Each executive director receives a salary, which is usually below the market average, which is reviewed annually by the remuneration committee.
Certain non-cash benefits are also provided including private health care and life assurance.
Pension Each UK-based director is entitled to participate in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme a defined benefit scheme, closed to new directors, the Euromoney Pension Plan a money purchase plan or their own private pension scheme.
Directors based overseas are entitled to participate in the pension scheme arrangements applicable to the country where they work.
Details of pension scheme contributions can be found on page 47 of this report.
There are no other post-retirement benefits.
Profit share The profit sharing scheme links the pay of each executive director to the growth in profits of the businesses that the director manages.
The executive directors have profit thresholds for the businesses for which they are responsible.
These thresholds are set at the time the director takes on responsibility for the businesses concerned, usually based on the profits of the previous 12 months, and are adjusted if such responsibilities change.
The normal profit share arrangement pays up to 1% of profits up to a threshold and then 5% of profits in excess of this threshold.
Some of the directors have schemes which have been in place for a number of years and pay profit shares at slightly higher rates or which are subject to additional thresholds.
The profit shares of the chairman and managing director are based on the adjusted pre-tax post non-controlling interests profit of the group, thereby matching their profit share with the pre-tax return the group generates for its shareholders.
The chairman is entitled to 5.16% 2010: 5.21% of the adjusted pre-tax profit.
The managing director is entitled to 3.05% 2010: 3.08% of the adjusted pre-tax profit up to a threshold of 37.0 million 2010: 35.2 million and an additional 1.14% 2010: 1.16% of the adjusted pre-tax profit in excess of this threshold.

com Directors Remuneration Report continued The finance director receives a profit share linked to the pre-tax adjusted earnings per share EPS of the group.
A fixed sum is payable for every percentage point the EPS is above 11p and an additional fixed sum is payable for every percentage point that EPS is above 20p.
CHC Fordham has an incentive linked to the performance of acquisitions in the period post-acquisition, in addition to his profit share.
JL Wilkinson is responsible for all the groups marketing activities and, in addition to her profit share on the business she runs, receives an incentive based on the growth in the groups subscription and delegate revenues.
Each executive director's profit share is completely variable with no guaranteed floor and no ceiling and is designed to be the most significant part of the executive directors remuneration package.
In the event profits fall from one year to another, there is no clawback of profit share paid in respect of previous years, but the executives profit share will decrease at a faster rate than the rate of reduction in profits of the businesses he she manages.
Each directors profit share is subject to remuneration committee approval, and can be revised at any time if the directors responsibilities are changed.
There is no deferral of profit share, which is paid in full in the December following the year in which it is earned.
The deferral element of the directors' remuneration is achieved through the delayed vesting and additional performance conditions under the CAP 2010.
The table below shows the 2011 percentage split of the fixed and variable elements of each directors remuneration package.

2010 Capital Appreciation Plan CAP 2010 CAP 2010 was approved by shareholders on January 21 2010.
CAP 2010 was a direct replacement for CAP 2004 and no further awards may be granted under CAP 2004.
40 20899-04 12 12 2011 Proof 8 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 www.
com Awards were granted under CAP 2010 on March 30 2010 to approximately 200 directors and senior employees who have direct and significant responsibility for the profits of the group.
Each CAP 2010 award comprises two equal elements: an option to subscribe for ordinary shares of 0.25p each in the company at an exercise price of 0.25p per ordinary share: and a right to receive a cash payment.
No individual may receive an award over more than 6% of the award pool.
In accordance with the terms of CAP 2010, no consideration was payable for the grant of the awards.
The award pool comprises 3,500,992 ordinary shares with an option value calculated at date of grant using an option pricing valuation model of 15 million, and cash of 15 million, limiting the total accounting cost of the scheme to 30 million over its life.
The awards will vest in two equal tranches.
The first tranche of awards become exercisable on satisfaction of the primary performance condition, but no earlier than February 2013, and lapse to the extent unexercised by September 30 2020.
The second tranche of awards becomes exercisable in the February following a subsequent financial year in which 1 adjusted pre-tax profits again equal or exceed 100 million increased to 105 million following the acquisition of NDR, but no earlier than February 2014.
The second tranche only vests on satisfaction of the primary performance condition and an additional performance condition.
1 The primary performance condition requires the group to achieve adjusted pre-tax profits of 100 million, from a 2009 base profit of 62.3 million, 1 by no later than the financial year ending September 30 2013 and that profits remain at 100 million or more for a subsequent year following the initial year of vesting.
Following the acquisition of NDR, the profit target for the second tranche of awards has been increased by 5 million to 105 million.
1 The primary performance condition was achieved in financial year 2011, two years earlier than expected, when adjusted pre-tax profits were 101.3 million.
However, the internal rules of the plan were modified to prevent the awards vesting more than one year early so although the primary condition has been achieved the award pool will be allocated between the holders of outstanding awards by reference to their contribution to the growth in profits of the group from the 2009 base year to the profits achieved in financial year 2012 and these awards are expected to become exercisable in February 2013.
The additional performance condition, applicable for the vesting of the second tranche of the award, requires that the profits of each business in the subsequent vesting period remain at least 75% of that achieved in the year the first tranche of awards become exercisable.
As the initial allocation of awards to participants will be calculated with reference to the profits achieved in financial year 2012, the earliest the additional performance condition can be applied is by reference to the profits achieved in financial year 2013, provided the primary performance condition has been met for a second time in financial year 2012 or 2013.
Thus if the primary performance condition is again met in financial year 2012 the second tranche of awards will not become exercisable until February 2014.
Equally if the primary performance condition is not achieved again until financial year 2013 the second tranche of awards also become exercisable in February 2014.
Thus the CAP 2010 is designed so that profit growth must be sustained if awards are to vest in full.
The number of options received under the share award of CAP 2010 is reduced by the number of options vesting with participants from the 2010 Company Share Option Plan see below and note 25.
The number of options received under CAP 2010 is provisional and reflects managements best estimate taking into consideration the profit forecasts to 2012 of the individual profit centres, the respective weighting of these profits between participants and the offsetting number of options delivered under the CSOP 2010.
The provisional number of options anticipated to be received by the directors for the CAP 2010 are given in the directors share option table on pages 48 to 51.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used to calculate its value are set out in note 25.

com Directors Remuneration Report continued 2010 Company Share Option Plan 2010 CSOP The shareholders approved the 2010 Company Share Option Plan at the AGM on January 21 2010.
The CSOP 2010 plan was approved by HM Revenue and Customs on June 21 2010.
2 Awards were granted under the CSOP 2010 on June 28 2010 to approximately 135 directors and senior employees of the group who have direct and 2 significant responsibility for the profits of the group.
Each CSOP 2010 option enables each participant to purchase up to 4,972 shares in the company 2 at a price of 6.03 per share, the market value at the date of grant.
No consideration was payable for the grant of these awards.
The options will vest and become exercisable at the same time as the corresponding share award under the CAP 2010 providing the CSOP option is in the money at that time and does not vest before June 28 2013.
Once vested the CSOP option remains exercisable for a period of one month and then lapses.
If the CSOP option is not in the money at the time of vesting of the corresponding CAP 2010 share award it continues to subsist and becomes exercisable at the same time as the second tranche of the CAP 2010 share award.
The CSOP has the same performance criteria as that of the CAP 2010 as set out above.
The number of CSOP 2010 awards that will vest proportionally reduces the number of shares that vest under the CAP 2010.
The CSOP is effectively a delivery mechanism for part of the CAP 2010 award.
The CSOP 2 3 2010 options have an exercise price of 6.03, which will be satisfied by a funding award mechanism which is in place and results in the net gain on these options being delivered in the equivalent number of shares to participants as if the same gain had been delivered using CAP 2010 options.
The amount of the funding award will depend on the companys share price at the date of exercise.
2004 Capital Appreciation Plan CAP 2004 The CAP 2004 was approved by shareholders on February 1 2005 and replaced the 1996 executive share option scheme.
Each CAP 2004 award comprises an option to subscribe for ordinary shares of 0.25p each in the company for an exercise price of 0.25p per ordinary share.
In accordance with the terms of CAP 2004, no consideration was paid for the grant of the awards.
The awards vest in three equal tranches.
The first tranche of awards became exercisable on satisfaction of the primary performance condition in 2007, and lapse to the extent unexercised on September 30 2014.
The other two tranches of awards became exercisable following the results achieved in the 2008 and 2009 financial years when the profits exceeded those achieved in 2007 but only to the extent that an additional performance condition was also achieved.
The scheme was potentially 1 available to all employees.
The primary performance condition, broadly, required that the company achieve adjusted pre-tax profits of 57 million by no later than the financial year ending September 30 2008 and remain at least this level for two further vesting periods.
The additional performance condition requires that the profits of the respective participants businesses in the subsequent two vesting periods remain at least 75% of that achieved in the year the primary performance condition was met.
The CAP 2004 profit target was achieved in 2007 and the option pool of a maximum of 7.5 million shares was allocated between the holders of outstanding awards by reference to their contribution to the achievement of the primary performance condition, subject to the condition that no individual had an option over more than 10% of the option pool.
One third of the awards vested immediately.
The primary performance target was achieved again in 2008 and, after applying the additional performance condition, 2,241,269 options from the second tranche of options vested in February 2009.
The primary performance target was achieved again in 2009 and, after applying the additional performance condition, 1,527,152 options from the third final tranche of options vested in February 2010.
The additional performance condition was applied again to profits for financial year 2010 for those individual participants where the additional performance conditions for the second and final tranches had not previously been met and 303,321 options vested in February 2011.
For those individual participants where the additional performance conditions for the second and final tranches have not been met, the vesting is deferred until the profits are at least 75% of that achieved in 2007 but no later than by reference to the year ending September 30 2012.

com The actual value of the second and third tranches of the CAP 2004 award that vested in February 2011 to each director is set out in the directors share option table on pages 48 to 51 and has been trued-up from the estimates provided in last years annual report.
The provisional number of options vesting this year under CAP 2004 for those directors who have options that did not vest under the second and third tranches due to the additional performance test not being satisfied in previous years are also set out in the directors share option table.
The number of options vesting is provisional and will depend on the extent that the additional performance test has been met this year for their respective businesses.
The remuneration committee require the results of the businesses to be reviewed and subsequently modified for true-up adjustments during the period to December 31.
1996 executive share option scheme Some of the executive Directors have options from a previous executive share option scheme approved by shareholders in 1996.
This scheme expired in 2006 and no share options have been issued under it since February 2004 although options granted may be exercised before various dates to February 2014.
These options are exercisable subject to certain performance conditions set by the remuneration committee such that the Total Shareholder Return TSR of the company exceeds that of the average TSR for the FTSE 250 index for the same period.
For the performance condition to be satisfied, the TSR of the company must exceed that of the FTSE 250 on a cumulative basis, measured from the date of grant of the option, in any four out of six consecutive months starting 30 months after the option grant date.
SAYE scheme The group operates an all employee save as you earn scheme in which those directors employed in the UK are eligible to participate.
Participants save a fixed monthly amount of up to 250 for three years and are then able to buy shares in the company at a price set at a 20% discount to the market value at the start of the savings period.
In line with market practice, no performance conditions attach to options granted under this plan.
The executive directors who participated in this scheme during the year were PM Fallon, PR Ensor, NF Osborn, DC Cohen, CR Jones and CHC Fordham, details of which can be found on pages 48 to 51 of this report.
DMGT SIP scheme Daily Mail and General Trust DMGT, the groups parent company, operates a share incentive plan scheme in which all UK-based employees of the Euromoney group can participate.
Employees can contribute up to 125 per month from their gross pay to purchase DMGT A shares.
These shares are received tax free by the employee after five years.
The executive directors who participated in this scheme during the year were PM Fallon, PR Ensor and CR Jones, details of which can be found on page 52 of this report.
1 Adjusted pre-tax profits are before goodwill amortisation and impairment, exceptional items, movements in acquisition option commitment values, imputed interest on acquisition option commitments, foreign exchange gains on losses on tax equalisation contracts on hedges of intra-group financing, foreign exchange loss on restructured hedging arrangements, and the cost of the CAP itself.
2 The Canadian version of the CSOP 2010 has a grant date of March 30 2010 and an exercise price of 5.01, the market value of the companys shares at the date of grant, and enables each Canadian participant to purchase up to 19,960 shares in the company.
3 The net gain on the CSOP options is the market price of the companys shares at the date of exercise less the exercise price 6.032 multiplied by the number of options exercised.

The pension cash accrual represents the sum which would be available on retirement based on service to September 30 2011 to secure retirement benefits, ignoring any increase for future inflation.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Retirement Benefit Transfer Values GN11 published by the Board for Actuarial Standards.
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement include the pension cash accrual and represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of the directors pension benefits.
They do not represent a sum paid or payable to individual directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The pension cash accrual has been included in the increase in transfer value net of directors contributions.
Members of the scheme have the option of paying additional voluntary contributions.
Neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.

As such the actual number of options granted could vary from that disclosed.

If the option is not in the money at the time of vesting of the corresponding CAP 2010 award it continues to subsist and becomes exercisable at the same time as the second tranche of the CAP 2010 share award note 25.
