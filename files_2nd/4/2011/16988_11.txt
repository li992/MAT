The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement, prior to any cash commutation, based on pensionable service to the end of the year.
With effect from 1 October 2008, Government legislation requires the trustees having taken actuarial advice to take responsibility for setting the assumptions underlying the calculation of voluntary transfer values to be paid from the plan.
Prior to this date the scheme actuary had this responsibility.
Consequently, the transfer value of the accrued pension at the year end has been calculated in accordance with this revised requirement.
The change in the amount of the transfer value over the year is made up of the following elements: a. transfer value of the increase in accrued pension b. increase in the transfer value of accrued pension at year start due to ageing c. impact of any change in the economic or mortality assumptions underlying the transfer value basis as referred to in 2. above d. less the directors ordinary contributions 4.
The change in the amount of the transfer value over the year includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Group and directors, such as stockmarket movements: which will be reflected within 3c above.
The inflation measure for leavers during 2011 with at least one year to their normal retirement date was 2.5%.
Consequently, the rate of inflation assumed in the above figures is 2.5%.
Directors have the option to pay voluntary contributions.
Neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.
The figures for Alan Mitchelson allow for the impact of the plan specific earnings cap and his restricted salary for pension accrued from April 2010.
Alan Mitchelson does not have an entitlement to an excepted formerly known as unapproved pension from the Group.
Payment of actual transfer values from the defined benefit scheme of which Alan Mitchelson is a member are not currently reduced below 100% of their full value.
The figures allow for the impact of inflation in accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
