With effect from 6 April 2011 contribution levels were capped at the annual allowance of 50,000 by legislative changes, so a non-pensionable salary supplement was paid to the Executive Directors for the balance.
Mike Wilsons contributions amounting to 63,000 2010: 63,000 were paid as additional salary due to the pensions cap.
No other Directors had any such contributions made on their behalf.
iv For the 2011 annual bonus, Executive Directors could earn up to 80% of salary by reference to the Groups financial performance, largely based on growth in EEV operating profit and the profit from new business, by reference to objectives set by the Committee at the start of the year.
A further payment of up to 40% of salary could be earned by reference to the team performance of the Executive Directors, based on a number of non-financial objectives set at the start of the year by the Committee.
The Committee met in January 2012 to review the performance of the Group and the executives against the objectives set at the start of the year.
As regards the elements of the annual bonus based on EEV operating profit and the profit from new business being the EEV new business contribution plus the profits arising in the distribution company as shown in the segmental analysis, a breakdown of the performance is as follows: In relation to the EEV operating profit, a range had been set requiring delivery of profit of between 355million to 390 million.
Actual EEV operating profit during the year was 371.5 million however, as described in the Financial Commentary on page 17, this result was significantly adversely impacted by the fall in the 10 year UK government gilt yield.
In recognising that the fall in the gilt yield was not reflective of the operating performance of the business, the Committee took this into consideration and set the bonus at 30% out of the maximum 40%.
Had the committee taken the full impact of the adverse movement in the UK gilt yield into account the bonus would have been set at 40%.
In relation to the profit from new business in 2011, a sliding scale had been set requiring profit from new business of between 241 million to 276 million.
Actual profit from new business was 252.1 million 246.0 million from EEV new business contribution and 6.1 million from distribution business, which led to a bonus of 15% out of 40%.
In relation to the team performance element of the bonus, recognising managements very good performance during the year, including a 6% increase in the size of the Partnership and good progress in members of the Partnership passing the necessary professional qualifications in advance of the December 2012 deadline, the Committee determined that 30% out of the maximum 40% should be payable.
Overall, the total bonus payable for the year equated to 75% of salary out of the maximum of 120% of salary.
The Committee is satisfied that this level of bonus is appropriate, and provides a good link to the overall performance of the business and management.
As explained on page 69, half of the annual bonus is paid in cash, with the other half being used to purchase St. Jamess Place shares which are subject to forfeiture for three years under the terms of the Deferred Bonus Scheme.
