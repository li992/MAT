58 | RSA | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Remuneration policy principles The continuing focus of the Committee is on maintaining a strong link between performance and reward.
It is the Committees view that shareholders interests are best served through a remuneration structure which contains a significant element of deferred performance-related pay, supporting the existing Group-wide culture of high performance and accountability, without undue risk.
The key principles which underpin the remuneration policy are consistent with those applied across the Group, namely that: Total remuneration is set at a competitive level which enables the recruitment, retention and reward of high-quality executive talent There is a strong and visible link between remuneration and performance: only exceptional levels of performance will generate exceptional levels of total reward A high proportion of the Executive Directors variable pay is made in the form of shares which aligns their interests with those of shareholders, and this is further strengthened by the share ownership guidelines which are detailed on page 65 A balance of short and long-term performance measurement is used, incorporating appropriate financial and non-financial targets Remuneration policy and practice is transparent to shareholders Where relevant, there is consideration of environmental, governance and social risks when determining remuneration for Executive Directors and senior managers to ensure that positive and appropriate behaviours are reinforced.
The policies relating to each element of remuneration are set out in the table below Remuneration Policy Base salary Base salary is set with reference to equivalent roles in similar companies and the sustained performance of the executive.
Annual incentive plan awards Annual incentive plan awards are related to stretching performance targets and are capped at 160% of base salary.
For maximum bonuses to be achieved, outstanding Company and individual performance must be demonstrated.
Long-term incentive plan awards Conditional share awards are made on an annual basis to ensure alignment with shareholders interests.
Other than in exceptional circumstances, grants of Performance Shares are capped at 150% of salary.
Pension provision and other benefits Employment benefits are set in line with arrangements made in similar companies to be market competitive.
Pension provision is at a level which allows executives to plan effectively for their eventual retirement.
During 2011, the Company announced the resignation of two Executive Directors: Andy Haste and George Culmer, both of whom have made a significant contribution to the success of the business during their respective tenures.
Andy Haste left the Company on 31 December 2011 with the Boards approval, and following significant planning and hand-over to the incoming Group Chief Executive, Simon Lee, in accordance with the Companys succession plan.
Andy was therefore treated as a good leaver in light of his performance and commitment to the Company.
His leaving arrangements include a cash bonus in respect of the 2011 financial year, unvested shares under the long-term incentive plans and a payment to reflect the remaining part of his notice period: further details of these terms are set out in each relevant section of this report.
George Culmer tendered his resignation in November 2011 and he will leave the Company in May 2012 to join Lloyds Banking Group plc.
As a consequence, he did not receive a bonus award in respect of 2011 performance.
He will also forfeit all shares issued to him through the Companys incentive plans that remain unvested at the date his employment ceases.
Annual Report and Accounts 2011 | RSA | 59 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Elements of remuneration Remuneration for Executive Directors in 2012 will consist of the four principal elements described in the table on page 59, of which only base salary is pensionable: Remuneration Purpose Delivery Detail Base salary To reflect the market value Paid in cash on a monthly basis Reviewed annually, changes of the role and the skills, and is pensionable.

The Committee has agreed that a review of the Companys remuneration arrangements will be conducted during 2012, with a particular focus on short and long-term incentives.
This review will seek to implement leading practice, where this is appropriate for the Company, and strengthen the alignment of managements interests with those of shareholders.
It is anticipated that a new long-term incentive plan will be tabled for shareholder approval at the AGM in 2013.

The Committee also has regard to levels of base pay within European and international companies, where appropriate.
