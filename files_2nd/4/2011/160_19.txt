Remuneration report Dear Shareholder, on behalf of the board, i am pleased to present the directors report on remuneration for 2011, for which we will be seeking approval from shareholders at our annual general meeting.
2011 has been a strong year for abg financially, with noticeable improvements in our operations and exciting progress in our exploration activities.
These could not be achieved without the combined effort of our Senior leadership team and our employees.
abgs compensation committee strives to ensure that our remuneration philosophy serves shareholder interests and closely reflects the groups business strategy, whilst also being mindful of the external focus on executive remuneration, including the revised principles of remuneration issued by the association of british insurers and the consultations undertaken by the department of business, innovation and Skills on Executive remuneration and The future of narrative reporting.
reward in the global mining sector is highly competitive.
abgs remuneration The committee is keen to ensure policy seeks to retain and motivate our high performing team and to attract new talent.
The committees expectation is that a significant portion of abgs Executive that we continue to attract, retain director remuneration is based on variable pay components to provide alignment with shareholder expectations.
given the long-term nature of our business, our and motivate the executive talent Executive director remuneration packages are weighted toward long-term incentives required to ensure that we deliver with time horizons of three years, and which payout only if share price growth is strong.
as highlighted in last years report, the committee is aware that some features of the abg senior executive remuneration package, whilst broadly consistent with typical practice in the global mining sector, may not be common amongst large-cap Uk-listed companies.
However, we seek to ensure that abgs remuneration package is consistent with those companies operating in similar business sectors and in MICHAEl KENyON, similar geographic locations to attract, retain and motivate the specific executive cHairman of tHE comPEnSation committEE talent required for the successful delivery of our business strategy.
7 marcH 2012 during 2011, the committee reviewed prospective changes to abgs remuneration policy for improved alignment with Uk remuneration practice.
after considerable discussion, the committee concluded that such changes would only reduce the competitiveness of the abg remuneration package relative to those offered by many of our sector peers and at barrick, our majority shareholder.
consequently, the committee intends to retain much of abgs remuneration structure in its current form in 2012, but will continue to review the structure to ensure it remains appropriate in the context of our specific circumstances.
furthermore, the committee intends to seek shareholder approval at the 2012 agm to amend the companys ltiP rules.
The proposed amendments i provide for clawback in relation to awards granted to Executive directors and ii seek to give greater flexibility in setting vesting periods and the extent to which performance conditions apply for awards granted to other employees.
further details of these amendments are set out on page 104 and have been provided with the agm notice.
