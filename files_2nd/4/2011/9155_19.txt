indd 43 43 14 4 11 14 4 11 12:55:29 12:55:29 King sher plc Annual Report Directors remuneration report 44 and Accounts 2010 11 Alignment with shareholder interests The Committee is recommending a change to the structure of the The Committee proactively consults with its largest shareholders and their long-term incentive scheme and has recommended proposals for representative bodies regarding its remuneration policy to ensure that changes to the Performance Share Plan PSP awards to be made their views are understood and duly taken into account in its deliberations, in 2011.
The revised PSP would grant certain executives an award of particularly in relation to changes in King sher share-based incentive scheme 500% of their annual base salary with shares vesting subject to suitably arrangements and wider trends in executive remuneration.
The interests stretching earnings per share EPS and King sher Economic Pro t of shareholders are also considered when structuring remuneration KEP targets over the three financial years to January 2014.
Annual bonus objectives focus on a mixture of financial and any vesting shares would be released to participants in 2014 with the nonfinancial measures to ensure the operational success of the Group, remaining shares held over for release in 2015.
This award would replace whilst sustained performance is rewarded through incentive measures the 200% annual award with no further awards made under the PSP designed to improve shareholder returns.
Short-term rewards are further to those executives participating in the 2011 award until 2014.
This is aligned with shareholders interests through the compulsory deferral to enable recipients to receive a single award in 2011 in lieu of awards of one-third of annual bonuses into share awards under the King sher which would otherwise have been made in 2011, 2012 and 2013.
This is Incentive Share Scheme the KIS.
Long-term rewards are similarly felt to be both appropriate to incentivise the completion of the recovery aligned with shareholders interests by the requirement that executives programme and in the interests of shareholders as the single award is hold a speci ed percentage of their annual salary in shares of the smaller than the sum of the individual awards would have been.

King sher Economic Pro t KEP 50% of the shares subject to an award will be subject to a KEP target with Planned future changes the following targets: The structure for remuneration for executives for the year 2011 12 was debated by the Committee and remains broadly similar to previous Aggregate KEP over years.

The Committee considers that the total remuneration package links corporate and individual performance with an appropriate balance between short and long-term elements, and xed and variable components.
Table 1 below shows the breakdown of the remuneration package into its main constituent elements and assumes maximum payment of annual bonus and maximum vesting of PSP deferred share awards, the Companys long-term incentive plan.
Table 1 Ian Cheshire Kevin OByrne 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Base salary LTIP Annual bonus Pension & other benets The first chart below gives the proportions of xed cash, variable cash and deferred shares which make up the executive directors salary, bonus and long-term incentive opportunity according to achievement of objectives at stretch.
Fixed cash comprises base salary, whilst variable cash is the 67% of annual bonus paid in cash, and the share element includes the 33% of bonus deferred into shares, and the PSP.
The second chart shows the proportions of base salary, cash and deferred bonus and PSP and indicates the total remuneration at risk.
Remuneration elements split between Fixed and at risk elements of cash and deferred shares at stretch remuneration at stretch Fixed Fixed cash 25% 25% Deferred shares 50% At Risk Variable cash 75% 25% Note: the xed elements in the charts above include pensions and bene ts.
For the purposes of the above, the historic practice of awarding 200% of base salary annually under the PSP is assumed.
The Committee believes that the targets set for the different elements of performance-related remuneration are both appropriate and stretching in the context of the business environment and the challenges with which the Group is faced.
The performance-related remuneration constitutes a substantial proportion of the remuneration package, and is at risk, being subject to achievement of performance hurdles, deferral periods during which the individual must remain employed, and uctuations in the market price of shares.
The maximum bonus payable under the KIS is made up of 133% of salary in cash and 67% in deferred forfeitable shares, and the maximum vesting under the PSP is currently 200% of salary in deferred forfeitable shares.
Accordingly, the maximum awards under the KIS and PSP result in 75% of total remuneration being performance-related.

Base salary Executive salaries are reviewed with effect from January each year and are generally set to be competitive, taking into account the prevailing market and economic conditions, affordability, the level of increases awarded to employees generally and the individuals contribution.
In June 2010 the basic salary of Kevin OByrne was increased by 2.4% to 600,000.
Ian Cheshire proposed that his salary was not reviewed in January 2011 and no further review was applied to Kevin OByrne.
The base salaries of the executive directors as at 23 March 2011 were 816,000 for Ian Cheshire and 600,000 for Kevin OByrne.
Annual bonus The annual bonus is earned by the achievement of performance targets set by the Committee at the start of each financial year and is delivered under the KIS.
The KIS comprises the King sher Cash Incentive Scheme 2003 KIS Cash Scheme and the King sher Incentive Share Scheme 2003 KIS Share Scheme.
Senior executives may receive a performance-related cash bonus under the KIS Cash Scheme, and a contingent share award under the KIS Share Scheme, in the proportions of 67% of the bonuses earned being payable in cash, and 33% in deferred shares.
The vesting of the deferred shares are subject to a three-year holding period, with the shares being subject to forfeiture should the executive leave the Group during the holding period as a result of voluntary resignation or dismissal for cause.
Participants granted deferred shares under the KIS Share Scheme are entitled to receive a dividend equivalent payment in the form of additional deferred shares, which is equal to the value of dividends that would have been earned over the holding period.
These additional shares are conditional upon the original deferred shares vesting.
The award of deferred shares is subject to a claw back provision, whereby unvested deferred shares previously granted under the KIS Share Scheme may lapse if the Committee decides the grant of deferred shares was not justi ed.
Included as an element of a KIS award, individuals now receive a grant under the Company Share Option Plan CSOP an HMRC approved plan, which provides tax and NIC advantages for participants and potential NIC savings for King sher at no additional cost for the Group.
The CSOP is underpinned by a matching xed value element of the KIS, however, the value of the total award remains unchanged.
The maximum bonus is considered in the light of market practice for companies of a similar size and industry sector.
The maximum bonus payable is 200% of base salary, which remains unchanged from last year.
The executive directors targets for the 2010 11 bonus were based on both corporate and individual objectives and were structured equally between financial and nonfinancial measures as in the previous year as set out below.

The PSP currently runs over a period of three years and has performance hurdles requiring King shers Total Shareholder Return TSR to exceed median level of TSR measured against the FTSE 100, and adjusted Earnings Per Share EPS.
Relative TSR was considered as a valid benchmark as it measures the performance of executives in terms of delivery of shareholder return against that of other businesses.
The Committee chose the FTSE 100 as the comparator group because of the general lack of directly quoted home improvement businesses against which to compare the Companys TSR speci cally.
HNBS independently carries out the relevant TSR calculations for the Committee.
This relative measure is coupled with EPS as a driver for absolute performance.
The TSR and EPS performance targets for all PSP awards in 2010 11 are set out in the notes to the PSP awards table on page 50.
Shares delivered on the vesting of an award receive a dividend roll-up calculated on the basis of a notional purchase of shares on each relevant ex-dividend date using that days closing mid-market price.
Shares used to satisfy awards under the PSP are normally purchased in the market by the King sher Employee Bene t Trust.
As described earlier in this report, the Committee has reviewed the appropriateness of the quantum and performance measures under the PSP during the year and subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General meeting on 16 June 2011, awards in 2011 12 will be made on the basis set out on page 44.
Other long-term incentive plans Apart from the Sharesave Option Scheme and those described above, all other option and incentive arrangements for executive directors have been discontinued, but awards made under these schemes in previous years will vest over time in accordance with the rules governing the various plans.
The details are shown in the section entitled Closed Incentive Plans on page 51.
Pension provision Ian Cheshire is a member of the main fide ned bene t arrangement, the King sher Pension Scheme, and subject to the scheme cap currently 123,600.
Following his appointment as Group Chief Executive, Ian Cheshire also receives a 30% Company contribution, on his base salary above the pension cap, into fide ned contribution arrangements.
Kevin OByrne commenced employment after the fide ned bene t section had closed to new members and thus is a member of the fide ned contribution arrangements and receives a Company contribution of 20% of base salary.
Other bene ts Each executive director is entitled to a car or car allowance, an allowance for financial planning, medical insurance, life insurance equivalent to four times salary, a subsidised staff canteen, a staff discount card and 30 equivalent working days holiday per year.
