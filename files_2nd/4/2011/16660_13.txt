REMUNERATION POLICY FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The remuneration policy of the Company aims to establish a remuneration structure for executive Directors and other senior managers in the Group which: attracts and retains high calibre executives: aligns managements interests with those of shareholders, by incentivising management to enhance shareholder value: and fosters a high performance culture, linking a substantial portion of remuneration to performance by providing management with the opportunity to earn competitive remuneration through variable based pay.

The Committee takes into account the pay and employment conditions of other Group employees when determining Directors remuneration, particularly when determining base salary increases.
The Committee also obtains information on the remuneration paid for comparable roles at other companies to provide a point of reference for determining remuneration policy.
The Committee is cognisant of the need to ensure that the remuneration policy is firmly linked to the Groups strategy, including its risk management philosophy.
As all the non-executive Directors serve as members of both the Audit and Remuneration Committees, each Committee benefits from the Directors experience on the other.
This is particularly relevant when the Remuneration Committee is considering matters such as the Groups achievement of performance conditions and the implications for the Groups risk profile of the award of incentives under the Groups remuneration programmes.
The Committee considers the Groups executive remuneration policy and incentive structure to be compatible with the Groups risk management and internal control systems.
The Board has set a strategy with the objective to grow earnings in both the short-term and longer-term with the intention of delivering above average shareholder returns in the medium to long term.
This strategy is underpinned by the three-year plan which translates the strategy into operational targets.
These key operational targets focus on growing annual revenue in excess of global GDP growth, achieving a higher return on sales margin and growing annual headline earnings, so that the Group can grow dividend payments and ensure that its return on investment is increasingly ahead of the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
At the same time the Group seeks to maintain a strong financial position with a leverage ratio of not more than 1.5 times at each year-end.
The remuneration policy incentivises and rewards executives to deliver their contribution to the achievement of the Groups strategy, with more than half of the executive Directors total remuneration based on the variable, performance-related elements of the Annual Incentive and the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The performance conditions under these arrangements support the Groups focus on growth in profit and shareholder returns by targeting key business imperatives such as Headline earnings represented by Headline profit attributable to owners of the parent, as shown on page 69, relative Total Shareholder Return TSR, defined as the increase in the value of a share, including reinvested dividends, and Headline earnings per share Headline EPS, as defined in note 4.5.
The inclusion of a working capital performance target in the Groups Annual Incentive further supports the Groups objective to maintain a strong financial position by reducing leverage.
These targets are objective, auditable and transparent and as such are considered to be appropriate performance measures for management.
To ensure that their interests are aligned with those of shareholders, executive Directors are required to build a significant stake in the Company in accordance with the Companys share retention guidelines.
At the year-end, all executive Directors substantially exceeded this shareholding guideline.
The Committee evaluates the efficacy of the Groups executive remuneration policy each year and commissions more formal reviews as it considers appropriate.
The review in 2010 resulted in the implementation of clawback arrangements for the executive Directors, divisional CEOs and Group Secretary to take effect from the 2011 Annual Incentive and LTIP awards, and resulted in an amendment to the mechanism used for setting the EPS targets for the LTIP from a percentage growth target to an absolute EPS target.
Further details about these changes are given below.
Following the Committees review in 2011, no further changes were made to the policy and structure of remuneration for the executive Directors.
It is anticipated that the Groups existing remuneration policy and structure, as outlined below, will therefore continue in 2012.
CLAWBACK ARRANGEMENTS The executive Directors, divisional CEOs and Group Secretary are subject to clawback arrangements.
In the event that a misstatement is identified in the Groups consolidated financial statements which requires the restatement of a prior years accounts in order to ensure compliance with the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards, then any variable executive remuneration resulting from the misstatement would be subject to clawback provisions at the discretion of the Committee.
These arrangements are to be applied in respect of the 2011 Annual Incentive, the 2011 LTIP awards, and their respective equivalents in future years.
DIALOGUE WITH SHAREHOLDERS The Company is committed to open and transparent dialogue with its shareholders on remuneration as well as other matters.
As a matter of course the Committee consults with key institutional shareholders and various representative bodies about the incentive arrangements of the Companys executive Directors.
During the latter part of 2011, the Committee Chairman and Secretary met with the Groups largest shareholders to discuss the Groups remuneration programme.
This included soliciting shareholders views on remuneration proposals for 2012 and providing an update on the operation of the Groups incentive programmes.
In addition, the opportunity was taken to discuss governance matters.

The Executive Directors are also eligible to receive certain benefits in kind.
These principally comprise company car allowances, life assurance and medical insurance.
These benefits are similar to those provided to other Group executives in the UK and Belgium.
co. uk 41 KEY FEATURES OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION BASE SALARY Salary levels are reviewed annually and any increase takes account of the individuals contribution and experience, and the Groups financial performance.
The Committee also considers the pay environment for employees within the Group and the level of salaries paid in similar companies.
As reported in last years Directors Remuneration Report, in 2011 Messrs Salmon and Wanecq were awarded salary increases of 2.5% in line with increases paid to other Group executives, and Mr Butterworth was awarded an increase of 4.5%.
The broad budget for salary increases for 2012, throughout the Groups global operations, ranged between 1.5% and 18%, with the latter figure reflecting the impact of wage inflation in certain countries.
The standard UK increase within the Group is expected to be between 2.5% and 4%.
In light of the prevailing economic climate, the Committee decided that no salary increases should be awarded to executive Directors in 2012.
Accordingly, Messrs Butterworth, Salmon and Wanecqs salaries remain at 334,160, 540,105 and 632,528 respectively.
ANNUAL INCENTIVE In line with the Groups other senior executives, the executive Directors are eligible to receive an Annual Incentive calculated as a percentage of base salary and based on achievement against specified financial targets.
Each year the Committee establishes the financial performance criteria for the forthcoming year.
These criteria are set by reference to the Groups financial budget and prior year actual financial results.
The target range is set to ensure that maximum bonuses are only paid for significantly exceeding market expectations.
The Committee considers that the setting and attainment of these targets is important in the context of achievement of the Groups longer-term strategic goals.
The annual incentive has a threshold level of performance below which no award is paid, a target level at which executive Directors are entitled to a payment equal to 50% of their base salary and a maximum performance level at which a maximum award is earned.
Mr Salmons maximum Annual Incentive potential is 150% of base salary, and Messrs Butterworths and Wanecqs is 100% of base salary.
Any payout for Mr Salmon over 100% of salary is payable in deferred shares under the rules of Cooksons Deferred Share Bonus Plan further information about this Plan is given on page 44.
These shares vest on the third anniversary of their award date, although they will lapse if Mr Salmon ceases employment with the Company before the end of the three-year period other than in certain circumstances permitted under the Plan rules, such as retirement.
For the financial year 2011, the executive Directors Annual Incentives were based on Group Headline earnings performance, the calculation of which is shown in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.
Messrs Butterworths and Salmons Annual Incentives were assessed solely against this criterion, whilst half of Mr Wanecqs Annual Incentive was assessed against this criterion and the remainder based upon the divisional trading profit of the Engineered Ceramics division adjusted for performance against a key operating cash flow target.
For 2011, the Groups performance was above the Headline earnings threshold, but below the target and the Engineered Ceramics divisions performance was below the Headline earnings threshold: Target Achieved Incentive Paid Name Measure Weighting Performance % of salary % of salary Mike Butterworth Group Headline earnings 100% 199.6m 36.25% 36.25% Nick Salmon Group Headline earnings 100% 199.6m 36.25% 18.51% Franois Wanecq Group Headline earnings 50% 199.6m 18.13% 18.13% 1 Franois Wanecq Engineered Ceramics trading profit 50% 225.6m 0% 0% 1 Before allocation of central corporate costs.
Note: Any Annual Incentive payable to Mr Wanecq in respect of the trading profit of the Engineered Ceramics division is subject to an adjustment of - 5% subject to the achievement of the divisional working capital target.
To put the above performance conditions into perspective, the 2010 Group Headline Earnings was 169.8m and the Engineered Ceramics divisions trading profit before allocation of central corporate costs was 184.8m.
At the time the performance conditions were set in December 2010, analysts consensus for 2011 was for Headline earnings of 185.2m.
An Annual Incentive equivalent to 36.25% of base salary will therefore be paid to Mr Butterworth for 2011 and 18.13% of base salary to Mr Wanecq.
Given the marked deterioration in the performance of the US Precious Metals Processing business necessitating a substantial headcount reduction ahead of its disposal, Mr Salmon volunteered to waive part of his annual bonus entitlement.
Mr Salmon will therefore receive an annual bonus equivalent to 18.51% of base salary for 2011.
These annual bonus payments are reported in the Directors remuneration table on page 47. cooksongroup.
com 20769-04 13 01 2012 Skeleton 2 Our F Our F Our Financials inancials inancials Our G Our G Our Go o ov v ver er ernanc nanc finance e e Our Business Our Business Our Business Cookson Group plc 42 Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT The Committee has determined that for 2012 Messrs Butterworths and Salmons Annual Incentives will again be based on Group Headline earnings, but this year they will also incorporate an adjustment based upon the Groups working capital performance, to focus greater attention on cash flow performance.
The effect of this will be to reduce the level of payout that the Directors can achieve by up to 10% if specified working capital targets are not attained.
The adjuster can increase the level of payout by up to 10%, but not above the usual plan maximum.
Mr Wanecqs Annual Incentive will continue to be based 50% on the aforementioned Group Headline earnings target adjusted for working capital and 50% on the Engineered Ceramics divisions trading profit again adjusted for working capital.
Their maximum incentive potential will remain unchanged at 150% of salary for Mr Salmon and 100% of salary for Messrs Butterworth and Wanecq.
In the past five years, Messrs Butterworth, Salmon and Wanecq have invested 916,662, 1,496,850 and 1,671,345 respectively of their gross cash Annual Incentive payments, representing 88%, 83% and 92% respectively of their total Annual Incentive payments in the Companys shares in order to participate in the Matching Share element of the Groups Long-Term Incentive Plan.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN LTIP The LTIP rewards executives for delivering superior TSR, defined as the increase in the value of a share, including reinvested dividends, and Headline EPS growth over a set period of time, and as such is intended to align executive remuneration with shareholders interests.
The LTIP has two elements: firstly, executive Directors are eligible to receive a conditional annual allocation of shares worth up to 100% of base salary Performance Shares : secondly, executive Directors can elect to invest all or part of their Annual Incentive in ordinary shares of the Company Investment Shares in return for which they receive a conditional allocation of shares worth up to 2.25 times the pre-tax equivalent of the Annual Incentive so invested Matching Share Award.
The Chief Executives maximum investment in the Matching Share element of the LTIP is capped at an annual bonus equivalent to 100% of base salary.
In addition to the executive Directors, senior divisional and corporate executives are allocated Performance Shares under the LTIP and members of the Groups Executive Committee and senior corporate executives are also given the opportunity to participate in the Matching Share element.
In 2011, each executive Director received an award under the LTIP equal to 100% of salary, as shown on pages 47 and 48.
In accordance with the rules of the LTIP, Messrs Butterworth, Salmon and Wanecq chose to use more than three-quarters of their cash based Annual Incentive awards to purchase Investment Shares and received additional Matching Shares in respect of these investments.
These Matching Shares may vest after three years, conditional upon the achievement of the performance targets described below.
During the year, the Committee reviewed the use of TSR and Headline EPS as the basis for the LTIP performance conditions.
It remained satisfied that they continue to be the most appropriate measures of long-term performance for the executive Directors at this point.
Many investors regard TSR as an important indication of both earnings and capital growth relative to other FTSE 250 companies.
The Committee has considered using a sector comparator group for measuring TSR performance, but given the lack of directly comparable competitors deems it to be inappropriate.
Use of TSR ensures that the value of awards vesting reflects improvement in the Companys performance over the relevant period.
Headline EPS is a key indicator of long-term financial performance and value creation.
The Committee will continue to review the measures as it sees fit to ensure that the LTIP continues to reward true value creation and sustainable performance going forward.
The rules of the LTIP allow shares purchased by executives under a rights issue to be designated as Investment Shares and qualify for a Matching Share Award.
The value of the Matching Share Award relating to shares purchased under a rights issue is, as with any other Matching Share Award, increased as if the executive had invested a pre-tax amount in shares under the rights issue.
In respect of the 2009 LTIP awards, the Committee specified that the total annual maximum value of Investment Shares however sourced that could qualify for a Matching Share Award was subject to an overall limit of 100% of base salary.
Subject to this limit, shares purchased by executives using any Annual Incentive could continue to count as Investment Shares and qualify for a Matching Share Award in addition to any shares purchased in the rights issue which were designated as Investment Shares.
Within this overall limit, the Committee decided, in consultation with major shareholders, that only 63% of shares taken up under the 2009 rights issue could be designated as Investment Shares under the LTIP in recognition of the significantly discounted price of the shares issued in the rights issue.
The Committee also specified that the executive Directors be required to retain all of the Cookson shares that they held at the time of the 2009 rights issue for a period of 36 months after the rights issue in order for a Matching Share Award based on shares purchased in the rights issue to be able to vest.
The Committee has the discretion to award participants in both the Long Term Incentive Plan and the Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP the dividends that would have been paid on the number of shares that vest in respect of dividend record dates occurring during the period between the award date and the date of vesting.
These dividends can be paid in either cash or shares.
The Committee believes that this can be an important step in aligning the interests of senior executives with those of shareholders.
The Committee exercised this discretion in 2011, awarding these dividends in respect of the shares that vested under the 2008 LTIP and the 2008 DSBP.
Performance Shares and Matching Share Awards made in 2009, 2010 and 2011 vest after three years.
From 2011, LTIP awards for some participants were granted in the form of nil-cost options.
These options will become exercisable, subject to the achievement of the applicable performance conditions, three years after their award, and then remain exercisable until the fifth anniversary of their award.
This allows each participant the flexibility to decide when to exercise their awards rather than the shares being subject to a one-off vesting date on the third anniversary of their award.
LTIP awards made prior to 2011 have a one-off vesting date three years after the date of the award.
co. uk 43 Performance conditions The proportion of shares vesting is based on the Companys performance against specified performance conditions.
Vesting of 50% of shares awarded is based upon the Groups three-year TSR performance relative to that of the constituent companies, the FTSE 250 excluding Investment Trusts, and 50% on Headline EPS the calculation of which is shown in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements growth over a three-year period.
The two measures operate independently.
Vesting of 50% of Performance Shares and Matching Share Awards under the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 LTIP awards is based on TSR performance in accordance with the following schedule: TSR ranking relative to FTSE 250 Performance Shares Matching Shares Vesting Ratio excluding Investment Trusts Vesting Percentage Matching Shares: Investment Shares Below Median 0% 0 Median 12.5% 0.25 : 1 Upper Quintile top 20% 50% 1.125 : 1 Between Median and Upper Quintile Pro rata between 12.5% and 50% Pro rata between 0.25 : 1 and 1.125 : 1 Vesting of 50% of Performance Shares and Matching Share Awards under the 2009 and 2010 LTIP awards is based on Headline EPS growth, as compared with the compound annual growth in the Retail Prices Index RPI, in accordance with the following schedule: Annual Compound Headline Performance Shares Matching Shares Vesting Ratio EPS Growth above RPI Vesting Percentage Matching Shares: Investment Shares Below 3% 0% 0 3% 12.5% 0.25 : 1 At or above 10% 50% 1.125 : 1 Between 3% and 10% Pro rata between 12.5% and 50% Pro rata between 0.25 : 1 and 1.125 : 1 In 2011, the Committee changed the criterion applicable to the Headline EPS element of the performance condition.
The new condition is that the Group has to achieve an actual EPS performance target at the end of the three-year performance period.
Vesting of 50% of Performance Shares and Matching Share Awards under the 2011 LTIP awards is therefore based on Headline EPS growth in accordance with the following schedule: Performance Shares Matching Shares Vesting Ratio Headline EPS for 2013 financial year Vesting Percentage Matching Shares: Investment Shares Less than 82.0 pence 0% 0 82.0 pence 12.5% 0.25 : 1 98.5 pence or more 50% 1.125 : 1 Between 82.0 pence and 98.5 pence Pro rata between 12.5% and 50% Pro rata between 0.25 : 1 and 1.125 : 1 The Groups Headline EPS for 2011 was 70.4p.
The performance criteria and award policy were, once again, reviewed by the Committee during the year.
Following this review, the Committee determined that vesting of 50% of Performance Shares and Matching Share Awards for the 2012 LTIP awards will be based on Headline EPS growth in accordance with the following schedule: Performance Shares Matching Shares Vesting Ratio Headline EPS for 2014 financial year Vesting Percentage Matching Shares: Investment Shares Less than 85.0 pence 0% 0 85.0 pence 12.5% 0.25 : 1 105.0 pence or more 50% 1.125 : 1 Between 85.0 pence and 105.0 pence Pro rata between 12.5% and 50% Pro rata between 0.25 : 1 and 1.125 : 1 Matching Share Awards will only vest if the Investment Shares originally purchased have been retained.
The Committee obtains independent external advice to assess whether the Company has met the TSR performance condition at the end of the relevant performance period and to confirm that the companies which make up the index and the measurement of the Companys performance are both in accordance with the rules of the LTIP.
Measurement of the Groups TSR takes place over a performance period commencing on the first day of Cooksons financial year in which the award is granted.
TSR is measured as the percentage increase in a return index for Cookson and each comparator company between the beginning and end of the performance period.
The return index at the beginning of the performance period is the average of the return index on each weekday in the three-month period prior to the start of the performance period.
The same three-month averaging method is used to ascertain the return index at the end of the performance period.
The companies are then ranked, in descending order, according to their TSR.
If Cookson is ranked at or above the median of the comparator group then a proportion of the awards is eligible to vest.

Growth in Headline EPS is the annualised percentage growth over the performance period.
Headline EPS for the base year i. e. the calendar year prior to the award date is compared with the final year i. e. the calendar year three years after the base year.
For the 2009 and 2010 LTIP awards this was expressed as compound annual growth, above the compound annual growth in RPI.
In 2009, the Committee adjusted the performance conditions applicable to the Companys outstanding LTIP awards to take account of the Companys 2009 rights issue.
The adjustments made to the calculation of TSR, reflecting the actual behaviour of the majority of shareholders, and aligned with the executive Directors own investments, were based upon the assumption that all available rights under the Companys rights issue, and any rights issues carried out by members of the comparator group during the performance period, were taken up in full by eligible shareholders.
The adjustments also assumed that funds had been borrowed for the purpose of taking up these rights at a borrowing cost of 6% p. a.
The TSR of the other companies forming part of the LTIP comparator group which had undertaken a rights issue during the performance period were also adjusted on a similar basis.
The adjustments made to the calculation of the Headline EPS performance conditions were based upon the assumption that the rights issue had taken place, on a pro forma basis, at the beginning of the base year, including an adjustment for notional interest on the rights issue funds received in the base year.
Vesting of 2009 LTIP awards The performance period applicable to the awards made in 2009 ended on 31 December 2011.
The Companys TSR performance during this three-year performance period was assessed against the comparator group and it was determined that the Companys performance was above upper quintile.
In addition, the Companys annual compound Headline EPS growth was assessed for the three-year performance period as being over 10% above RPI.
The 2009 LTIP awards will therefore vest in full.
Prior to the vesting of any award, the Committee stipulates that, as an additional hurdle, it needs to be satisfied that vesting has been justified by the underlying financial performance of the Group over the performance period.
Having carefully considered the Groups performance over the three-year period, and taking into account the significant improvement in the Groups financial results including the Groups revenue, trading profit, return on sales margins, and profit before tax the Committee concluded that the vesting of the 2009 LTIP awards is justified by the underlying financial performance of the Group.
Accordingly, all of the 2009 LTIP awards will vest on 25 March 2012.
The executive Directors have undertaken that they will not dispose of any of the LTIP shares which vest in March 2012 for a period of 12 months from the date of vesting, other than to sell sufficient shares to meet income tax and social security liabilities arising thereon.
Historic vesting under the LTIP The table below sets out the vesting levels for the LTIP awards made to executives since the plan commenced in 2004.

The senior managers who participate in this plan receive an allocation of deferred shares to the value of a percentage of their annual bonus.

The last executive share option grant was made in 2003 and the Company does not intend to make any further grants under the schemes.
Following the Companys rights issue in 2009, the Directors approved adjustments to the number of shares granted under all outstanding options or awards and to any associated exercise price.

Cookson share plans comply with the current ABI guidelines on headroom which provide that overall dilution under all plans should not exceed 10% over a ten year period in relation to the Companys issued share capital, with a further limitation of 5% in any ten year period on discretionary schemes.
In the last ten years less than 1% of the Companys current issued share capital has been allotted to settle obligations arising from the exercise or vesting of executive and all employee share incentives and thus the Company remains well within the limits.
Details of the awards outstanding under the Companys share plans as at 31 December 2011 and where granted as options, the associated exercise prices, are given in note 29 to the consolidated financial statements and note 13 to the Company financial statements.
