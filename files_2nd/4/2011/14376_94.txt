Firstly however, I of Davids retirement and consultancy arrangements can be found in should like to explain some of the main activities of the Committee in the report that follows.
2011 and the reasoning behind the new remuneration structure we are proposing.
UK and International ShareSave Plans We have operated an all-employee ShareSave Plan in the UK for 30 New remuneration arrangements for the Executive years.
In 2002 we introduced an International ShareSave Plan which Directors and Senior Executives now operates in 27 countries.
The UK and International ShareSave Plans approved in 2002 have now expired and need to be renewed at The main work of the Remuneration Committee this year has been the the Annual General Meeting.
These plans are very popular amongst development of a remuneration strategy for our Executive Directors and our employees who are able to save on a regular basis and then buy Senior Executives which supports and reinforces the new strategy shares in the Company.
We have around 2,500 employees participating Olivier is pursuing.
We want to put in place a remuneration framework in the current plans around the world and are currently exploring ways of that will focus our key executives to drive the new strategy over the extending these arrangements to China and other emerging markets to short, medium and long-term which in turn will drive performance for enable us to attract and retain talent in these key areas.
Following a review of our existing arrangements, which included feedback from our senior executives, it was felt that the plans previously in place were too complex and really did not work as effective incentives for the performance and behaviours we wished to drive.
As a result, we are proposing a revised framework, which seeks to simplify remuneration at Smith & Nephew, provide a clear link to the business goals and strengthen the line of sight between reward and performance.
The changes we are proposing have consciously been designed to be broadly neutral in value: for target performance the quantum available to our Executive Directors and Executive Ofcers will not change.
However, we have rebalanced the package across the short, medium and long-term varying by level, to improve the link with our business strategy.
We have moved away from two long-term incentive arrangements to a simple performance share plan linked to the delivery of Total Shareholder Return relative to our peers and growth in free cash ow.
