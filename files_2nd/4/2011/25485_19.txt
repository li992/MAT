Remuneration report continued Remuneration philosophy, principles and policies Remuneration philosophy Our philosophy, which remains unchanged from prior years, is to employ the highest calibre individuals, who are characterised by integrity, intellect and innovation and who adhere and subscribe to our culture, values and philosophies.
We strive to inspire entrepreneurship by providing a working environment that stimulates extraordinary performance, so that executive directors and employees may be positive contributors to our clients, their communities and the group.
We reward executive directors and employees for their contribution through: Payment of an industry competitive annual package base salary and bene ts : Variable performance reward linked to our EVA model as discussed on pages 258 to 260 : and Ownership in the form of share incentive scheme participation.
We tend to look at the aggregate of the above as the overall remuneration package designed to attract, retain, incentivise and drive the behaviour of our employees over the short, medium and longer term.
Overall rewards are considered as important as our core values of work content greater responsibility, variety of work and high level of challenge and work af liation entrepreneurial feel to the company and unique culture in the attraction, retention and motivation of employees.
We have a strong entrepreneurial, merit and values-based culture, characterised by passion, energy and stamina.
The ability to live and perpetuate our values, culture and philosophies in the pursuit of excellence is considered paramount in determining overall reward levels.
The type of people the organisation attracts, and the culture and environment within which they work, remain crucial in determining our success and long-term progress.
Our reward programmes are clear and transparent, designed and administered to align directors and employees interests with those of all stakeholders and ensure the groups short and long-term success.
Remuneration policy general principles Our remuneration policy is consistent with the following general principles: Remuneration policies, procedures and practices collectively referred to as the remuneration policy are consistent with, and promote, sound and effective risk management, and do not encourage risk-taking that exceeds the level of tolerated risk of the Investec group Our remuneration policy is in line with the business strategy, objectives, values and long-term interests of the Investec group The payment of variable remuneration does not limit the Investec groups ability to maintain or strengthen its capital base The structure of all employees remuneration is consistent with and promotes effective risk management.
Other key remuneration principles Other key principles of our remuneration policy for executive directors and employees, which were consistently applied during the financial year, are as follows: Total rewards comprise a xed and variable component The xed component of our rewards includes a base salary, pension and bene ts and is set at median market levels to keep xed cost elements low Variable rewards a portion of which is deferred for senior employees are largely EVA based and underpinned by our risk appetite and capital utilisation as discussed on pages 195 to 199 Long-term share incentive participation ensures alignment with stakeholders Total compensation base salary, pension, bene ts and incentives is targeted in normal market conditions to the relevant competitive market see below at upper quartile levels for superior performance We do not apply an upper limit on performance bonuses given our risk-based EVA approach and prefer to contain the xed cost component of remuneration at modest levels The xed component is, however, designed to be suf cient so that employees do not become dependent on their variable compensation as we are not morally bound to award variable rewards 256 2011 Investec integrated annual report | Remuneration report In addition, we operate a fully exible incentive policy and are not contractually bound to award variable rewards.
Investec has the ability to pay no performance bonuses should the performance of the group or individual employees require this.
The type of people In addition, our remuneration policy includes the following elements: the organisation We do not pay remuneration through vehicles that facilitate avoidance of applicable laws and attracts, and regulations the culture and Our policy is designed to avoid con icts of interest between Investec and its clients.
Speci c environment within internal controls and processes are in place to prevent such con icts of interest from occurring which they work, and posing a risk to the group on prudential grounds.
In addition, no individual is involved in the determination of his her own remuneration rewards remain crucial in determining our Employees must undertake and not use any personal hedging strategies or remuneration or liability-related contracts of insurance to undermine the risk alignment effects embedded in their success and longremuneration arrangements.
Group Compliance maintains arrangements designed to ensure that term progress.
employees comply with this policy.
Determination of remuneration levels Qualitative and quantitative issues form an integral part of the determination of reward levels.
Factors considered include: The performance of the overall rm, the speci c business unit and the individual employee The employees alignment and adherence to our culture and values Attitude displayed towards risk consciousness, risk management and regulatory compliance Speci c input from risk and compliance functions regarding concerns about the behaviour of individual employees or the riskiness of business undertaken The level of cooperation and collaboration fostered: the ability to grow and develop markets and client relationships: the development of staff: and the possible replacement cost of such employees.
Reward levels are targeted to be commercially competitive, on the following basis: The most relevant competitive reference points for reward levels are based on the scope of responsibility and individual contributions made Appropriate benchmark, industry and comparable organisations remuneration practices are reviewed regularly For executive directors, the FTSE 350 General Finance rms have provided the most appropriate benchmark to date For employees, combinations of rms from the JSE Financial 15 and the FTSE 350 General Finance sector have offered the most appropriate benchmark The committee also reviews on an individual basis data on other international banks with which we compete, including certain FTSE100 companies The committee recognises that we operate an international business and compete with both local and international competitors in each of our markets In order to avoid disproportionate packages across areas of the group and between executives, adjustments are made at any extremes to ensure broad internal consistency.
Adjustments may also be made to the competitive positioning of pay components for individuals, in cases where a higher level of investment is needed in order to build or grow either a business unit or our capability in a geography.
257 2011 Investec integrated annual report | Remuneration report Remuneration report continued Components of remuneration The reward package for executive directors and employees comprises: Base salary and bene ts Annual performance bonuses Long-term share incentive plans.
The elements of the reward package, as listed above, are discussed below and the components for each director are detailed in tables accompanying this report.
Base salary and other benefi ts Salaries are reviewed annually and re ect the relative skills and experience of, and contribution made by, the individual.
It is the companys policy to seek to set base salaries including bene ts at median market levels.
The Human Resources division provides guidelines to business units on recommended salary levels for all employees within the organisation to facilitate the review.
These guidelines include a strategic message on how to set salary levels that will aid Investec in meeting its objectives and corporate values and incorporates guidance on increasing levels to take account of the change in the cost of living over the year to ensure that salary levels always allow employees to afford a reasonable standard of living and dont encourage a reliance on variable remuneration.
Advisers are often engaged by either the Human Resources division or the business units to obtain general benchmark information or to benchmark speci c positions to ensure that xed pay levels are market driven and competitive so that we attract the most skilled talent in the market.
Bene ts are targeted at competitive levels and are delivered through exible and tailored packages.
Bene ts include pension schemes: life, disability and personal accident insurance: medical cover: and other bene ts, as dictated by competitive local market practices.
Only salaries are pensionable, the annual bonuses paid are not.
Our disclosure of executive directors salaries on page 268 has been done on a gross basis i. e. inclusive of pension fund contributions from the company.
The remuneration committee obtains industry benchmarking and speci c advice around salary and performance bonus levels from its independent advisers in respect of the executive directors.
Annual performance bonus All employees are eligible for an annual performance bonus, subject inter alia to the factors set out above in the section dealing with the determination of remuneration levels.
Our EVA model: performance-linked and risk-adjusted remuneration Our business strategy and associated risk appetite, together with effective capital utilisation, form the key cornerstones which underpin the EVA annual bonus allocation model.
Business units share in the annual bonus pool to the extent that they have generated a realised return on their allocated risk adjusted capital base in excess of their target return on equity.
Many of the potential future risks that the rm may face are avoided through ensuring that the bonus pools are based on actual realised risk adjusted pro ts.
Our EVA model has been consistently applied for a period in excess of 10 years and encompasses the following principals: Capital allocated is a function of both regulatory and internal capital requirements, the risk assumed within the business and our overall business strategy The group has always held capital in excess of minimum regulatory requirements, and this philosophy is perpetuated in our internal capital allocation process.
This process ensures that risk and capital discipline is embedded at the level of deal initiation and incorporates independent approval outside of the business unit of transactions by the various risk committees.
A detailed explanation of our capital management and allocation process is provided on pages 195 to 199.
Internal capital comprises the regulatory capital requirement taking into account a number of speci ed risks plus a capital buffer which caters, inter alia, for any unspeci ed or future risks not speci cally identi ed in the capital planning process.
The Investec group then ensures that it actually holds capital in excess of this level of internal capital Internal capital is allocated to each business unit via a comprehensive analysis of the risks inherent within that business and an assessment 258 of the costs of those risks 2011 Investec integrated annual report | Remuneration report Hurdle rates or targeted returns are determined for each business unit based on the weighted average cost of capital plus a buffer for trading businesses to take into account additional risks not identi ed in the capital allocation process applied to internal capital Targeted returns differ by business unit re ecting the competitive economics and shareholder expectation for the speci c area of the business, and are set with reference to competitive benchmarks for each product line In essence varying levels of return are required for each business unit re ecting the state of market maturity, country of operation, risk, capital invested capital intensive businesses or expected expense base fee-based businesses Growth in pro tability over time will result in an increasing incentive pool, as long as it is not achieved at the expense of capital ef ciency Target returns must be re ective of the inherent risk assumed in the business.
Thus, an increase in absolute pro tability does not automatically result in an increase in the annual bonus pool.
This approach allows us to embed risk and capital discipline in our business processes.
These targets are subject to annual review The groups credit and risk forums provide transaction approval independent of the business unit on a deal by deal basis adding a level of risk consciousness to the pre-determined and risk adjusted capital allocation and required hurdle rates and thus ensure that each transaction generates a return that is commensurate with its associated risk pro le.
In terms of our EVA process, if business and individual performance goals are achieved or bettered, the variable element of the total reward package is likely to be substantially higher than the relevant target market.
This ensures that overall reward levels are positioned at the upper quartile level for superior performance, in line with our overriding remuneration policy.
It should be noted the salaries and proposed bonuses for employees responsible for risk, internal audit and compliance as well as group executives are not based on a formulaic approach and are independent of any revenues or pro ts generated by the business units where they work.
The level of rewards for these employees are assessed against the overall financial performance of the rm: objectives based on their function: and compliance with the various nonfinancial aspects referred to above.

divisional alignment Business unit and line managers provide feedback and support.
Determination of total EVA pool Alignment to total EVA pool The group Finance division determine the pool Bonuses that are larger require size as per formula driven model but are not adjustment involved in the allocation thereof.
This required an executive approval process.
Final review by DLC remuneration committee of: Audited EVA pool by business unit Executive directors proposals for persons discharging managerial responsibilities Top 20 bonuses by country and total EVA payment All individual risk, compliance and internal audit employees Remuneration committee members serve on BRCC and the audit committee.
Key elements of the bonus allocation process are set out below: A xed predetermined percentage of any return in excess of the EVA hurdle accrues to the business units EVA pool A portion of the total EVA pool is allocated towards the bonus pool for central service and head of ce employees These bonus pools are reviewed regularly by the appropriate management and non-executive committees to ensure that awards are only paid when it is appropriate to do so, considering rm-wide performance against nonfinancial risk both current and future and compliance 259 based objectives.
All users of capital operate within a strict philosophical framework that requires a balancing of risk and reward and that is designed to encourage behaviour in the interests of all stakeholders as opposed to just employees 2011 Investec integrated annual report | Remuneration report Remuneration report continued The EVA pools are calculated centrally by the groups finance function and subject to audit as part of the year-end audit process Once the annual internal audit of the EVA pools is complete, line managers in each business unit will make discretionary bonus recommendations for each team member taking into consideration qualitative and quantitative criteria as mentioned above Bonus recommendations are then subject to an extensive geographic review involving Human Resources, local management and local remuneration committees Thereafter, these recommendations are subject to a global review by executive management, before the DLC remuneration committee review and approval process.
The remuneration committee speci cally reviews and approves the individual remuneration packages of the executive directors, persons discharging managerial responsibilities, and FSA code staff.
The committee also reviews the salaries and performance bonuses awarded to a number of other senior and higher paid employees across the group.
In addition, the committee speci cally reviews and approves the salaries and performance bonuses awarded to each employee within the internal audit, compliance and risk functions, both in the business units and in the central functions, ensuring that such packages are competitive and are determined independently of the other business areas.
In making these decisions the committee relies on a combination of external advice and supporting information prepared internally by the group.
Deferral of performance awards All performance awards exceeding a pre-determined hurdle level are subject to 60% deferral in respect of that portion that exceeds the hurdle level.
The entire deferred amount is awarded in the form of forfeitable share awards vesting in two equal tranches at the end of 12 months and 24 months.
These awards are made in terms of our existing long-term incentive plans refer below.
The entire amount that is not deferred is payable up front in cash.
Employees who leave the employment of Investec prior to vesting of these deferred awards will lose their forfeitable shares, subject to the groups normal good leaver provisions and approval process in exceptional cases.
The deferred share awards are subject to claw back of unpaid EVA where pro ts used to determine EVA bonuses are reversed in subsequent periods.
The current hurdle level is subject to review and for the 2012 financial year the deferral period will be extended to three years.
Share option and long-term share incentive plans We have a number of share option and long-term share incentive plans that are designed to link the interests of directors and employees with those of shareholders and long-term organisational interests, through performance and risk-based equity grants.
These share option and incentive plans are also used as a retention mechanism for key talent.
Prior to the implementation of our DLC structure and our listing on the London Stock Exchange in July 2002, we had a number of share option, share purchase and leveraged share schemes in place that were appropriate for a South African listed company.
However, at the time of the London listing it was necessary for us to consider implementing a more internationally recognised share scheme structure and philosophy.
As a result, a number of share option plans were introduced to cater for regulatory, tax and other considerations pertaining to the various jurisdictions in which we operated.
At the same time, however, a decision was taken to maintain the schemes in place prior to the London listing until the allocations made in terms of those schemes matured.
While this gives rise to what appears to be a multitude of schemes, the philosophy and practical implications are fairly simple the appropriate level of equity allocation is determined for each employee and then awards are made out of the scheme that is considered most appropriate for that individual given his her location, tax and regulatory environment.
The share option and long-term share incentive plans in operation, and in which the directors are eligible to participate, are summarised in the table below and further details are provided on our website.
Executive directors collectively hold approximately 1.8% of our issued share capital.
Long-term share incentive plans In essence we currently operate two main share ownership plans for employees other than executive directors, namely the Investec 1 Long Term Incentive Plan and the Investec Limited Long Term Incentive Plan i. e. referred to as LTIPs.
Awards are made in the form of nil cost options other than for countries where the taxation of such awards is penal.
In these cases awards are made in the form of forfeitable shares or market strike options.
260 2011 Investec integrated annual report | Remuneration report We follow a philosophy where all employees are eligible for LTIPs.
Awards are considered by the remuneration committee and made only in the 42-day period following the release of our interim or final financial results in accordance with the ABI guidelines.
These awards comprise three elements, namely: New starter awards are made based on an allocation table linked to salary levels General allocation awards are the same quantum as new starter awards and are made to employees who have not had any other share award in a three year period Top up awards are made at the discretion of line management primarily as a retention tool.
All proposed LTIP awards are recommended by business unit management, approved by the staff share executive committee and then the remuneration committee before being awarded.
Awards of Investec plc LTIPs are made to all employees of Investec plc and awards of Investec Limited LTIPs for its employees.
All LTIP awards are subject to 75% vesting at the end of four years and the final 25% at the end of the fifth year.
We believe this is more appropriate for our business requirements than the 50% vesting in year three and 50% vesting in year five guidance provided by the FSA Remuneration Code.
The awards are forfeited on termination, but good leaver discretion is applied in exceptional circumstances.
Retention is addressed through the long-term nature of awards granted which provides an element of lock-in for employees throughout the vesting period.

The limits for allocations to employees and executive management during a financial year may be exceeded if the directors determine that exceptional circumstances make it desirable that options should be granted in excess of that limit.
These conditions require growth in adjusted earnings per share EPS over the relevant option period to equal or exceed the UK Retail Price Index RPI plus 3% compounded annually over the same period.
In choosing the performance targets for this plan, the committee considered the merits of EPS-based targets against other possibilities, such as comparative performance or comparative growth in ROE against a basket of other companies.
The committee determined that EPS-based targets are most appropriate as they measure our underlying growth.
The committee intends to continue to apply this during the 2012 financial year but keeps the whole matter of the suitability of target-linked share-based remuneration under periodic review.
This note does not apply to the Share Matching Plan 2005 which has different performance conditions as approved by shareholders further information is available on our website.
This represents the number of awards made to all participants.
For further details, see the directors report on page 292.
More details on the directors shareholdings are also provided in tables accompanying this report.
Dilution limits: Investec is committed to following the Association of British Insurers ABI guidelines and accordingly, as from the date of the implementation of our DLC structure 29 July 2002, the maximum number of new shares which may be issued by the company under all of the share plans in respect of grants made after July 2002 may not exceed 10% of the issued share capital of the company over a rolling 10 year period.
We have, since our listing date, complied with both the 10% in 10 years guideline for discretionary and nondiscretionary awards in aggregate as well as the 5% in 10 years guideline for discretionary awards.
The committee regularly monitors the utilisation of dilution limits and available headroom to ensure that these guidelines are complied with.
The issued share capital of Investec plc and Investec Limited at 31 March 2011 was 537.2 million shares and 272.8 million shares respectively.
As announced on the stock exchange news services, 2.6 million Investec plc and 0.1 million Investec Limited shares were issued to the staff share schemes during the year.

263 2011 Investec integrated annual report | Remuneration report Remuneration report continued Non-executive directors remuneration The board agrees and determines the fees of non-executive directors and the fees are reviewed annually.
The boards policy is that fees should re ect individual responsibilities and membership of board committees.
The increase in non-executive directors fees for the forthcoming year re ects current market conditions with the focus on controlling xed remuneration and additional time commitment required.
Their fee structure covers the dual roles that the directors perform for the UK listed Investec plc and the South African listed Investec Limited boards.

In addition, as mentioned elsewhere in this report, the committee has reviewed a vast survey of the new remuneration regulations and changing attitudes in all of our core geographies and concluded that Investecs long-standing fundamental remuneration philosophies are consistent with these requirements.
Investec plc will formally adopt the requirements set out in the FSA Remuneration Code for its 2012 financial year.
Scope of our remuneration policy The Investec group aims to apply remuneration policies to executive directors and employees that are largely consistent group-wide, but recognises that certain parts of the group are governed by local regulations that may contain more onerous requirements in certain respects.
In those cases, the higher requirements are applied to that part of the group.
This will be applied to Investec plc and its subsidiary companies that are subject to the FSA Remuneration Code as a tier one organisation as fide ned therein, and in particular in relation to code staff.
Additionally, where any aspect of our remuneration policy contravenes local laws or regulations, the local laws or regulations shall prevail.
We believe that our remuneration policy is consistent with and complies with the principals and rules of the FSA Remuneration Code in respect of Investec plc and its subsidiary companies.
The following Investec plc group entities are separately regulated by the FSA and as such maintain their own remuneration policy separate from the Investec group policy and in line with such entitys own risk pro le and business activities: Hargreave Hale: Investec Wealth and Investment UK formerly Rensburg Sheppards : Investec Asset Management.
Composition and role of the committee George Alford Chairman and Sir David Prosser were members of the committee throughout the year.

Advisers to the committee Where appropriate, the committee has access to independent executive remuneration consultants.
The selection of the advisers is at the discretion of the committee chairman, and Investec funds any expenses relating to the appointment of external consultants.
During the financial year, the committee continued to use the services of its advisers, Hewitt New Bridge Street, which among other things speci cally reviewed and provided information on executive share incentive schemes: industry consultation papers, regulations and developments with respect to remuneration practices and our alignment to them.
In addition, they continued to review and provide information on appropriate benchmark, industry and comparable organisations remuneration practices.

The variable remuneration pools are determined by our finance teams taking into account risk adjusted capital requirements and after eliminating unrealised gains.
The employees within these specialist divisions, which provide support to the committee, are not board directors and are not appointed by the committee.
The committee, together with the board, attends a strategic off-site each year at which senior executive employees provide information and presentations on the groups strategic direction, prospects, key focus areas and annual budget.
While executive directors have the right to address any meeting of the committee, they play no role in the determination of their remuneration package.
Furthermore, no employee participates in discussions or decisions of the committee relating to their own remuneration.
Service contracts and terms of employment Three out of our four executive directors namely S Koseff, B Kantor and GR Burger have inde nite contracts of employment, terminable by either party giving six months written notice to the other.
The contracts of employment do not contain provisions for compensation payable on early termination.

Biographical details of the directors of the board These details can be found on pages 282 to 284.
Dates of appointment to the board The boards of Investec plc and Investec Limited are separate and subject to separate legal obligations for each company.

Performance graph total shareholder return We have implemented a DLC structure, in terms of which we have premium primary listings in London and Johannesburg.
The listing on the London Stock Exchange LSE took place on 29 July 2002, although we have been listed in South Africa since 1986.
Schedule 420 of the UK Companies Act 2006 requires this report to include a performance graph of Investec plcs total shareholder return TSR performance against that of a broad market index.
We found it dif cult to locate an appropriate group of companies to benchmark ourselves against because of our specialist activities.
A number of companies within the FTSE 350 General Finance Index conduct similar activities to us, although they do not necessarily have the same geographical pro le.
Nevertheless, to date this has been the most appropriate index against which to measure our performance on the LSE.
Towards the end of our 2010 financial year, Investec plc was included as a new entrant into the FTSE 100 Index.
We have included the total shareholder return of that index for illustrative purposes.
The graph below shows the cumulative shareholder return for a holding of our shares in orange in Pounds Sterling on the LSE, compared with the average total shareholder return of other members of the FTSE 350 General Finance Index and the FTSE 100 Index.
It shows that, at 31 March 2011, a hypothetical 100 invested in Investec plc at the time of its listing on the LSE in July 2002 would have generated a total return of 462 compared with a return of 161 if invested in the FTSE 350 General Finance Index and a return of 118 if invested in the FTSE 100 Index.
Investec plc has therefore outperformed the FTSE 350 General Finance Index and the FTSE 100 Index over the period.
During the period from 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2011, the return to shareholders of Investec plc measured in Pounds Sterling and Investec Limited measured in Rands was negative 8.5% and negative 12.6% respectively.
This compares to a return of 23.3% for the FTSE 350 General Finance Index and a return of 7.4% for the FTSE 100 Index.
The market price of our shares on the LSE was 4.78 as at 31 March 2011, ranging from a low of 4.29 to a high of 5.50 during the financial year.
Furthermore, the market price of our shares on the JSE Limited was R52.80 as at 31 March 2011, ranging from a low of R49.49 to a high of R65.50 during the financial year.
Gross remuneration comprises base salary and other bene ts see point 2 and 3 below.
Gross remuneration of S Koseff and B Kantor has increased by 3.7%.
The gross remuneration of GR Burger is determined in Rands and converted into Pounds Sterling.
In Rand terms GR Burgers gross remuneration increased by 9.8% from R3 050 000 in March 2010 to R3 350 000 in March 2011.
Gross remuneration increases for other employees across the group have generally been in the range of 4% to 10%.
The executive directors receive other bene ts which may include pension schemes: life, disability and personal accident insurance: and medical cover, on similar terms to other senior executives.
In determining annual bonuses, a number of quantitative and qualitative factors metrics were considered which included: The group reported operating pro ts in all of its core geographies, bene ting from its solid recurring income base with attributable earnings increasing by 5.9% over the period.
Five out of our six operating divisions performed well The group maintained its disciplined approach with respect to the quality of its balance sheet, reporting an increase in both capital and liquidity over the period.
Leverage ratios remain low and the group has further reduced reliance on wholesale funding The group reported an increase in dividends per share of 6.3% to 17.0 pence and an increase in tangible net asset value per share of 6.1% to 343.8 pence The group has made signi cant progress in increasing its non-lending revenue base and further balancing the revenue generated from its operational risk businesses and its financial risk businesses.
Initiatives and developments in this regard include: the substantial increase in funds under management over the period: the acquisition of Rensburg Sheppards plc and the formation of a global Wealth and Investment unit.
The Asset Management and Wealth Management businesses accounted for 38.6% of the groups operating pro t 2010: 25.3% A focused and intimate involvement of the executive directors in ensuring stringent management of risk, liquidity and capital Investment in the Investec brand continues to deliver shareholder value Business units have moved onto the front foot and are taking advantage of new opportunities Continuous engagement with key stakeholders The group has maintained its commitment to its sustainability efforts, and received a number of awards in this area.
Further information on the groups financial and nonfinancial performance and risk management metrics have been discussed elsewhere in the annual report.
