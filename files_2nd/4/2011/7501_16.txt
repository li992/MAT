Remuneration report This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 the Act and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 and has been approved by the Board and the Remuneration Committee.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors remuneration.
A resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
The Act requires the external auditors to report on certain parts of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with it.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information Remuneration Committee Role The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining and agreeing with the Board the pay, benefits and contractual arrangements for the Executive Directors of the Company and other members of the Executive Committee.
It aims to develop and recommend strategies that drive performance and reward it appropriately.
The Committee also has oversight of the long-term incentive schemes operated by the Company.
In determining its policy, the Committee has paid regard to the principles and provisions of good governance contained in the Combined Code published in July 2003 by the UK Financial Reporting Council as updated in June 2008 the Code.
The Committee operates under the delegated authority of the Board and its terms of reference are available on request from the Company Secretary.
Membership The Committee was chaired throughout the year by Ian Chippendale.
The other members of the Committee were Barry Gibson and Mark Morris.
All of the members are independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Board determined that the Chairman, Barry Gibson, should remain a member of the Committee taking account of the fact that he is considered to be independent and also that, as a former Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, his knowledge of the development of the remuneration policy and practices at HomeServe is invaluable.
He takes no part in discussions relating to his own remuneration.
Meetings Attendance at Committee meetings held during the year and the number of meetings held is set out on page 63.
HomeServe 66 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Governance Advisers During the year Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS, a firm of independent remuneration consultants, served as advisers to the Committee.
The Company also instructed HNBS to advise it on a limited number of remuneration matters concerning individuals below the Executive Committee during the year.
Other than in relation to advice on remuneration, HNBS has no other connections with the Company.
HNBS is a trading name of Aon Hewitt Ltd, the ultimate parent company of which is Aon Corporation.
Aon Benfield another Aon company provides underwriting advice and services to HomeServe.
The Remuneration Committee is comfortable that this does not present a conflict of interest.
The terms of engagement for HNBS are available on request from the Company Secretary.
The Committee has also received assistance from Richard Harpin, the Chief Executive and Anna Maughan, the Company Secretary, both of whom attended meetings of the Committee as required.
Mr Harpin did not take part in discussions in respect of matters relating directly to his own remuneration.
Remuneration policy The Committees remuneration policy for the remuneration of Executive Directors and other senior executives is based on the following principles: to provide a remuneration package that is sufficient, but no more than necessary, to attract, retain and motivate high calibre executives: to align rewards with the Groups performance: to reward good performance with remuneration that is in line with that payable by broadly comparable businesses i. e. high-growth companies of a similar size and those with similar operating characteristics: to reward exceptional performance in such a way as to align the executives interests with those of the Companys shareholders, with the potential to deliver above market levels of reward for outstanding performance.
To that end, the Committee structures executive remuneration in two distinct parts: fixed remuneration of basic salary, pension and benefits and variable performance-related remuneration in the form of a cash bonus and long-term incentive arrangements.
Remuneration for Executive Directors is structured so that the variable pay element forms a significant portion of each Directors package.
The charts below demonstrate the balance between fixed and variable pay at on-target and maximum performance levels, in the case of the long-term incentive arrangements assuming certain levels of share price growth.
Maximum performance assumes the achievement of maximum bonus and full vesting of shares under the Companys long-term incentive arrangements.
On-target remuneration Maximum remuneration 20% 38% 40% 18% 62% 22% n Fixed pay n Fixed pay n Short-term variable pay n Short-term variable pay n Long-term variable pay n Long-term variable pay HomeServe 67 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Remuneration report They demonstrate the significant weighting of the package towards variable performance-related pay.
In particular, the majority of Executive Directors total remuneration at the maximum performance level will derive from the Companys long-term incentive arrangements, which are strongly aligned to shareholder value creation.
The Committee has the discretion to take into account performance on environmental, social and governance matters when setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
However, the Committee has chosen not to take these into specific account in setting performance targets for 2011 12 in the belief that the structures in place neither encourage nor reward inappropriate behaviour in this regard and that relevant operational controls relating to such matters are in place.
The Committee is satisfied that neither the structure of the remuneration packages, with the high weighting on variable pay, nor the performance measures targeted under the annual bonus and long-term incentives encourage inappropriate risk taking.
The remuneration arrangements are designed so as to provide a strong alignment of interest between the executives and shareholders and to support the growth and performance aspirations of the Company and the Committee is satisfied that the current arrangements meet these objectives.
Noting the best practice recommendations set out in the new UK Corporate Governance Code effective for the 2011 12 financial year, the Committee has approved the introduction of a claw-back provision to future annual and long-term incentive awards.
Key activities of the Remuneration Committee during the year In line with its remit, the following key issues were discussed by the Committee during the year: Review of salary levels for the Executive Directors and other members of the Executive Committee: Agree the bonuses payable for the 2009 10 financial year: Determination of the targets for the 2010 11 annual bonus plan: Approval of the 2010 Remuneration report and review of the final outcome of the Annual General Meeting voting for the report: Approval of the performance targets and individual and aggregate award sizes to be granted under the 2008 LTIP: Review of the performance targets and confirmation of the level of vesting of 2007 executive share option and deferred share bonus plan awards and approve vesting levels of other awards for good leavers from the Company as appropriate: Review of, and agreement to, all Director joining and leaving arrangements, covering all elements of their reward package: Review of the remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors and other members of the Executive Committee for 2011: and Consideration of institutional investor guidelines on executive compensation.

Summary of changes to the Board structure and individual roles and responsibilities in the year On 31 March 2010, Brian Whitty, Executive Chairman, retired and was replaced by Barry Gibson as Non-Executive Chairman.
On 5 July 2010, Jonathan King, Chief Executive of HomeServe USA, was appointed to the Board.
This appointment reflected the growth and development of the US business within the overall Group.
Stella David was appointed as a Non-Executive Director on 23 November 2010.
HomeServe 69 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Remuneration report Remuneration for Executive Directors The main components of the remuneration package for Executive Directors are: Basic salary Basic salary for each Executive Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account the roles, responsibilities, performance and experience of the individual.
This is normally reviewed annually with any increase usually being effective from 1 April unless responsibilities change.
Salary levels are determined taking into account market data on salary levels for similar positions at comparable companies and pay and employment conditions of employees elsewhere in the Company.
Following a review undertaken by HNBS in March 2009 the Committee determined that the top-half of the FTSE-250 was the most appropriate comparator group against which to benchmark salaries.
HNBS updated their review in February 2011 using the top-half of the FTSE-250 as a comparator group at the time of the review the Company was ranked 154th in the FTSE.
Consideration was also given to the pay and conditions across the Group.
It was agreed that the basic salaries of the Board and Executive Committee were positioned appropriately in respect of the benchmark but that an inflationary increase of 2% be applied with effect from 1 April 2011.
This was also the budgeted increase for the general workforce in the UK.
Current salaries are set out below: Name of Director 2010 11 Salary 2011 12 Salary R D Harpin 510,000 522,750 M Bennett 306,000 313,650 J Florsheim 510,000 522,750 J King $575,252 $589,633 Annual bonus The annual bonus is designed to drive and reward excellent short-term operating performance of the Company and encourage real year-on-year growth in profitability.
No annual bonus is paid unless a very high level of profit performance is achieved.
The maximum annual bonus for 2011 12 will be maintained at 100% of basic salary with the exception of Jon Florsheim whose maximum bonus potential is unchanged at 150% of salary.
During the year, Executive Directors were able to earn up to 80% of bonus potential for Group financial performance, measured by profit before tax, amortisation and exceptional items.
The remaining 20% of bonus potential was based on measurable personal targets, relating to the part of the business or the function for which the Director is responsible.
This weighting differed for Jon Florsheim and Jonathan King who were able to earn a higher proportion of bonus potential based on targets specifically related to the performance of their respective divisions the UK and the USA.
For 2011 12 the maximum limits will remain the same as will the weighting between business and personal objectives.
Provided their personal objectives are met in full, the normal on-target bonus payable to Executive Directors in any year is expected to be in the region of 60% of their basic salary 90% for Jon Florsheim.
HomeServe 70 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Governance Executive Directors bonuses are paid entirely in cash, though under the Long Term Incentive Plan adopted in 2008, Directors have the opportunity to invest part of their net bonus in shares.
If they choose to do this, they may be awarded a matching award which is subject to a comparative Total Shareholder Return TSR performance condition and an Earnings per Share EPS target.
Long-term incentives The Committees policy for the provision of long-term incentives to Executive Directors is to grant awards of performance shares performance awards and to provide them with the opportunity to voluntarily invest their annual bonus into a matching share arrangement matching awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan adopted in 2008 the 2008 LTIP.
The maximum individual award limit under the 2008 LTIP is 200% of basic salary for performance awards and for matching awards is up to two shares for each share invested, based on a maximum investment of the net of tax equivalent of 75% of the maximum bonus potential.
Consistent with the grant policy applied previously, the Committee intends to limit the size of performance share awards in 2011 to the Executive Directors to 150% of salary.
Matching awards up to the maximum ratio of two shares for each invested share will continue to be granted.
It should be noted that, under the plan rules, the executives may invest up to the lower of their actual bonus earned in the preceding financial year and 75% of their maximum bonus potential.
In the event that actual bonuses are lower than 25% of salary, executives may invest up to 25% of salary in shares from their own money.
In 2010 the Committee conducted a review of the performance targets to be attached to awards under the LTIP.
Following the review the Committee concluded that TSR remained an important performance condition and should be retained.
However, in order to balance this measure with one which provides a stronger link to the long-term financial performance of the Company, the Committee decided that it would be appropriate to incorporate a stretching EPS target.
The Committee considers that the use of both EPS and TSR creates a balance between internal financial and external relative stock market measures and both measures are aligned to shareholder value creation.
Accordingly, as last year, 50% of the award of performance and matching shares will be subject to TSR targets.
25% of any award subject to TSR will vest if HomeServes TSR performance is equal to the FTSE-250 index, increasing on a straight line basis to 100% vesting where TSR performance exceeds the Index by an average of 15% per annum.
In determining the vesting of awards in any year under the TSR part of the award, the Committee will also take into account the underlying financial performance of the business.
50% of the award will be subject to a target based on a range of EPS growth.
25% of any award subject to EPS will vest for average annual EPS growth of RPI 4%, increasing in a straight line to 100% vesting where average annual EPS growth is RPI 10%.
For both conditions, performance will be measured over a period of three years.
The estimated fair value of LTIP awards granted in 2010 was 77% of the face value of the share at the time of grant.
Awards under the 2008 LTIP may be satisfied through a mixture of either market purchase or new issue shares.
To the extent new issue shares are used, the 2008 LTIP will adhere to a 5% in 10 year dilution limit.
HomeServe 71 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Remuneration report Executive Directors may also participate in the Groups Save As You Earn Scheme where share options are exercisable after three or five years at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares at the time of grant.
No performance criteria are attached to this scheme.
Benefits Non-pension benefits comprise company car and fuel allowance and medical insurance.
The range of benefits and their value are considered to be broadly in line with those provided to Executive Directors in similar companies in the FTSE-250.
Shareholding guidelines It is the Boards policy that Executive Directors and certain members of the Companys senior management build up and retain a minimum shareholding in the Company.
Each Executive Director is encouraged to hold shares of at least equal value to his annual basic salary.
Accordingly, if the holding guideline has not been fulfilled at the point of exercise of any option or the vesting of any other long-term incentive award, the Director must retain 50% of the net proceeds in the Companys shares until the holding requirement is achieved.
Details of the current shareholdings of the Executive Directors are provided on page 78.
Service contracts The Committees policy is to offer service contracts with notice periods of one year or less other than in exceptional circumstances, where longer initial notice periods may be offered on appointment, and then reduced to one year over time.
All Executive Directors contracts of service are terminable on 12 months notice by either party.
Further details of the Executive Directors contracts are summarised in the table below: Name of Director Date of contract R D Harpin 18 January 2002 M Bennett 26 June 2009 J Florsheim 5 March 2007 J King 28 September 2010 The company may terminate the executives employment by making a payment equivalent to one years remuneration excluding bonus in the case of Martin Bennett and Jonathan King.
Notice periods and payments are not extendable in takeover situations.
HomeServe 72 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Governance Pensions Executive Directors currently participate in one of two pension schemes, the Water Companies Pension Scheme WCPS or the HomeServe Money Plan HMP.
The normal date of retirement for Executive Directors is at age 60.
The WCPS is a funded, Inland Revenue approved occupational defined benefit scheme.
Richard Harpin and Jonathan King were members of the WCPS during the year.
In respect of these Directors, its main features are: pension at normal retirement age of one-half of final pensionable salary and a tax free lump sum of one and a half times final pensionable salary on completion of 40 years service at an accrual rate of 3 80ths plus 80ths cash: life assurance of five times basic salary: pension payable in the event of ill health: and spouses pension on death.
Mr Harpin is a non-contributory member.
A notional earnings cap restricts the benefits provided to members of the WCPS.
An unapproved pension payment, equal to 20% of the amount by which his basic salary exceeds the notional cap is paid annually.
The notional cap is indexed in line with earnings inflation.
The HMP is a funded, Inland Revenue approved occupational defined contribution pension scheme.
Jon Florsheim and Martin Bennett are members of the HMP.
In respect of Martin Bennett, its main features are: employer contributions of 20%: life assurance of five times basic salary: permanent health insurance: and spouses pension on death.
In respect of Jon Florsheim, its main features are: employer contributions of 8%: life assurance of five times basic salary: permanent health insurance: and spouses pension on death.
Where the benefits provided to Executive Directors under the scheme are restricted as a result of the notional earnings cap described above, further provision is made by making a payment of 20% in cash of the amount by which his basic salary exceeds the cap in respect of Martin Bennett, and 8% into the HMP in respect of Jon Florsheim.
No changes were made to the pension arrangements following recent changes in the tax regime.
HomeServe 73 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Remuneration report Non-Executive Directors Non-Executive Directors serve under letters of appointment for periods of three years.
Previously these letters included provisions in respect of liquidated damages limited to the payment of one years fee.
This provision was removed in 2009 10.
The Non-Executive Directors therefore have a notice period of three months but no liquidated damages are payable.
Their fees are determined by the Executive Directors within the limits set by the Articles of Association and are based on information on fees paid in similar companies and the skills and expected time commitment of the individual concerned.
Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to bonus payments or pension arrangements, nor do they participate in the Companys long-term incentive plans.
Details of their current three year appointments are as follows: Name of Director Date of contract J M B Gibson 1 April 2010 I Chippendale 1 January 2010 S David 23 November 2010 A Sibbald 1 June 2010 M Morris 27 February 2009 The fees for the Non-Executive Directors were last reviewed in January 2010 with the changes being effective from 1 April 2010.
During the year the base Board fee was 44,000 with a premium for Chairmanship of the Audit and Remuneration Committees of 8,500.
Ian Chippendale received an additional fee of 5,000 for his role as Senior Independent Director and Barry Gibson received 200,000 for his role as Chairman.
No increase is proposed for 2011 12.

As disclosed in last years Remuneration report, under the terms of his contract, he was entitled to participate in the bonus plan for 2010 11.
A payment equivalent to 20% of his bonus entitlement was paid on termination this being the portion which would have been assessed on personal targets.
The remainder of the 2010 11 bonus was subject to the same profit related target as was applied to the other Executive Directors.

Under its terms, Executive Directors were able to invest some or all of their annual bonus into shares and to defer receipt for three years.
Matching shares could be earned if the TSR of the Company over a three year period exceeded the median of the FTSE-350 index of companies excluding investment trusts.
Mr Harpin elected to convert his vested award granted on 2 August 2005 into a nil cost option at the end of the performance period.
The option can be exercised at any time up until tenth anniversary of grant.
The table below demonstrates the vesting of matching shares under the DBP according to TSR growth: TSR performance Matching ratio Below median Nil Median 0.5:1 Median upper decile 0.5:1-3 on a straight line basis Upper decile 3:1 1 TSR is averaged over the three months prior to the beginning end of the performance period.
At the end of the performance period for the 2007 awards, HomeServes TSR performance was ranked between median and upper decile against the constituents of the FTSE 350 Index.
Accordingly 2.48 matching shares vested for each invested share out of a maximum three matching shares for each invested share.
The price of an ordinary share on 21 September 2010, the date on which the 2007 invested shares vested was 4.657.
