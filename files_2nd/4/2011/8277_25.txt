The Committee also reviews the balance of fixed and variable remuneration provided to the wider management population, to ensure these are appropriate relative to the Executive Directors and to market practice.
The next section shows the components of total remuneration for each Executive Director.
Introduction of claw back in incentive plans For awards made from 2012, the ABP and LTIP will allow Committee discretion to claw back unvested share awards in the following exceptional circumstances: serious misconduct that causes significant damage or potential damage to IHGs prospects, finances or brand reputation: and or actions that lead to material misstatement of accounts.
This change is further to ensure that there is proper alignment between rewards and shareholder returns and is in line with developing market practice in relation to share-based incentive plans.

Performance graph Throughout 2011, the Company was a member of the FTSE 100 index and, for remuneration purposes, used a TSR comparator group of the DJGH index.
Accordingly, the Committee has determined that these are the most appropriate market indices against which to test the Companys performance.
The graph below shows the TSR performance of IHG from 31 December 2006 to 31 December 2011, assuming dividends are reinvested, compared with the TSR performance achieved by the FTSE 100 index and the DJGH index.
Over the five-year period, IHGs TSR performance increased by just under 4%.
Over the last three years, it out-performed the FTSE 100 index and the DJGH index.

THE BOARD, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND GROUP FINANCIAL PARENT COMPANY OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION Remuneration report 63 11.
Non-Executive Directors pay policy and structure Non-Executive Directors are paid a fee which is agreed by the Board and the Chairman, taking into account fees paid in other companies of a similar complexity.
These fees also reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of the roles.
Accordingly, higher fees are payable to the Senior Independent Director who chairs the Audit Committee and to the Chairmen of the Remuneration and Corporate Responsibility Committees, reflecting the additional responsibilities of these roles.
The Chairmans fees are agreed by the Committee.
Non-Executive Directors fee levels are reviewed annually.
In the final quarter of 2011 an increase of approximately 2% for the Non-Executive Directors was agreed from 1 January 2012.
This increase is broadly in line with anticipated salary increases for executive and senior management employees across the wider organisation.
The Chairman waived any right to an increase in respect of his fees for 2012.
The following table sets out the change in annual fee rates from 2011 to 2012 for the Non-Executive Directors: Fees at Fees at 1 Jan 2012 1 Jan 2011 Director Role David Webster Chairman 406,000 406,000 David Kappler Senior Independent Director and Chairman of Audit Committee 105,060 103,000 Luke Mayhew Chairman of Remuneration Committee 88,230 Jennifer Laing Chairman of Corporate Responsibility Committee 77,520 76,000 Others Non-Executive Director 66,300 65,000 Luke Mayhew became Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on 1 July 2011.
Service contracts Policy The Committees policy is for Executive Directors to have rolling contracts with a notice period of 12 months.
Richard Solomons, Thomas Singer, Kirk Kinsell and Tracy Robbins have service agreements with a notice period of 12 months.
All new appointments will have 12-month notice periods, unless, on an exceptional basis to complete an external recruitment successfully, a longer initial notice period reducing to 12 months is used, in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
No provisions for compensation for termination following change of control, nor for liquidated damages of any kind, are included in the current Directors contracts.
In the event of any early termination of an Executive Directors contract, the policy is to seek to minimise any liability.
Current Executive Directors hold no non-executive directorships of other companies.
However, the Company recognises that its Executive Directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies and that such duties can broaden experience and knowledge, and benefit the Company.
Executive Directors are, therefore, permitted to accept one non-executive appointment in addition to any positions where the Director is appointed as the Groups representative, subject to Board approval, as long as this is not, in the reasonable opinion of the Board, likely to lead to a conflict of interest.
Executive Directors are generally authorised to retain the fees received.
Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment.
David Websters appointment as Non-Executive Chairman, effective from 1 January 2004, is subject to six months notice.
All Directors appointments and subsequent reappointments are subject to election and re-election by shareholders.
Biographies of each of the Directors and their main responsibilities can be found on pages 42 and 43.

THE BOARD, SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND GROUP FINANCIAL PARENT COMPANY OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION Remuneration report 65 Directors pension benefits The following information relates to the pension arrangements provided for Messrs Cosslett and Solomons under the executive defined benefit section of the IC Plan and the unfunded ICETUS.
Mr Cosslett ceased to be a Director on 1 July 2011.
The executive section of the IC Plan is a funded, registered, final salary, occupational pension scheme.
The main features applicable to the Executive Directors are: a normal pension age of 60: 1 pension accrual of 30th of final pensionable salary for each year of pensionable service: life assurance cover of four times pensionable salary: pensions payable in the event of ill health: and spouses, partners and dependants pensions on death.
When benefits would otherwise exceed a members lifetime or annual allowance under the post-April 2011 pensions regime, these benefits are limited in the IC Plan, but the balance is provided instead by ICETUS.
The defined benefit section of the IC Plan will close to future accruals by existing members with effect from 1 July 2013.
ICETUS will also close to future accruals with effect from 1 July 2013.
James Abrahamson, who ceased to be a Director on 13 June 2011, has retirement benefits provided via the Six Continents Hotels, Inc.
Kirk Kinsell has retirement benefits provided via the 401 k Retirement Plan for employees of Six Continents Hotels, Inc. 401 k and the DCP.
The 401 k is a tax qualified plan providing benefits on a defined contribution basis, with the member and the relevant company both contributing.
The DCP is a non-tax qualified plan, providing benefits on a defined contribution basis, with the member and the relevant company both contributing.
Tracy Robbins participates in the executive defined contribution section of the IC Plan.
This section of the IC Plan is a funded, registered, defined contribution, occupational pension scheme.
The main features applicable are: a normal pension age of 60: employee contributions of 7.5% of salary and company matching contributions of 30% of salary subject to the Annual Allowance, with any excess over the Annual Allowance as a salary supplement in lieu of pension benefits : life assurance cover of four times pensionable salary: and lump sum contributions payable in the event of ill health.
The following table sets out the pension benefits of the Executive Directors in the UK defined benefit plans: Andrew Richard 1 2 Cosslett Solomons 3 Directors contributions in the year 20,400 26,000 Transfer value of accrued benefits at 1 January 2011 3,438,100 4,708,400 Transfer value of accrued benefits at 31 December 2011 5,643,300 6,999,800 Increase in transfer value over the year, less Directors contributions 2,184,800 2,265,400 4 Absolute increase in accrued pension per annum 18,500 65,100 5 Increase in accrued pension per annum 10,300 52,900 6 Accrued pension at 31 December 2011 per annum 180,000 304,300 Age at 31 December 2011 56 50 1 W hen Andrew Cosslett ceased pensionable service with the Group on 30 June 2011, under the terms of the IC Plan his pension entitlement was 177,800 per annum before any cash commutation.
In line with the Enhanced Early Retirement Facility EERF which is available to all members of the plan, this pension was not reduced on retirement.
This facility enables members to retire without reduction in pension if they are within five years of normal retirement age.
Although the EERF is non-contractual, its continuation formed part of the agreement with trustees on closure of the defined benefit section of the IC Plan, and the provisions of the facility state that while in place, it cannot reasonably be refused to retiring employees.
2 T he increase in the transfer value of accrued benefits for Richard Solomons arises partly from the increase in salary resulting from his appointment as Chief Executive and partly from a change in the transfer value basis resulting from lower gilt yields.
3 Contributions paid in 2011 by the Directors under the terms of the plans.
Contributions were 5% of full pensionable salary.
4 The absolute increase in accrued pension during 2011.
5 The increase in accrued pension during 2011, excluding any increase for inflation.
