com Group PLC Annual Report 2011 Directors Remuneration Report continued Remuneration policy and objectives The principal objective of the remuneration policy is to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors of appropriate calibre and experience who are focused and adequately incentivised to successfully execute the Groups short-term and long-term strategy.
The Remuneration Committee believes that this requires: The provision of mid-market base salaries with appropriate leverage to reward sustained exceptional performance provided stretching and demanding performance conditions are met.
A reward structure that balances short-term and long-term performance.
Competitive incentive arrangements that are underpinned by a balance of financial and operational performance metrics to provide both a focus on business performance and alignment with the interests of shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the remuneration of Executive Directors should provide an appropriate balance between fixed and variable performance related pay elements with a significant proportion of potential total remuneration being performance related elements.
The chart below illustrates the average mix between the fixed and variable elements of remuneration of the Executive Directors for target and maximum performance.
Target Maximum 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Basic Bonus LTIPs The Remuneration Committee will continue to review the remuneration policy to ensure it remains consistent with best remuneration practice and is aligned to shareholders interests.

1 Based on market price at date of grant.
These figures relate to the maximum available if the performance targets are met in full, representing 150% of the actual awards made.
2 The Deputy Chairman does not participate in the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan.
In order for the annual grants to vest, the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that such vesting is justified when taking into account the underlying financial performance of the Group.
The Remuneration Committee chose the combination of absolute TSR and comparative TSR as the performance targets for the 2011 award under the Long Term Incentive Plan to maintain close alignment of management with shareholder interests and to incentivise management to generate long-term sustainable returns for shareholders.
For 2012, the Remuneration Committee has decided to amend the performance conditions so that 70% of the award will be based on an absolute EBITDA CAGR performance condition set at an appropriately stretching level and 30% of the award will be based on a comparative TSR performance condition.
The Remuneration Committee has amended the performance condition to focus the Executive Directors on EBITDA growth which is a measure that further aligns the Executive Directors with the Companys emerging strategic priorities, whilst retaining an element of the award aligned to comparative TSR.
The Remuneration Committee will meet once the results for the three year plan period are available to determine whether, and the extent to which, the performance conditions have been met.
Dividends will accrue on any shares that vest in the form either of additional shares or a cash payment and will be made at the time of vesting.
