72 Governance Remuneration Report Letter from the Remuneration Committees chairman Dear Shareholder I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committees Annual Report on directors remuneration.
The Groups management has delivered good results in a transformational year that saw the acquisition of The PBSJ Corporation.
This acquisition was a material step in our multi-skill, multi-local strategy and the enlarged Group provides a strong platform from which to realise our vision to become the worlds best infrastructure consultancy.
During the year the Committee was once again mindful of the pay restraint which had been exercised across the Group.
The salaries of the executive directors were increased in October 2010 following the completion of the PBSJ acquisition.
The modest increases of 3% compared to an average increase of 2.91% for the Groups wider workforce.
The increases for Keith Clarke, chief executive, and Alun Griffiths, group HR director, were the first since April 2008 and followed the waiver of 10% of salary made by all executive directors during 2009 10.
However, following a detailed benchmarking exercise it was concluded that the salaries of Heath Drewett and Alun Griffiths were behind the market rate.
The Committee also recognised the increasing demands placed on the executive directors as a consequence of the international expansion of the Group whilst they maintained good financial results during difficult economic times in a number of its markets.
Accordingly, their salaries were increased by 10.2% with effect from 1 April 2011.
The Committee recognises that these are significant increases in the current climate but considers that they are necessary and in the interests of shareholders.
During 2011 the Committee intends to review the bonus and long term incentive arrangements.
The Committee is conscious that the implementation of our strategy has changed the Groups geographic footprint and increased the complexity of the business.
However, there have been no significant changes made to management incentives since 2006.
The Committee therefore believes that it is an opportune time to consider the existing arrangements and ensure they are appropriate for the international markets in which the Group operates and to ensure that management is incentivised to continue to deliver on our strategy.
Any significant changes will be discussed with our major shareholders and, where appropriate, approval will be sought at next years AGM.
A resolution to vote for this remuneration report will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.
I very much hope that you will support it.

com investors tor The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is a committee of the Board.
Its terms of reference are available on the Companys website www.
com or on request from the company secretary.
The Committee has responsibility for setting remuneration policy and structure for the Companys chairman and executive directors.
The Committee also has oversight of remuneration practice across the Group.
Committee membership The independent non-executive directors who served on the Committee during the year are shown in table 1.
Table 1: Members of the Committee during the year Member From To Admiral the Lord Boyce 5 May 2004 To date Fiona Clutterbuck 15 June 2009 To date Raj Rajagopal 1 March 2009 To date Sir Peter Williams chairman 6 May 2005 To date The Committee met seven times during the year.
Details of the attendance of members at meetings can be found in the Corporate Governance Report.
Committee meetings are attended by the Group HR director, Alun Griffiths.
The chairman, Allan Cook, and the chief executive, Keith Clarke, also attend meetings at the discretion of the Committee chairman.
The company secretary, Richard Webster, acts as secretary to the Committee.
No director or other attendee, including the company secretary, participates in discussions regarding their own remuneration.
During the year the Committee continued to receive advice from Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS, a brand of Aon Hewitt Limited, on remuneration policy and structure.
HNBS also monitored the Companys total shareholder return TSR performance.
Neither HNBS nor Aon Hewitt provided any other material services to the Group.
Linklaters LLP provided legal advice with respect to share plans.
Linklaters also provides other legal services to the Group.
The Committee also consulted the chief executive, the Group HR director and the company secretary regarding remuneration policy.
Committee activities In April each year employees receive confirmation of their remuneration for the year ahead.
This communication includes salary and, where appropriate, bonus targets and intended share awards.
Bonuses for the financial year ended 31 March 2011 will be declared to staff immediately following the announcement of the Groups preliminary results in June.
The Committee therefore has a schedule of standing agenda items which align to this reward communication programme.
In addition to these items, the Committee meets to discuss remuneration policy and market practice.
A summary of the key matters discussed during the previous financial year is shown in table 2.

The Committee endeavours to ensure that: the fixed elements of our remuneration are competitive, enabling us to attract and retain staff the variable elements of our remuneration are linked directly to Group performance approximately half of total target remuneration, both fixed and variable elements, is linked directly to annual bonus and the long term creation of shareholder value.
Figure 1 illustrates the key elements of remuneration for each executive director.
Figure 1: Key remuneration elements Target 49% 16% 8% 27% Stretch 33% 22% 11% 33% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Salary Bonus DSP LTIP Target performance includes a target bonus and associated Atkins Deferred Share Plan DSP award of 50% of salary and 55% vesting of the annual Atkins Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP award.
Stretch performance illustrates a stretch bonus and associated DSP award of 100% of salary and 100% vesting of the annual LTIP award.
The illustration does not include any share price growth, the benefit of dividends on the DSP and LTIP awards or other benefits for example, cash car allowance, value of private medical insurance and participation in all employee share ownership plans.
Fixed elements of reward Salary Purpose To ensure that we remain competitive, attracting and retaining the best staff To reflect skills and experience Delivery Monthly Cash Policy Annual review in March with changes effective from April and further reviews following changes in responsibilities or as dictated by market conditions Benchmarked against published salary data for FTSE 250 companies and a bespoke comparator group to ensure that salaries remain market competitive In March 2010, the Committee decided to delay the 2010 11 executive director pay review until the outlook for the Company and pay conditions across the Group were better known.
On 1 April 2010 the salaries of Keith Clarke and Alun Griffiths therefore reverted to the same levels prior to the 10% salary waiver which applied during 2009 10.
The salary of Heath Drewett, who was appointed during the previous financial year, had been reduced by 10% on appointment to reflect the waivers which his fellow directors had put in place.
Following the end of these waivers, Heath Drewetts salary was therefore increased by 10%.
In October 2010, the Committee considered the salaries of the executive directors.
The review sought to ensure that salaries were appropriate within the markets in which the Group recruits and seeks to retain staff.
The Committee also considered detailed benchmarking data and analysis provided by HNBS.
As a result, the salaries of the executive directors were increased by 3% with effect from 1 October 2010.
This compared to an average salary increase for 2010 11 for all staff in the Group of 2.91% during the financial year.
In March 2011, the Committee once again decided to delay the annual executive director pay review until the pay reviews for all staff had been completed.
In June the Committee implemented pay increases with effect from 1 April 2011 of 10.2% for Heath Drewett, group finance director, and Alun Griffiths, group HR director.
The Committee was conscious that the increasing internationalisation of the Group, particularly following the acquisition of PBSJ, had significantly increased the demands placed upon the executive directors whilst they continued to ensure that the Company performed well in challenging markets.
In addition, these increases followed concern from the Committee that executive directors salaries were falling behind the market and that this would hinder our ability to attract and retain key staff in the future.
This opinion was confirmed during the Companys global search to identify a potential successor to the position of chief executive.
The increases compared to an average salary increase as at 1 April 2011 for all staff in the Group of around 2.2%.
Keith Clarke, who will retire as a director and chief executive on 31 July 2011, did not receive an increase.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2011 Introduction Reviews Governance Financial Statements Investor information Governance 75 The salaries of the executive directors during the year and to the date of this report are shown in table 3.

An additional employer contribution of 3% of salary per annum was made until 30 September 2010.
This transitional contribution was payable to all members of the Atkins Pension Plan affected by the closure of the scheme to future accrual.
The maximum company contribution to other UK based staff is 10% of salary.
Alun Griffiths retains an entitlement to a defined benefit pension on the same basis as other long serving UK employees.
The pension contributions made to a pension plan on behalf of the executive directors during the year ended 31 March 2011 are set out in table 5.

Keith Clarke receives an additional cash payment of 25% of his salary in lieu of a contribution to a defined contribution pension plan.
Heath Drewett makes no personal contributions.
Alun Griffiths contributes 5% of his salary and an additional 2% of his salary as a voluntary contribution.

Variable elements of reward Annual bonus Purpose To incentivise delivery of corporate objectives and strategy To provide the opportunity to increase total remuneration in return for achieving challenging performance targets Delivery Annual award Two-thirds in cash One-third via deferred share award Dividend equivalent payment on deferred share award Policy Total bonus opportunity of 100% of salary 10% of total bonus for achieving personal key performance targets 90% of total bonus based on achieving a Group financial target, 50% paid for meeting budgeted profit after tax target and 100% for meeting stretch target Non-pensionable and non-contractual Take account of quality, safety and environmental performance when making bonus awards Annual bonus payments via our Executive Bonus Scheme EBS reward in-year performance.
However, executive directors are required to defer one-third of any bonus they receive in the form of an award of shares under the terms of the Atkins Deferred Share Plan DSP.
The DSP provides each director with a direct link to the Companys share price performance.
Interests are further aligned with those of our shareholders via the delivery of a cash payment following release of the award equal to the value of dividends declared on each share which makes up the award following grant.
The DSP also seeks to aid retention with the awards being subject to forfeiture on resignation within three years of grant.
The Group exceeded budget for the year ended 31 March 2011 but did not meet the full stretch target.
Each of the executive directors also had personal key performance targets for the financial year which were met in part.
The Committee considered quality, safety and environmental performance when making the bonus awards.
Annual bonuses payable to the executive directors are shown in table 7.
Around 1,100 staff will receive a bonus payment which reflected achievement against a combination of targets comprising Group financial performance, business financial performance and personal objectives.
In addition, around 30% of other staff will receive a discretionary bonus.
Heath Drewett was appointed on 15 June 2009 and his 2010 bonus was pro-rated to reflect his period of employment.
The increase decrease reflects the increase in bonus had the pro-rating not taken place.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2011 Introduction Reviews Governance Financial Statements Investor information Governance 77 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Purpose To incentivise delivery of corporate objective to create long term shareholder value measured by growth in normalised diluted EPS and the delivery of strong relative TSR To provide the opportunity to increase total remuneration in return for superior performance Delivery Annual award Shares Variable dependent on performance over three year period Dividend equivalent payment Policy Maximum annual award of 150% of salary Three year performance period 50% of the award is subject to TSR performance relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts on the date of award 50% of the award is subject to the Groups growth in normalised diluted EPS over the performance period relative to inflation The purpose of the LTIP is to reward executive directors for longer term performance.
Half of each award is subject to our TSR performance which seeks to ensure that executives are motivated to deliver returns that are at least at the median of those delivered by FTSE 250 companies excluding investment trusts over the same period.
In addition, the performance condition applied to the second half of each award endeavours to reward the delivery of the Companys primary objective to create long term shareholder value measured by growth in EPS.
The performance measure for each award is shown in tables 8 and 9.
Table 8: LTIP TSR performance measure Atkins TSR relative to the comparator group % of award that vests Upper quartile 100 Between median and upper quartile Pro rata between 30% and 100% on a straight line basis Median 30 Below Median 0 Table 9: LTIP EPS performance measure Atkins EPS growth above RPI % of award that vests 10% or greater per annum 100 Between 4% and 10% per annum Pro rata between 30% and 100% on a straight line basis 4% per annum 30 Below 4% per annum 0 Each executive director will receive an LTIP award following the announcement of the Groups preliminary results.

Potential value based on the Companys share price as at 1 April 2011 and salary as at 31 March 2011.
The Committee has considered the mixed vesting history of the LTIP, shown in table 11, in great detail in light of the Companys strong performance in challenging markets, the continued delivery of the Companys strategy and also relative to other design and engineering consultancies and a wider peer group.
The Committee intends to review incentive provision, particularly the measures of long term performance, during 2011 to ensure that the LTIP continues to provide an appropriate incentive and retention tool for our key talent and to improve the link between performance and vesting.
If, following this review, the Committee considers changes are necessary it will consult with major shareholders and, if required, seek shareholder approval at next years AGM.

In addition, it regularly reviews the remuneration of staff throughout the Group thereby ensuring that the Committee is attuned to general pay and conditions when fixing the remuneration of the executive directors.
The fixed and variable elements of remuneration for the Groups senior executives are broadly consistent with those of the executive directors with two important exceptions.
As reported in the Human Resources Review, pay levels have remained flat in many markets in which we operate with targeted increases having been awarded.
Overall, for the third year running, pay levels have increased by less than inflation.
To mitigate the impact on staff, all participants in the EBS, other than the executive directors, will be paid their bonus entirely in cash with the normal one-third deferral waived for this year.
Only the executive directors will receive LTIP awards in 2011.
Share awards to other staff will be made via the DSP.
Executive directors contracts The service agreements of the executive directors are summarised in table 12.
Table 12: Executive directors service agreements Notice period Effective date Unexpired term months Contract date of contract of contract Keith Clarke 12 12 September 2003 1 October 2003 Rolling contract Heath Drewett 12 17 April 2009 15 June 2009 Rolling contract Alun Griffiths 12 18 April 2007 13 March 2007 Rolling contract In the event of unsatisfactory performance, the notice period for the executive directors is reduced to three months.
Their service agreements include a duty to mitigate loss where the agreement is terminated and any payment in lieu of notice may be reduced to take account of such mitigation.
No service agreement provides for predetermined amounts of compensation in the event of early termination of service contracts.
The service agreements are terminable on giving 12 months notice.
Copies of each directors service agreement will be available for inspection prior to and during the AGM and are also available for inspection at the Companys registered office during normal business hours.
During the process to identify a successor to the position of chief executive the Committee identified that the provision in the executive directors service agreements enabling the Company to terminate with three months notice for unsatisfactory performance was unusual and concluded that this would hinder the Companys ability to recruit in the international market for talent.
As a consequence the Committee has resolved to remove this provision from the service agreements.
The Committee, in making this change, will include provision for the Company to make phased payments in the event that the agreement is terminated on giving 12 months notice.
All other principal terms will remain unchanged.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2011 Introduction Reviews Governance Financial Statements Investor information Governance 79 Uwe Krueger Uwe Krueger was appointed as an executive director and chief executive designate on 14 June 2011.
Uwe will succeed Keith Clarke as chief executive on 1 August 2011.
The Company undertook a robust succession planning exercise to identify a suitable successor to the position of chief executive in the event that Keith Clarke decided to retire from the position.
The key elements of Uwe Kruegers remuneration package are shown in table 13.
Table 13: Key elements of Uwe Kruegers remuneration Remuneration element Value Annual salary 550,000 Annual bonus opportunity 125% of annual basic salary Annual LTIP award 100% of salary Employers pension contribution 25% of annual salary Annual car allowance 13,200 Private medical insurance Worldwide family cover Annual rental allowance for the first twelve months following appointment 39,000 Life Assurance 7 times annual salary Annual professional advice allowance on receipt of invoices up to 15,000 In determining the package offered to Uwe Krueger, the Committee took into account the current remuneration packages of the candidates considered to have the range of skills and experience necessary for the role of chief executive.
The Committee also considered the results of an extensive benchmarking exercise conducted by HNBS.
This included target and actual remuneration against several comparators within a bespoke group of organisations engaged in similar or related activities to the Company the bespoke group, the FTSE 250 and a smaller benchmark group weighted by market capitalisation and turnover the weighted group.
The agreed package is within the upper quartile for the bespoke group, many of which are significantly smaller in size and complexity than the Company and slightly ahead of the median for the weighted group.
The Committee concluded that the package was necessary to attract and retain a new chief executive in the international market for talent.
The Company did not buy out any of Uwe Kruegers existing share awards or lost bonus entitlements.
Chairman and non-executive directors The chairman and non-executive directors have letters of appointment stating their annual fee.
To date their appointment has been for an initial term of three years subject to satisfactory performance and their re-election at forthcoming AGMs.
From the 2011 AGM onwards each will stand for annual re-election.
Their appointment may be terminated with six months written notice at any time.
Table 14 summarises the dates of appointment and most recent re-election dates for the chairman and each of the non-executive directors.
Table 14: Dates of appointment and most recent re-election dates for the chairman and each of the non-executive directors Name of director Date of appointment as a non-executive director Date of last re-election at AGM Admiral the Lord Boyce 5 May 2004 9 September 2009 Fiona Clutterbuck 13 March 2007 9 September 2010 Allan Cook 10 September 2009 9 September 2010 Joanne Curin 10 February 2009 9 September 2009 Raj Rajagopal 24 June 2008 3 September 2008 Sir Peter Williams 5 May 2004 9 September 2010 Copies of the letters of appointment of the chairman and non-executive directors will be available for inspection prior to and during the AGM and are also available for inspection at the Companys registered office during normal business hours.
The remuneration of the chairman is determined by the Committee.
The Committee considered Allan Cooks remuneration during the year.
In undertaking its review, the Committee considered: its desire to reflect his significant increased time commitment to a geographically diverse organisation: and the ongoing suitability of his taxable expense allowance, which allowed him to claim up to a maximum of 10,000 per annum for travel and accommodation in connection with visits to the Groups London and Epsom offices from his home in Scotland.
As a consequence of the significant activity during the year, particularly in connection with the acquisition of PBSJ, the taxable expense allowance was exceeded which the Committee approved in the specific circumstances.
For future years, the Committee concluded it was appropriate to replace the taxable expense allowance with an increase in Allan Cooks annual fee.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2011 Investor information Financial Statements Governance Reviews Introduction 80 Governance Remuneration Report continued The Committee resolved that it was appropriate to award an increase in fee of 18.8%.
This is an increase of 11.76% on his previous package fee and expenses allowance.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors has, to date, been determined biennially by the Board on the recommendation of the executive directors within the limits set out in the articles of association.
This recommendation has been made on the basis of independent advice and the level of fees paid to non-executive directors of comparator companies.
Mindful of salary constraints within the Group the Board delayed the 2010 biennial review until October.
At this October review the basic annual fee was increased by 8.1%, the first increase since 2008.
However, the fee is now inclusive of normal travel expenses for travelling to and from the Groups Epsom or London offices.
Expenses are still payable on all travel and subsistence to offices outside these areas in accordance with the Groups normal policy.
It was also agreed that future reviews would be undertaken annually with the first such review scheduled to take place in March 2012.
The annual fees are specific to each director reflecting their individual commitments to the Board and various Board committees.
The current fee structure is shown in table 15.
Table 15: Chairman and non-executive directors fees Fee as at 1 October 2010 Fee description Fee as at 1 April 2010 and 1 April 2011 Increase 1 2 3 Chairman fee 160,000 190,000 18.8% Basic annual fee 37,000 40,000 8.1% Committee chair annual fee 6,000 6,000 1 Committee annual fee 3,000 3,000 1.
No fee is paid in respect of chairmanship or membership of the Nomination Committee.
An annual expenses allowance of 10,000 per annum for travel and accommodation in connection with visits to the Groups London and Epsom offices was also payable.
An annual expenses allowance in connection with visits to the Groups London and Epsom offices is no longer payable and was replaced with an increase in Allan Cooks annual fee.
The chairman and the non-executive directors are not eligible for pensions, share incentives, annual bonus or any similar payments other than out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the performance of their duties.
The chairman and the non-executive directors do not participate in any meeting at which discussions in respect of matters relating to their own position take place.
External appointments The Board and the Committee recognise the benefit we can obtain if our executive directors serve as non-executive directors of other companies.
Subject to review in each case, the Boards general policy is that each executive director may accept one non-executive directorship with another FTSE 350 company from which any fees received may be retained.
At present no executive director holds such an appointment.
All employee share plan The Company operates a Share Incentive Plan, as approved by HM Revenue & Customs, which is offered to all eligible UK employees, including the executive directors.
Dilution DSP share awards can only be satisfied using market purchase shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust EBT.
LTIP share awards can be satisfied using new issue shares, shares held in treasury or market purchase shares held in the EBT.
The Committee reviews the hedging and dilution position of the Company at least bi-annually prior to making grants under the DSP or LTIP.
At 31 March 2011 the EBT held 1,892,142 shares to hedge outstanding awards over 3,964,699 shares.
At this date the EBT held shares to satisfy 47.7% of all outstanding awards.
No new issue shares have been used to satisfy share awards since 2005 and, to date, no treasury shares have been used.
Investment in shares Each executive director is encouraged to hold shares in the Company either directly or through share awards made in connection with annual bonuses equivalent to the level of their annual salary, based on the value of such shares at the time of their acquisition or award, or their current market value from time to time, whichever is the higher.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2011 Introduction Reviews Governance Financial Statements Investor information Governance 81 The interests of the directors and their families in the ordinary shares of 0.5p each in the Company as at 31 March 2011 are shown in table 16.
Changes in directors interests of Keith Clarke, Heath Drewett and Alun Griffiths between 31 March 2011 and 15 June 2011 relate to shares acquired via the Atkins Share Incentive Plan.
Heath Drewett was appointed as a director on 15 June 2009.
Uwe Krueger was appointed as a director on 14 June 2011.
Details of the share options and long term incentives of each executive director as at 31 March 2011 are given in table 17.

Subject to performance criteria described in note 32 to the Financial Statements.
Following the exceptional write down in relation to Metronet, the Companys EPS for the financial year ended 31 March 2007 was 56.8 p. The consequence of this was that any LTIP awards made in 2007 would never be capable of vesting.
Pursuant to the rules of the plan, the Remuneration Committee considered that it was appropriate to remove profit in respect of discontinued operations and the exceptional loss in respect of Metronet and that the EPS for the financial year ending immediately before the commencement of the performance period for the 2007 awards be deemed to be 57.3p.
In 2009 the Remuneration Committee considered the impact of the 7.0m tax benefit from the purchase of prior year consortium relief from the Metronet companies and concluded that the non-trading nature of this benefit was not a fair reflection of underlying earnings.
Pursuant to the rules of the plan, the Remuneration Committee considered it was appropriate to remove the benefit of this item and that the EPS for the financial year ending immediately before the commencement of the performance period for the 2009 award was 76.4p.
In 2010 the Remuneration Committee considered the impact of the expiry of a letter of credit in respect of the Metronet enterprise and the related provision giving rise to a one-off, non-cash pre-tax credit of 25m in the Groups income statement for the year.
It concluded that the non-trading nature of this benefit was not a fair reflection of underlying earnings.
It was therefore excluded and the lower normalised basic EPS for the year ended 31 March 2010 of 79.4p was used to calculate the vesting of LTIP awards made in 2007 and was also used as the EPS for the financial year immediately before the commencement of the performance period for the 2010 awards.
The awards granted under the terms of the LTIP, DBP and the DSP are structured as options, for which the exercise price is nil.
