DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Dear Shareholder 2010 11 was an outstanding year, capping off an exceptional period for the Group.
The Group achieved tremendous growth, outpacing the recovery in the luxury sector.
The Group delivered financial results very significantly ahead of budget and brokers forecasts even though a significant amount of investment in the future of the Brand was carried out, which affected the years profits.
A number of key strategic milestones were achieved, providing a strong platform for future sustained performance.
Throughout the year, the Remuneration Committee considered the effectiveness of its incentive plans in rewarding employees for the performance of the Group and ensuring the motivation and retention of a high performing executive team, while maintaining a balance between cost and rewards for shareholders.
Against this background, the Committee awarded salary increases to the executive directors and senior management team for the first time since April 2008, and agreed annual bonus pay outs at the maximum level for the 2010 11 year.
The Restricted Share Plan and Exceptional Performance Share Plan grants partially vested in 2010.
Much of the success since 2006 has been due to Angela Ahrendts leadership and strategic vision, which the Group regards as critical over the next phase of its development.
Following consultation with major shareholders, the Remuneration Committee granted Angela an exceptional one-time award to ensure her leadership until 2015, when she will be entering her tenth year as Burberrys Chief Executive Officer.
As announced in 2010, the Remuneration Committee granted awards under the Freeshare Plan to all eligible employees, whether based in the UK or overseas.
We believe that this will encourage share ownership as well as giving all employees a stake in the continued success of Burberry.
David Tyler Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Directors Remuneration Report This report has been prepared on behalf of the Board by the Remuneration Committee.
It has been prepared in accordance with the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 the Regulations issued under the Companies Act 2006 the Act and it meets the relevant requirements of the Financial Services Authoritys Listing Rules.
The Remuneration Committee The following directors served as members of the Remuneration Committee the Committee throughout the financial year ending 31 March 2011: David Tyler Chairman Philip Bowman Ian Carter Stephanie George John Peace John Smith The Committee is responsible for setting the remuneration of the executive directors and the Chairman of the Board and monitors the level and structure of senior executive pay.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Groups website www.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is a matter for the Board as a whole.
No director is involved in any discussions as to their own remuneration.
During the year under review, the Committee met five times.
Details of attendance at those meetings is set out in the Corporate Governance Report on page 71.
At the invitation of the Committee, except where their own remuneration was being discussed, Angela Ahrendts Chief Executive Officer, Stacey Cartwright Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Reg Sindall Executive Vice President Corporate Resources, Michael Mahony Senior Vice President Commercial Affairs and General Counsel and Anne-Soline Thorndike Director of Reward and Recognition attended Committee meetings during the period under review and provided advice that materially assisted the Committee.
On 1 February 2011 the Committee appointed Towers Watson following a review of remuneration advisors to assist with its considerations.
Towers Watson provides advice on the ongoing operation of employee and executive share plans together with advice on executive remuneration.
The terms of engagement between the Committee and Towers Watson set out that any additional consulting services provided by Towers Watson to management must be reported on a regular basis to the Committee, and where an actual or potential conflict may occur that such work is agreed by the Chairman of the Committee prior to commencement.
Since their appointment Towers Watson has provided market benchmarking information to management in relation to a small number of roles which fall below the level subject to review by the Committee.
Prior to the appointment of Towers Watson, advice had been provided by Kepler Associates.
76 Burberry Group plc annual report 2010 11 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued Remuneration policy The Committee believes the Groups remuneration should be competitive and strongly linked to performance, taking into account the global markets in which it operates.
The Groups remuneration policy is based on the following principles: remuneration should be closely aligned with shareholders interests through thoughtful selection of performance measures as described on pages 81 to 83, emphasis on variable pay and delivery of a significant proportion of remuneration in shares, some of which are expected to be retained in accordance with the Groups shareholding policy: the overall remuneration framework should provide a balance between short and long-term business objectives.
Variable pay for executive directors includes 1 an annual cash bonus based on profit before tax PBT, and 2 long-term share-based incentives linked primarily to increases in shareholder value and growth in PBT.
Furthermore, the Burberry Co-Investment Plan encourages executive directors and other senior executives to invest their annual cash bonus into shares over a further three-year period: and total remuneration should be sufficient to attract, motivate and retain exceptional talent within the global luxury brands sector.
Total remuneration for executive directors and other senior executives is therefore benchmarked against the Groups main global competitors and comparable UK companies.
The Committee recognises that for each executive the relative importance of each of these benchmarks may be different.
Benefits are based on competitive market practice for each executive, depending on individual circumstances.
The Committee reviews the Groups remuneration policy on a regular basis, taking into account the performance and growth of the business and the global luxury goods sector.
The Committee also considers the Groups policy against regulatory developments, shareholder expectations and market practice.
During its deliberations on executive remuneration, the Committee took into account the key elements of remuneration policy for all employees worldwide, any merit increases and global participation in share schemes, including the Sharesave Scheme and the recently reintroduced SIP and Freeshare plans.

The mix of fixed and variable pay at target and maximum performance is illustrated below: Executive Vice President, Chief Executive officer Chief Financial officer Target Fixed Variable Cash Variable Shares Target Fixed Variable Cash Variable Shares Maximum Fixed Variable Cash Variable Shares Maximum Fixed Variable Cash Variable Shares 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Fixed Base Allowances Variable Cash Annual Bonus Variable Shares Matching Shares assuming full co-investment RSP Annualised One-Off Award to Angela Ahrendts The Group implements its remuneration policy through the provision of the following elements: Base salary The Group aims to provide salaries which are competitive with those of comparable roles at global companies of a similar size and or global reach within the luxury goods sector and to a lesser extent comparable UK companies.
These companies are representative of Burberrys competitors for executive talent.
When making salary determinations, the Committee takes into account not only competitive information but also each executives individual performance and overall contribution to the business during the year.
In 2010, the Committee awarded salary increases to the executive directors and senior management team for the first time since April 2008.
Annual Bonus Each year the Committee sets bonus targets by reference to internal and external expectations.
Bonuses for executive directors are currently based on PBT.
The Committee believes that linking incentives to profitability helps to reinforce the Groups strategy and long term growth objectives.
Targets are calibrated using benchmarks that include broker earnings estimates for Burberry and its competitors, latest projections for the then current year, budget, strategic plan, and long-term financial goals.
Actual bonus awards are subject to the discretion of the Committee.
In relation to 2010 11, the Committee agreed annual bonus pay outs for the executive directors at the maximum level, as PBT was significantly above the maximum targets set at the beginning of the financial year.

To facilitate this, executive directors and other senior executives may, at the invitation of the Committee, defer receipt of all or part of their annual bonus and invest it in Burberry shares, with up to a 2:1 match based on Group performance during the year.
The Matching Share awards, which are structured as nil-cost options, do not vest for three years and are forfeited if the executive resigns within that period.
To further link pay and performance, and to align remuneration with shareholders interests, Matching Share awards granted after 31 March 2009 are subject to secondary performance conditions: 25% of an award may vest if growth in PBT achieves 5% per annum over three years, 100% may vest if PBT growth exceeds 7% per annum, with vesting occurring on a straight line basis between these points.
None of the award shall vest if PBT growth is below 5% per annum.
For the year ended 31 March 2010, Angela Ahrendts and Stacey Cartwright chose to defer and invest the whole of their bonus after the deduction of tax into Burberry shares via the Co-Investment Plan.
The Invested Shares are included in the table below and in the table of directors interests appearing on page 85.
The related Matching Share awards under these arrangements are also shown in the table below.
2 The Matching Share awards are awarded on a gross basis and are taxed at the point of exercise.
The market value of these awards at the date of grant 9 June 2010 was 725.77p per share.
The EPP The EPP is a one-off long-term incentive plan introduced in 2007, the purpose of which was to incentivise senior management to achieve stretching goals and to help provide exceptional reward for exceptional performance.
Awards granted under the EPP, which are structured as nil-cost options, are subject to performance conditions based 50% on relative TSR performance and 50% on growth in adjusted PBT over the three and four-year performance periods to 31 March 2010 and 31 March 2011.
Awards do not vest unless Burberrys TSR exceeds the median of the comparator group or PBT growth exceeds 50% over the four-year performance period to 2010 or 75% over the five-year performance period to 2011.
For the performance period to 2010, maximum vesting required Burberrys TSR to outperform the median of its peers by at least 8% per annum and PBT growth of at least 75%.
For the performance period to 2011, maximum vesting requires Burberrys TSR to outperform the median of its peers by at least 7% per annum and PBT growth of at least 100%.
Vesting against each metric occurs on a straight line basis between threshold and maximum.
Of the shares which vest based on the achievement of the performance conditions, 50% vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant based on performance to 2010 and the remaining 50% vest on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant based on performance to 2011.
The TSR group for this award comprised Bulgari, Coach, Compagnie Financire Richemont, Este Lauder, Fossil, Geox, Herms International, Hugo Boss, Inditex, Liz Claiborne, Luxottica Group, LVMH Mot Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Nike, Nordstrom, Polo Ralph Lauren, PPR, Saks, Swatch, Tiffany & Co, and Tods.
In reviewing the EPP award vesting in 2010, the Committee took into account the relative financial performance achieved and the excellent progress in implementation of the medium term business plan.
The Committee chose, after notifying major shareholders, to use a local currency basis to determine vesting of the relative TSR element.
The portion of the award due to vest in 2011 will be calculated in the same manner.
Burberry Group plc annual report 2010 11 81 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued The interests of the executive directors in share awards granted under this plan as at 31 March 2011 were as follows: Number of ordinary shares As at Lapsed Exercised As at Date of 1 April during the during the 31 March grant 2010 year year 2011 Vesting date Expiry date 1 2 Angela Ahrendts 26 07 2007 425,000 295,375 129,625 26 07 2010 25 07 2012 425,000 425,000 26 07 2011 25 07 2012 1 3 Stacey Cartwright 26 07 2007 175,000 121,625 53,375 26 07 2010 25 07 2012 175,000 175,000 26 07 2011 25 07 2012 Total 1,200,000 417,000 183,000 600,000 1 Following the calculation of the achievement of the performance conditions attaching to the awards vesting on 26 July 2010, whereby the relative TSR target was partially met and the PBT growth measure was not met, 69.5% of these awards lapsed.
2 The market value of Burberry shares on the date of exercise 6 August 2010 was 865.1p.
3 The market value of Burberry shares on the date of exercise 23 November 2010 was 1,017.8p.
The RSP Under the RSP which was introduced in 2004, executives may be awarded shares, structured as nil-cost options, up to a maximum value of two times base salary per annum.
The vesting of awards granted under the RSP is based 50% on Burberrys three-year TSR relative to its peers and 50% on three-year growth in PBT.
Awards granted between 2004 and 2007 vest in full only if Burberry achieves at least upper quartile TSR relative to its global peers and at least 15% per annum PBT growth.
A proportion of an award 12.5% may vest if TSR performance exceeds the median of the peer group or if PBT growth exceeds 5% per annum over three years.
Of the shares which meet the performance criteria, 50% vests after three years.
The remaining 50% vests in two equal tranches on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant.
Awards granted in 2009 and 2010 will vest in full only if Burberry achieves at least upper quartile TSR relative to its global peers and at least 10% per annum PBT growth.
A proportion of an award 12.5% may vest if TSR performance exceeds the median of the peer group or if PBT growth exceeds 3% per annum over three years.
The Committee believes that these performance conditions were as challenging, given the significant changes in the economic environment, as those set when the RSP was adopted in 2004.
The Committee chose TSR relative to a group of Burberrys peers because it provides an objective measure of the Groups success and aligns with shareholder interests.
Growth in PBT was chosen as it continues to be the primary measure used by management and the Committee believes strong growth in pre-tax profit is key to delivering superior shareholder returns.
The TSR group for awards granted in 2004 and 2005 comprised Barneys New York, Bulgari, Christian Dior, Coach, Compagnie Financire Richemont, Herms International, Hugo Boss, IT Holding, LVMH Mot Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Movado, Neiman-Marcus, Polo Ralph Lauren, PPR, Saks, Swatch, Tiffany & Co, Tods, Tommy Hilfiger and Waterford Wedgewood.
Barneys New York, NeimanMarcus and Tommy Hilfiger ceased to be listed and were replaced in 2006 by Estee Lauder, Fossil, Liz Claiborne and Nordstrom.
Following review by the Committee in 2007, Christian Dior, IT Holding, Movado and Waterford Wedgewood were replaced by Geox, Inditex, Luxottica Group and Nike.
2 The market value of Burberry shares on the date of grant 10 June 2010 was 784p.
3 Following the calculation of the achievement of the performance conditions attaching to these awards, 57.5% lapsed.

5 The market value of Burberry shares on the date of exercise 23 November 2010 was 1,017.8p.
One-Off Award to Angela Ahrendts Following consultation with the Companys major shareholders, the Remuneration Committee granted Angela Ahrendts a one-off nil cost option over ordinary shares on 8 December 2010.
This option is due to vest on 1 April 2015 and then only if strategic and financial objectives linked to the long term growth of the Company have been met.
These are specifically: the strategic development of the business measured against the strategic plan approved by the Board from time to time: Burberrys financial performance which will be assessed by reference to the PBT condition applied to awards made under the Co-Investment Plan in June 2010 subject to adjustment to reflect the prevailing economic climate during the vesting period if appropriate : the personal contribution made by Angela Ahrendts: the shareholder value delivered in the context of the evolution of the luxury goods markets operated in by Burberry during the period between grant and vesting and any other performance factors which are appropriate in assessing the fairness of vesting the award to the executive and the shareholders.
The Committee will review progress against the performance condition at the end of each financial year during the vesting period.
The interests of Angela Ahrendts in shares subject to this award as at 31 March 2011 were as follows: 1 Number of ordinary shares Vesting period As at Granted Lapsed Exercised As at Date of 1 April during the during the during the 31 March 2 3 grant 2010 year year year 2011 From To Expiry date Angela Ahrendts 08 12 2010 500,000 500,000 01 04 2015 31 03 2016 31 03 2016 1 Subject to performance testing.
2 The market value of Burberry shares on the date of grant 8 December 2010 was 1,156p.
In the event of a change of control, awards will be performance tested and pro-rated for time, subject to a maximum time based reduction of 50%, or may be rolled over subject to Angela Ahrendts agreement.
If Burberry terminates the agreement without cause, or Angela Ahrendts leaves for good reason, the option will be exercisable in full.
If Angela Ahrendts ceases to be an employee for cause, for performance reasons or as a consequence of voluntary resignation, the option will lapse.
Burberry Group plc annual report 2010 11 83 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued The Sharesave Scheme In order to encourage employee share ownership at all levels, the Group offers a Sharesave Scheme.
The Sharesave Scheme offers executive directors and eligible employees an opportunity to enter into a long-term savings contract to save a portion of their salary which can be used to purchase Burberry Group plc shares at up to a 20% discount to the market price at the date of invitation.
Where it is not possible to offer a Sharesave Scheme in countries due to regulatory issues, or where the number of employees based in that country would make its introduction financially unviable, the Group offers a cash-based scheme as an alternative.
The interests of the executive directors in options granted under the Sharesave Scheme are shown in the table below: Number of ordinary shares Exercise period As at Granted Lapsed Exercised As at Date of 1 April during the during the during the 31 March Exercise 1 grant 2010 year year year 2011 price p From To Angela Ahrendts 25 06 2010 2,773 2,773 557.0 01 09 2015 28 02 2016 Stacey Cartwright 30 06 2009 2,827 2,827 321.0 01 09 2012 28 02 2013 1 The market value of Burberry shares on the date of grant 25 June 2010 was 784.5p.
The SIP and the Freeshare Plans The executive directors do not participate in the Freeshare Plan and elected not to participate in the SIP.
Dilution Limits The Groups share schemes contain limits that govern the quantum of awards that may be granted and the amount of newly issued shares that may be used to satisfy such awards.
These limits are in line with the guidance of the Association of British Insurers in that no more than 10% of the Groups issued share capital may be allocated under the Groups relevant schemes over a rolling ten year period.
Shareholding Policy The Committee believes that share ownership provides an effective way to align the interests of executives with those of shareholders.
The Group introduced a Shareholding Policy in 2007.
Certain senior executives are expected to achieve an interest in Burberry shares equivalent to at least one times base salary over the five year period to 2012.
Executives are expected to retain a proportion of the shares acquired on the exercise of options and awards until such guidelines are met.
The Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer are expected to hold an interest in shares with a value equivalent to at least three times and one and a half times base salary respectively by 2012.
As at 31 March 2011, both the Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer have complied with the policy.
As part of the Groups Shareholding Policy, the Chairman and non-executive directors are expected to hold shares with a market value of a minimum of 6,000 for each year of their appointment.
The Chairman and non-executive directors have complied with this policy.
