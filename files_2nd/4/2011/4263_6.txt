The Directors Report on Remuneration for the 52 week period ended 31 December 2010 was approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held in May 2011.
As required by the Companies Act 2006 the Act, shareholders will be invited to approve this report at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 23 May 2012.
This Report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Act.
The Report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to directors remuneration in the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on certain parts of the Remuneration Report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the Remuneration Report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Act.
The Remuneration Report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
In setting the remuneration policy, the Committee takes into account the strategic objectives of the Group and the expected performance of individual directors within their areas of responsibility.
Targets set in association with the performance related elements of pay take into account the strategic objectives of the Group, for example in the development and release of particular products or technologies or specific markets for products, such as applications for use in vehicles or home entertainment.
These are reviewed each year in the context of the plans set for the Group as a whole and are agreed for each executive director at the start of a financial year.
Summary of key reward philosophies Link to business strategy Performance conditions have been set to align with the long term business strategy and to maximise shareholder value.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 61 Full version AR 290898. pdf 65 14 03 2012 17:20:32 Directors report Remuneration report continued The annual bonus which forms part of the Executive Incentive Plan see pages 64 and 65 continues to support the short-term operational performance of the business by measuring against the fundamental business performance of the year in question, but also including personal performance objectives for the year which are necessary to ensure future performance.
These can, for example, be meeting defined revenue, profit or other financial targets and personal performance objectives such as delivery of new products, people development, or expansion into new markets.
For longer term incentives linked to equity plans, the directors hold awards that use various performance measures: Underlying diluted earnings per share, EPS which is believed to be an appropriate operational measure: Total shareholder return TSR relative to other companies within our sector: and Absolute total shareholder return of the Company introduced in 2011 following consultation with shareholders for grants under the CSR Share Option Plan providing clear focus on maximizing sustainable growth in the Companys share price.
Remuneration and risk The Committee has reviewed the relationship between remuneration and risk and is satisfied that the policies operated are appropriate and do not encourage undue risk taking as: basic salary levels are targeted at around mid-market levels and are reviewed annually: annual bonuses are capped and targeted to ensure that performance incentives and rewards are set at an appropriate level: and alignment with shareholders is provided through the use of bonus deferral, shareholder return for long-term share incentives and the operation of share ownership guidelines.
Unaudited information During the period ended 30 December 2011 and at the date of this report, the executive directors of the Board were: Name Position Date joined the Company J A J van Beurden Chief Executive Officer November 2007 D D W Gardiner Chief Financial Officer June 2008 C A Ladas Operations Director May 2000 K Chadha Chief Marketing Officer June 2009 appointed to the Board January 2008.
Remuneration policy for the executive directors Executive remuneration packages are designed in order to attract, motivate and retain employees of the highest calibre required by the Group in order to achieve its objectives, to meet the needs of customers and enhance value to shareholders.
As one of the UKs leading technology companies, CSR seeks to attract, retain and motivate executive directors on a global basis who have experience in working in markets and with technologies which are complementary to CSRs activities and strategic intent.
CSR is a fabless semiconductor company.
Few of CSRs peers are based in the UK, and the majority have their executive teams located in the US.
Each of our executive directors has extensive experience of working outside of the UK including the US, and this breadth of experience is reflected in the executive management team that reports to the Chief Executive, in addition to the breadth and diversity of our employees.
As at 30 December 2011, 75% of employees were based outside the UK.
There are five main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors and senior management, comprising basic annual salary, benefits-in-kind, the opportunity to participate in a money purchase pension scheme, a cash bonus and participation in the Companys share incentive plans.
The Companys policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors should be performance-related.
The payment of any bonus and the vesting of share incentives are subject to meeting performance conditions established by the Committee reflecting what, at that time, the Committee considers to be demanding targets.
These targets are set taking appropriate account of the challenging and rapidly evolving market in which the Group operates, and the expectations of the investment community on the Groups potential future performance.
The Remuneration Committee considers corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues and the extent to which these should be incorporated into the performance-related benefits of individual directors.
The Committee looked at the matter at the end of 2011 and determined that, given the Companys current activities and its strategic imperatives for 2012, it was not appropriate to incorporate such matters specifically within the incentive arrangements for any executive director during 2012.
This is kept under review on an annual basis.
The report on the Companys initiatives on matters related to corporate social responsibility, including environmental matters, is set out on pages 33 to 38.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 62 Full version AR 290898. pdf 66 14 03 2012 17:20:32 Basic salary An executive directors basic salary is considered by the Committee on their appointment and then reviewed once a year or when an individual changes position or responsibility.
When making a determination as to the appropriate remuneration, the Committee considers firstly remuneration practices within the Group as a whole and, where considered relevant, conducts objective research on companies within the Companys peers with both an international and UK focus, reflecting that the Company is competing in a global market.
As the Group has continued to evolve, the peer group has also been reconsidered, reflecting the broader international presence and the importance of maintaining an executive team with suitable and relevant industry and international business experience.
The target salary is at mid-market noting that after promotion or appointment to the Board it may take several years to meet this policy, with the opportunity to go above this level, subject to sustained individual performance.
The Committee seeks to ensure that there is an appropriate balance between fixed and variable pay, with a significant element based on performance-related variable reward.
The salary of Mr van Beurden and Mr Gardiner is paid in pounds sterling, whilst the salary of each of Mr Ladas and Mr Chadha is paid in US Dollars.
Details of the basic salary of the executive directors who served during the period ended 30 December 2011 are set forth in the table below.
Current Salary Previous Salary Date of Last Review J A J van Beurden 416,000 400,000 February 2012 D D W Gardiner 313,668 301,600 February 2012 C A Ladas $321,360 $312,000 February 2012 K Chadha $321,360 $312,000 February 2012 In keeping with a decision on the review of salaries for the Group as a whole, the salaries for the executive directors were reviewed in February 2012, with the decision taken to make no change to executive director salaries.
Salaries for those below Board level were subject to an average increase globally of 2%.
The Committee is satisfied that the salaries conform to its strategy, whilst remaining competitive against similar roles within the relevant peer group.
Benefits-in-kind The executive directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, comprising private medical insurance, life assurance as a multiple of basic salary four times in the UK and two times in the US, and personal accident insurance and subsistence expenses.
During 2011, Mr Ladas, who lives in the US, was provided with support in meeting the cost of a UK temporary residence reflecting his frequent travel and stays in the United Kingdom as an important part of the performance of his role.
Mr Ladas and Mr Chadha also receive US-based dental plan insurance.
Pension arrangements Two of the executive directors serving at the period end were members of the Cambridge Silicon Radio Retirement Benefits Scheme the UK Pension Plan which is an HM Revenue and Customs approved money purchase defined contribution scheme operated for eligible employees in the United Kingdom.
One executive director has established their own personal pension plan to which the Company contributes.
One director participates in the US 401K Plan which the Company operates for its US-resident employees.
Contributions are determined as a percentage of the employees gross basic salary, up to a limit of 50,000.
Details of the actual contributions made by the Group to the UK Pension Plan and the US 401K Plan on behalf of the executive directors are set out in the table on page 70.
Normal retirement age is 65 for employees and executive directors.
However, employees and executive directors may continue to remain in office beyond that age.
Mr Ladas, Operations Director, has continued in his office beyond the normal retirement age.
Other than basic salary, no element of the directors remuneration is pensionable.
Share ownership Executive directors are encouraged to build up a shareholding in the Company to a level equivalent to a percentage of their basic salary.
This shareholding should be satisfied through retention of the shares obtained as a result of participating in any Company share plan and the Executive Incentive Plan, net of the shares sold to finance option exercises or to pay a National Insurance or income tax liability or overseas equivalent.
The programme specifically excludes the need for directors to make a personal investment should awards not vest.
Normally the Committee would expect the executive director to achieve the holding within five years following appointment to the Board.
The shareholding requirements were reviewed by the Committee during 2011 and are as follows: Name Position Shareholding Requirement percentage of salary J A J van Beurden Chief Executive Officer 400% D D W Gardiner Chief Financial Officer 200% C A Ladas Operations Director 100% K Chadha Chief Marketing Officer 100% Medium and long term incentive arrangements The Committee is responsible for determining on what basis to incentivise executive directors, through the use of medium and longer term incentive arrangements.
The following sections of the report explain the plans available to the Committee in providing for such incentives.
For executive directors, the maximum opportunity in any single year is to earn up to 500% of salary under these incentive arrangements.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 63 Full version AR 290898. pdf 67 14 03 2012 17:20:32 Directors report Remuneration report continued The CSR plc 2011 Executive Incentive Plan the EIP Background The EIP was approved by shareholders at the General Meeting held on 30 August 2011.
2011 was the first year of operation of the Plan.
The EIP replaces the annual bonus arrangement previously used for the executive directors and also the awards made under the Share Award Plan for executive directors.
It allows a mixture of cash once the shareholding requirement is met and shares to be earned on an annual basis some of which are subject to a further two year retention as well as the risk of partial forfeiture in the event certain minimum thresholds set by the Committee at the start of an annual measurement period are not satisfied.
The Committee took into account the following specific factors when designing the EIP: the Plan allows the setting of annual targets based on KPIs linked to the business at that point in time, thereby mitigating against some of the risk of market volatility and the resulting difficulty in setting long-term targets whilst ensuring sustainability by linking bonus years together and providing substantial deferral in shares and ongoing risk adjustment: the Plan has been structured to ensure that key executives become material in terms of their compensation shareholders in the Company to provide a greater alignment of interests with shareholders: and the Company competes in an international market place for its executive talent.
The Committee believes that whilst retaining the best elements of UK corporate governance, the Plan is easier to operate and explain to an international team in particular in the US.
Overview of the EIP The key elements of the EIP are: the maximum annual contribution by the Company for a participant in respect of any single Plan Year is 250% of salary p. a. and the annual contribution will be subject to the satisfaction of performance targets see later for the targets set for 2011 and 2012 The maximum annual contribution is split into two elements for each Plan Year: Element A is paid at the end of Plan Year 1.
For 2011, Element A is 50% of the maximum annual contribution 125% of salary with a maximum of 100% of salary paid in cash and the balance paid in shares.
Participants may elect to receive shares to replace part or all of the cash component.
The share price used to calculate the number of shares is an average determined by the Committee which for 2011 has been set as the 30 day average share price for the period finishing at the end of Plan Year, being 30 December 2011.
For example, in respect of the 2011 financial year, at 30 December 2011, for executive directors Element A will be paid in shares until their shareholding requirement has been satisfied.
Following the continued satisfaction of this requirement, their participation in the EIP will be on the same basis as for any other participants.
The executive directors can sell sufficient shares to meet the tax arising on satisfaction of the conditions and release of shares.
Element B is paid at the end of Plan Year 3 i. e. there is an additional two year deferral for this element.
For 2011 Element B is 50% of the maximum annual contribution 125% of salary and is paid in shares.
The share price used to calculate the number of shares subject to Element B is the 30 day average share price for the period finishing at the end of Plan Year.
The vesting of Element B is subject to the following conditions: continued employment of the Participant by a member of the CSR plc Group at the end of Plan Year 3: and risk adjustment if the forfeiture thresholds for the performance requirements set for Plan Year 2 and or Plan Year 3 are not met.
Forfeiture would be on a sliding scale up to a maximum of 50% of Element B as illustrated in the table below.
EIP Opportunity and Forfeiture illustrative examples The following section explains by way of an illustrative example the potential reward and forfeiture provisions under the EIP.
Maximum Forfeiture On Target Maximum Performance Requirements for Plan Year 2 and or Plan Year 3 Forfeiture Threshold Performance Performance Percentage of Profit Target 70% 80% 100% 120% Percentage of Element B forfeited 50% 0% 0% 0% Straight line forfeiture between points The following is an example of the operation of the forfeiture provisions.
For the purposes of this illustration the participant has earned the maximum annual contribution in respect of Plan Year 1.
Element A has been paid and Element B is subject to a two year deferral period and will be adjusted if the forfeiture thresholds are not met in Plan CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 64 Full version AR 290898. pdf 68 14 03 2012 17:20:33 Year 2 and or Plan Year 3.
It has been assumed that no annual contribution has been earned in either Plan Year 2 or Plan Year 3 and that for each of the Plan Years the maximum forfeiture applied.
The following table shows the impact of the forfeiture provisions on Element B earned in respect of Plan Year 1: Operation of Maximum Forfeiture Operation of Maximum Forfeiture Final Value of Element B Plan Year 1 in Plan Year 2 in Plan Year 3 on Vesting Element B earned 125% of salary Element B reduced from Element B reduced from 31.25% of salary 125% of salary to 62.5% 62.5% of salary to 125% 62.5% 31.25% 31.25% Operation of the EIPfor the plan year ended 30 December 2011 The annual contribution earned by each executive director is determined by reference to the level of satisfaction of the performance requirements set out below.
The maximum annual contribution for the Plan year ended 30 December 2011 is 250% of salary.
The same maximum will be used for the 2012 financial year.

At the date of this report, this election has not yet been made.
Operation of the EIPfor the plan year ending 30 December 2012 The Remuneration Committee reviews the performance requirements for each Plan Year taking into account the following factors: alignment of the performance requirements to the Companys strategy for the Plan Year: and market conditions affecting the Company.
It is the opinion of the Remuneration Committee that the following performance requirements and their weighting is appropriate for the Plan Year Ending 28 December 2012: Performance Requirement Revenue Profit Individual Objectives Percentage of Maximum Annual Contribution earned based on the satisfaction of the relevant Performance Requirement 25% 50% 25% Performance Thresholds % of budget : Maximum 110% 120% On Target 100% 100% Bonus Threshold 90% 90% Forfeiture Threshold 80% Maximum Forefeiture 70% CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 65 Full version AR 290898. pdf 69 14 03 2012 17:20:33 Directors report Remuneration report continued Share option plans The Company has a number of share option plans intended to facilitate the motivation and retention of employees.
Two of the plans were established prior to the Companys flotation, being the Founders Share Option Plan and the Global Share Option Plan.
Whilst not all the awards under these two plans have been exercised, the plans are closed for the purpose of any new awards, and neither plan was used during 2011 for grants to executive directors or to other employees.
No director has any outstanding grants under these plans.
Following shareholder approval at the 2004 Annual General Meeting, the Company established the CSR plc Share Option Plan CSOP.
The reason for the introduction of this plan was to provide a means by which to incentivise the executive directors and employees whilst aligning their interests more closely with those of the Companys shareholders.
The Committee has responsibility for supervising the CSOP and the grant of options in accordance with its rules.
Awards are made to executive directors and other employees at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Awards for directors and certain other senior employees are subject to a three year retention period and the requirement that, subject to certain mitigating factors, the participant is an employee at the end of the retention period.
Since the introduction of the CSOP, through to and including grants made in 2008, the vesting of shares was subject to a performance target based on the growth over a three year period in the Companys underlying earnings per share.
As reported in 2009, the vesting of options granted in 2009 were subject to satisfying a performance target based on relative Total Shareholder Return of the Company against a peer group over a three year period.
The performance target for the 2009 grants was not met, and these options therefore lapse.
As disclosed in the report of the Committee for 2010, during 2011 the Committee undertook a detailed review of the incentive arrangements for executive directors which included engagement with shareholders during the first half of 2011.
For the grants made in 2011, the targets are as follows: Absolute Shareholder Return Absolute Shareholder Return Threshold Growth p. a.
7.50% 10.50% Percentage of Option Vesting 25% 100% Straight line vesting between thresholds For grants made in 2011 to each of the executive directors, based on their performance during the year, the Committee determined that it was appropriate to make a grant of 250% of salary under the CSOP.
Total Shareholder Return TSR comparator group of companies The following basket of comparator companies is used for determining the relative TSR performance of the Company, for grants made prior to 2011.
Hewlett-Packard Development QUALCOMM Incorporated ARM Holdings plc Company L. P. Infineon Technology AG STMicroelectronics N. V. Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc. Intel Corporation Silicon Laboratories Inc. ASML Holding N. V. Analog Devices, Inc. Logitech International SA Skyworks Solutions, Inc. Marvell Technology Group Ltd Spirent plc Apple Computer, Inc. austriamicrosystems AG Motorola, Inc. Synopsys Inc. National Semiconductor Corporation Taiwan Semiconductor Broadcom Corporation Manufacturing Company Limited Nokia Oyj Teradyne, Inc. Cirrus Logic, Inc. Conexant Systems, Inc. PMC-Sierra, Inc. Texas Instruments Incorporated Plantronics, Inc. Wolfson Microelectronics plc Dell, Inc. GN Store Nord A S The grants in 2009 included additional companies in the comparator group, being Bookham Inc, Dialog Semiconductor plc, Nordic Semiconductor ASA, Research in Motion Ltd and Wavecom SA.
Following the acquisition by Qualcomm Inc of Atheros Communications during 2011, Atheros has been removed from the comparator group.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 66 Full version AR 290898. pdf 70 14 03 2012 17:20:33 The Committee decided that the thresholds to be met would be as follows: none of the options shall vest if the Companys relative position is below median: 30% of a grant vests at median, with full vesting of a grant for performance at the upper quartile.
Options vest on a straight-line basis between the median and upper quartile, with no retesting of the performance condition if it is not met at the end of the three year period.
The performance condition was considered by the Committee to be challenging and appropriately aligned with shareholder interests to achieving sustained performance in the return to shareholders over the three year performance period.
The rules of the CSOP do not allow for options to be granted at a discount to the Companys share price at the date of grant.
Following consultation with shareholders and approval at the General Meeting held in August 2011 at the discretion of the Committee options may be granted up to a maximum of 300% of salary in each year, taking into account individual performance.
Prior to this change to the rules, the annual maximum was 200% of salary.
Pursuant to the rules of the CSOP, the Committee also reserves to its discretion the right to grant awards at a higher proportion of up to 400% of basic salary to deal with circumstances which the Committee determines to be exceptional, for example, the retention of key employees.
Performance share awards At the Annual General Meeting held in May 2005, shareholders approved the introduction of a Share Award Plan called the CSR Share Award Plan.
Awards are made to executive directors and other employees at the discretion of the Committee.
The performance condition in respect of grants made in 2010 was subject to meeting specific underlying EPS targets in 2012.
In order for 20% of the grant to vest, the Company must achieve an underlying EPS of 58 cents, increasing to vesting at 100% for achieving an underlying EPS of 70 cents.
Above 58 cents up to maximum vesting at 70 cents, the proportion of shares which vests increases on a straight line basis.
The Committee determined that these performance conditions were appropriate for the form of award and were suitably stretching.
The TSR performance target for the grants made in 2009, which were based on Total Shareholder Return was not met, and the Share Awards therefore lapsed.
In accordance with the rules of the CSR Share Award Plan, the Committee reserves the right to grant awards at a proportion of basic salary normally up to a maximum of 100% of salary 200% in exceptional circumstances.
The level of award is considered each year in the light of performance.
No awards were made to directors under the CSR Share Award Plan in 2011.
The table below summarises the total awards held by each executive director at 30 December 2011.
Interests held at Interests held at 31 December Date of 2011 Award vesting Awards exercised 30 December Name 2010 award Awards made Awards price date in 2011 Lapsed in 2011 2011 J A J van Beurden 371,775 94,944 276,831 D D W Gardiner 412,576 179,800 232,776 C A Ladas 161,687 36,096 125,591 K Chadha 123,209 123,209 Contingent shares For each of Mr van Beurden and Mr Gardiner, in addition to the cash bonus in respect of the financial year 2010, the Committee incorporated an additional incentive which provided for the potential, subject to fulfilling performance targets, to receive ordinary shares, which for Mr van Beurden was a maximum opportunity of 120,000 shares and for Mr Gardiner was a maximum opportunity of 100,000 shares.
Each of Mr van Beurden and Mr Gardiner were able to elect to sell sufficient shares to satisfy the tax liability on vesting, but otherwise are required to hold the shares they receive for a further period of 12 months.
The performance targets were met in respect of these conditional awards and the maximum opportunity for each of Mr van Beurden and Mr Gardiner vested in March 2011.
In accordance with the terms of the award, Mr van Beurden elected to satisfy the tax arising on the transfer of the ordinary shares out of the CSR Employee Benefit Trust by cash.
120,000 shares were transferred to Mr van Beurden on 31 March 2011.
In accordance with the terms of the award, Mr Gardiner elected to sell sufficient shares to satisfy the tax liability on vesting.
The CSR Employee Benefit Trust therefore withheld 51,773 shares and the balance, comprising 48,227 shares was transferred to Mr Gardiner on 31 March 2011.
As reported in the 2009 and 2010 Remuneration Reports, in respect of the bonus earned in 2009, Mr Chadha was allotted 16,580 ordinary shares in the form of restricted shares which would vest, subject to his remaining employed by the Company as at 1 March 2011.
There were no further restrictions applying to the transfer of the shares and Mr Chadha was able to elect either to hold or sell the shares on transfer.
In accordance with the terms of the award, the CSR Employee Benefit Trust, withheld 6,157 ordinary shares to satisfy the tax arising on transfer.
The balance, comprising 10,423 shares, were transferred to Mr Chadha on 31 March 2011.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 67 Full version AR 290898. pdf 71 14 03 2012 17:20:33 Directors report Remuneration report continued Dilution The Company monitors the awards of shares, made under the various share plans which it operates in relation to their effect on dilution limits.
Following shareholder approval at the 2005 Annual General Meeting, the Company is able to make selective share awards while maintaining the traditional overall 10% limit on awards as a proportion of the issued share capital in any rolling ten year period.
Conscious of the need to ensure that the issue of new shares to employees pursuant to its share schemes operates within Association of British Insurers ABI guidelines, the CSR Employee Benefit Trust the Trust was established during 2007.
The Trust enables the satisfaction of awards to be met by using shares acquired by the Trust in the open market.
As at 30 December 2011 the Trust held 3,790,109 ordinary shares in CSR plc which were acquired in the open market.
The purchase of shares by the Trust is satisfied through cash drawn down under the terms of a Loan Facility Agreement established at the time of the creation of the Trust.
During 2011 the Trust did not acquire any shares.
The details of each purchase of ordinary shares in CSR plc and the total holding by the Trust is shown in note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Performance graph The graph below shows the Companys performance, measured by total shareholder return, compared with the performance of the FTSE 250 index.
The FTSE 250 index has been selected for this comparison because it is a broad equity index of which CSR plc is a constituent company.
60.0% 40.0% 20.0% 0.0% CSR -20.0% FTSE 250 -40.0% -60.0% -80.0% -100.0% Employee share purchase plans The Company operates an HM Revenue and Customs approved SAYE Share Option Scheme for eligible employees under which options may be granted at a discount of up to 20% of market value.
Executive directors who are subject to UK tax are eligible to participate in the SAYE Share Option Scheme.
Following the acquisition of SiRF in 2009 and, as approved by shareholders at the General Meeting held on 25 June 2009, the Company introduced an Employee Share Purchase Plan the ESPP under which shares in the Company may be acquired at a discount of up to 15% of the lower of the market value at either the start or end of the savings period.
