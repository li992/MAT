employees is a key consideration for the Committee.
The Committee will continue to focus on reaching a sustainable balance.
We manage remuneration decisions on the basis of total remuneration.
An important tool in ensuring an appropriate balance between competitiveness and responsibility is the mix between the xed and variable components of remuneration.
We set the xed component of remuneration which largely comprises salaries at a level consistent with market rates.
We use the variable component of remuneration to create the exibility that allows our cost base to respond to changes in economic and business conditions and to provide a clear and explicit link between remuneration and current and future performance.
That link includes, in particular for senior roles, paying a substantially higher proportion of bonuses in shares, and deferred bonuses being subject to clawback provisions, to help ensure sustained performance over the longer term.
We have increased the use of deferred bonuses to align better the incentive created by the variable component of remuneration to sustained performance.
Deferred bonuses are payable only once an employee meets certain conditions, including a specified period of service.

This creates a timing difference between the communication of the bonus pool being the total bonus awards granted that are decided upon by management and approved by the Committee and the charges that appear in the income statement for any year.
As such, set out in Tables 22 to 24 are the components of remuneration that relate to managements and the Boards decisions on the bonus pool reconciled to the income statement charge, recognised in accordance with accounting standards.

In addition, employees receiving a deferred cash bonus may be awarded a service credit of 10% of the initial value of the award at the time that the final instalment is made, subject to continued employment.

Employees only become eligible to receive payment from a deferred bonus once all of the relevant conditions have been fullled, including the provision of services to the Group.
The income statement charge for performance costs reects the charge for employees actual services provided to the Group during the relevant calendar year including where those services full performance conditions relating to previously deferred bonuses.
It does not include charges for deferred bonuses where performance conditions have not been met.
As a consequence, while the 2011 incentive awards granted were down 26% compared to 2010, the income statement charge for performance costs was down 25%.
