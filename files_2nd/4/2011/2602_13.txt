DIRECTORS REmUNERATION REPORT intRODuCtiOn FROm peteR JOHnSOn, CHAiRmAn OF tHe RemuneRAtiOn COmmittee Following the retirement from the Board of Charles Banks, who had chaired the Remuneration Committee the Committee for the past eight years, I was appointed as Chairman of the Committee in April 2011.
The Committee has taken the opportunity to review the contents of the Directors remuneration report to ensure that our remuneration policies and practices are clear and transparent to our stakeholders.
We hope that the new layout of this report will aid understanding and clarity of the way that our directors are remunerated.
The Bunzl Long Term Incentive Plan the LTIP, which is referred to below, was approved by shareholders at the Companys Annual General Meeting the AGM in May 2004.
The LTIP runs for a 10 year period and the Committee believes that it has worked well in both incentivising our senior management and aligning their interests with those of our shareholders.
The Committee will start work during 2012 in developing proposals for the introduction of a new plan upon expiry of the current LTIP and will consult with the Companys principal shareholders in relation thereto.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 the Act and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008, the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and the UK Corporate Governance Code.
KPMG Audit Plc has audited the relevant content as required by the Act the tabular information on pages 49 to 52.
A resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the AGM on 18 April 2012.
COmmittee Remit AnD membeRSHip The terms of reference of the Committee have been formally adopted by the Board and are available for inspection in the Investor Centre section of the Companys website www.
The key responsibilities of the Committee include: ensuring that executive directors and senior executives are properly incentivised to attract, retain and fairly reward them for their individual contribution to the Company and having due regard to the policies and practices applied to the rest of the employees within the Group: determining the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of the Chairman and the executive directors of the Board including setting their individual remuneration packages as well as their level of remuneration and overseeing all the Companys long term incentive plans: ensuring that remuneration is aligned with and supports the Companys strategy and performance, having due regard to the shareholders and to the financial and commercial health of the Company, while at the same time not encouraging undue risk taking: and communicating and discussing any remuneration issues with the Companys stakeholders as and when appropriate.
In undertaking these responsibilities, the Committee seeks external advice as necessary.
During the year the Committee received advice from independent remuneration and benefit consultants  LLP PwC and New Bridge Street, an Aon Hewitt company New Bridge Street, who may from time to time also provide services to the Company on remuneration and benefit related matters that are not subject to review by the Committee.
During 2011 PwC provided external survey data on directors remuneration and benefit levels and New Bridge Street made a presentation to update the Committee on recent market changes relating to executive remuneration and provided information to determine whether, and if so to what extent, the performance conditions attached to share options and performance share awards under the LTIP had been satisfied.
In addition to the work undertaken on behalf of the Committee, PwC also provides the Company with some accounting, tax and pre-acquisition due diligence services.
The following independent non-executive directors were members of the Committee during 2011 and continue to be members, with the exception of Charles Banks who retired in April 2011: Date of appointment Meetings eligible Meetings to the Committee to attend attendance Ulrich Wolters 21 July 2004 3 2 Peter Johnson 18 January 2006 3 3 David Sleath 5 December 2007 3 3 Eugenia Ulasewicz 20 April 2011 2 2 Charles Banks retired from the Board in April 2011 1 June 2002 1 1 note a Ulrich Wolters was unable to attend the Committee meeting on 7 December 2011 due to other business commitments.
The Secretary to the Committee is Celia Baxter, Director of Group HR.
No executive director or Board member plays any part in determining his or her remuneration.
During the year ended 31 December 2011, both the Chief Executive and the Chairman were consulted and invited to attend meetings of the Committee, but were not present during any part of the meeting when their own remuneration was under consideration.
In line with its remit, the following key issues were addressed by the Committee during the year: approval of the 2010 Directors remuneration report: review of all share plan earnings per share performance measures for the three year period ended 31 December 2010 and the total shareholder return TSR performance measures for the three year periods ended 31 March and 30 September 2011: review of the achievement against targets of the awards under the annual bonus plan and the Deferred Annual Share Bonus Scheme the DASBS and the setting of the targets for 2011: 40 BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011 review and approval of the performance measures to be applied to the 2011 grants and awards under the LTIP: review and approval of all grants and awards made under the LTIP and exercise of Committee discretion regarding the vesting of any outstanding grants and awards where appropriate: annual review of all executive directors base salaries and benefits in line with the Companys policies and practices: and consideration of current guidelines on executive remuneration by advisory bodies and institutional investors.
RemuneRAtiOn pOliCy AliGnment witH GROup StRAteGy Bunzl continues to pursue its well defined strategy of developing the business through organic growth and targeted acquisitions in both existing and new geographies, while continuously improving the efficiency of our operations.
Bunzls business model relies on excellent customer and supplier relationships and the skills, knowledge and experience of its directors and employees.
The Companys remuneration policy supports this strategy by ensuring that the overall remuneration package is set at a competitive level whilst ensuring that additional reward is paid for high performance over a sustained period.
This policy is designed to ensure the recruitment, retention and motivation of the executive directors and other senior executives over the long term.
The performance related elements of the remuneration package are designed to incentivise executives to meet key performance metrics which align their interests and remuneration with those of shareholders, for example targets relating to earnings per share and TSR.
In setting such targets the Committee takes due account of the potential effect such targets could have on the attitude and behaviour of executives to risk within the business.
In addition the Committee has the discretion to take into account performance on environmental, social and governance matters.
The remuneration package comprises both core fixed elements base salary, pension and other benefits and performance based variable elements cash bonus, the DASBS and the LTIP.
The Committee has set a guideline that for on target performance approximately half of the remuneration package should be performance related.
The structure of the remuneration packages for on target and stretch performance for each of the executive directors is illustrated in the bar charts below: Michael Roney 34% 10% 24% 32% Target performance 23% 7% 27% 43% Stretch performance Brian May 36% 9% 25% 30% Target performance 25% 6% 27% 42% Stretch performance Patrick Larmon 35% 16% 23% 26% Target performance 25% 11% 26% 38% Stretch performance Salary and benets Pension Bonus cash DASBS LTIP notes a S alary represents annual salary for 2011 and benefits such as car or car allowance and private medical insurance as shown on page 49. b Pension represents the cost of pension accrued in 2011 in the Defined Benefit Section of the Bunzl Pension Plan for Brian May, the value of the annual pension allowance for Michael Roney and Brian May, the contributions to the Defined Contribution Section of the Bunzl Pension Plan for Michael Roney and the total of company contributions to Patrick Larmons 401K Plan, Retirement Savings Benefit the RSB and through the Defined Contribution Senior Executive Retirement Agreement SERA, further details of which are shown on page 49. c Target performance comprises annual bonus awarded at target level i. e. 70% of base salary comprised of 50% cash and 50% deferred shares under the DASBS and, for the LTIP, an assumption that 50% of performance shares will vest and the share options will deliver 25% of their face value in gain to the executives.
d Stretch performance comprises annual bonus awarded at maximum level i. e. 115% of base salary for Michael Roney and Brian May and 110% of base salary for Patrick Larmon comprised of 50% cash and 50% deferred shares under the DASBS and, for the LTIP, an assumption that 100% of performance shares will vest and the share options will deliver 50% of their face value in gain to the executives.
BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011 41 DIRECTORS REmUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED exeCutive DiReCtORS RemuneRAtiOn In setting executive directors remuneration, the Committee is mindful of a range of factors, including remuneration policy, incentive arrangements and the remuneration packages across the Group.
In addition, the Committee reviews information on remuneration and benefit levels based on external survey data produced by PwC.
The Committee seeks to maintain, wherever possible, a consistent and appropriate basis for comparison year on year in terms of the survey methodology and, in particular, the use of comparator groups from which the survey data is produced.
There are three comparator groups that the Committee uses.
These are related to revenue, profit before tax and market capitalisation.
In each case the comparator group consists of at least 20 non-financial and non-oil oil services UK based companies that have substantial operations overseas.
Half of the companies in each comparator group are the next highest and half are the next lowest compared with Bunzl.
The total number of companies included in this survey will depend on the overlap of the companies within each of the three comparator groups but the aim is for the total number of companies to be at least 40.
The results from each of the comparator groups are blended by PwC to provide an overall assessed market position as at 1 January of the year of the review.
Neither PwC nor New Bridge Street provide specific recommendations to the Committee on remuneration or benefit levels for the executive directors.
The Committee does, however, review survey information provided by them in the light of its established remuneration policy before making its decisions.
All decisions of the Committee were implemented in full.
SAlARy purpose recognise knowledge, skills and experience reward individual performance reflect scope and size of the role consider achievement related to environmental, social and governance issues Delivery monthly cash policy annual review in December with any changes effective from January taking into consideration individual and Group performance, salary increases across the Group are benchmarked for appropriate salary levels using a comparator group of similarly sized companies with large international presence pensionable The summary table above sets out the key policy principles for the salaries for the executive directors.
Similar principles are applied to the salaries of senior managers and other levels of employees in the organisation, taking into account local market practices across the Group.
Details of the executive directors annual salaries are as follows: Increase in salary Salary from Salary from 2011 to 2012 1 January 2012 1 January 2011 % Michael Roney 845,000 825,000 2.4 Brian May 468,000 456,000 2.6 Patrick Larmon US$960,000 US$935,000 2.7 Employees across the Group have received, on average, increases in the range of 2%4% dependent on geographical location with the exception being those employees based in Brazil and China where current market salary increases are much higher.
The actual increases received by employees have been based on each individuals contribution and performance as well as the market competitiveness of the salary.
AnnuAl bOnuS purpose incentivise the attainment of annual corporate targets retain high performing employees Delivery annual award 50% cash and 50% shares deferred shares DASBS Patrick Larmons maximum cash bonus payment is 65% of the total bonus although the total of cash and deferred shares is capped at 110% of base salary policy the measure for performance is the growth at constant exchange rates in the Companys earnings per share adjusted to exclude items which do not reflect the Companys underlying financial performance constant exchange rate eps.
Patrick Larmon has additional measures based on the profit before interest and tax pbit and working capital employed in the business for which he has direct responsibility the annual on target bonus opportunity for Michael Roney and Brian May is 70% of base salary with a maximum award of 115% of base salary and for Patrick Larmon is 70% of base salary with a maximum award of 110% of base salary non-pensionable 42 BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011 The annual bonus rewards short term business performance.
Appropriately stretching financial performance targets are set by the Committee at the beginning of the year.
The use of the constant exchange rate eps measure is seen as appropriate as it is one of Bunzls KPIs and aligns the executive directors interests with those of our shareholders.
The additional measures relating to pbit and working capital are relevant for Patrick Larmon as these are the key performance indicators of the business he is responsible for running and these measures, together with other business measures, are used to incentivise the management group in North America.
The relevant performance points are: threshold which must be exceeded to attract any payment of bonus : target: and maximum amount the level at which the bonus for that measure is capped.
These performance points are determined at the start of the year by reference to the Groups annual budget.
No elements of the bonus are guaranteed.
As in previous years, the specific performance points are commercially sensitive and are therefore not made public.
At the end of the performance period, which is the Groups financial year from 1 January until 31 December, the Committee assesses the extent to which the performance measures have been achieved.
The level of bonus for each measure is determined by reference to the performance relative to that measures performance points, on a pro rata basis.
In respect of the year ended 31 December 2011, the total payments under the annual bonus plan were: Total bonus payment cash and deferred shares as a % of salary 2011 2010 2009 2008 % % % % Michael Roney 114.0 81.6 52.2 61.8 Brian May 114.0 81.6 52.2 61.8 Patrick Larmon 110.0 76.7 54.2 55.4 note a The actual performance related payments for 2011 and 2010 are included in the table on page 49.
Under the DASBS, eligible executives, including the executive directors, receive the deferred element of their annual bonus as an award of ordinary shares.
The awards are satisfied by ordinary shares that are purchased in the market and provided via the Bunzl Group General Employee Benefit Trust the Trust on 1 March in the third year after the year in which the award is made when they are transferred to the executive.
The rules of the DASBS provide that executives who leave the Group prior to the vesting of their awards lose their rights to any deferred shares although the Committee has discretion to allow such shares to vest if deemed appropriate to do so.
For awards made in 2011 and in subsequent years, the clawback terms provide scope for the Committee to reduce or cancel such DASBS awards to the extent that the value of the bonus originally awarded is subsequently deemed to have been overstated as a result of a material mis-statement of the relevant financial statements by which the bonus was originally determined.
In February 2012 the Committee amended the rules of the DASBS to provide the flexibility to structure awards as nil cost options with a three year exercise window commencing on the date of vesting.
Following this change, Brian Mays outstanding DASBS awards were converted to nil cost options.

The LTIP Part A relates to the grant of executive share options and Part B to the award of performance shares.
All of the executive directors, Executive Committee members and other key employees participate in both parts of the LTIP which was adopted in 2004.
The majority of senior management only participate in the LTIP Part A.
Share options are granted and performance shares awarded under the LTIP in respect of both new issue shares and market purchased shares.
Grant award levels The total actual annual grant award levels for the executive directors are set out in the table below and have been applied to awards made from August 2008 to date.
Face value of grants awards as a percentage of base salary Executive share options Performance shares Michael Roney 150% 112.5% Brian May 140% 105% Patrick Larmon 125% 94% To the extent that the performance conditions have been satisfied, grants of executive share options are normally exercisable between three and 10years after they have been made and awards of performance shares are normally exercisable between three and six years after they have been made.
A grant of executive share options or an award of performance shares lapses to the extent that the performance conditions are not satisfied in accordance with the measures set out in the forthcoming sections at the end of the three year performance period.
performance The percentage of executive share options which vest is based solely on eps performance conditions, whereas for awards of performance shares vesting is based on a combination of eps and TSR performance.
Performance conditions in all cases are measured over a three year period and there is no retesting.
The Committee considers that both of these measures are appropriate benchmarks of the Companys performance.
This combination provides an important balance of measures relevant to the Groups business and market conditions as well as providing a common goal for the executive directors, senior management and shareholders.
Further details on these performance conditions are provided below.
eps performance condition Executive share options LTIP Part A Executive share options may vest based solely on the Companys eps growth adjusted to exclude items which do not reflect the Companys underlying financial performance relative to UK inflation RPI over three years, based on the following sliding scale: Face value of annual executive share options granted as a proportion of salary Total margin over UK inflation RPI after three years First 150% of salary 9.3% Next 75% of salary 12.5% Next 75% of salary 19.1% The Committee considers that the current performance condition remains appropriate after taking into consideration the recent significant increase in RPI, the current economic conditions, the performance of the business and the fact that a vested option has no value unless the share price increases.
The Committee considers that over many years vested executive share options have provided a high level of incentivisation for the management team to strive continually to improve the Groups operational performance and thereby increase the Companys share price.
Performance shares LTIP Part B The extent to which half of the awards may vest is subject to a performance condition based on the Companys eps growth adjusted to exclude items which do not reflect the Companys underlying financial performance relative to UK inflation RPI over three years, based on the following sliding scale: Total margin over UK inflation RPI after three years Proportion of performance share awards exercisable Below 12.5% Nil 12.5% 25% Between 12.5% and 33.1% Pro rata between 25%100% Over 33.1% 100% The Committee considers that the current performance condition remains challenging given the recent significant increase in RPI, the current economic conditions and the performance of the business.
The Committee considers that the eps performance condition for the vesting of performance shares should be more stretching than for executive share options since on exercise of the award the value of the whole share is delivered to the participant as opposed to executive share options where value only arises if the share price on exercise is greater than the optionprice.
44 BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011 tSR performance condition Performance shares LTIP Part B The extent to which the other half of the performance share awards may vest is subject to the Companys TSR performance relative to the TSR performance of a specified group of companies the Comparator Group.
The process for identifying the Comparator Group is the same as that used for setting executive remuneration as described under Executive directors remuneration on page 42.
These performance share awards vest in full only if the Companys TSR performance is ranked at upper quartile or above within the Comparator Group and the following vesting schedule is applied: TSR Proportion of performance share awards exercisable Below median Nil Median 25% Median to upper quartile Pro rata between 25%100% Upper quartile 100% The performance condition relating to TSR for all awards under the LTIP Part B provides for the exclusion from the Comparator Group of those companies that cease to be listed and the exclusion of those companies that have been subject to a recommended takeover offer and are therefore in the process of delisting.
Where the companies are excluded from the Comparator Group, the median upper quartile rankings are recalculated using the reduced number of companies in the Comparator Group.
The applicable Comparator Group for the LTIP Part B awards for October 2011 and April 2012 are shown below.

It is measured on the basis that all companies dividends are reinvested in the shares of those companies.
The return is the percentage increase in each companys index over the three year performance period.
The opening and closing indices for this calculation are respectively the average of the index numbers for the last month preceding the performance period and for the last month of that performance period.
vesting of ltip grants awards made in 2008 Executive share options LTIP Part A Grants of executive share options were made to the executive directors on 28 February 2008 and 29 August 2008 with the three year performance periods being completed on 31 December 2010.
The Committee subsequently assessed the relevant performance of the Company against the performance conditions.
Eps growth was 34.4% for the three years ended 31 December 2010 which compared to an increase in RPI of 8.3% over the same period.
Since the performance condition would have been satisfied if eps had grown by at least 17.6% over the period, all of the options vested.
Performance shares LTIP Part B Awards of performance shares were made to the executive directors on 17 April 2008 and 7 October 2008 with the three year performance periods being completed on 31 March 2011 and 30 September 2011 respectively.
The Committee subsequently assessed the performance of the Company against the relevant performance conditions.
The extent to which half of the awards would vest was subject to a performance condition based on eps growth relative to RPI.
Eps growth was 34.4% for the three years ended 31 December 2010 compared to an increase in RPI of 8.3% over the same period.
A quarter of the award would have been exercisable if eps had grown by at least 20.8% over the period and the whole award would have been exercisable if eps had grown by at least 41.4%.
As a result of the Companys actual growth in eps over the period, 74.5% of this part of the awards vested 37.25% of the full awards.
The extent to which the other half of the awards vested was based on the Companys TSR performance against the relevant Comparator Group.
For the April award, the Company ranked 25th out of the remaining 38 companies in the Comparator Group of companies, resulting in no vesting for this part of the award.
For the October award, the Company ranked 19th out of the remaining 40 companies in the Comparator Group of companies, as a result of which 36.25% of this part of the award vested 18.125% of the full award for performance between median and upper quartile.
Accordingly 37.25% of the total performance shares awarded in April 2008 and 55.375% of the total performance shares awarded in October 2008 vested in April and October 2011 respectively.

All emplOyee SHARe SCHemeS The executive directors are also eligible to participate in all employee share schemes which are designed to incentivise employees of the Group by giving them opportunities to build a shareholding in the Company.
The UK based executive directors may participate in an HM Revenue & Customs HMRC approved Sharesave Scheme and the US based executive director may participate in an IRS approved Employee Stock Purchase Plan US the ESPP.
In addition employees in Australia, Canada, Germany and the Netherlands are eligible to participate in an International Sharesave Plan and Irish employees can take part in the Irish Sharesave Plan.
Sharesave Scheme The current Sharesave Scheme was approved by shareholders in 2011, is approved by HMRC and is open to all UK employees who have completed at least three months of continuous service.
It, like the Sharesave Scheme which preceded it, is linked to a contract for monthly savings of up to 250 per month over a period of either three or five years.
Under the Sharesave Scheme options are granted to participating employees at a discount of up to 20% of the market price prevailing on the day immediately preceding the date of invitation to apply for the option.
Options are normally exercisable either three or five years after they have been granted.
Both Michael Roney and Brian May participate in the Sharesave Scheme.
eSpp The current ESPP was also approved by shareholders in 2011 and, like its predecessor, provides an opportunity for employees in the US to purchase the Companys shares in the market at a 15% discount to the market price, up to an annual maximum of 10% of remuneration or US$25,000 worth of shares, whichever is lower.
The purchase of the shares is funded by after tax payroll deductions from the employee with the employing company contributing the 15% discount.
Shares held by Patrick Larmon under the ESPPs are included in his ordinary share interests set out in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.
OptiOnS AnD AwARDS OutStAnDinG To satisfy the future exercise of options or awards of performance shares under the Groups employee share schemes, ordinary shares are either acquired in the market by the Trust or the Company issues new shares.
the trust The Trust is used to satisfy the vesting and exercise of awards of ordinary shares made under the DASBS and the LTIP Parts A and B.
The number of shares held in the Trust to satisfy outstanding awards is monitored by the Board.
The Trust is funded by interest free loan facilities from the Company enabling the Trust to facilitate the purchase of ordinary shares to satisfy the future vesting or exercise of options and awards under the DASBS and LTIP.
The loan is either repaid from the proceeds of the exercise of options or, in the case of ordinary shares acquired by the Trust to satisfy vesting and exercise of awards under the DASBS and the LTIP Part B, the Company will subsequently waive the loan provided over the life of the awards.
The Trust currently waives dividends on the ordinary shares held by it.
As at 31 December 2011, the Trust held 5,230,867 ordinary shares with a market value of 46.2 million 31 December 2010: 3,995,293 ordinary shares: market value 28.7 million being 1.5% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital 31 December 2010: 1.1% including treasury shares.
While shares are held by the Trust, the trustee does not exercise any voting rights.
Details of the Companys material equity share based payment arrangements are set out in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.
46 BUNZL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011 SHAReHOlDinG GuiDelineS In order to align further the interests of the executive directors and shareholders, the executive directors are required to build a significant personal shareholding in the Company.
A formal share ownership guideline is in place under which executive directors are expected to retain shareholdings worth at least equal to their annual base salaries.
A period of three years is allowed for executives who are promoted from within the Company to achieve this shareholding with an additional two years permitted in the case of external appointments.
As at 31 December 2011, the value of the executive directors shareholdings as a percentage of salary were: Actual share ownership as a percentage of salary at 31 December 2011 at the closing mid-market price Michael Roney 310% Brian May 204% Patrick Larmon 165% The interests of the executive directors in the ordinary shares of the Company are shown in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.

During 2011 such contributions amounted to 6,405 2010: 6,180 and this amount was deducted from his pension allowance.
The Company also provides lump sum life assurance cover of four times base salary.
Brian May, who joined the Group in the UK prior to the closure of the defined benefit sections of the BPP, is a member of the Bunzl Senior Pension Section of the BPP.
His pension accrues at the rate of 2.4% per annum up to two thirds of the pensionable salary cap, as described above.
The employee contribution rate is currently 9% of pensionable salary.
The normal retirement date is 60 years of age but members can choose to take a pension at any time after the age of 55 years without the employing companys agreement, subject to a reduction as determined by the pension fund trustee in conjunction with the pension fund actuary.
This section of the BPP includes provision for spouses benefits on death in service or after retirement.
In the event of death in service a spouses pension equal to 60% of the members prospective pension at normal retirement age would be payable.
A spouses pension in the event of death after retirement is equal to 60% of the members full pension, irrespective of any decision to exchange part of the benefit for a lump sum.
In addition to benefits from the BPP, Brian May receives a pension allowance of 30% of base salary above the pensionable salary cap which permits him to make provision, of his own choice, in respect of that part of his salary which exceeds the cap.
Patrick Larmon originally joined the US Plan, subject to IRS limits, which accrued at a rate of 1.67% per annum up to 50% of the five year average pensionable salary less the primary social security benefit, with a normal retirement age of 65 years.
Pensionable salary in the US Plan is capped at US$140,000.
