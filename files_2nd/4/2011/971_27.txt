Further details on the structure of the LTIP, the required level of performance for the 2011 award and how performance against targets is measured can be found on pages 107 to 109.
The market price of the shares at the date of award was 31.99.

The performance period relating to the LTIP awards in 2008 which were granted on 17 March ended on 31 December 2010.
Vesting was subject to two performance conditions: the first based on the Companys TSR relative to a weighted group of international mining companies and the FTSE 100: the second based on an underlying operating measure which focused on improvements in the Companys ROCE in the medium term.
Part of each award was based on the TSR measure and part on the operating measure.
Cynthia Carroll and Ren Mdori contractually agreed with AAS that supplementary pension contributions would be made in return for their surrendering the potential right to receive shares in the Company, pursuant to an award granted in 2008 under the LTIP.

"&, "" In the case of the LTIP awards granted in 2008, the determinants for vesting were 50% on relative TSR and 50% on meeting specified Group ROCE targets."
The ROCE targets are a function of targeted improvement in returns on existing capital employed at the start of the performance period and targeted returns in excess of the cost of capital on new capital investment over that period.
The entry-level target for any LTIP has been the actual return achieved on the capital employed, excluding capital work in progress, in the year immediately preceding the commencement of the performance period.
In order to maintain the effectiveness of the plan in driving long-term performance, the actual returns in the final performance year are adjusted for movements in commodity prices, certain foreign exchange rate effects e. g. translation windfalls, capital in progress to reect the fact that mines under construction absorb large amounts of capital before producing a return, relevant changes in the composition of the Group e. g. significant acquisitions and disposals and other one-off factors which would otherwise result in a misleading outcome.
The threshold blended target i. e. the target on existing and new capital for the performance period for the 2008 LTIP was 39.67% and the upper blended target 41.67%.
The ROCE achieved was 51.85% and the outcome on this element of the LTIP was thus 100%.
On the TSR measure, Anglo American achieved a TSR over the three-year performance period of -17% which generated a nil vesting in terms of the 2008 Sector Index Comparator Group against a median target of -2% and a nil vesting against the FTSE 100 being lower than the 50th percentile.
The overall vesting level for those directors with a 50% Group ROCE, 25% Sectoral TSR and 25% FTSE 100 TSR split would therefore have been 50%.
