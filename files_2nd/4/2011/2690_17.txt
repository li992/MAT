The base valuation at 1 April 2006 is adjusted over the performance period to create the Cash LTIP hurdle as follows: i to reflect additional capital notionally treated as borrowed by the business: ii to reflect capital notionally treated as returned by the business: and iii increased by a hurdle rate being the notional weighted average cost of capital of the business which will be at least 8% per annum compounded.
If the value of the Group is lower than its adjusted base valuation at the end of the performance period, there will be no reward pool.
To the extent that the Groups value exceeds its adjusted base valuation at the end of the performance period, 10% of the growth in value over the adjusted base valuation goes into the reward pool.
