Business overview Business review Governance Financial statements Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011 39 Remuneration report The Directors present their Remuneration Report for the period ended 2 July 2011.
Introduction The Remuneration Committee has prepared this report in accordance with the requirements of Section 420 Companies Act 2006 and the Listing Rules.
The report and the Groups remuneration policy comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
An ordinary resolution to approve the report through a shareholder vote will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
The disclosures that the Groups auditors are required to audit within the Remuneration Report are contained in the section headed Audited Information.
The auditors opinion is included in their report on page 52.
In this report Nick Wharton appears both as a Non-Executive Director and as CEO.
This is because he served as Non-Executive Director until 1 December 2010 when he was appointed as CEO designate.
Nick succeeded Will Adderley as CEO on 17 February 2011 when Will became Executive Deputy Chairman.
Non-audited information Remuneration committee membership and advisers The purpose of the Committee is to assist the Board by: Recommending to the Board the specific pay and benefits packages for the Executive Directors, including the remuneration package of Nick Wharton on appointment as Chief Executive: Recommending and monitoring the structure and level of pay and benefits for senior management below Board level: and Implementing any awards made under share incentive schemes.
The full terms of reference for the Committee can be found on the Companys website, www.
The following Directors served on the Committee during the year: Member Period from: To: Marion Sears Chair 18 January 2005 To date Geoff Cooper 18 January 2005 To date Simon Emeny 25 June 2007 To date Nick Wharton 16 September 2009 30 November 2010 Marion Sears acts as Secretary to the Committee.
Six meetings were held in the year and members attendance was as shown in the table below.
Meetings Member attended: Marion Sears Chair 6 Geoff Cooper 6 Simon Emeny 5 Nick Wharton 1 Prior to his appointment as an Executive Director on 1 December 2010, Nick Wharton was a member of the committee in his role as Non-Executive Director.
He did not participate in any decisions concerning his own remuneration.
No Director is ever present when their own remuneration is discussed.
During the year, the committee appointed Deloitte to review and benchmark the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
Deloittes only other connection with the Company in the last financial year was to provide advice on certain taxation matters in which they were considered to have particular expertise.
40 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011 Governance Remuneration report continued Remuneration committee role, responsibility and meetings The Board has delegated to the Remuneration Committee responsibility for reviewing and recommending the pay and benefits and contractual arrangements of the Executive Directors and senior managers and for overseeing the operation of the Groups share schemes.
The Remuneration Committee is committed to principles of accountability and transparency to ensure that remuneration arrangements demonstrate a clear link between performance and reward.
The committee considers fully the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code and its terms of reference are available on the Groups website.
Executive remuneration policy and alignment with corporate strategy The Remuneration Committees policy is to provide an executive remuneration structure that will pay fairly for the roles and responsibilities of each director, and incentivise strongly for value creation, with an emphasis on the long term.
This is in line with our successful strategy to continue to grow and strengthen our business as described in the Chief Executives review.
The Committee considers alignment between Group strategy and the remuneration of its senior executives to be critical.
In view of this required director shareholdings are set at above market levels.
The committee also believes that senior executives should be highly rewarded on a market competitive basis for the delivery of stretching goals but should receive reduced rewards if the business performs poorly.
The pay and employment conditions of employees of the Group are also taken into account when determining directors remuneration.
In particular the remuneration policy aims to provide packages for Executive Directors and other senior managers in the Group which: Align managements interests with those of shareholders by incentivising management to deliver the Groups long-term strategy and enhance shareholder value: Provide management with the opportunity to earn competitive remuneration through variable pay: Provide upper quartile rewards compared to other FTSE 250 companies, but only if upper quartile performance is delivered: and Enable the Group to attract and retain management of the calibre required to run the business and drive exceptional shareholder value creation.
To strengthen further the alignment between management and long term business success, Executive Directors are required to build up, over time, a shareholding equivalent to at least twice their base salary.
Balance of fixed and variable remuneration The Remuneration Committees policy is that a substantial proportion of the Executive Directors remuneration should be variable and performance related in order to encourage and reward superior business performance and shareholder returns.
Through performance criteria and the setting of personal objectives each directors remuneration is individually linked to both personal and Company performance.
The following illustrates the balance between fixed and variable remuneration during the year for the Executive Directors: 220 220 100 Fixed 220% LTIP 38% LTIP 30% 200 200 Variable 180 180 80 160 160 140 140 Bonus 20% % of Base 60 120 120 Bonus 31% salary 100 100 Fixed 50% 100% 100% 100% 40 80 80 60 60 Fixed 31% 20 40 40 20 20 0 0 0 Maximum opportunity Target On target Maximum performance opportunity The breakdown does not include any share price growth or other benefits e. g. cash car allowance, value of private medical insurance, pension contribution or all employee share ownership plans.
Business overview Business review Governance Financial statements Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011 41 Summary of Remuneration The Remuneration Committee selects performance measures that it believes are aligned with the Groups strategic goals, that are unambiguous and easy to calculate and that are transparent to Directors and shareholders.
Each element of remuneration is designed to support the achievement of different corporate objectives as outlined in the following table: Element Purpose and link to remuneration policy Maximum award Key features Base salary Reflects at or below median market N A Paid monthly in cash salary for the individual and their role Based on individual contribution Takes account of personal Reviewed annually any increase in performance and contribution to context of Group wide review corporate performance Annual Bonus Rewards the achievement of annual 100% of base salary Paid in cash after year end results are EPS targets audited Remuneration Committee discretion linked to achievement of personal objectives LTIP Aligns with shareholder interests 120% of base salary Based on EPS performance through the delivery of shares Vests based on a three year Rewards growth in long-term performance period earnings and shareholder value Shares vesting may contribute to minimum shareholding requirement Will increase to 150% of base salary in 2011 12, subject to shareholder approval.
During the year the committee expressly considered whether to introduce provisions that permit the Company to reclaim variable components of remuneration in exceptional circumstances.
It was decided that while such provisions are particularly required in other industries, they would be inappropriate at this time at Dunelm.
Further details are provided about each element of remuneration below.
Base salary and benefits Prior to the beginning of each financial year the Remuneration Committee sets the base salaries of Executive Directors.
The committee examines the salaries of Directors in a comparator group of public companies and considers the operational scale and complexity of the role each Director performs.
It also reviews published research and surveys, and considers the wage increases across the Group as a whole.
The committee aims to set salaries at or below the median level provided by similar companies.
In addition to base salary, the Executive Directors are entitled to benefits comprising a car allowance, a contribution to a personal pension, private medical insurance and life insurance.
During the year, Will Adderley received an increase in basic salary of 2%, in line with the pay increase across the Group.
Will then took a reduced salary when he assumed his new role as Executive Deputy Chairman.
Wills basic salary will be unchanged in 2011 12.
Nick Whartons base salary and remuneration from date of joining were set out in last years remuneration report.
Nicks basic salary is first due for review from July 2012.
David Steads role has increased significantly over recent years as a result of the growth of the business and includes additional responsibility, inter alia, for the HR and IT functions.
After taking these factors into account and benchmarking Davids salary against comparable roles in other companies, the committee awarded a base salary increase in 2010 11 of 13.6% to 255,000.
It continues to be below median level for the FTSE 250 and below our closest competitors.
In 2011 12 Davids base salary has increased in line with the Company wide review by 1.5% to 258,800.
42 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011 Governance Remuneration report continued Annual bonus The Group operates a discretionary annual cash bonus scheme.
Any bonus amounts determined to be payable are paid after the year-end results are finalised.
The Remuneration Committee has established bonus objectives that are principally financial, based on the level of EPS achieved against target for the relevant financial year, but also include personal objectives for the year relevant to each Director.
In setting the budget EPS target for the year, both market consensus expectations for EPS and individual broker forecasts are considered.
As notified in last years annual report, the potential reward available to Executive Directors under this scheme was increased for the year ended 2 July 2011 as follows with payment in each case conditional on satisfactory personal performance against job objectives : EPS Bonus payment performance percentage of base salary percentage of target FY10 FY11 Threshold 93% 3% 5% Target 100% 24% 40% Maximum 112% 60% 100% For the year ended 2 July 2011, EPS was 7% below target.
After due consideration of job performance, the committee awarded an annual bonus to Nick Wharton of 11,667 proportionate to date of joining, to Will Adderley of 15,219 and to David Stead of 12,750.
Long-Term Incentive Plan Under the LTIP, Executive Directors are awarded nominal cost share options annually.
These awards will vest three years after date of grant, to the extent that the applicable performance target is met.
If there is a change of control of the Company, any awards under the LTIP that have not yet vested will be exercisable, at the discretion of the Company, taking into account the period of time that has elapsed since grant of the award, and to the extent that any performance target has been met.
The Remuneration Committee has chosen growth in fully diluted EPS over each three-year performance period as the performance target for the awards under the LTIP.
The committee believes that this measure is closely aligned to the drivers of growth of the business, and that in the long term, EPS performance will be reflected in shareholder value.
The committee is satisfied that capital expenditure controls exercised by the Board are sufficiently rigorous to avoid EPS accretion by means of ineffective investment of capital, and in any event reserves the right to adjust the target in the event of a major capital transaction.
The LTIP is structured as follows awards vest on a straight-line basis between the threshold and maximum points : Amount of award Compound Annual Growth in EPS to vest Periods ending 2010 2011, 2012, 2013 Threshold RPI 5% RPI 3% 25% Maximum RPI 20% RPI 12% 100% The committee decided after consultation with shareholders, to reduce the performance hurdle in respect of the schemes maturing from 2011, recognising the challenging market conditions expected to result from global recession.
The committee meets after the results for each three-year performance period and are available to determine the extent to which performance conditions have been satisfied.
Awards cannot be granted to Executive Directors under the LTIP over Ordinary Shares in excess of 5% of the issued Ordinary Share capital in any rolling 10 year period.
Business overview Business review Governance Financial statements Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011 43 Conditional awards of nominal cost options over Ordinary Shares worth 120% of base salary were made to Will Adderley and David Stead in March and September 2007, in September 2008 and in September 2009: and to Nick Wharton pro rata to service, Will Adderley and David Stead on 1 December 2010.
In addition, on 1 December 2010, with the approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, a one off nominal cost option award was made to Nick Wharton under the LTIP over 198,807 Ordinary Shares.
The award will vest on 30 November 2015, subject to Nick continuing to be employed by the Company at that date.
No other performance conditions apply to this award.
The committee approved this award to Nick on his appointment as Chief Executive.
It considered that a longer than usual vesting period five years would be sufficient without further performance hurdles being applied.
The closing share price on the date preceding the options granted on 1 December 2010, which was used to calculate the number of shares covered by the award, was 503p.
The September 2007 award was in respect of the three-year performance period to 3 July 2010, over which the compound annual fully diluted growth in EPS was 30.1% 27.3% above RPI.
Accordingly, 100% of the conditional nominal cost options awarded in September 2007 vested in September 2010 and the entitlements were exercised by both Will Adderley 190,130 shares and David Stead 127,792 shares on 11 and 12 October 2010.
The closing share price on those days were 440p and 449p respectively.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the Companys EPS record over the three-year performance period which ended on 2 July 2011.
Reported fully diluted EPS grew at a compound annual rate of 20.8%.
This is 18.0% above RPI over the same period.
Accordingly, 100% of the September 2008 LTIP award will vest in September 2011, representing 259,459 shares in favour of Will Adderley and 178,378 shares in favour of David Stead.
Changes in policy during the year As noted in last years report, we increased the maximum annual cash bonus potential for Executive Directors in the year ended 2 July 2011 to 100% of salary previously 60%.
This change was made to bring Dunelm into line with normal market practice.
During the year a requirement was introduced for Executive Directors to build a shareholding over time equivalent to at least twice their basic salary, further reinforcing the alignment of interests between management and shareholders.
There have been no other changes to remuneration policy during the year.
Proposed future changes in policy From 2011 12 the annual bonus performance range will move to 95% 105% of budget EPS.
This is a narrower range than the 93% 112% used in the year ended 2 July 2011 but is considered to be more appropriate for a larger company.
It also harmonises the bonus structure for Executive Directors with that of the new operating board.
We also indicated in last years report that we would review the long-term incentive arrangements applicable to Executive Directors.
A formal review was carried out in May with the benefit of external advice from Deloitte.
In the review we took advice on how Dunelms Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP compared to equivalent schemes in other FTSE 250 companies, as well as the overall remuneration levels of Dunelms Executive Directors compared with the median.
The conclusion was that Dunelms overall remuneration levels are restrained.
This is because base salaries are at or below median levels and both annual bonus and LTIP are functions of base salary.
Whilst the Remuneration Committee is content with the positioning of Executive Directors base salaries, we believe that it is important to provide both incentive and reward for strong business performance.
Accordingly, taking into account the findings of our review we wish to increase both the maximum reward achievable under the LTIP and the performance target required in order to achieve the maximum reward.
Specifically, we propose that the award of conditional nominal cost share options under the LTIP should be increased to 150 per cent of salary currently 120 per cent, with vesting on a straight-line basis when compound annual growth rate in EPS over the plan period falls between RPI 3 per cent and RPI 15 per cent currently RPI 3 per cent to RPI 12 per cent.
This proposed change will be put to shareholders for approval at the forthcoming AGM.
44 Dunelm Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011 Governance Remuneration report continued Other share options The Group operates an all-employee SAYE scheme in which Executive Directors are also entitled to participate after having been employed for 3 months.
Pension arrangements The Remuneration Committee has decided not to use final salary pension plans as a way of remunerating its Executive Directors.
Instead the Group contributes to the Executive Directors personal pension plans.
The Remuneration Committee believes this is an efficient way to assist Executives to prepare for retirement.
When determining overall remuneration levels for an Executive, the Remuneration Committee takes account of contributions to pension plans.
Share ownership requirements Executive Directors are required to build a shareholding equal to at least twice their base salary over time and shares vesting under the LTIP must be held for this purpose.
Below Board level, members of the Operating Board are required to own shares equal to at least one times their base salary, to be accumulated over time.
Non-Executive remuneration policy Non-Executive Directors remuneration is determined by the Executive Directors.
The Non-Executive Directors do not receive bonuses or participate in any incentive plans.
They are paid annual fees which reflect additional responsibilities taken when chairing a committee of the Board.
Fees were reviewed and amended in the light of market practice in July 2010.
The next review will be in July 2012.
Service contracts In accordance with the Groups policy, the service contracts of the Executive Directors have no fixed term, the notice period for termination is 12 months from either party and payments on termination are restricted to a maximum of the value of salary for the notice period.
The Remuneration Committee will apply mitigation rigorously in respect of any post remuneration payment.
The Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment for an initial period of three years with a provision for termination of one months notice from either party, or three months notice from either party in the case of Geoff Cooper, the Chairman.
Date of Unexpired Notice contract term period Nick Wharton 15.09.10 n a 12 months Will Adderley 28.09.06 n a 12 months David Stead 15.09.03 n a 12 months Geoff Cooper 08.10.04 25 months 3 months Marion Sears 22.07.04 22 months 1 month Simon Emeny 25.06.07 21 months 1 month Senior Executive remuneration The Remuneration Committee provides oversight and guidance on the remuneration structure for below Board management.
The package for new appointments is formally presented to the committee for approval.
In conducting its assessment of senior executive remuneration the committee pays particular regard to whether any individual is incentivised to take risks inappropriate to their role and responsibilities.
In the finance function, managers are not remunerated against individual financial performance, but against corporate performance and personal qualitative objectives.
Share options and dilution It is Group policy to comply with the provisions of the Association of British Insurers Guidelines on Executive Remuneration when determining the number of shares over which share scheme incentive awards may be made.
At the date of this report options have been granted over 1.23% of the Companys issued share capital.
