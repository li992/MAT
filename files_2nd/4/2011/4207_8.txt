Croda International Plc Annual Report 2011 Remuneration report Dear Shareholder As described in the Business Review, 2011 was another outstanding year of growth for Croda, particularly in light of the record results delivered in 2010 and the wider context of continuing tough global economic conditions.
The results demonstrate the ability of our business to continue to deliver growth in difficult market conditions and, in particular, the strength of the Groups strategy and effective leadership of our dynamic and experienced management team.
The Remuneration Committee the Committee consider the remuneration paid to our management team to fairly reflect their performance during the year.
The annual bonus paid out in full arising from the 2011 income, as calculated for the purpose of the bonus scheme, exceeding the maximum targeted income and the 2009 LTIP and BCIP awards performance targets were also met in full, which reflected a growth in earnings per share of 137% over the three year period ended 31 December 2011, and a total shareholder return created of over 290% which resulted in Croda being amongst the top fifteen performing FTSE 250 companies over the three year performance period.
As described in the Chairmans statement, 2012 marks the start of a new era at Croda, with a new Group Chief Executive in post.
The new Group Chief Executive has been with Croda for over 20 years and is supported by a highly experienced and dedicated senior team.
The Board consider the leadership team to be ideally placed to continue to deliver the Companys consistent track record of delivering profitable growth.
The Committee considers our current remuneration policy of paying competitively against comparable international businesses, with an incentive structure weighted towards long-term performance, to continue to serve the business well.
The Committee has a clear track record of aligning pay with performance and shareholder value creation.
As a result, our broad policy framework is to be retained for 2012.
However, in light of the changes to the Board that take effect for 2012, and in response to developments in corporate governance expectations, the following amendments to our current policy are being introduced for 2012: l the new Group Chief Executives remuneration has been adjusted to reflect his promotion: and l clawback provisions are to be introduced into both the annual and long-term incentive plans operated by the Company from 2012.
The Committee believes that the policy in place for 2012 will provide it with sufficient flexibility to meet its objective of retaining and motivating the Companys management team to continue to deliver the Boards strategic objectives.
In addition, given that a substantial proportion of the total package is weighted towards long-term performance, the deferral requirement that forms part of the annual bonus arrangements and the introduction of clawback provisions for 2012, the Committee is comfortable that the current arrangements do not inadvertently encourage undue risk taking.
As a result, the Committee looks forward to your support of our remuneration policy at the 2012 AGM.
S Musesengwa Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 30 Directors report | Business review Directors report | Governance Financial statements Other information The directors present their remuneration report which covers the remuneration of both executive and non-executive directors and certain senior executives.
This report sets out the policy for the financial year just ended, for the forthcoming year and, subject to ongoing review, for subsequent years.
The report has been approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by the chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
The first section of the report contains unaudited information and the second section audited information.
The report will be subject to approval by shareholders at the AGM in April 2012.
Section 1: Unaudited information The role of the Remuneration Committee The Committee reviews and approves the annual salaries, bonus arrangements, service agreements and other employment conditions of the executive directors and certain members of the senior executive management team designated by the Board.
In so doing it takes due account of pay and conditions in the Group as a whole and receives information on pay proposals for other employees throughout the Group.
It also approves the design of, and determines targets for, any performance related bonus pay schemes operated by the Group, approves the total annual payments made under such schemes, reviews the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and shareholders and approves the award of long-term incentives.
The Committee has delegated responsibility for setting the remuneration of the Chairman.
The full terms of reference of the Committee are published on the Companys website www.
Membership and operation The Committee comprises all non-executive directors including the Chairman and is chaired by Stanley Musesengwa.
The Group Chief Executive is usually invited to attend all meetings but neither he nor the Chairman attends when their individual remuneration is being discussed.
The Committee met five times during the year.
Other directors and employees of the Company who attended some, or all, of the meetings during the year and provided advice and services to the Committee were Samantha Brook VP Human Resources, Graham Myers Group Financial Controller Treasurer and Louise Scott Company Secretary.
All have the appropriate qualifications and experience to advise the Committee on aspects of the Groups policies and practices.
New Bridge Street NBS have been appointed by the Committee to provide independent advice on remuneration policy and practice.
NBS has no connection with the Company other than in the provision of advice in relation to executive remuneration.
Another subsidiary of Aon Corporation, the ultimate parent company of NBS, provides insurance broking services to the Group.
The Committee is comfortable that no conflicts arise out of these relationships.
The key activities of the Committee undertaken during the year which were supported, as appropriate, by NBS are set out below.
Further details of these activities appear later in this report: l reviewing executive directors and senior executives salary levels including setting an appropriate salary level for the new Group Chief Executive : l determining annual bonus awards in respect of 2010 performance: l setting the annual bonus plan terms for 2011: l testing of performance targets for the Companys 2008 long-term incentive awards: l determining 2011 award levels and the associated performance targets under the Companys long-term incentive plans: l reviewing the level of the Chairmans fee: l determining the treatment of Mike Humphreys long term incentives on his retirement: and l implementation of clawback provisions in the Companys annual bonus and long-term incentive plans.
Policy on directors and senior executives remuneration The key objectives of Crodas executive remuneration policy are: l to ensure that individual rewards and incentives are comparable with those provided by similar companies having regard to the Groups turnover, business sector and market worth and the need for skills to manage international businesses: l to enable the Group to attract and retain high calibre people: l to give full consideration to the relevant principles on directors remuneration set out in the 2010 UK Corporate Governance Code: and l to ensure a balance between fixed and performance related remuneration, the latter being related to objective measurement of the financial performance of the Company.
The Committee believes that the interests of shareholders and directors are more closely aligned by the operation of short-term incentives which encourage the achievement of stretching profit targets and under which rewards may be delivered in the form of cash and shares, combined with share-based long-term incentives that reward performance against three year earnings per share and relative total shareholder return targets.
In designing an appropriate incentive structure for the executive directors and senior executive management team, the Committee endeavours to set challenging performance criteria that are aligned with the Groups strategy for the business and the enhancement of shareholder value.
In line with the Association of British Insurers Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee ensures that the incentive structure for executive directors and senior executive management will not raise environmental, social or governance ESG risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
More generally, with regard to the overall remuneration structure, there is no restriction on the Committee which prevents it from taking into account corporate governance on ESG matters and it takes due account of issues of general operational risk when structuring incentives.
The Committee takes due account of remuneration structures elsewhere in the Group when setting pay for the executive directors for example, consideration is given to the overall salary increase budget and the incentive structures that operate across the Group.

Only basic salary is pensionable.
Other market standard benefits are provided.

32 Directors report | Business review Directors report | Governance Financial statements Other information Balance between fixed and variable pay As described previously, a substantial proportion of the executive directors pay is performance related.
The charts below illustrate the balance between fixed and performance related pay at target and maximum performance levels based on the remuneration policy that is to operate in the current financial year the full policy is described in detail below.
Fixed and variable pay: Average executive director at target and maximum performance levels Assumptions: Target: annual bonus award of 50% of Maximum salary plus threshold vesting under the LTIP and BCIP the BCIP assumes 50% of target bonus invested in the plan.

Benefits: including pension have been 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% excluded from the analysis for simplicity.
Base salary Annual bonus LTIP & BCIP As can be seen from the charts, a substantial proportion of the total package is weighted towards long-term performance through the LTIP and BCIP long-term incentive arrangements.
In addition, there is a deferral requirement that forms part of the annual bonus arrangements which requires bonus awards in excess of 50% of salary to be deferred into Croda shares for a period of three years, share ownership guidelines and, from 2012, clawback provisions operating across the incentive arrangements for executive directors and senior executives.
After taking due account of these factors, allied to the rigorous process that is undertaken in setting incentive plan targets and determining payouts including regular liaison between the Audit and Remuneration Committees as appropriate, the Committee is comfortable that the current arrangements do not inadvertently encourage undue risk taking.
In testing the LTIP and BCIP performance targets, independent third party advisors provide information in respect of the extent to which targets are met, with audited results used to determine vesting in respect of EPS targets.
Components of executive directors remuneration Basic salary The Committee reviews the base salary levels annually with effect from 1 January.
Account is taken of the performance of the individual concerned, together with any change in responsibilities that may have occurred, and the rates of pay in international manufacturing and pan-sector companies of a comparable size market capitalisation and turnover and complexity.
Data is sourced from the Committees independent advisers, NBS.
The salary levels of the executive directors who were in their posts on 1 January 2012 are as follows: Executive director Basic salary at Basic salary at % increase 1 January 2012 31 December 2011 S E Foots 500,000 300,000 66 M S Christie 350,200 340,000 3 The revised salary set for Steve Foots reflected his additional responsibilities on being promoted to Group Chief Executive but also took due account of the fact that this is his first role as a PLC Chief Executive.
Accordingly, his salary was set at around the lower quartile of the relevant benchmarks with the Committees intention being to increase his salary, based on performance and experience in the position, over the next few years to ensure his remuneration is consistent with the Companys stated remuneration policy.
The salary increase awarded to Sean Christie, at 3%, was consistent with the salary increase budget operated across the Group and reflects the individuals continued strong performance.
Keith Layden was appointed a director on 6 February 2012 and his current salary is 280,000.
33 Croda International Plc Annual Report 2011 Remuneration report Performance-related annual bonus The Company operates bonus schemes for its directors and senior executives.
Bonus payments are not pensionable.
The 2011 bonuses for executive directors were calculated by reference to the amount by which the income for the year, which is defined as the Group EBITDA for continuing operations before exceptional items and any charges or credits under IFRS 2 Share based payments less a notional interest charge on working capital employed during the year the 2011 income, exceeded the income for 2010 calculated on the same basis the base income.
Bonuses for 2011 are payable against a graduated scale once the 2011 income exceeds the base income by inflation defined as the consumer prices index CPI, with maximum bonuses due at CPI plus 10%.
Income is measured after providing for the cost of any bonuses.
Once the level of bonus has been determined against the targets set at the start of the year, the Committee has the discretion to take health, safety and environmental performance into consideration when determining the actual overall level of individual bonus payments and it may reduce the bonus awards if it considers it appropriate to do so e. g. if health, safety and environmental performance is not considered satisfactory during the period over which the bonus was earned.
The maximum amount of bonus payable to the executive directors is 100% of salary with the net element of any bonus in excess of 50% of salary being compulsorily invested in the BCIP.
With regard to the actual performance delivered during 2011, 2011 income exceeded base income by 11.2% above CPI.
Following an assessment of the health, safety and environmental performance of the Group in 2011, which was considered satisfactory, the bonuses payable to each of the executive directors were at 100% of salary reflecting the fact that the maximum target was exceeded.
Actual bonus payments are included in the table on page 39.
Given the record performance delivered in 2011 the Committee were comfortable paying maximum bonuses for what was considered an exceptional achievement.
With regard to 2012 bonuses, the maximum bonus opportunity will remain unchanged at 100% of salary.
The performance targets will continue to operate on a similar basis, requiring out-performance of the 2011 income before bonuses become eligible for payment.
The target range set for 2012 will require 2011 income to be exceeded by 10% above CPI with the Committee considering this target to be equally as challenging as the range of targets set for the 2011 annual bonus given that 2011 was another record year and the fact that current economic circumstances remain challenging.
The Committee remains comfortable that the structure of the annual bonus does not encourage the pursuit of strategies that may involve inappropriate risk-taking and that the mandatory reinvestment of net bonuses in excess of 50% of salary into shares in any year is considered to provide clear alignment with shareholders and foster a longer-term link between annual performance and reward.
In addition, the 2012 annual bonus will also be subject to clawback provisions which will enable the Committee to recover the value overpaid to an executive director in respect of 2012 performance in the event of a misstatement of the Companys financial results, an error being made in assessing the extent to which performance targets were ultimately achieved or in the event of serious misconduct.
The clawback provisions will operate for a three year period following the date on which the bonus is paid.
Long-term incentives Long-term incentives are provided to executive directors through two long-term incentive plans, the BCIP and the LTIP.
It is the Committees policy, subject to unforeseen circumstances, that these will comprise the sole long-term elements of the total remuneration package of executive directors for the foreseeable future.
It is also the Committees policy to continue exercising its right to decide the number of LTIP awards to be granted to each executive director subject to plan limits.
BCIP The BCIP operates in conjunction with the annual bonus schemes and allows participants to invest a proportion of their net annual cash bonus in Company shares.
Participants have to agree to hold the invested shares for three years in return for which they receive a conditional award entitling them to additional shares subject to the achievement of the BCIPs performance condition.
The maximum number of shares over which an award can be granted to an employee in a single year is limited to shares having a market value not exceeding 100% of the employees salary.
The levels of awards differ between participants.
As detailed in last years remuneration report, following consultation with the Companys major shareholders and shareholder protection bodies, since 2011, executive directors and members of the Group Executive and Finance Committees receive matching shares based on the pre-tax equivalent number of shares invested in the BCIP by participants from their net of tax annual bonus proceeds.
Prior to 2011, matching shares were awarded based on the post-tax number of invested shares.
It is compulsory for members of this group, whose gross bonus could exceed 50% of their annual salary, to invest the excess over 50%, net of tax, in shares unless they are within three years of anticipated retirement date.
The awards to date have been subject to a performance condition initially adopted in 2007 which is structured to require the achievement of a challenging sliding scale of adjusted earnings per share growth EPS targets in excess of retail price inflation RPI : Adjusted EPS growth over the three year period Proportion of award vesting Less than RPI 12% No vesting RPI 12% 30% RPI 24% 100% Straight-line vesting occurs between these points 34 Directors report | Business review Directors report | Governance Financial statements Other information If the performance target is met, awards vest and shares become eligible to be transferred to the employee.
If the employee does not retain their invested shares until the release date their award lapses.
It is intended that the same performance target will be applied to any BCIP awards made in 2012.
EPS continues to be a key internal measure used to assess the performance of the business and is aligned with the Companys objectives of continuing to deliver profitable growth and operating a progressive dividend policy.
With regard to the range of targets set, they are considered to remain appropriate, providing a stretching but realistic target from a record result in 2011.
LTIP Participation in the LTIP is limited to executive directors and senior executives.
Annual awards of shares are made based on varying percentages of salary.
Shareholder approval was sought and received at the 2011 AGM to increase the annual award limit under the LTIP from 100% of salary to 200% of salary.
However, awards were limited to 100% of salary in 2011 and it is intended that awards will remain at, or below, 100% of salary in 2012.
Awards are subject to performance conditions measured over a period of not less than three years.
The awards are subject to a performance condition which is split into two separate parts, each with a separate performance condition.
Half of any LTIP awards vest based on a condition measuring the Companys relative total shareholder return TSR.
For awards to date, relative TSR performance has been measured against the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts.
There are a limited number of direct competitors to Croda and the Committee was mindful of the dangers inherent in operating a relative TSR-based performance condition with a comparator group comprised of only a small number of companies.
The FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts has, therefore, been considered to date as an appropriate comparator group by the Committee since it has been the index within which Croda resides.
Vesting takes place on the following sliding scale: Rank of the Companys TSR against the FTSE 250 excluding Investment Trusts Vesting % TSR part Below median 0% Median 30% Upper quartile 100% Between median and upper quartile 30% - 100% pro rata The remaining half of the awards vest based on the same EPS growth condition that is set for the BCIP, with vesting thus taking place on the following slide scale: Adjusted EPS growth over the three year period Vesting % EPS part Less than RPI 12% No vesting RPI 12% 30% RPI 24% 100% Straight-line vesting occurs between these points Use of relative TSR in tandem with EPS growth targets is considered appropriate since it provides clear alignment between executives and shareholders in focusing management to deliver above market total returns at the same time as incentivising executives to deliver growth in EPS which, as described above, is a key internal measure of performance.
If the performance target is met, awards will become eligible for exercise by the employee.
With regard to awards to be granted in 2012, it is intended that awards will be granted at 100% of salary to the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director with the newly appointed Chief Technology Officer being granted awards at 70% of salary.
In terms of performance targets, it is also anticipated that the same approach will operate.
LTIP and BCIP awards granted in 2012 to executive directors will also be subject to clawback provisions which will enable the Committee to clawback the value overpaid to an executive director in respect of performance during the three years ending 31 December 2014 in the event of a material misstatement of the Companys financial results or misconduct.
The clawback provisions will operate for a three year period following the date on which the awards vest.
The gains arising from LTIP and BCIP awards vesting in 2011 are set out on page 42 with the awards vesting in full due to the performance targets applying to the awards granted in 2009 being achieved in full.
35 Croda International Plc Annual Report 2011 Remuneration report Senior Executive Share Option Schemes Following the adoption of the BCIP and the LTIP, the operation of the Senior Executive Share Option Schemes was discontinued except in relation to options already granted.
The only options now outstanding were granted in 2003.
The options were granted subject to performance conditions which required basic EPS before exceptional items to grow at RPI plus 7% per annum over the performance period for 100% of the options granted to be exercisable.
The performance conditions have been satisfied in full.
Mike Humphrey was the only director who held these options and details of his options are shown in the table on page 38.
It is the Companys current intention to satisfy awards under the BCIP and the LTIP and the exercise of share options primarily from shares held in the Employee Share Ownership Trust, treasury shares and shares purchased in the market and not by the issue of new shares.
Details of shares held for this purpose are given in note 25 on page 84.
Pension and other benefits Croda has a number of different pension plans in the countries in which it operates.
Pension entitlements for Crodas executives are tailored to local market practice, the length of service and age of the participants.
The principal pension plan in the UK is a defined benefit scheme which provides a pension based on a proportion of final salary with a salary cap imposed from 6 April 2011 onwards.
A salary supplement in lieu of pension provision above the salary cap now applies.
The Company is flexible in the manner in which pension provision is made for executive directors with the aim of balancing the needs of the director against the liability of the Company.
Hence, it makes contributions by direct contribution to the Croda defined benefit pension scheme and or by way of a cash supplement in lieu of pension benefits to enable the funding of personal pension arrangements.
Other customary benefits such as company cars or car allowances, health benefits, the UK SAYE Scheme and the Croda Share Incentive Plan SIP which are available to all eligible UK employees, are made available to executive directors.
Benefits in kind are not pensionable.
The Committee reviews the individual components and the balance of these components from time to time.
Components of senior executives remuneration The Group Executive Committee and the Finance Committee are made up from eight senior executives in addition to the three executive directors.
The reward structure for these senior executives is broadly similar to that of the executive directors although there are some differences in LTIP participation.
Service contracts and external appointments Policy The Committees policy on executive directors service contracts is for them to contain a maximum notice period of one year.
In respect of termination, the Committees policy is to deal with each case on its merits, in accordance with the law and any further policy adopted by the Committee at the time.
In the event of early termination, other than for cause, the relevant directors then current salary and contractual benefits would be taken into account in calculating any liability of the Company.
For clarification, the Companys policy is that no entitlement to unearned bonus will be taken into account when determining payments on early termination.
The principal contractual benefits provided in addition to salary are the provision of a car or car allowance, pension, medical insurance and life assurance.
Annual bonuses and long-term incentives are non-contractual and are dealt with in accordance with the rules of the relevant schemes.
Specific contracts Sean Christie and Steve Foots have service contracts dated 15 December 2006 and 16 September 2010 respectively which are terminable by the Company on one years notice and by them on six months notice.
The Company may also terminate the contracts at any time with immediate effect and they would be entitled to receive compensation equivalent to twelve months salary plus the value of their pension benefits valued at 20% of basic salary and the value of other benefits, payable in equal monthly instalments for twelve months or, if less, the remaining period of any notice period not yet completed.
Such payments would discontinue or reduce to the extent that they obtained alternative employment i. e. any such payments would be phased and subject to mitigation to the extent that any alternative employment was commenced.
Mike Humphreys service contract dated 21 December 2005 ended on 31 December 2011 on his retirement as Group Chief Executive.
No payments other than salary accrued due at the date of his retirement were made.
In accordance with the rules of the executive bonus scheme, Mike Humphrey, as a retiree, is entitled to receive his full 2011 bonus as shown in the table of directors remuneration on page 39.
Under the terms of the BCIP and LTIP, as a retiree, he is a good leaver and, accordingly, is entitled to potential vesting under his outstanding share awards.
With regard to the shares represented by the award made to him under the BCIP and LTIP in 2009, since the performance targets have been met in full, he is entitled to exercise the awards in full.
With regard to his unvested BCIP and LTIP awards granted in 2010, he can exercise the awards in full, subject to the application of performance targets, at the awards normal vesting dates.
In relation to the awards granted in 2011, following the application of a pro-rata reduction to the original number of shares awarded of one third, he will be able to exercise a maximum of two-thirds of the original awards, subject to the application of performance targets at the awards normal vesting date at the end of 2013.
In accordance with the rules of the SAYE scheme and the SIP Mike Humphrey is entitled to exercise his outstanding SAYE options and to withdraw the shares invested and awarded to him under the SIP.
36 Directors report | Business review Directors report | Governance Financial statements Other information Under the terms of his historic service contract, Mike Humphrey had a service contract that was terminable by the Company on one years notice and by Mike Humphrey on six months notice.
The Company could also have terminated the contract at any time with immediate effect and Mike Humphrey would be entitled to receive compensation equivalent to twelve months salary plus the value of his pension benefits valued at 20% of basic salary, bonus entitlement 50% based on the assumption that performance targets are deemed to have been achieved and the value of other benefits, payable in equal monthly instalments for twelve months or, if less, the remaining period of any notice period not yet completed.
Such payments would have discontinued or reduced to the extent that he obtained alternative employment i. e. any such payments would have been phased and subject to mitigation to the extent that any alternative employment was commenced.
Mike Humphreys contract was a legacy contract and it is not the Companys current policy to include an element of bonus in payments following termination for other directors.
As announced in July 2011, Mike Humphrey has been appointed Senior Advisor to the Board following his retirement on 31 December 2011.
He will receive a fee of 150,000 for providing strategic advice for a term of 12 months.
He is not eligible to participate in either the annual bonus plan or to receive future long-term incentive awards.
External appointments Executive directors are permitted to accept external non-executive appointments with the prior approval of the Board.
It is normal practice for executive directors to retain fees provided for non-executive appointments.
Mike Humphrey became a non-executive director of IP Group plc in October 2011 and during the year he received total fee payments of 8,512.
Neither of the other two executive directors held nonexecutive positions during the year.
Apart from service agreements and share schemes, no director has had any material interest in any contract with the Company or its subsidiaries requiring disclosure under the Companies Act 2006.
Policy on non-executive directors remuneration The Board is responsible for determining the policy on, and level of, the remuneration of non-executive directors.
The aim is to attract nonexecutive directors who through their experience can further the interests of the Company through their stewardship and contribution to strategic development.
The Boards policy is to provide cash fees at a level commensurate with companies of Crodas size, set fees to reflect the anticipated time commitment of fulfilling the relevant non-executives duties, not to grant share options to non-executive directors and to encourage non-executive directors to establish a holding of Croda shares.
Components of non-executive directors remuneration Non-executives pay comprises cash fees, paid monthly.
All non-executive directors are reimbursed for travel and related business expenses reasonably incurred in performing their duties.
The Chairmans fees are determined by the Remuneration Committee and the fees of the remaining non-executive directors are determined by the Chairman and the executive directors.
These fees were last reviewed in 2008 resulting in increases with effect from 1 January 2009.
During the year NBS was commissioned to provide benchmark fee and typical time commitment data for comparably sized international companies and, consequently, after consideration, fees were increased with effect from 1 April 2011.
The Chairmans fee is now 170,000, the basic annual fee for a non-executive director is now 46,000 with an additional 8,000 for chairing a committee and the Senior Independent director receives an additional 5,000.
Terms of appointment The Chairman and non-executive directors have letters of appointment for an initial fixed term of three years subject to earlier termination by either party on written notice.
In each case, this term can be extended by mutual agreement.
In the case of the Chairman, his term of office was due to expire in September 2011 after six years, but in order to provide continuity during the transition from Mike Humphrey to Steve Foots as Group Chief Executive the Board agreed that the Chairmans period of office should be extended for a further two years.
The discussions were led by the Senior Independent director who consulted with the other members of the Board.
Mike Buzzacott retired from the Board at the end of his term of office in August 2011.
The non-executive directors have no entitlement to contractual termination payments.
The dates of their initial appointments are set out below.
Original appointment date Expiry date of current term M C Flower 16 May 2005 28 September 2013 A M Ferguson 1 July 2011 30 June 2014 S Musesengwa 7 May 2007 6 May 2013 P N N Turner 1 June 2009 31 May 2012 S G Williams 1 July 2010 30 June 2013 M C Buzzacott 2 August 2004 1 August 2011 retired 1 August 2011 37 Croda International Plc Annual Report 2011 Remuneration report Directors interests The beneficial interests at 31 December 2011 of the directors of the Company and their connected persons in the shares of the Company are shown below.
Further information regarding employee share option schemes is given in note 23 to the financial statements on pages 80 to 83.
The BCIP shares comprise 137,924 shares invested by the directors 2010: 166,237 and 160,472 shares which are the subject of conditional awards 2010: 166,237.
The SIP shares comprise 6,115 Partnership shares 2010: 5,857 and 6,115 Matching shares 2010: 5,857.
Share ownership policy The Company has adopted share ownership guidelines which apply to all executive directors and members of the Group Executive Committee and the Finance Committee.
Executives are required to build up a target shareholding of shares with a market value equivalent to 100% of salary from time to time through a combination of share purchases and the retention of incentive shares.
On the exercise of SAYE and executive share options or the vesting of LTIP and or BCIP awards, executives are required to retain shares from the shares awarded representing 50% of the net of tax gain until the target is met or exceeded.
The target is expected to be reached within five years.
All the executive directors have holdings well in excess of the target shareholdings.

Pension rights Prior to 6 April 2006, Mike Humphrey accrued pension benefits under the Croda International Supplemental Scheme CISS.
The CISS was merged with the Croda Group Pension Scheme on 30 September 2010 to form the Croda Pension Scheme CPS.
Mike Humphrey was entitled on retirement at age 60 to a pension equal to his accrued pension at 5 April 2006 accrued at a rate of two-thirds of his annual pensionable remuneration as at 5 April 2006, pro-rated by the ratio of his actual service accrued prior to 5 April 2006 and prospective service to age 60, increased to age 60 at the rate which applies to all preserved pensions in the CISS section of the CPS.
Mike Humphrey started to draw his pension from the Scheme on 21 March 2011, at age 60.
In the event of death a pension equal to two-thirds of the directors pension would become payable to the surviving spouse.
Mike Humphreys pension in payment is guaranteed to increase in line with the rate of inflation up to a maximum of 10% per annum.
During 2011, Mike Humphrey was paid 115,399 2010: 112,000 in addition to his basic salary to enable him to make independent provision for his retirement.
This is the same level of contribution expressed as a percentage of salary in respect of salary in lieu of pension that has been provided to him since 2006.
Sean Christie accrues pension benefits under the CPS with an accrual rate of 1 60th and an entitlement to retire at age 65.
From 6 April 2011 onwards, pension benefits accruing are based on a capped salary of 187,500.
If Sean Christie retires before age 65 a reduced pension is payable unless retiring at the Companys request.
In the event of death a pension equal to 50% of the directors pension would become payable to the surviving spouse.
Sean Christies pension in payment is guaranteed to increase in line with the rate of inflation up to a maximum of 2.5% per annum.
During 2011, Sean Christie was paid 22,876 2010: Nil in addition to his basic salary to enable him to make independent provision for his retirement.
This contribution reflects the introduction of a cap to the maximum salary on which benefits at retirement will be based under the CPS.
Accordingly, benefits above this cap are now provided by a salary supplement in lieu of pension benefits above the cap of 187,500.
This change in benefit structure is expected to be cost neutral for the Company.
Steve Foots accrues pension benefits under the CPS with an accrual rate of 1 60th and an entitlement to retire at age 60.
If Steve Foots retires before age 61, a reduction will be applied to the element of his pension accrued after 5 April 2006, and if he retires before age 60 a reduction will also be applied to the element of his pension accrued before 6 April 2006, unless in either instance he is retiring at the Companys request.
Steve Foots pension in payment is guaranteed to increase in line with the rate of inflation up to a maximum of 10% per annum for benefits accrued prior to 6 April 2006, and in line with inflation up to a maximum of 2.5% per annum for benefits accrued from 6 April 2006 onwards.
During 2011, Steve Foots was paid 16,875 2010: Nil in addition to his basic salary to enable him to make independent provision for his retirement.
As above for Sean Christie, this contribution reflects the introduction of a cap to the maximum salary on which benefits at retirement will be based under the CPS.
Sean Christie and Steve Foots are both also entitled to death in service benefits from the CPS.
