4 The maximum number of ordinary shares in the Company to which the 2010 and 2011 awards granted to Mr R W Simkin relate was reduced from 25,781 and 25,750, respectively, to reflect the length of service with the Group of Mr R W Simkin during the performance periods for such awards.
In relation to the 2009 and 2010 awards, 25% of the award vests if 5% per annum EPS growth is achieved over the relevant performance period, increasing on a sliding scale to 100% if EPS growth is at least 15% per annum over the period.

Therefore, any such PFI sales will be included for the purposes of calculating the vesting of the 2010 and 2011 awards and all future awards under the 2010 LTIP, both in relation to establishing the opening EPS position with respect to an award and in assessing the Groups performance during the relevant performance period.
54 Kier Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Overview Operating review Financial statements Directors pensions Executive directors participate in the Kier Group Pension Scheme the Pension Scheme which has both a defined benefit section and a defined contribution section.
Executive directors accrue pension up to the value of the lifetime allowance.
Where the value of pension benefits exceeds the lifetime allowance, future pension accrual ceases and a cash supplement is paid.
Following changes to the taxation of UK pensions and, in particular, the reduction in the annual allowance, the trustees of the Pension Scheme and the Company have agreed that an executive directors annual pension provision may be replaced partly by a cash supplement.
The level of cash supplement is 20% of that salary which is no longer pensionable or, in the case of Mr I M Lawson, 30%, as the cost of his current membership of the pension scheme is higher than for the other directors.
The Committee has determined the level of cash supplement for each individual with a view to maintaining the Groups pension-related costs at their current level.
An assessment has been carried out by the pension scheme actuary of the cost to the Group of the current benefit provision and the individual supplements have been set at levels which are commensurate with the value of the pension benefit foregone.
The Committee believes that the levels of supplement are in line with market practice.
Only the basic salary of directors is pensionable.
Any cash supplement is excluded in determining annual bonus and long-term incentive entitlements.
Pension benefits earned by those persons who have served as a director during the year ended 30 June 2011 and are members of the defined benefit section of the Pension Scheme are as follows: Accumulated Transfer Transfer Increase Increase Transfer total value of value of in accrued in accrued value of accrued accrued accrued pension pension increase in pension at pension at Increase pension at over the over the accrued 30 June 30 June in transfer 30 June 1 2 year year pension 2011 2010 value 2011 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 I M Lawson 11 8 114 75 961 176 1,137 3,4 D E Mattar 10 7 89 69 686 183 869 5 M P Sheffield 6 140 1,715 182 1,897 6 R W Simkin 33 37 832 80 2,425 658 1,767 1 The figures in this column represent the difference between the total accrued benefit at the end of the year and the equivalent amount at the beginning of the year.

5 Mr M P Sheffield opted out of the Pension Scheme with effect from 30 June 2010 and became entitled to a deferred pension on that date.
Mr M P Sheffield receives a cash allowance of 20% in lieu of continued pension accrual.

The pension figure shown at 30 June 2011 is the annual pension which Mr R W Simkin was entitled to receive at that date.
Upon retirement, Mr R W Simkin opted to surrender 32,374 of pension in return for a pension commencement lump sum of 450,000.
