Griffiths was appointed to the Committee on 31 January 2011.
Remit The Committee is responsible for determining all aspects of executive directors remuneration and for monitoring the remuneration of senior management.
The Committee is also responsible for recommending the remuneration of the chairman to the board.
No director makes a decision relating to their own remuneration.
Individual directors leave the meeting when their own remuneration is being discussed.
The full terms of reference of the Committee are available from the Company on application to the Company secretarial department.
Advisers The Committee has access to professional advice, both inside and outside the Company, and consults with the Chief Executive.
During the year, advice was obtained from Mercer Limited, who provided advice on retirement benefits and administered the Groups defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes, and from , who provided advice on directors remuneration.
As at the date of this report,  provide internal audit services and corporate pensions advice to the Company.
Remuneration policy The ongoing policy of the Committee is to reward the executive directors in line with the current remuneration of directors in comparable businesses taking into consideration the advice of independent benefit consultants in order to recruit, motivate and retain high quality executives within a competitive marketplace.
Consistent with this policy, the benefit packages awarded to executive directors are intended to be competitive and comprise a mix of performance and non-performance related elements designed to incentivise directors and align their longer term interests with those of shareholders.
In the year to 29 January 2011, a significant proportion of the executive directors remuneration was performance related through the annual performance bonus and share awards pursuant to the LTIP.
During the year, the performance related elements of the remuneration package amounted to approximately one half of the total executives package 2010: approximately one third.
The executive directors remuneration consists of the following elements: Base salary and benefits Basic salaries and benefits in kind are reviewed within the policy each year.
Basic salaries are reviewed each year to take account of movements in the market place and individual contribution.
Annual bonus This scheme aims to provide focus among the senior executives, including executive directors, on the annual financial performance of the Group.
It is principally based on Profit Before Tax excluding exceptional items : the Committees view is that this is the most appropriate performance measure since it represents a key short-term operational driver of the business.
A maximum of 75% of each executive directors base salary is currently payable in cash under the scheme.
There have been no changes to the policy from the preceding year and no departures from the policy in the current year.
Following an external independent review of the executive directors remuneration, the maximum percentage of each executive directors base salary payable in cash under the scheme will be increased to 100% for the next financial year: this policy is expected to continue for future years.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011 55 Directors Remuneration Report continued Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP This scheme was approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 19 May 2003 and amended by resolution of the shareholders at the AGM held on 26 May 2009.
It is available to reward executive directors by the award of shares if the average earnings per share EPS of the three years running up to and including the year of calculation exceeds the average EPS of the three years preceding that period, both being adjusted for Retail Price Index, by 10% points or more.
No part of an award vests if EPS growth is less than 10% points above RPI growth over the three year period.
20% 99.9% of an award vests on a sliding scale where EPS growth exceeds RPI growth by 10% points or more but by less than 32.5% points.
100% of an award vests where EPS growth exceeds RPI growth by 32.5% points or more.
The maximum value of any award of shares is 100% of basic salary.
The revised vesting conditions for the LTIP scheme, as outlined above, were approved by shareholders at the AGM on 26 May 2009.
The revised vesting conditions applied to outstanding awards under the scheme as well as to new awards.
The total amount which may vest under outstanding awards and the maximum potential award for each existing award holder was not altered as a result of the revised vesting conditions.
The LTIP performance conditions were chosen to align executive directors share awards to Company performance over a three year period, thereby aligning the interests of the directors with those of the shareholders.
In addition to the above elements of remuneration, there are two further elements which are available to all qualifying employees: All-Employee Share Ownership Plan AESOP The AESOP is HMRC approved and the executive directors participate in both sections of the scheme, which is open to all qualifying employees.
The partnership share element provides that for every three shares a participant purchases in the Company, up to a maximum contribution of 125 per month, the Company will purchase one matching share.
The matching shares purchased are held in trust in the name of the individual.
There are various rules as to the period of time that the shares must be held in trust but after five years the shares can be released tax free to the participant.
The free share element allows participants to receive shares to the value of a common percentage of their earnings, related to the performance of the Group.
The maximum value of the annual award is 3,000 and the shares awarded are held in trust for five years.
Under the terms of this scheme, the matching shares will be forfeited if the participant leaves the employment of the Company within three years of the award.
All other partnership, matching and free shares must be removed from the trust if employment with the Company ceases.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE The SAYE is HMRC approved and is available to all qualifying employees, including executive directors.
It is based on a five year savings contract which provides the participant with an option to purchase shares after five years at a discounted price fixed at the time the contract is taken out, or earlier as provided by the scheme rules.
No performance conditions require to be met by any participant in order to exercise their option under the SAYE.
Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The ESOS was approved by shareholders at the 2010 AGM and approved by HMRC on 11 June 2010.
The 2010 ESOS replaced the Companys current Executive Share Option Scheme, which expires on 19 May 2013 2003 ESOS.
To date, no options have been awarded under the 2003 ESOS or the 2010 ESOS.
Pension schemes Executive directors are all members of the A. G. BARR p. l. c. 2008 Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
The scheme has a defined benefit section and a defined contribution section.
The defined benefit section was closed to new entrants from 14 August 2003.
Details of the entitlements accruing to the two directors who are currently members of the defined benefit section are detailed in the table on page 60.
The contributions paid to the defined contribution section in respect of three directors are disclosed on page 61.
Non-executive directors remuneration The remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the board within the limits set by the Articles and reviewed annually.
Non-executive directors received remuneration for their services during the year as disclosed in the table of directors detailed emoluments on page 58.
The non-executive directors do not participate in any of the Companys share option schemes, share award schemes, or bonus schemes.
With the exception of W. R. G. Barr, the non-executive directors do not participate in the Companys pension schemes.
56 A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Directors service contracts Executive directors are appointed on rolling contracts which do not have a set termination date.
An executive directors contract will terminate following either the Company or the executive director giving the other requisite notice that they wish to terminate an executive directors contract.
It is the Companys current policy that executive directors service contracts have a notice period of not normally more than one year.
The service contract for each of the executive directors provides for a notice period of one year except during the six months following either a takeover of or by the Company or a Company reconstruction.
Under these conditions and certain circumstances the notice period reverts to two years for each of the executive directors.
The Committee considers that, given the shareholding structure of the Company, this condition is appropriate in order to attract and retain high calibre executive directors.
Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial period of three years.
It is the Companys current policy that non-executive directors may serve a maximum of three consecutive three-year terms.
Thereafter, they are reappointed annually.
Their service contracts are terminable by either the Company or the directors themselves upon three months notice.
The terms and conditions of appointment of the non-executive directors are available for inspection at the Companys registered office during business hours and at the AGM.
The executive and non-executive directors have no contractual entitlement to compensation payments in the event of loss of office other than those related to their period of notice.
Details of the service contracts of the executive directors and of the letters of appointment for the non-executive directors are as follows: Notice period Notice period Effective date required from required from of contract director Company Executive R. A.

Statement of consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Group In determining remuneration, consideration will be given to reward levels throughout the organisation as well as in the external employment market.
The Committee aims to reward all employees fairly based on their role, their performance and salary levels in the wider market.
In the year under review, excluding A. L. Memmott, the average base salary increase for the executive directors was 2.7% and for all other staff was 2.8%.
The base salary increase for A. L. Memmott in the year under review was 10.9%.
A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011 57 Directors Remuneration Report continued Performance review The graph below shows the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR performance against the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts over the past five years.
In the opinion of the board, the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts is the most appropriate index against which the TSR of the Company should be measured because it represents a broad equity market index of which the Company is a constituent member.

B. C. Short and A. L. Memmott for the year ended 29 January 2011 are cash bonuses made in compensation for the forfeiture by those directors of LTIP awards made to them in October 2008.
Having met the relevant performance criteria under the LTIP, these directors elected, pursuant to a resolution of the Remuneration Committee and with the consent of the trustee of the LTIP, to forfeit these LTIP awards and receive an equivalent cash bonus in substitution for the awards in order to optimise the tax treatment of those awards.
As a condition of these directors being authorised to forfeit these LTIP awards, they were obliged to use the full amount of the cash bonus to purchase shares in the Company prior to 13 April 2010.
Benefits in kind include the provision of a company car and fuel.
No director waived emoluments in respect of the years ended 29 January 2011 or 30 January 2010.
58 A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Total Shareholder Return From April 2009 salary sacrifice was introduced by the Company.

Directors Pensions All executive directors are members of the A. G. BARR p. l. c. 2008 Pension and Life Assurance Scheme the Scheme on a contributory basis.
Their dependants are eligible for dependants pensions and the payment of a lump sum in the event of death in service.
Where the Scheme provides a pension on a defined benefit basis, Final Pensionable Salary is used to determine the directors pension entitlement.
Where benefits are provided on a defined contribution basis, the benefits depend on the directors accumulated fund.
Lump sum life assurance cover is provided at four times Pensionable Salary.
The pension entitlements earned by the directors during the year calculated in accordance with the requirements of the U. K. Listing Authority listing rules and the Companies Act 2006 were as follows: Total accrued Transfer Value of Value of Total change Increase pension value of net accrued accrued in value in accrued entitlement at increase in pension pension during year, pension during 29 January year, net of entitlement at entitlement at net of the year net 2011 member 30 January 29 January member of inflation 000 per contributions 2010 2011 contributions 000 annum 000 000 000 000 R.

However, as there were no increases applied to his benefit other than those that apply to other members of the Scheme, there is nothing to be disclosed in respect of him.
A. L. Memmott ceased his accrual under the defined benefit plan on 1 March 2008.
His accrued benefits retain a link to his final pensionable salary.
The accrued pension entitlement is the amount that the director would receive if he retired at the year end.
60 A. G. BARR p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011 The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the Occupational Pension Schemes Transfer Values Amendment Regulations 2008.
The figures showing the transfer value of net increase over the period include an allowance for the costs of providing death in service benefits.
The change in the amount of the transfer value during the year is made up of the following elements: a transfer value of the increase in accrued pension: b change in the transfer value of accrued pension at the start of the year due to ageing: and c the impact of any change in the economic or mortality assumptions underlying the transfer value basis.
Directors pay contributions as required by the Scheme and these amounts are offset in calculating the values shown in columns headed Transfer value of net increase in year and Total change in value during year.
The transfer value of the accrued entitlements represents the value of assets that the Scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the Schemes liabilities in respect of the directors pension benefits.
They do not represent sums payable to individual directors and, accordingly, have been excluded from the remuneration table.
The Company paid contributions to the defined contribution section of the Scheme during the year in respect of the following directors: 2011 2010 000 000 J. D. Kemp 38 35 A. L. Memmott 41 35 A.
B. C. Short 52 49 During the year to 30 January 2010 the Group introduced a salary sacrifice arrangement under which a salary reduction was made and the member no longer pays contributions to the Scheme.
As the year to 29 January 2011 is the first full year of the arrangement, there has been an increase in the contributions paid by the Company in this year.
Gains made by directors The aggregate value of gains realised on the exercise of share options and awards in the year to 29 January 2011 under the LTIP and SAYE was 410,153 30 January 2010: 166,062 under the LTIP.
