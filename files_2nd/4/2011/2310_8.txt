the performance condition is described below.
c the options were exercised on 4 november 2010, on which date the closing mid market price of a ordinary share was 55.07p.

PSP options the committee established a performance share plan the psp in July 2008, which was extended on a discretionary basis to certain employees only.
certain information relating to the psp was set out in the remuneration report contained in the companys 2008 annual report and accounts which was approved by shareholders at the companys annual General Meeting in 2008.
PSP options granted in 2008 in 2008, the company made awards under the psp in relation to a total of 36.5 million new ordinary shares.
under the psp, employees selected to participate are entitled to acquire ordinary shares for no payment at the end of a vesting period which will normally be 3 years.
the Directors believe that the best indicator of performance of the company and its Directors is its share price performance.
vesting is subject to continued employment and the requirement that the companys share price be equal to or exceed certain share price targets for 60 consecutive days ending on or before the relevant vesting date.
in certain circumstances, however, a proportion of awards may vest early.
a quarter of the ordinary shares subject to each award will vest on reaching share prices of 28.75p, 30.5p, 34.5p and 46p over a consecutive 60 day period.
as at the 25 March 2011, all four share price targets had been met.
consequently, half of the shares vested in July 2010, with the remainder vesting in July 2011, subject to continued employment at the dates of vesting.
the options will lapse if not exercised within ten years of the date of award.
the remuneration committee has agreed to exercise its discretion and allow the balance of Bryan Drews psp options awarded in 2008 to vest in July 2011, notwithstanding his resignation from the company on 25 March 2011 having regard to his contribution to the success of the company and his continuing support thereafter.
24 Booker Group plc annual report & accounts 2011 PSP options granted in 2010 in october 2010, the company made further awards under the psp in relation to a total of 11.3 million new ordinary shares.
the options granted will vest and become exercisable three years from the date of the award subject to continued employment and the performance conditions mentioned below being satisfied and will lapse if not exercised within ten years of the date of award.
a quarter of each option will vest on reaching each of the share prices of 60p, 62.5p, 70p and 90p, in each case sustained over a consecutive 60-day period.
as at 25 March 2011, none of the four share price targets had been met.
Guy Farrant on 14 october 2010, Guy was granted a special performance share award in the form of a nil-cost option over 3.9 million ordinary shares in the company the option.
the option was granted specifically in connection with Guys appointment as a Director and shareholder approval was not sought because of these unusual circumstances.
the option is in two parts: one part relates to 2.1 million ordinary shares in the company and the other part relates to 1.8 million ordinary shares in the company.
a third of the 2.1 million shares will vest on reaching each of the share prices of 52p, 56p and 58p.
this part of the option can be exercised in three annual instalments, assuming that the relevant share price target has been reached by the end of each year otherwise, the option can be exercised after three years to the extent that the targets have subsequently been reached by that time.
as at the 25 March 2011, two of the three share price targets had been met.
a quarter of the 1.8 million shares will vest on reaching each of the share prices of 60p, 62.5p, 70p and 90p.
to the extent that these share price targets are met, this part of the option can be exercised after three years.
for each part of the option, each share price target has to be sustained over a consecutive 60 day period in order for the relevant part of the option to vest.
other than as set out above, the vesting and exercise terms applying to the option are the same as if it had been granted under the psp.
the option is not pensionable and, in the event of a variation in the companys share capital, the number of shares subject to the option and the share price targets can be adjusted, as determined by the Board.
the company will not amend the terms of the option which relate to the number of shares subject to the option, the basis for determining Guys right to exercise the option or the adjustment provisions without shareholder approval.
the terms of the option are set out in an addendum to the rules of the psp and will be on display at the 2011 annual General Meeting for at least 15 minutes before and during the meeting.
SaYE the committee established in July 2008 a savings related share option scheme the saYe, as approved by HM revenue & customs, which was offered to all employees within the Group.
certain information relating to the saYe was set out in the remuneration report contained in the companys 2008 annual report and accounts which was approved by shareholders at the companys annual General Meeting in 2008. options under the saYe are exercisable three years from the commencement of the relevant savings contract and not more than six months thereafter.
these incentive arrangements reward participants if shareholder value is created, thereby aligning the interests of executive Directors and employees with those of shareholders.
on 3 July 2008, Jonathan prentis was granted an option under the saYe in respect of 50,321 ordinary shares.
this option will vest on 1 september 2011 with an option price of 18.68 pence per share, subject to continued employment at the date of vesting, and will lapse on 1 March 2012. it is expected that the company will offer further options under the saYe in the course of 2011. this report was approved by the Board of Directors on 18 May 2011.
