3 The extent of vesting of the Third Award was dependent on the satisfaction of performance targets assessed over a three year performance period.
The performance targets applying to the Third Award were identical to those set for the 2008 LTIP awards, a mix of earnings per share and shareholder return targets.
At the end of the Performance Period, the TSR performance and the EPS performance had both been such as to cause 0% of the relevant part of the award to vest.
2 The TSR performance conditions applicable to the 2010 awards are the same as for the 2011 awards and the relevant maximum and minimum EPS figures are 28 pence and 23 pence.
3 EPS targets were not applicable to 2009 awards as the prevailing economic conditions made it difficult to set a robust range of EPS targets and the TSR performance condition as described on page 63 was applied as the sole performance condition to 100% of the award.
To ensure that the relative condition was supported by improved underlying financial performance, awards made in 2009 were also subject to an earnings underpin that applies to the extent that the TSR performance condition is met.
4 The TSR performance conditions applicable to the 2008 awards were the same as for the 2011 awards and the relevant maximum and minimum EPS figures were 6% and 3% inflationary growth.
Performance and Matching shares granted under the LTIP on 10 April 2008 expired on 10 April 2011.
At the end of the performance period TSR performance and EPS performance had been such as to result in 0% of the relevant part of the award to vest.
