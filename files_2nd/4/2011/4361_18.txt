Directors pension entitlements The Directors pension entitlements under the Dairy Crest Group pension fund, a defined benefits scheme, which have been excluded from the table on page 41, were as follows: Accumulated Accumulated Increase Transfer value total accrued total accrued in accrued of increase Length of pension at pension at pension during in accrued service 31 March 2011 31 March 2010 the year pension Age years 000 000 000 000 M Allen 51 19.3 35 64 0 0 A S N Murray 50 7.2 30 29 0 0 The transfer value of each Directors accrued benefits at the end of the financial year is set out below.
The transfer values shown in the table have been calculated in accordance with actuarial guidance note GN11.

Length of service is unchanged from 31 March 2010 as included at that date were the 7 months to November 2010, reflecting the transitional arrangement based on notice period that was agreed on the closure of the scheme to future service accrual.
The accumulated total accrued pension at 31 March 2010 also included service accrual to November 2010 and, in the case of Mark Allen, represented the deferred pension prior to any reduction resulting from his decision to draw early retirement benefits and the early retirement lump sum.
Therefore pensions accrued in the year ended 31 March 2011 is nil.
Mark Allen decided to draw benefits from 31 March 2010 and receives a pension of 33,227 per annum and a cash lump sum of 221,510.
Mark Allens accrued pension immediately before electing to draw it early was 63,931 per annum including seven months additional pension service.
The future pension payable at March 2011 is less than 63,931 per annum due to the application of an early retirement reduction and because some pension was exchanged for a lump sum cash payment.
The transfer value of 957,000 at 31 March 2010 was made up of 735,000 in respect of pension and 222,000 in respect of the cash lump sum.
As benefit accrual ceased on 31 March 2010, Mark Allen and Alastair Murray are no longer paying contributions into the fund.
The increase in accrued pension excludes the increase in pension due to inflation.
