Babcock International Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Remuneration report Introduction by the Chairman of the Committee Overview I am pleased to present the Directors Remuneration report for the Our remuneration policy year to 31 March 2011.
The table on pages 65 to 67 summarises our policy for remunerating The Remuneration Committee believes that over recent years it Executive Directors, how we seek to apply it, whether we think we has met the policy objective approved by shareholders of providing are succeeding in delivering it and any issues that arise in that executive remuneration arrangements that are fair and allow for respect.

trying to address it in a manner that seeks to be fair to both our management team and to shareholders.
How often it meets Justin Crookenden Reflecting the increasing complexity of issues around executive Committee Chairman remuneration generally and the Boards determination to give thorough consideration to all aspects of Director remuneration in our rapidly growing Company, the Committee significantly increased the number of meetings it held this year.
In total there were nine meetings.
Principal areas of focus for the Committee during the year to 31 March 2011 The year was, of course, dominated by the impact of the VT acquisition, which was announced in March 2010 and completed in July.
Inevitably, the acquisition had direct and immediate implications for the work of the Committee.
Revising annual bonus plans and increased share award for the Chief Executive The annual bonus plans for 2010 11 had initially been set on the basis of Babcock continuing on an as is basis.
The substantial in-year impact of the VT acquisition and accompanying Group restructuring would, however, have made year-on-year comparison difficult and was bound to have a distorting effect on actual performance measurement.
The Committee, therefore, devoted much time and attention to considering this and formulating appropriate proposals that maintained a fair test of executive performance.
64 Details of the structure of the annual bonus schemes for 2010 11 Executive Directors, may now wish to reduce their annual pension and also for 2011 12 are set out on pages 69 and 70 below.
As an alternative to continuing with their current rate of pension accrual and any existing supplement in lieu of Apart from the immediate in-year impact of the VT acquisition on pension benefits, the executives will be able, instead, to elect to take annual bonus plans, it was clear that the main strategic priority for a supplement to salary, which would not be pensionable or taken the Group, in the medium to longer term, had become the securing into account when assessing annual bonus or share awards, of an of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and the challenge of amount having taken into account employers national insurance finding ongoing profitable revenue growth.

Policy Our approach to remunerating Babcocks Executive Directors Our Policy General To provide remuneration arrangements that allow for enhanced but fair rewards for delivery of superior performance by allowing for the possibility of upper quartile rewards for upper quartile performance, that align Directors and shareholders interests and take account of risk.
How we seek to achieve it Emphasis on performance-related and long-term reward.
On a fair value basis around half or more of a Babcock Executive Directors package is performance-related see charts on page 67 below.
In recent years, the actual total remuneration of Executive Directors has been in accordance with our policy and reflected the Companys performance.
However, the fair value of the overall remuneration packages for the Executive Directors is currently towards or below lower quartile.
Comments Although the current structure of our packages reflects our emphasis on performance-related pay, to deliver on our remuneration policy of enhanced but fair rewards for the delivery of superior performance by allowing for upper quartile reward for upper quartile performance, it is necessary to consider enhancing further the variable elements of pay and or increasing base pay.
What are we doing for The Committee decided that for 2011 12 it was not appropriate to alter significantly the structure of the 2011 12?
remuneration arrangements, in particular the variable elements, but to begin to address the level of base pay where it is at a level that undermines our general policy.
Judged against market data based on an average of size, and size-adjusted sector, comparators compiled by Kepler Associates, the Committees independent remuneration advisers.
65 Babcock International Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Remuneration report continued Policy continued Our policy Fixed element base pay Base pay should be at a level that is i fair and ii capable, when taken with the gearing effect of performance-related pay, of delivering upper quartile actual remuneration for upper quartile performance.
How we seek to achieve it Fixed remuneration should be at or just below median.
Market data suggests that base pay for each of the Executive Directors was, by the end of the financial year 2010 11, at a level around or below lower quartile and between 15% and 20% below market median.
Comments The increasing disparity between market levels of base pay and Babcock base pay has in large part been driven by the rapid growth of Babcock.
Base pay at current levels, taken together with the existing levels of gearing of performance-related rewards, makes it less likely that total actual remuneration can continue to deliver our policy as to rewarding upper quartile performance if delivered: this is unlikely to be in the longterm best interests of shareholders.
What are we doing Consistent with its general policy, the Committee intends to move base pay towards market median and for 2011 12?
narrow the gap over the next few years.
We have restricted the rises this year to no more than c. 9%.
These salary increases for 2011 move Executive Director salaries to around 10% below market median and the fair value of the remuneration package for all the Executive Directors is between lower quartile and median.
The Committee believes that these increases are necessary to fulfil the Companys remuneration policy and to ensure that remuneration levels remain competitive.
Salary increases were around 2% in 2009 for both the Group Finance Director and Chief Executive who were then the only Executive Directors and, respectively, 2.5% and 4% in 2010.
Our policy Performance-related rewards Variable pay should reward long-term sustainable growth and value creation.
How we seek to achieve it Annual bonus rewards year-on-year growth in earnings as well as non-financial and financial performance against agreed targets: PSP awards reward a combination of TSR performance relative to the FTSE 350 excluding financial services companies and investment trusts and EPS growth over three years.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the remuneration structure in place over the last few years has been appropriate, with actual total remuneration delivered over the recent years reflecting the Companys performance.
Comments Although we have succeeded in delivering our policy in recent years, this is becoming more difficult to sustain as the fixed element of remuneration base pay has fallen, comparatively, relative to market see above.
What are we doing We have decided to increase the maximum annual bonus potential for Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas for 2011 12?
from 120% to 125% as part of our policy, adopted on their appointment to the Board in May 2010, of bringing them, over time, into closer alignment with the arrangements for the Group Finance Director.
Performance-related share awards for Executive Directors, other than Peter Rogers, will be maintained at 150% of salary.
In the case of Peter Rogers, the award will be as it was last year at the maximum of 200% of annual salary with an extra stretch requirement for vesting of the final 50% because we continue to regard as exceptional the management challenge facing him following the VT acquisition and in maximising the potential presented by that acquisition.
Our policy Alignment with shareholders interests How we seek to achieve it A major part of pay potential that is performance-related both standalone and comparative is delivered in the form of share awards, thus directly linking the Directors remuneration to the investment risk faced by shareholders.
40% of annual bonus must be deferred into Company shares, which can normally only be accessed after two years and is subject to potential clawback, ensuring that a substantial part of the reward is exposed to the longer term performance of Babcock.
Performance-related share awards PSP Awards are subject to comparative TSR vs. peers and standalone EPS growth performance over a three-year period.
In order further to align the interests of management and shareholders, the Committees shareholding guidelines expect Executive Directors to hold Company shares derived from share awards or purchased by them equivalent in value to 200% of their base salaries.
The first annual bonus payments subject to the deferral requirement were those in respect of the year to 31 March 2010, with the associated share awards being made in July 2010 as shown on page 72.
All Executive Directors currently meet or exceed the shareholding guidelines see page 71.
What are we doing No substantive changes are being made to the structure of the annual bonus scheme, share awards for 2011 12?
66 Policy continued Our policy Take account of risk How we seek to achieve it The combination of measures financial for share awards and both financial including cash generation and non-financial for annual bonus schemes used in performance-related pay are designed to incentivise sustainable, profitable growth linked to achievement of strategic objectives and risk mitigation priorities.
Use of shares also exposes executives to the longer term risks in any of their decisions.
20% of maximum annual bonus potential is linked to tailored non-financial measures related to agreed strategic and risk mitigation priorities.
In addition, the award of annual bonuses is subject to forfeiture or reduction for poor health, safety and environment performance at the discretion of the Committee.
By these means we seek to balance short-term and long-term priorities as well as strategic, reputational and other business objectives.
The Committee is satisfied that the incentive structure for Executive Directors does not raise environmental, social or governance issues by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
What are we doing for We are continuing with the same approach.
Summary of the structure of Executive Directors remuneration packages Based on our policy, the principal elements of the arrangements for Executive Director remuneration in the year to 31 March 2011 were, and for the year to 31 March 2012 are, as summarised in the table below.
Further details on the annual bonus schemes, share awards, and pension schemes and pension benefits are to be found in the following pages of this Remuneration report.
Annual bonus Annual bonus Base pay Base pay potential potential Performance share Performance share 2011 12 2010 11 2010 11 2011 12 awards 2010 11 awards 2011 12 Director 000 000 % of salary % of salary % of salary % of salary Peter Rogers 500 545 150% 150% 150% 50% 200% 150% 50% 200% Bill Tame 320 345 150% 150% 150% 150% Archie Bethel 275 300 120% 125% 150% 150% Kevin Thomas 275 300 120% 125% 150% 150% Balance of remuneration The charts below show the relative proportions of each element of the Executive Directors total remuneration packages.
Long-term incentive awards are valued on a fair value basis.
The charts assume that PSP awards over shares have a value on grant equal to 150% of the Directors base salary 200% for Peter Rogers.
These charts are based on annual bonus fair values including the mandatorily deferred share element of 72% of salary for Peter Rogers and Bill Tame and 60% of salary for Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas, and Performance Share Plan fair values of 65% of salary for the Directors other than Peter Rogers, and 82% of salary for Peter Rogers.
Note: the fair value of PSP is its long-run average outcome.
This takes into account the difficulty of achieving the associated performance conditions.
It also takes account of factors such as volatility, time value of money, risk of forfeiture, correlation between the value of the share and the performance conditions, etc.
67 Babcock International Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Remuneration report continued Linkage of remuneration to strategic objectives, risk management and its alignment with shareholder interests The Committee strongly believes that the remuneration of executives should be aligned with the long-term interests of shareholders and should support the key strategic and risk management objectives of the business.
The linkage is achieved through the performance criteria both financial and non-financial used in the annual bonus and long-term incentive schemes.
Examples include the following: Objective Annual bonus scheme metric Long-term incentive metric Delivering superior returns Financial measures focused on delivery of Focus on delivery of top quartile performance to our shareholders.

The use of financial metrics that are principally cash flow, profit and earnings driven rather than sales based discourages poor quality sales growth.

The requirement to defer 40% of any bonus into shares for two years exposes executives to the future impact of current year decisions.
68 Annual bonus schemes As explained in the Overview on pages 64 and 65, the Committee had to reconsider the shape of the annual bonus scheme for Directors during the year in the light of the VT acquisition.

The maximum bonus potential for Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas is increased from 120% to 125% in a step towards bringing them into closer alignment with the Group Finance Director, as envisaged at the time of their appointment to the Board in May 2010.
Deferral into shares To ensure that a substantial part of the Directors bonus is exposed to the longer term impact of decision-making and to further align them with shareholders, 40% of any annual bonus earned by Executive Directors and other senior executives must be deferred into Babcock shares for two years under the Deferred Bonus Plan.
There is no provision for the Company to match or augment these deferred shares on any basis.

For Alexander Hesketh, the interest in shares shown is the interest in shares on the date he resigned as a Director.
Shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors The Committee sets shareholding guidelines for Executive Directors.
The current guideline is to build and maintain, over time, a personal and or spousal holding of shares in the Company equivalent in value to at least twice the Directors annual base salary.
The guidelines also state that normally and subject to the Committees discretion to allow a dispensation an Executive Director is expected to retain at least half of any shares acquired on the exercise of a share award that remain after the sale of sufficient shares to cover tax and national insurance triggered by the exercise and associated dealing costs until the guideline level is achieved and thereafter maintained.
The Executive Directors currently meet these guidelines, as shown in the table above.

The Companys mid-market share price at close of business on 31 March 2011 was 621p.

Further details about these plans and, where applicable, performance conditions attaching to the awards listed are to be found on pages 75 to 77 below.
The figures for Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas is as at 1 May 2010, the date of their appointments to the Board.
The PSP and L-TIP awards are structured as nil priced options.
Subject to the rules of the scheme concerned, including as to meeting performance targets.
Where this date is less than ten years from the date of award, the Committee may extend the expiry date on one or more occasions, but not beyond the tenth anniversary of the award.
The vesting of the CSOP award is subject to performance measures which are identical to those for the PSP award granted on the same date.
The CSOP and PSP awards are linked so that the maximum aggregate number of shares that can be acquired on exercise of the two awards is limited to that number of shares that had a market value on the date of the awards and after deducting any exercise price payable on exercise of the CSOP award equal to the relevant grant multiple of the Directors base salary at the date of the awards the Limit.
If there is less than full vesting, it is possible for the Director to choose to exercise the CSOP to its fullest extent within the Limit and then to exercise the PSP award to the extent of any balance left within the Limit.
72 Directors and shares continued Performance-related awards made to Executive Directors in 2010 In July 2010, PSP awards were made to each of the Executive Directors.
Peter Rogers and Bill Tame also received CSOP awards linked, as explained in note 6 under the table on page 72, to their PSP awards.
PSP vesting schedules Executive Directors, other than the Chief Executive In accordance with past practice, the awards for Bill Tame, Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas were made so that they were potentially exercisable over that number of shares that had a market value on award of 150% of their qualifying base salaries.
As anticipated in the last Remuneration report, the performance target attached to those awards split between TSR performance relative to the peer group and real EPS growth see table on page 76 for detail was toughened in respect of the EPS growth test compared to the awards made in 2009, in that maximum vesting for that element will require real annual compound growth of 12.5% or more over the performance period 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2013.
This represented an increase from the 11% real EPS target applied to the 2009 awards.
The performance measures are illustrated in the charts below: Chief Executive In the case of Peter Rogers, in recognition of the exceptional management challenge particularly he now faces following the VT acquisition, and following discussions with leading shareholders, the Committee made him an award equivalent in value to 200% of his base salary.
As regards that part of the award up to 150% of his salary, the performance measures applied were the same as for the awards to the other Executive Directors above.
In order, however, for the remainder of the award equivalent on grant to 50% of his salary to vest, more stretching TSR performance is required with vesting on a straight-line basis for out-performance of between 9% p. a. and 12.5% p. a. as illustrated below: 73 Babcock International Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Remuneration report continued PSP awards to be made in 2011 It is the Committees intention to adopt the same approach and the same performance measures as followed in 2010 when making awards to Executive Directors.
This will involve the grant of awards to Bill Tame, Archie Bethel and Kevin Thomas over shares having on the date of grant a value equal to 150% of their base salaries.
The same exceptional management challenge continues to apply to Peter Rogers and his award will be of 200% of base salary, with the additional 50% being subject to the same added stretch target described above.
Why TSR and EPS for Executive Directors share awards?
The Remuneration Committee reviews the performance conditions to be attached to share awards prior to the start of each cycle to ensure they remain appropriate.
No material reduction in targets would be made without prior consultation with shareholders.
The Committee believes that continuing to use a balance of TSR and EPS performance conditions remains appropriate and provides a strong blend of performance metrics, in line with prevailing market practice.
The TSR performance measure is tested by reference to the Companys relative long-term share price performance against suitable peers.
The use of relative TSR provides strong alignment with shareholders interests by rewarding management for the delivery of above market returns, whilst the use of an EPS growth performance measure focuses management on continued strong financial performance and is heavily dependent on the Companys success in achieving its strategic goals.
The TSR calculation would normally use a 12-month average for opening and closing share prices adjusted for dividends paid during the period.
The Company feels that this is the most appropriate period because a 12-month average ensures both that short-term market volatility is excluded and that for each company a 12-month period will capture the impact of the announcement of results and payment of dividends.
A shorter period would not capture all these events and would not necessarily put all companies on an equal footing.
For certain senior managers, but not Directors, the performance targets attached to PSP awards in 2009 were set wholly or in part by reference to divisional profit targets and return on capital employed or operating cash flow, as appropriate to the divisions business.
Sourcing of shares It is the intention of the Company that shares needed to satisfy share awards for Directors will be purchased in the market to the extent that they are not already held in the Groups employee share trusts at the date the options or awards are granted or are exercised, unless it is in the interests of the Company to do otherwise and issue new shares.
Performance graphs The graphs below were prepared by Kepler Associates.
They show the total shareholder return for a holding in the Companys shares for the period from 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2011 relative to a holding of shares representing respectively the FTSE 350 Index excluding investment trusts and the FTSE 350 Support Services sector.
The calculation of the return assumes dividends are reinvested to purchase additional equity.
This FTSE 350 Index excluding investment trusts is a broad index that allows comparison of the Companys performance against the performance of the stock market as a whole: Support Services is the sector in which the Companys share price is reported.
Over the five-year period, the Company has significantly out-performed both indices.
An investment of 100 in the Company on 1 April 2006 would have been worth assuming the dividends were reinvested in further Company shares 219 at 31 March 2011.

TSR comparator group For the TSR element the peer group is the FTSE 350 excluding investment trusts and financial services.
This group was chosen after careful review due to the fact that Babcocks closest peers 2009 and 2010 awards straddle multiple sectors, not just support services, and the broader group makes the calibration more robust.
Other information Participants will be entitled to a vesting of shares under the TSR element only to the extent the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the recorded TSR is a genuine reflection of the underlying performance of the Company over the performance period.
The awards are not subject to re-testing.
EPS is adjusted to exclude acquired intangible amortisation, but, unless the Committee decides otherwise in respect of any item, is after exceptional items.
Real EPS growth is that in excess of the change in the retail prices index.
The awards carry the right to receive on vesting any dividends that would have been paid in the period between grant and vesting but this right applies only to the shares that actually vest under the award.
CSOP and PSP Awards are linked so that in aggregate the holder cannot get more value from them than a standalone PSP award of shares equal to the relevant award multiple of the Directors base salary.
Exercise periods commence not less than three years from actual or nominal award grant date.
Subject to the rules of the plan, an earlier release of shares under unvested awards may be allowed by the Remuneration Committee for example, in the event of a cessation of employment or a change in control, but of not more than a time-apportioned proportion and then only having regard to the Companys performance, though the Committee has discretion to allow a greater proportion to be released.
2011 awards will be as per the 2010 awards with the performance period being 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2014.
76 Share awards summaries continued Scheme Deferred Bonus Plan nil price options 2010 awards Performance period Not applicable: the scheme is purely a mechanism for mandatory deferral of part of the annual bonus earned.
Awards vest and become exercisable two years after the date of grant.
Other information Awards are subject to potential forfeiture if the holder leaves before the awards vest other than by reason of death, disability, redundancy, retirement or the company or business in which they are employed ceasing to be part of the Group.
The number of shares into which the bonus is deferred may be reduced by the Committee if the accounts by reference to which the bonus was calculated have to be materially corrected or if, in the opinion of the Committee, there is evidence that performance against performance conditions in the bonus year or the impact of that performance on the Group in respect of future financial years was or will be materially worse than was believed to be the case at the time of the original assessment.
The shares carry the right to dividends paid in the period of deferral, but payable only when the shares are released.
There is no provision for the Company to match these deferred shares on any basis.
