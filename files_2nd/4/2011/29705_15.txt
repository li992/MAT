Part A Unaudited section The Remuneration Committee the Committee The Committees members during the year were Francis Finlay Chairman, Denis Raeburn and Caroline Goodall, who were all considered by the Board to be independent non-executive Directors.
Ms Goodall joined the Committee on 11 February 2011.
The biographies of the current members are provided on pages 32 and 33.
The Chairman and selected executives, including the Chief Executive, and the Committees advisers are invited to attend as appropriate.
None of the executives invited to attend during the year participated in discussions or decisions regarding their remuneration.
The Committee is responsible for determining the remuneration policy throughout the SVG Group including making a recommendation to the Board on the remuneration of the Chairman and the operation of the Companys Executive Share Incentive Plans.
Its terms ofreference take into account the provisions of the Corporate Governance Code.
The Committee is able to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues when setting remuneration of executive directors.
As a financial services rm, the environmental and social impact of the Companys activities is low.
Governance issues, including effective engagement with shareholders and the general partners of the funds the Company invests in, is considered in evaluating the CEOs performance and therefore impacts the performance-related portion of her remuneration package.
The Committee has appointed independent remuneration consultants, New Bridge Street a trading name of Aon Corporation, to advise it.
New Bridge Street also provides advice on the operation of the Companys share schemes.
Work included providing updates on governance and tax developments and providing benchmark and market information.
Neither New Bridge Street nor any other part of Aon Corporation provided other services to the Company during the year.
The Committee meets at least twice a year and during the year under review it met formally twice, in February to agree remuneration proposals and in December 2011 for an update meeting.
MrFinlay and Mr Raeburn attended both meetings.
The February meeting took place prior to Ms Goodall joining the Committee.
MsGoodall was unable to attend the December meeting due to a conict witha meeting of a sub-committee of the Nominations Committee.
Ms Goodall received the relevant papers and was briefed by the Company Secretary following the meeting.
In addition, the subcommittee of the Remuneration Committee, comprising the Chairman of the Committee and the Company Secretary, met in February 2011 to effect a proposal for the granting of awards under the Performance Share Plan PSP.
During the year the Committee: Determined the aggregate bonus awards for the years to 31 December 2010.
Approved the granting of awards under the PSP.
Approved all remuneration packages for any Group executive with a proposed total cash remuneration in excess of 250,000 perannum.
Both SVGA and SVGIM have separate Boards with independent directors and separate remuneration committees.
The SVG Capital Remuneration Committee sets parameters and principles for the salary increases, discretionary bonuses and long-term incentive plans for these subsidiaries which are consistent with effective risk management.
Accordingly, the subsidiary remuneration committees, operating under specified delegated limits of authority from the main Board, met during the year to determine increases in salary and discretionary bonuses for all executives below main Board level.
A summary of these were presented to the SVG Capital Remuneration Committee for its approval.
A summary of the terms of reference of the Committee are set out on page 47.
A copy of the full terms of reference of the Committee isavailable on the Companys website, www.
Corporate information SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2011 38 Remuneration report continued Policy on the remuneration of executive Directors The Committees aim is to ensure that remuneration packages should attract, retain and motivate senior executives including executive Directors while avoiding paying more than is necessary for this purpose and not encouraging excessive risk taking or rewarding failure.
At 31 December 2011, Lynn Fordham was the only executive Director of the Company.
The Committees policy is that the xed elements of remuneration should be sufficient to allow the Company to be competitive againstother companies with which the Company competes for executive talent.
The majority of the remuneration package should  so that it is linked to the returns created for shareholders and the total cost is sufciently exible to reect changes in business performance.
The variable element comprises a balance between short-term and long-term performance through the Companys annual bonus and the performance share plan.
In order to help mitigate risk and ensure that overall rewards are not excessive, incentive levels are capped at a level that encourages out-performance and allows the Company to deliver competitive levels of remuneration without encouraging undue risk taking.
The Committee considers performance on a multi-year basis and inthe event of exceptional circumstances of misstatement or misconduct, an appropriate reduction will be made to a following years bonus.
This, coupled with the 200% cap on bonuses andanappropriate weighting to the long-term performance share plan, means theCommittee is satisfied that it has sufficient exibility within the current arrangements to enable it to adjust future bonus payouts for exceptional circumstances and that executives are not incentivised to take undue risks.
The Committee continues to keep its policy under review in light of market and corporate governance developments and will review the policy in light of BISs review of executive remuneration.
Basic salary Salaries are reviewed annually with changes becoming effective in April each year.
The Committee decides on the increases awarded to the executive Directors and is consulted on increases for all employees of the business.
The Committee considers Group performance, individual performance and pay and employment conditions of employees of the Group in reaching any decisions.
The Committee considers the pay awards and other employment conditions of employees of the Group before approving the pay packages of any executive Directors.
In addition, relevant compensation surveys are reviewed but as a guide only.
No executive Director of the Company is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.
Lynn Fordhams salary was not increased in April 2011 and stayed at 350,000 per annum.
The Committee has approved an increase of5% to Lynn Fordhams salary effective 1 April 2012 bringing her salary to 367,500.
The Committee considers this increase is appropriate and reects the CEOs performance, role and responsibility as well as the performance of the Company.
The increase is consistent with increases given to other members of staff thisyear and follows salary increases of 2.9% in 2010 and 0% in 2011 to LynnFordham.
Annual bonus Annual bonuses are intended to reward achievement of Group and personal objectives.
Bonuses are non-pensionable and discretionary.
The Committee sets the performance targets for the annual bonus plan at the beginning of the financial year.
The targets are chosen to reect the successful implementation of the business plan and strategies agreed by the Board and may be adjusted to take account of risk.
The normal maximum annual bonus for an executive Director has been set at 200% of salary, although this cap can be exceeded in exceptional circumstances.
The Committee believes that capping bonuses at this level enables the Company to provide competitive levels of remuneration while ensuring that executives are not incentivised to take inappropriate risks.
The bonus awarded to Lynn Fordham in respect of her performance in the year to December 2011 amounted to 560,000 being 160% of her 2011 salary.
Mrs Fordham will buy shares in the Company with the after-tax proceeds of 70,000 of her bonus.
Mrs Fordham hasmade similar purchases in prior years.
This bonus is between on target bonus and maximum bonus and compares to a bonus of455,000 130% of 2010 salary paid in 2011.
The key performance parameters for Lynn Fordham for 2011 included increasing thestrength of the balance sheet, developing the Companys long-term strategy and widening shareholder relationships.
SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2011 39 The Chairman met with Lynn Fordham to assess her performance in 2011.
In each case, Lynn Fordham had met or exceeded her goals.
In particular, it was noted that: the strategic plan for shareholders was completed: net debt was reduced by 60% enabling completion of the strategic plan: the Companys 40 million sub-debt investment in P25 had been realised at a multiple of 1.78x in just over 2.5 years.
Thisinvestment had been initiated and led by Lynn Fordham: the very successful widening of the shareholder relationships.
It was also noted that over the period, the Companys net asset value had grown by 12.8% versus a fall of 3.5% in the FTSE All Share TR Index.
The overall bonus earned was ahead of the 2010 level reecting the Committees assessment that the targets were fully met and that Lynn Fordham had performed very well during the year.
It was noted that Lynn Fordhams salary and bonus continued to be below the comparator median, reecting the Companys bias to long-term incentive remuneration.
Long-term incentives Lynn Fordham and selected employees of the SVG Group are eligible to participate in the Performance Share Plan PSP at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The Committee believes that participation in long-term incentives ensures that a significant part of executives potential remuneration istied to the returns received by shareholders over the longer term through the use of performance conditions linked to the Groups strategy and through exposure to the Groups share price.
This provides alignment between executives and shareholders and, because vesting of awards takes place three or four years after grant, provides an element of lock-in and encourages a focus on performance that is sustainable in the longer term and potentially protects against misstatement or misconduct during the vesting period.
PSP awards are made annually, as this enables executives to build up a series of overlapping awards, which the Committee believes ismore retentive than larger one-off awards.
The PSP enables awards of conditional free shares or nil or nominal cost options to be made.
Award levels are determined by reference to the individuals seniority, level of salary and bonus earned in the previous year asthis provides a link to individual performance.
The maximum that can be awarded in any financial year is 200% of base salary andbonus.
For the purposes of calculating these limits the maximum amount of bonus which may be used is capped at 300% of basesalary and the value of an award shall be calculated and, if necessary, adjusted to take into account any employers secondary National Insurance contributions or overseas equivalent that may have been transferred to the award holder.
In practice, the cap onthe amount of bonus that may be included in the calculation of awards is unlikely to be reached as the normal maximum annual bonus of 200% of salary can only be exceeded in exceptional circumstances.
The maximum bonus as a percentage of salary that was paid in 2011 was 130%.
The maximum award as a percentage of base salary and bonus in 2011 was 175%.
In order to ensure that long-term incentives provide alignment with shareholders, the Committee sets performance conditions that reward executives for delivering absolute growth in the value of the Group.
The performance conditions used for the 2011 awards were the same as those for the 2010 awards and consist of i the average growth in the Companys undiluted Net Asset Value per Share NAV over a four-year period of 7% per annum 0% of the award vests and 15% per annum 100% of the award vests and ii the Companys average annual compound total shareholder return TSR over a three-year period of 10% per annum 0% of the award vests and 20% per annum 100% of the award vests, with each determining the vesting of 50% of the award.
In 2011, Lynn Fordham was awarded 563,500 shares under the PSP.
The face value of this award represented 175% of Lynn Fordhams 2010 base salary and bonus paid in 2011.
The Committee has approved an LTIP award with a face value of 1,592,500 and expected value of 637,000 as estimated by New Bridge Street representing 175% of Lynn Fordhams 2011 salary and bonus to be paid in 2012.
NAV-based awards will normally vest on the fourth anniversary of the award being granted provided that the award holder is a director or employee within the SVG Group on that date and to the extent that the NAV performance condition has been satisfied.
If average annual growth in NAV over the performance period is less than 7% per annum, none of this part of the award will vest.
If average annual growth in NAV over the performance period is 15% per annum or more, all of this part of the award will vest.
For NAV growth between these two points, between 0% and 100% of this part of the award will vest on a pro-rata basis.
Corporate information SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2011 40 Remuneration report continued TSR based awards will normally vest on the third anniversary of the award being granted provided that the award holder is a director oremployee within the SVG Group on that date and to the extent that the TSR performance condition has been satisfied.
If average annual compound TSR over the performance period is less than 10% per annum, none of this part of the award will vest.
If average annual compound TSR over the performance period is 20% per annum or more, all of this part of the award will vest.
For TSR performance that is between these two points between 0% and 100% of this part of the award will vest on a pro-rata basis.
The Remuneration Committee believes that TSR and growth in NAV are appropriate measures of long-term performance for a business focused on delivering superior levels of NAV growth and returns to shareholders.
In setting the performance targets for the 2011 awards the Remuneration Committee took account of the current shareholder expectations of future performance for the Company.
The PSP replaced the 2001 ESOP following the 2007 AGM.
No further grants can be made under the 2001 ESOP.
In addition, the Company introduced a SIP at the 2007 AGM.
