No salary increases were awarded to any of the Executive Directors in July 2011.
However, Mr Pearce received a salary increase upon his promotion to become Chief Executive Of cer.
On 1 January 2012, his salary increased from 262,650 to 410,000 which is below the benchmark range for someone experienced in this position.
The Committee would expect to increase Mr Pearces salary as he develops in his new role.
The average annual salary increase across the Inmarsat Global group of employees made at 1 July 2011 was 2.38%, limited to a certain number of employees up to middle management levels while salary levels were held static for all other Inmarsat Global employees.
The Committee believes that the current Executive Director salaries are competitively positioned against the market and this is appropriate given the context of individual performance, Inmarsats sector and the competition for talent in this sector.
The next review of basic salary for Executive Directors will be with effect from 1 July 2012.
Our benchmarking and remuneration reviews generally re ect that our employee base rank above the 50th percentile of broader sector survey data.
This positioning remains competitively placed.
Basic salaries for Executive Directors at 1 January 2012 are: Andrew Sukawaty Executive Chairman 614,744 Rupert Pearce Chief Executive Of cer 410,000 Rick Medlock Chief Financial Of cer 330,839 Bene ts for our Executive Directors include private medical insurance, permanent disability insurance and life assurance.

Annual cash bonus Bonus awards, which are not pensionable, are made to Executive Directors based on Group financial and individual performance.
Personal performance is appraised against achievement of challenging objectives set by the Committee at the start of each financial year, and is linked to Group strategic and operational performance.
The Group financial performance targets represent 80% weighting and individual performance targets represent 20% weighting.
The Committee considered that revenue, operating and capital expenditure, with an EBITDA underpin, remained appropriate key performance measures for the financial year to 31 December 2011.
The Committee reviewed these targets in respect of annual cash bonus arrangements for the current year year ending 31 December 2012 and considered that they continued to remain appropriate.
For the 2011 financial year, the corporate financial targets for EBITDA, operating and capital expenditure were achieved, the Group fell short of the mobile satellite services revenue target but LightSquared delivered signi cant revenue and pro t contributions.
An aggregate bonus amount of 127.65% of target bonus, adjusted for personal performance, will be paid to the Executive Directors and Inmarsat Global staff.
