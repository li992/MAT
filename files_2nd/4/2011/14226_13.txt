Corporate governance SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 direCtors remuneration report inCluding the statement of remuneration poliCy for the year ended 31 deCember 2011 dear shareholder On behalf of the Board I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committees report of the Directors Remuneration for 2011 for which we will be seeking Shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting in May.
SIGs strategy is to focus on: operating efficiency improvements in the core business: upgrading the Groups portfolio by prioritising investment in high growth profitable markets: and organic growth initiatives supported by selected acquisitions.
During the year, we reviewed the performance measures under the annual bonus and long-term incentive arrangements to improve alignment with our strategy, taking into account the feedback of our shareholders from last year.
The key changes for 2012 are summarised below with further detail provided later in the report.
annual Bonus Performance measures The weighting on underlying PBT performance has been increased from 60% to 65% and the weighting on cash conversion correspondingly reduced from 20% to 15%.
Cash conversion remains an important measure of short-term performance for the Group but the Committee believes it timely to re-balance the emphasis towards the Groups key measure of short-term performance, i. e. growth in profit.
This follows a number of improvements in the Groups cash management processes over the last few years and corresponding levels of performance in this area.
long term incentive Plan Performance measures For 2012 Awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan, the Remuneration Committee has introduced a Return on Capital Employed ROCE metric to strengthen the focus on efficiency and delivering strong returns for our shareholders.
EPS continues to be an important measure of long-term performance for SIG.
Accordingly, two thirds of the LTIP award will be based on three year average ROCE performance and one third on three year cumulative underlying Earnings Per Share EPS.
Following a review of the Groups and the individuals performance, the Committee increased the base salary for the Chief Executive by 3%.
Doug Robertson was appointed Group Finance Director on 1 December 2011 on an annual salary of 315,000.
He did not receive any salary increase on 1 January 2012.
The Committee considers the approach outlined above to be appropriate for executive remuneration in 2012.
Our major institutional Shareholders were consulted before this approach was implemented and were supportive.
We hope this will be formally endorsed by Shareholders in their vote on the Directors Remuneration Report at the Annual General Meeting in May.
chris geoghegan Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 13 March 2012 introduction This report, prepared by the Remuneration Committee on behalf of the Board, sets out the policy and disclosures on remuneration for the Executive and Non-Executive Directors of the Board.
It takes full account of the UK Corporate Governance Code and the latest ABI NAPF guidelines, and has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 the Act, the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008.
The Act requires the Auditor to report to the Companys Shareholders on the audited information within this report and to state whether, in their opinion, those parts of the report have been prepared in accordance with the Act.
The Auditors opinion is set out on page 114 and those aspects of the report which have been subject to audit are clearly marked.
A resolution will be put to Shareholders at the Companys Annual General Meeting on 18 May 2012 inviting them to approve this report.
the remuneration committee The role of the Remuneration Committee the Committee is to determine, on behalf of the Board, the salary and benefits received by the Chairman and the Executive Directors and for overseeing the remuneration of other Senior Executives.
The Committees Terms of Reference, which are reviewed regularly, are set out on the Companys website www.
Its key responsibilities are: to determine the remuneration policy for Executive Directors and such other members of the Executive Management as it is designated to consider: to design specific remuneration packages which include salaries, bonuses, equity incentives, pension rights and benefits: to review the Executive Directors service contracts: to ensure that failure is not rewarded and that steps are always taken to mitigate loss on termination, within contractual obligations: to review remuneration trends across the Group: and to approve the terms of and recommend grants under the Groups incentive plans.
61 SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 direCtors remuneration report Continued inCluding the statement of remuneration poliCy for the year ended 31 deCember 2011 the remuneration committee continued The Committee comprises the following Non-Executive Directors: Mr. C. V. Geoghegan who chairs the Committee, Ms. J. E. Ashdown, Mr. M. Ewell and Mr. J. C. Nicholls, all of whom are independent Non-Executive Directors within the definition set out in the Code.
Mrs. V. Murray was a member of the Committee until her resignation as a Non-Executive Director on 16 March 2011.
During the year the Committee met four times.
Attendance by individual members of the Committee is disclosed in the table on page 57.
The Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive and Company Secretary attend the Committees meetings by invitation, but are not present when their own remuneration is discussed.
The Committee also takes independent professional advice, on an ad hoc basis, as required.
Kepler Associates Kepler, provided independent advice to the Committee in respect of the Groups remuneration strategy and relevant market information in 2011.
Kepler reports to the Chairman of the Committee and provided no other services to the Company during the year.
Both the constitution and operation of the Remuneration Committee comply with the principles incorporated in the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The Committee reviews its own performance annually and considers where improvements can be made as appropriate.
Key activities of the committee in 2011 the committee met four times in 2011 in march, may, november and december, covering: in addition, the committee considered the following: consultation with major shareholders on remuneration policy: Executive Director salaries: approving appointment terms for Mr. D. G. Robertson: and performance outcomes for the annual bonus and long-term incentives: LTIP awards for the Executive Directors: final payments for Mr. G. W. Davies and Mr. M. J. Chivers.
the Chairmans fee and terms: the 2011 Directors Remuneration Report: preparation for the AGM: and remuneration policy for 2012.
Policy on remuneration of executive directors The Companys policy is to provide remuneration packages that fairly reward the Executive Directors for the contribution they make to the business and that are appropriately competitive to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and Senior Managers of the right calibre.
The policy is designed to align the Directors interest with those of shareholders, and to incentivise the Directors to meet the Companys financial and strategic objectives such that a significant proportion of remuneration is performance related.
The Companys financial and strategic objectives are set out in the Business Review on pages 10 to 37.
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to consider the Companys performance on environmental, social and governance issues when determining the overall reward for the Executive Directors.
The Committee also takes into account pay and conditions across the Group when determining remuneration for the Executive Directors.
The actual fixed and variable remuneration for the Executive Directors at target and stretch performance is illustrated below.
This is based on our ongoing remuneration policy.
100% ltip bonus 75% pension Benefits 50% salary 25% 0% C. J. davies d. g. robertson The main components of Executive Directors remuneration are given page 63.
62 Corporate governance SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Policy on remuneration of executive directors continued Base salary and Benefits Base salary and benefits are determined on an annual basis by the Committee after a review of the individuals performance, experience and market trends.
The Committee takes into account published remuneration information from circa 30 companies of similar size excluding financial services and real estate companies and salary policy within the rest of the Group.
The Chief Executives salary had been frozen in 2011.
For 2012, the Chief Executives base salary has been increased by 3%.
The Committee feels it was important to provide the Chief Executive with a moderate increase in base pay i. e. less than price inflation to recognise his performance in leading SIGs recovery.
Notwithstanding the difficult trading conditions in which the Group operates, a strong performance in 2011 has been delivered largely as a result of the actions taken by the Chief Executive over the past three years.
Further, in a period of major changes in the organisation, including a complete refreshment of the management team, it is inevitable that there is increased reliance on the Chief Executives leadership to retain stability and focus on sustaining performance.
The Board wants to recognise the significant contribution the Chief Executive has made, and continues to make, to this change process.
In determining this increase, the Committee also considered individual salary increases across the Group, which typically ranged between 0% and 5%.
Benefits comprise a company car, medical and permanent health insurance.
The value of benefits is not pensionable.
The annual rates of base salary during the year are shown in the table below: Annual rate annual rate of salary of salary Name 2011 2012 Increase C. J. Davies 532,875 548,861 3% D. G.

Davies left the company 31 December 2011 305,000 n a annual Performance Bonus The annual performance related bonus provides Executive Directors with an incentive to achieve annual performance targets, which are set at the beginning of a financial year.
The performance metrics and the corresponding maximum bonus under each measure for 2010, 2011 and 2012 are shown in the table below: Debt Underlying management profit Personal Maximum working capital before tax objectives bonus of Name Year improvement % of salary % of salary % of salary C.

Robertson 2012 15% 65% 20% 100% For Mr. M. J. Chivers, this element is split such that 33.3% is based on SIG Group performance and 66.7% is based on UK Exteriors.
The performance against each measure in 2011 is set out in the table below: Performance element 2011 performance Remuneration Committee assessment Debt management working capital improvement 100% cash conversion Target met in full Underlying profit before tax Group: 81.7m 27.3% increase on prior year 92% of max.
for Group Performance against pre-determined personal objectives varied by individual and resulted in overall bonuses of 96% of salary for Mr. C. J. Davies and Mr. G. W. Davies, and 65% for Mr. M. J. Chivers.
Mr. D. G. Robertson, having joined the Company on 1 November 2011, was not eligible for the portion of the bonus determined against personal objectives.
Recognising his brief tenure with the Group thus far, he received a pro-rated bonus of 10% of his annual salary based on the underlying profit element of the Plan.
For good leavers, annual bonus is pro-rated for the time that they are employed by the Group.
In the Committees view, the level of bonus paid to Executive Directors appropriately reflects the significant growth achieved in an exceptionally difficult environment.
Following a review of the annual bonus arrangement, the Committee has decided to increase the weighting on underlying PBT performance in 2012 from 60% to 65% and to correspondingly reduce the weighting on cash conversion from 20% to 15%.
The maximum bonus than can be earned in 2012 will remain at 100% of base salary for each Executive Director.
Executive Directors will continue to be required to mandatorily defer one third of the annual bonus into SIG shares for a period of three years, subject to clawback.
63 SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 direCtors remuneration report Continued inCluding the statement of remuneration poliCy for the year ended 31 deCember 2011 Policy on remuneration of executive directors continued Pension schemes Mr. C. J. Davies and Mr. G. W. Davies up to 31 December 2011 are members of the Groups contributory defined benefit pension scheme, which enables members to retire at age 60 with a maximum pension after 40 years pensionable service equivalent to two thirds of final pensionable salary.
Pensionable salary is basic salary, excluding bonuses.
Final pensionable salary is the average of the highest three consecutive pensionable salaries in the last ten years before retirement.
For service up to 31 July 2002, pensions in payment are guaranteed to increase by 5% per annum compound.
Following consultation with the active membership of the scheme, certain changes were made to the contribution levels and benefits in order to limit future liabilities and, consequently, for service from 1 August 2002, pensions in payment are guaranteed to increase by the lower of 5% per annum or the increase in the Retail Price Index RPI.
On death before retirement, a lump sum equal to four times current salary is paid, together with a spouses pension of 50% of pensionable salary.
As part of this scheme, all Executive Directors are covered by permanent health insurance.
In March 2006 the Board agreed that the rules of the Groups contributory defined benefit pension scheme should be amended to permit continued accrual in the scheme to age 65.
All members will be permitted to take their benefits at age 60 without abatement if they so wish.
long-term incentive schemes The Group operates two long-term incentive arrangements which were approved by shareholders in 2004: the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP and the Deferred Annual Bonus Scheme DABS.
LOnG TeRm InCenTIve pLAn All Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the LTIP which was approved by Shareholders in 2004.
Under the LTIP participating Directors and other designated Senior Managers are granted nil cost share options up to a maximum of 100% of base salary.
Awards under the LTIP are not pensionable.
Vested awards under the LTIP are exercisable between three and seven years from the date of grant but the right to exercise options terminates upon the employee ceasing to hold office with the Group, subject to certain exceptions and the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Following a review of performance measures, the Committee concluded that the introduction of a ROCE metric for the 2012 Award would reinforce the focus on efficiency and delivering strong returns for our shareholders, thereby further strengthening the alignment of managements incentives with our strategy.
Accordingly, the 2012 Award will be based two thirds on three year average ROCE performance.
The Committee continues to believe that underlying EPS is a key measure of long-term performance for SIG and the remaining one third of the 2012 Award will be based on three year cumulative underlying EPS.
No change will be made to the size of the award to Executive Directors of 100% of salary.
The performance targets can be illustrated as follows: roce element of the award two thirds ePs element of the award one third 100% 100% 75% 75% 50% 50% 25% 25% 0% 0% 9% 13% 30p 40p average roce 2012-14 cumulative underlying ePs 2012-14 operating profit after tax divided by the sum of total equity plus net debt For the ROCE element, if the three year average ROCE over financial years ending 2012-14 is less than or equal to 9%, no shares will vest.
Awards vest in full for a three year average ROCE of 13% or higher and vesting is on a straight-line basis between these two points.
Note that ROCE is measured on a post-tax basis.
For the EPS element, if cumulative underlying EPS over the three financial years ending 2012-14 is less than or equal to 30p, no shares will vest.
Awards vest in full for a cumulative EPS of 40p or higher and vesting is on a straight-line basis between these two points.
As in previous years, the ROCE and EPS targets have been calibrated with reference to analysis based on internal and external data and the Committees view of what it believes will provide an appropriate level of stretch.
In order to ensure targets remain commensurately stretching with what was intended at the outset, and also to ensure a fair outcome for both participants and shareholders, the Committee has discretion to adjust the targets, as appropriate, e. g. to reflect changes in capital, M&A activity, etc.
Furthermore, if such discretion is exercised, the Committee undertakes to disclose the rationale for its decision in the Directors Remuneration Report.
In advance of each LTIP cycle, the Committee will continue to review the appropriateness of the performance measures and corresponding targets.
64 % vesting % vesting Corporate governance SIG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Policy on remuneration of executive directors continued long-term incentive schemes continued DefeRReD AnnuAL BOnuS SCheme Under the DABS, participants including Executive Directors are invited to defer up to 50% of their annual performance related cash bonus after income tax and national insurance in respect of the preceding financial year in order to purchase shares in the Company.
The purchased shares must be retained for three years.
Participants purchasing such shares will be eligible to receive up to a maximum of one additional free matching share for every share purchased, providing certain pre-set real in excess of RPI annual compound EPS growth targets are met over a three year period.
The performance target for the 2008 Award which required as a minimum real annual compound growth in Group underlying EPS over the three year performance period was not met and consequently all of these Awards have lapsed.
For 2009 the performance target for the DABS was the same as that for the LTIP as described above.
No Awards under DABS were made in 2010 and 2011.
The Committee does not intend to grant Awards under this plan in 2012.
Under the rules of the LTIP and the DABS outstanding Awards vest on termination for certain reasons, such as death, retirement and redundancy or on a change of control, on a time related, pro-rata basis subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance criteria.
If, however, the termination of employment is for a reason other than one of those specified in the rules, an individuals award lapses in full.
Deloitte LLP, in their capacity as Auditor, are requested to examine outcomes for the LTIP and DABS before any Awards vest.
The EPS growth target for awards granted in 2008 was not met and consequently these Awards lapsed.
All outstanding awards under this plan are detailed in the Directors share options table on page 69. emPloyee share schemes The Executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the Companys Share Incentive Plan SIP, which commenced in November 2005 and is open to all UK employees of the Group.
The SIP is an HMRC approved arrangement which entitles all employees to purchase shares and receive matching shares in a potentially tax-advantageous manner.
The Company gives one matching share for each share purchased by the employee up to a maximum of four matching shares per month.
non-executive directors The Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman, do not have service contracts.
The Companys policy is that Non-Executive Directors are appointed for specific terms of three years unless otherwise terminated earlier by and at the discretion of either party upon three months written notice.
Non-Executive Directors appointments are reviewed at the end of each three year term.
Non-Executive Directors will normally be expected to serve two three year terms, although the Board may invite them to serve for an additional period.
The Executive Directors are responsible for recommending to the Board the fees of Non-Executive Directors.
The basic Non-Executive Director fee is calculated by reference to current market levels and takes account of the time commitment and the responsibilities of the Non-Executive Directors.
Non-Executive Directors do not receive benefits from the Company and they are not eligible to join the Companys pension scheme or participate in any bonus or incentive scheme or any of the Companys share option schemes.
Any reasonable expenses that they incur in the furtherance of their duties are reimbursed by the Company.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors fees are reviewed in May each year with any increase being payable from 1 June.
These fees were reviewed in May 2011 and were left unchanged.

With regard to Mr. C. J. Davies and Mr. D. G. Robertson, the Company can discharge any obligation in relation to the unexpired portion of their notice period or any notice required to be given under their service contracts by making a payment in lieu of notice excluding any variable pay which might otherwise apply over the notice period, subject to the deduction of tax and national insurance.
If the Company terminates employment without giving notice or making a payment in lieu, any damages to which the Executive may be entitled is to be calculated in accordance with common law principles, including those relating to mitigation of loss and accelerated receipt.
There are no agreements between the Company and its Directors or employees providing for additional compensation for loss of office or employment whether through resignation, purported redundancy or otherwise that may occur in the event of a takeover.
share oWnershiP guidelines To ensure alignment between Executive Director interests and those of Shareholders the Company has established the principle of requiring Executive Directors to build up and maintain a beneficial holding of shares in the Company equivalent to a minimum of one times basic salary.
Under normal circumstances it is expected that this should be achieved within five years of appointment.
It is anticipated that the satisfaction of this target will be mainly achieved by the vesting of shares through the Companys share schemes.
Performance graPh The graph below shows the Companys TSR performance share price plus dividends paid compared with the performance of the FTSE All Share Support Services Index over the five year period to 31 December 2011.

The transfer values disclosed above do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual Director, but instead represent a potential liability of the pension scheme.
Pension accruals shown are the amounts which would be paid annually from normal retirement age based on service to the end of the year.
Mr. C. J. Davies retired from the main scheme on 8 December 2010.
He stopped accruing pension in the main scheme from 1 January 2009 and began accruing benefits in the EFRBS.
The figures quoted represent his entitlement in both schemes.
Mr. Davies took a pension of 67,500 p. a. and a cash sum of 450,000 from the main scheme but continues to accrue pension in the EFRBS.
He also took the option of an increased initial pension in exchange for lower pension increases.
The disclosure amounts above at 31 December 2011 are in relation to pension only, i. e. cash lump sums paid were in addition to these amounts.
The pension figures include both the amount of pension paid by the plan and the accrual in the EFRBS.
Mr. M. J. Chivers took his benefits in 2010 and has accrued no benefits over 2011.
Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the Occupational Pension Schemes Transfer Value Regulations 1996 and the revised transfer value basis adopted by the Trustees in April 2011.
The figures in the second and third columns comply with the Greenbury requirements.
The value of the net increase represents the incremental value to the Director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption service terminated at the year-end.
It is based on the accrued pension increase after deducting the Directors contribution.
The change in the transfer value in the final column includes th e effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and Director, such as market movements and also includes the effect of the change in the transfer value basis.
It is calculated after deducting the Directors contribution.
Contributions made by Executives to the scheme in the year were made by way of salary sacrifice.
