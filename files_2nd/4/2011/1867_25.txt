The Committee believes that the Groups remuneration plans have been effective in supporting this positive performance over the past three years.

The upper bar on each chart shows the position labelled target if half of the maximum potential variable remuneration was received.
The lower bar on each chart shows the position labelled stretch if all of the maximum potential variable remuneration was received.
As more stretching performance is achieved, so the proportion of variable to fixed remuneration increases.
The actual value of performance-related incentives will depend on actual performance.
If the respective minimum performance conditions are not met then the incentive will have no value and if the share-based incentives vest, then the share price of the Company at that time will determine the actual value on vesting of such incentives.
The targets for variable remuneration include operating profit, free cash flow, EPS and ROIC, all of which strongly align to the Companys strategic objective of creating long-term sustainable value.

These matching voluntary deferral awards are subject to a performance condition that is tested at the end 1:1 matching award for of the three-year performance period and the awards will lapse if the deferred bonus condition is not met.
ROIC performance condition The overall effect is to defer the payment of at least 50% of the for matching award annual bonus earned by executive directors as shown by the timeline below: As ROIC for 2010 was 9.5%, with ROIC for the first half of 2011 of 10.1% Timeline for 2011 annual bonus: and ROIC for the full year of 10.6% the Committee is of the view that these targets are suitably stretching.

On the third anniversary of the deferral, the shares would be released to the employee.
If an employee left before the third anniversary any voluntarily deferred portion of the bonus would be retained by the 2014 Year 2 of deferred 2011 bonus individual, though the related matching award would usually lapse on their departure.
The Committee considers the award levels under the Deferred 2015 Deferred 2011 bonus released in Bonus Plan to be appropriate, when viewed in the context of the shares and depending on performance structure of the total remuneration package including the fact that condition being satis ed related there is a compulsorily required deferral of bonus which is forfeitable matching shares released if the individual leaves within three years.
