42 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011 Directors Remuneration Report Letter to Shareholders Dear Shareholder, I am pleased to present to you, on behalf of the Board and the Remuneration Committee, the Remuneration Committees report on our Board Directors remuneration for the financial year 2011.
We believe it is important to continue to foster shareholder confidence in the integrity of our remuneration decisions and, therefore, in 2011 we remained in dialogue with major shareholders regarding the remuneration packages offered to Executive Directors, seeking as in previous years to maintain executive remuneration which: is in the best interests of the Company: takes account of pay in the rest of the business: is reasonable and in line with shareholder guidelines: and will be applied consistently for the future.
The Remuneration Committee has continued to work with and been advised by Mercer Ltd. on Executive Remuneration related matters and consulted them for advice on market trends, incentive design questions and other relevant matters.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee the Committee determine the policy for the remuneration of Lamprells Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and such other members of senior management as it is designated to consider.
There have been some minor amendments to the terms of reference since the last Remuneration Report and the full terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Companys website www.
Members of the Remuneration Committee in 2011 have been Brian Fredrick, Colin Goodall and Richard Raynaut.
Members have attended all Remuneration Committee meetings.
In addition, the Company Chairman, Jonathan Silver and the Chief Executive Officer, Nigel McCue attended meetings by invitation but were at no stage present when elements of their own remuneration were discussed.
The following pages provide a more detailed description of current Lamprell Executive Remuneration including changes that have been agreed upon during 2011.
Brian Fredrick Chairman of the Remuneration Committee OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 43 Lamprell plc Annual Report 2011 Executive remuneration policy and pay principles Our remuneration policy for Executive Directors gives consideration to remuneration policy and levels for the wider employee population and is designed to enable the recruitment, retention and motivation of Executive Directors and senior managers of the highest calibre.
Our remuneration policy aims to drive business performance and maximise shareholder value through offering remuneration packages to our senior management that are appropriately balanced between base salary and variable compensation and taking into account policy and practice in the UAE.
Our key remuneration principles are: base salaries should be competitive and bonuses should reflect both collective financial performance and personal performance.
Personal performance will be determined based on stretching, quantitative and qualitative targets set individually at the beginning of each year: the individual performance targets for the Executive Directors are recommended by the Company Chairman and approved by the Remuneration Committee.
Individual performance targets for the Vice Presidents are recommended by the Chief Executive Officer: maintaining the highest possible health and safety standards is of paramount importance to the Company and its business and is the collective responsibility of all Executive Directors, Vice Presidents and Employees.
Any fatality that takes place in a facility operated by the Company or any of its subsidiaries will be taken into account when considering whether to pay the whole or part of the personal performance bonus: and performance shares are awarded in order to align the interests of senior staff and shareholders and to encourage the recipients to remain with the Company.
The Remuneration Committee met six times during this financial year.
Items covered in the meetings included: investor consultation: variable pay: consideration of the ABI Guidelines: review of PSP awards: and review and agreement of financial targets for the annual bonus plan.
Main elements of remuneration Total remuneration, in line with our remuneration policy, is made up of a balance of fixed and variable compensation.
The current executive remuneration packages for Lamprell executives and senior managers are structured as follows: Component Objective Performance period Performance measure Delivery vehicle Base salary Reflect competitive n a Normally reviewed Monthly cash payment market, level of annually taking into responsibility and account individual individual contribution to performance, competitive fulfilling role requirements positioning and roles and responsibilities Allowances Provide additional n a n a Monthly cash payment payments in line with local market practice Annual bonus plan Focus and motivate One year Pre-defined performance Annual cash payment achievement of targets split between annual targets financial and individual objectives Performance share plan Reward executives for Three years Growth in Earnings Full value shares achievement of longer Per Share EPS over term earnings, value the three-year creation and share price performance period growth.

The Committee considers all elements of the pay structure to be important in supporting the Companys remuneration policy.
Pay mix In 2011, the remuneration mix for Lamprell Executive Directors, including long term and short-term incentives LTI and STI respectively was as follows: CEO CFO COO Basic Salary Actual STI LTI expected value 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Scott Doak retired from the Board of Directors with effect from 30 October 2011.
Elements of remuneration Base salary Provide a market competitive base salary that reflects the role, skills, experience and contribution of the individual In 2011, following the 2010 review of base salaries, the Committee decided to continue to position base salaries to recognise the following: Lamprell positions pay at levels to reflect the size and performance of the Company: the results of the benchmarking exercises undertaken by Mercer in both 2009 and 2010 had indicated anomalies between the base salaries and bonus amounts paid by the Company, and that of its comparator group, with base salaries significantly lower and variable pay through bonus significantly higher than the comparator group: and the Committee considered that too high a level of variable pay i. e. pay which is at risk could lead to the loss of key Executive Directors in difficult economic circumstances when continuity is most important.
The table below shows the base salaries of each current Executive Director effective as at 1 January 2011, and those that will apply from 1 January 2012.
