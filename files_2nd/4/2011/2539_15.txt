Composition and terms of reference The committees composition and terms of reference are in line with the Code and are available on the companys website or on request from the Company Secretary.
While the Chairman of the board is a member of the committee, he is not present when his own remuneration is under discussion.
The committee meets not less than three times a year and has responsibility for: Looking at executives remuneration in terms of the pay policy of the company as a whole, pay and conditions elsewhere in the group, and the overall cost to the shareholders: Making recommendations to the board on the groups policy on the remuneration of the companys Chief Executive, Chairman, the Executive Directors and other members of the Executive Committee: Determining, within agreed terms of reference, and taking into account corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues, the remuneration of the Chairman and specific remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors and other members of the Executive Committee, including pension rights, any compensation payments and benefits: Determining the level and extent to which awards should be made to the Executive Directors and other members of the Executive Committee under the companys employee share plans.
The committee also ensures compliance with the Code in this respect and takes into consideration the wider pay and employment conditions of the employees across the company.
Advisors The committee has appointed an external consultant, Towers Watson, to provide advice on executive compensation issues and performance-related remuneration.
The company is also advised by Towers Watson on other remuneration-related issues.
The following individuals also provided material advice or services to the committee during the year: Paul Moody Chief Executive : John Gibney Group Finance Director : Doug Frost Group Human Resources Director : and Julie Withnall Group Head of Reward Remuneration objectives The principal objective of the remuneration policy is to provide market competitive levels of remuneration for the companys senior executives, including incentive arrangements that will reward successful execution of the companys shortand long-term strategy.
The committee believes that this requires: The provision of mid-market base salaries and incentive levels for the sector, with appropriate leverage to reward sustained exceptional performance and support the future growth plans of the company: A reward structure that places appropriate emphasis on short-term operating performance and sustained longer-term performance: and Competitive incentive arrangements that are underpinned by a balance of operational and long-term performance metrics to provide both a focus on business performance and alignment with returns to the companys shareholders.
Britvic plc Annual Report 2011 45 governance directors remuneration report continued Remuneration policy and components of remuneration The remuneration policy has been designed to provide market competitive remuneration relative to appropriate peer groups for base salary and incentive opportunity.
The table below outlines the purpose for and performance measures attaching to each element of the package.

The committee believes that the remuneration of Executive Directors should be appropriately balanced between base salary and performance-related pay elements with the predominant proportion of potential reward being linked to performance.
The table below shows the current pay mix in place for Executive Directors under both target and maximum performance scenarios.
Executive Director reward elements Chief Maximum Executive Target Maximum Group Finance Director Target 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Base Bonus ESOP PSP Percentage of total 46 Britvic plc Annual Report 2011 The committee regularly reviews the remuneration policy to ensure that it is sufficiently flexible to take account of future changes in the companys business operations and environment, provides alignment to shareholder interests and that it recognises key developments in remuneration practice.
The committee believes the remuneration policy described above remains appropriate and that the incentive structure does not raise environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
Remuneration in practice Base salary Salaries are reviewed annually to take account of: The individual performance and contribution of each Executive Director: The annual salary review budget for the rest of the group: Business performance: Mid-market data for a peer group of UK-listed companies of similar revenue size and scope to the company: and Mid-market data for the few relevant companies in the UK food and beverage sector.
When determining directors remuneration, the committee considers market data provided by Towers Watson in June 2011 and the overall GB salary review budget which was 2% in 2011 12 with increases of 2.5% for on target performance.
Taking into account the above factors, the committee has decided that salaries will increase as shown in the table below.
Base salary as at Base salary as at 31 January 2011 31 January 2012 % increase Chief Executive 500,000 510,000 2% Group Finance Director 318,990 325,370 2% Incentive plans In setting incentive levels, the committee considers mid-market data on shortand long-term incentive opportunity from a peer group of consumer goods and retail sector companies.
The committee seeks to ensure that variable pay is determined by relevant and stretching measures of performance that are consistent with the strategic objectives and risk profile of the company, in order to appropriately align directors interests with those of shareholders and to engender appropriate risk-based behaviour.
Short-term incentive plan In 2010 11, targets were approved by the committee at the beginning of the year and were aligned to internal targets and strategic business objectives.
Target Maximum Performance metrics Chief Executive 70% 140% Target bonus is payable for achievement of target PBT, net revenue growth and free cash flow performance.
Group Finance Director 60% 120% Maximum bonus is payable for the achievement of exceptional performance targets.
For 2010 11, a bonus of 0% of salary for the Chief Executive and 0% of salary for the Group Finance Director was earned for below threshold performance against our stretching internal targets.
The committee has decided to maintain the same target and maximum bonus opportunity for executive directors in 2011 12 as applied in 2010 11.
The committee has also decided that the key short-term operational drivers of the business for 2011 12 remain appropriate and therefore the same bonus structure as applied in 2010 11 should continue.
Therefore bonuses will be paid for achievement of performance targets based on PBT, net revenue growth and free cash flow and will be set at appropriately stretching levels.

The SIP has three parts, all of which the directors participate in: Free share awards are made annually at the discretion of the committee.
The value of the award is discretionary and the maximum is 3% of reckonable earnings, capped at 3,000.
In light of our 2010 11 performance against internal targets, the committee has determined that no award of free shares will be made in April 2012.
Partnership shares are purchased by employees through payroll deductions between 5 and 115 per pay period.
Matching shares are provided by the employer to individual purchasing partnership shares on a one for one basis up to a maximum of 50 per pay period from 9 December 2011 onwards previously 75 per pay period.
Share ownership guidelines To align the interests of Executive Directors and shareholders, share ownership guidelines are in place that require Executive Directors to acquire a shareholding equal to their annual salary within five years from IPO calculated at the IPO share price or from the point of joining Britvic calculated at the share price on the date of joining.
Until this holding is acquired, the Executive Directors may not sell any shares other than to finance the cost of exercising options and any tax liabilities arising from the vesting of long-term incentive plans, unless approved by the committee, for example, in cases of financial hardship.
Retirement benefits The Executive Directors ceased participation in the defined benefit section of the Britvic Pension Plan the Plan on 10 April 2011 following the closure of the Plan to future accrual.
Both Executive Directors now receive a cash allowance in replacement of pension.
The cash allowance payable: Reflects contributions Britvic would have made to the defined contribution section of the Plan had these individuals elected to join, less a deduction to ensure the cash allowance is cost neutral to the company from a National Insurance perspective.
Is paid at a rate of 24.6% of pensionable pay to the Chief Executive and 22.0% of pensionable pay to the Group Finance Director.
Both Executive Directors continue to have a deferred pension in the defined benefit section of the Plan and also the Britvic executive top-up scheme the Scheme, the companys unfunded retirement benefits scheme which also closed to future accrual on 10 April 2011.
The normal retirement age for Executive Directors is 60.
Other benefits Executive Directors receive an annual car benefit or allowance and membership of the companys private medical healthcare plan.

In the period 2 October 2011 to 30 November 2011 there has been no change in the directors interests, other than through the monthly purchases in October and November of partnership and matching shares under the share incentive plan, resulting in an increase in the interests held by Paul Moody and John Gibney of 113 shares each.
Pensions The table below shows, amongst other items, as at the year end, the accrued pension should the director leave employment: the increase in the accrued pension during the year: the increase excluding inflation and member contributions: the transfer value of accrued pension: and any increase decrease in this value assessed on the transfer value basis as under the Britvic Pension Plan the Plan.

The defined benefit section of the Plan and the Britvic Executive Top-Up Scheme the Scheme were closed to future accrual on 10 April 2011.
Most active members transferred to the defined contribution section of the Plan, but the two directors listed above opted to cease tax-relievable pension provision at the point of closure and instead now receive a cash sum in lieu of pension contributions.
The cash sum received by Paul Moody equates to 24.6% of basic salary and that received by John Gibney equates to 22% of basic salary.
The accrued pensions and transfer values listed above are calculated on the basis of entitlements accrued to 10 April 2011, but calculated where relevant in line with market conditions at 2 October 2011.
The entitlements shown also include increases to accrued pensions for deferred members which are required under the rules of the Plan and the Scheme, the aim of which is to increase the benefits in line with price inflation between the date of leaving pensionable service in the Plan and the Scheme and the date when benefits are drawn.
