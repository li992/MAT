Remuneration policy The policy for the remuneration of the executive directors and the Remuneration Committee executive management team aims to achieve: The committee is responsible for setting all aspects of the remuneration u the ability to attract, retain and motivate high calibre executives: ofthe chairman, the executive directors and the company secretary and formonitoring the level and structure of remuneration for other senior u a strong link between executive reward and the groups performance: management of the group.
It is also responsible for the operation of the u alignment of the interests of the executives and the shareholders: and companys share plans and monitors the level and structure of the u provision of incentive arrangements which focus appropriately on both remuneration for senior management.
Its terms of reference are available annual and longer term performance.
In terms of market positioning, the overall objective is to achieve remuneration levels which provide a market competitive base salary with the opportunity to earn above market norms through the companys incentive schemes on the delivery of superior performance.
A significant proportion of total remuneration is therefore related to performance, through participation in both short-term and long-term incentive schemes.
G4S plc 62 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Governance Financial statements Shareholder information In 2011 the mix of remuneration available to the executive directors was asfollows: Target CEO 1 Base salary 29.2% Maximum CEO 1 Base salary 20.4% % % 2 Annual bonus 26.3% 2 Annual bonus 30.6% 1 3 Long-term incentives 32.7% 1 3 Long-term incentives 40.8% 4 4 4 Pension 11.7% 4 Pension 8.2% 2 2 3 3 Target all other executive 1 Base salary 33.4% Maximum all other executive 1 Base salary 24.1% directors directors 2 Annual bonus 25.1% 2 Annual bonus 30.1% % % 1 3 Long-term incentives 28.1% 1 3 Long-term incentives 36.1% 4 4 Pension 13.4% 4 Pension 9.6% 4 2 2 3 3 The committee believes that the current balance between base pay, annual bonus and long-term incentives is appropriate given its desire to ensure a strong link between performance and remuneration whilst, at the same time, avoiding a system which might incentivise inappropriate risk taking.
The committee is satisfied that the existing long-term incentive scheme, allied to the claw back processes described below and minimum shareholding requirements which were introduced in 2009 and 2010, provide suitable controls and incentives which are designed to avoid rewarding excessive risk taking or behaviour aimed at short term, unsustainable gains.
The balance between longand short-term incentives, and between basicsalary and performance-related bonuses, is however kept under closereview.
The committee is also satisfied that the incentive structure for the board does not raise environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
Bonus payments do not form part of salary for pension purposes.
