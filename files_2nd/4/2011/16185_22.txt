At 30 September 2011 37 43 6 Fair value measurements IFRS 7 requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements of financial instruments through the use of a three-level fair value Trade and listed investments hierarchy that prioritises the valuation techniques used in fair value calculations.
As at 30 September 2011 37m 2010: 37m of trade and listed investments were categorised as level 3 instruments.
These consist of the Groups investment in The Airline Group Limited 30m and other trade investments in the equity of unlisted companies 7m.
Both are valued The levels can be broadly described as follows: using assumptions not observable in the market and so have been categorised as level 3 instruments in the fair value hierarchy see Note 12.
Level 1 use of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities The level 1 trade investment is the Groups holding in Air Berlin PLC see Note 12.
Level 2 use of observable inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in Derivative assets and liabilities active markets Derivatives are valued in the market using discounted cash ow techniques.
Level 3 use of inputs not based on observable market data but reecting managements own assumptions about pricing the asset or liability These techniques incorporate inputs at levels 1 and 2, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
These market inputs are used The Group maintains policies and procedures to value instruments using the most relevant data available.
If there are multiple inputs available in the discounted cash ow calculation incorporating the instruments term, notional amount and discount rate, and taking credit risk into account.
that fall into different levels of the hierarchy, the instrument is categorised on the basis of the lowest level input.
As significant inputs to the valuation are observable in the markets, these instruments are categorised as level 2 in the hierarchy.
Other financial liabilities The put option to acquire the remaining equity stake in LTUR Tourismus AG 39m is classied as an other financial liability with changes in fair value included in operating profit.
Deferred consideration 4m is also measured at fair value based on the relevant contracts.
As all of these financial liabilities are valued using assumptions not observable in the market, they are categorised as level 3 instruments in the fair value hierarchy.
There are no reasonably possible changes in assumptions which would materially alter the value of these level 3 financial instruments.
