It is the Companys policy that liquidated damages should not automatically apply on the termination of an Executive Directors contract.
In accordance with this approach, payment for early termination of contract without cause by the Company is to be determined, in the case of each of the Executive Directors, having regard to normal legal principles which require mitigation of liability on a case-by-case basis.
Any such payment would typically be determined by reference to the main elements of a Directors remuneration, namely: salary, bonus entitlement subject to Committee discretion as appropriate, benets-in-kind and pension entitlements.
Phased payments will be considered by the Company where appropriate.
There are no change of control provisions that apply in relation to the service contract of any Executive Director.
