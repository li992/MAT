directors remuneration report Helical Bar plc 2011 page 51 Performance share plan At the 2004 AGM the Group received approval for the adoption of a Performance Share Plan PSP.
General The operation of the PSP is supervised by the Committee.
The PSP is capable of delivering shares to an executive after a period of not less than three years, other than in exceptional circumstances and with the approval of the Committee, subject to meeting pre-specified performance targets.
Eligibility All employees of the Group and its subsidiaries including directors who are required to devote substantially the whole of their working time to the business of the Group who are not under notice nor within six months of any contractual retirement ages will be eligible to receive invitations to participate in the PSP at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Grant of awards Awards may be made within the six weeks following approval at a general meeting, the announcement by the Group of its results for any period, or the removal of any statutory or regulatory restriction which had previously prevented an award being granted or any other times considered by the Remuneration Committee to be exceptional.
An award consists of the right to acquire shares in the Group for either no payment or payment of a nominal sum.
Awards are neither transferable nor pensionable.
Limit on individual participation No awards may be granted over shares in any financial year whose value is greater than three times an employees annual rate of salary.
Exercise of awards Other than in exceptional circumstances, an award will vest no earlier than the third anniversary of its grant to the extent that the applicable performance conditions see below have been satisfied and the participant is still employed by the Group.
Once exercisable, awards will then remain capable of exercise for a period of normally no more than six months.
The Remuneration Committee has set demanding performance conditions for the vesting of shares.
There are two performance conditions, one based on absolute growth in the Groups net asset value per share and the other based on the gross ungeared total property return per share relative to other property funds as determined by IPD but excluding those funds worth less than 50m at the start of the three year period.
Performance will be measured over the three years following grant.
Participants will not normally be permitted to sell shares received through the PSP, other than to meet taxation and national insurance contributions liabilities, until they own shares to the value of 2 x salary for directors and 1 x salary for other executives.
For the growth in net asset value, the fully diluted triple net net asset value as at the start of the financial year in which a grant takes place will be compared to the value three years later having added back dividends.
Applicable conditions a Absolute net asset value per share having added back dividends condition Annual compound increase after three years % of awar d vesting 15% p. a. or more 66.7 Between 7.5% p. a. and 15% p. a.
Zero If UK ination RPI is higher than 3% per annum over the three year period then the required compound increases will be raised by the excess over the 3% per annum average.
page 52 Helical Bar plc 2011 directors remuneration report b Total property return v IPD property funds condition Ranking after three years % of award vesting Upper quartile or above 33.3 Between median and upper quartile Pro rata between 3.3 and 33.3 Median 3.3 Less than median Zero Provided the net asset value per share having added back dividends increases over the three year period.
Share awards will lapse where the gross return falls below the IPD median and where the growth in triple net asset value is below 7.5% per annum over the three year period.
Alignment with shareholders interests The Remuneration Committee has analysed the potential gains that may be made by executives directors and those below Board level through the PSP and other incentive arrangements currently in place.
It has concluded that the share of the increase in the value of the Group measured as the increase in the net asset value plus cash returned as dividends to shareholders that could accrue to all executives through the Groups long and short-term incentive and bonus plans at the point at which the maximum awards vest might be of the order of 20%.
At this point, in absolute terms, the Group will have increased its triple net asset value by at least 15% per annum with the Groups relative performance placing it in the top quartile of IPD, over the three year period.
Vesting of Awards During the year the performance conditions relating to the fourth award, granted on 6 July 2007, were considered.
The three year performance period to 31 March 2010 showed that the net asset value per share, calculated in accordance with the terms of the PSP, had reduced by 4.6% p. a.
During this three year period the total return of Helicals property portfolio, as determined by IPD, was 0.0% compared to the upper quartile of the IPD Benchmark which had reduced by 5.3%.
Therefore, although the IPD comparison performance criteria had been met, no shares could vest as the net asset value per share had fallen.
Helical Bar 2002 Approved Share Incentive Plan On 24 July 2002 the shareholders approved the Helical Bar 2002 Approved Share Incentive Plan the Plan.
Under the terms of this Plan employees of the Group are given up to 3,000 of free shares in any tax year.
Participants in the Plan may purchase additional shares up to a value of 1,500 which is matched in a ratio of 2:1 by the Group.
Provided participants remain employed by the Group for a minimum of three years they will retain the free and matching shares.
