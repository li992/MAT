101 Directors remuneration report Share Plans for Executive Directors Before releasing any award in respect of the TSR element, the Remuneration Committee seeks to satisfy itself that the Performance Share Plan Groups TSR performance is a genuine reflection of the Eligibility for conditional awards underlying business performance of the Group.
Under the International Power 2002 PSP, Executive Directors are eligible annually for the following conditional For the conditional award made in 2011 the TSR comparator award of shares: group comprises the FTSE 11-50 companies excluding the equivalent of 200% of base salary for the CEO those engaged in financial services, mining, oil exploration and property development as at 1 January 2011. the equivalent of 150% of base salary for the other Executive Directors Benefits on vesting The method of calculating an Executive Directors entitlement Performance conditions to shares upon vesting is as follows: Awards made conditionally under the PSP vest subject to a performance assessment at the end of a three-year i n respect of the TSR element, 25% of the maximum vests performance period, against the targets put in place at the for median TSR performance and the maximum vests for commencement of each cycle.

The link to EPS, at 50% of the potential value to for performance at the threshold target established by the participants, ensures vesting is aligned with a business Remuneration Committee and the maximum vests when performance measure as presented in the Groups the stretch target is achieved consolidated financial statements.
The use of TSR, also weighted at 50%, provides a market-based measure when s traight-line pro-rating is applied for performance between assessing performance.

New Performance Share Plan prospective conditional awards 2012 Subject to approval of the new PSP rules at the 2012 AGM, the Company proposes to make PSP conditional awards to Philip Cox equivalent to 200% of his base salary and to each of Geert Peeters subject to his appointment as Executive Director and CFO at the 2012 AGM, and Guy Richelle equivalent to 150% of their base salaries.
For the 2012 PSP awards, covering the three-year performance period 2012-2014, the Remuneration Committee has determined that 50% of the award will be linked to TSR performance and 50% of the award will be linked to EPS performance.
TSR and EPS performance targets will be confirmed in the circular to shareholders accompanying the notice convening the AGM.
Executive Share Option Plans Eligibility for awards During 2011 International Power made no new awards of Approved, Unapproved or Global Executive Share Options.
With effect from 1 January 2006, the Executive Directors have not been eligible to participate in new awards under any of the Companys Executive share option schemes.
Performance conditions In respect of all awards made to the Executive Directors under the Approved, Unapproved and Global Executive Share Option Plans, the performance conditions were based exclusively on EPS growth.
No re-testing has been permitted in respect of any share option grant.
Given that the principal performance measures for the Companys share option plans were based on growth in EPS, the Committee reserved the right to take into account, and adjust appropriately for, the enhancement effects of any purchase and subsequent cancellation of shares, or the placing of shares into treasury, by the Company.

The threshold 2007 performance condition was 13.7p New Performance Share Plan The objective of the proposed new Share Plan is to encourage the creation of value over the long-term and to align the rewards of the participants with the returns to shareholders.
Shareholder approval will be sought at the AGM on 15 May 2012 for a new long-term incentive plan, which will replace the existing 2002 PSP, which is due to expire on 23 May 2012.
The key design features of the new long-term incentive plan are as follows: awards will be structured as performance-vesting deferred shares the primary requirement for awards to vest is that the Remuneration Committee should be satisfied that any performance condition and any other condition imposed on the award has been achieved the performance will be measured over a three-year period and the Remuneration Committee will review this approach for future years awards the Remuneration Committee may specify different performance conditions and or other additional terms for awards granted under the Plan at any time, taking into account any factors as the Committee may consider relevant for this purpose Pension benefits New legislation in 2011 had a major effect on the tax efficiency of pension savings built up above specified levels, with particular impact on benefits accruing in defined benefit pension plans.
Until July 2011, pension arrangements for Philip Cox and Mark Williamson were provided through the Senior Section of the International Power Group of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme ESPS, a scheme registered with Her Majestys Revenue and Customs HMRC.
The scheme features included: a normal retirement age of 60 an accrual rate that targets two-thirds of pensionable salary at normal retirement age death-in-service benefit of four times capped salary a spouses pension on death in retirement of two-thirds of the Executive Directors pre-commutation pension The members contribution was the lower of 6% of uncapped salary and 15% of a notional earnings cap, based on limits previously imposed by HMRC.
The benefits provided through the scheme were also restricted by the earnings cap.
To compensate for this, the scheme benefits were supplemented by additional life assurance cover and the provision of a non-pensionable cash allowance.
The cash allowance comprised the balance of 33% of salary which is the limit that the Committee has established to provide all pension benefits less the employer contribution to a pension arrangement.
Its purpose was to enable the recipient to make his own personal provision for additional retirement income beyond that provided through a company arrangement.

The taxes paid by the Company in the UK and Australia were net of UK hypothetical tax paid by Tony Concannon in 2011, under the Companys expatriate policy.
The net tax liability from 1 January to 3 February 2011 was estimated by the Companys taxation specialists to be less than or equivalent to the hypothetical taxes and social security deductions that are withheld from his UK income, as the hypothetical UK tax was deducted at 50% plus 1% NIC.
However, the top rate of tax in Australia is 45% plus 2.5% medicare and medicare surcharge : this is compared to 2010, when the top rate of UK tax was 40%.

6 From 1 January 2011 until his resignation from the Board on 3 February 2011, the Other benefits entry for Steve Riley incorporated a company car allowance 1,107, private medical insurance 195 and the value of relocation support 1,340.
