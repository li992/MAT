Remuneration report The Board presents the remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2011.
Remuneration Committee Chairmans statement Following the introduction of both a new Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and deferred profit share plan in 2010, 2011 was a year of relatively little change in the principal components of total reward for executive directors.
In December 2010, the FSA published a policy statement on the disclosure of remuneration in response to the 2008 financial crisis.
Its aim is to ensure the disclosure of the remuneration policies and practices for those staff whose professional activities have a material impact on its risk profile.
Rathbones profits are not generated by higher risk activities such as proprietary trading.
The Board considers that the Companys remuneration arrangements are consistent with the risk profile of the business.
A remuneration policy statement was approved by the committee and the Board during the year.
Board salaries were increased by 3% with effect from 1 January 2012, in line with the increase given to the majority of employees.
Remuneration Committee The Board has delegated the determination of executive director remuneration to the remuneration committee.
The current members of the committee are the independent non-executive directors Caroline Burton chairman, Kate Avery, Oliver Corbett, David Harrel and Kathryn Matthews.
The chairman, Mark Nicholls, was considered independent on appointment as chairman and is also a member of the committee.
The chief executive attends meetings at the invitation of the committee.
Neither the chairman nor chief executive is present when their own remuneration is discussed.
The committee met on six occasions in 2011 2010: five.
Details of attendance at meetings are shown on page 47.
Remuneration policy for executive directors The overall aim of the remuneration policy is to support our longer term business objectives and promote behaviours which support value creation for shareholders, whilst at the same time providing a competitive remuneration package which is sufficient to attract and retain directors of the quality needed to manage and develop the Company successfully.
Total reward is designed to include a balance of fixed and variable pay with a high level of deferral.
External data is used to validate rather than to benchmark total reward.
The current remuneration package for an executive director has four main elements: basic salary and benefits, profit share, equity incentives and pension.
The various elements are designed to: align the interests of the directors with shareholders in generating long term shareholder value.
Achieved through participation in: an LTIP with a relative total shareholder return performance condition profit share deferrals invested in Rathbone Brothers Plc shares align remuneration practices with effective risk management.
Achieved by the use of: profit share based on profits rather than an income-based bonus deferred awards LTIP and partial deferral of profit share The committee also ensures that up to date, best practice contracts are adopted.
The committee is satisfied that the incentive structure does not increase environmental, social and governance risks by inadvertently encouraging irresponsible behaviour.
The elements of remuneration packages are summarised in table 1.

Deferred share awards vest after three years 3 Benefits include medical insurance and the value of SIP free shares and matching shares 4 During the year, retirement benefits accrued under money purchase schemes in relation to three directors 2010: three Basic salary and benefits An executive directors basic salary is determined by the committee.
Any change is implemented on 1 January of each year or when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the committee considers salaries throughout the Group as a whole and the information obtained on comparable companies in the financial sector as provided by the advisers to the committee.
The views of the chairman and chief executive are also taken into consideration when considering the salaries of other directors.
With one exception, all directors received a salary increase of approximately 4% with effect from 1 January 2011 which was in line with the average increase for all employees.
Ian Buckley received an increase of 7.8% to reflect significant additional responsibilities taken on during the year.
Salaries were increased by 3% on 1 January 2012 in line with the increase given to most employees.
The only exception was Richard Lanyon, whose salary was unchanged in view of his retirement from the Board on 10 May 2012.
In addition Rathbones provides a range of benefits including life, private medical and permanent health insurance.
50 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2011 Remuneration report continued Profit share The current profit sharing scheme was introduced on 1 January 2010.
Awards to all executive directors are made from a pool of profits of 3% 5% of Group profit before tax with an expectation that in a normal year the percentage is around 4%.
An additional profit share payment of 61,000 was made to Richard Smeeton as a result of his giving up legacy entitlements.
The committee has the discretion to adjust the calculation of Group profit before tax for the purposes of the profit share to ensure that it appropriately reflects underlying business performance.
No adjustment was made in 2011.
In 2010, the committee agreed that exceptional FSCS levies of 3.6 million should be excluded from the calculation.
Awards to individual directors are determined by the committee following recommendations by the chief executive and chairman having due regard of the performance of the director, the results of the business for which the director has responsibility where relevant and market data where this is available.
Awards are capped at 200% of basic salary.
Awards are made in both cash one third and deferred shares two thirds with interim, on account awards payable during the financial year, and final awards made shortly after the announcement of the Groups results for the year.
The proportion paid in cash may be increased at the request of the participant but this will cause the overall award to be reduced such that the total will be reduced by a maximum of one third if 100% of the award is taken in cash.
No executive directors chose to increase the cash element of the award in 2010 or 2011.
No performance criteria are attached to the deferred share awards.
The committees view is that share price movements reflect the performance of the business and therefore further performance conditions are not necessary.
Half of deferred share awards will lapse if a director is a bad leaver.
Deferred shares attract the monetary equivalent of declared dividends over the deferral period from the end of the financial year of the award.
Awards vest on the third anniversary of the financial year end at which point a nil paid option will be granted over the deferred share award including a further number of additional shares representing the value of dividends received and reinvested in relation to vested shares.
This option may be exercised within seven years of grant.
The final deferred share award for 2010 was made on 4 March 2011.
An interim deferred share award was made on 26 September 2011.
Awards were also made following dividend payments in May and October.
The final award for 2011 will be made following the announcement of the 2011 results on 21 February 2012.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2011 51 Remuneration report continued Profit share continued Table 2.
Awards are limited to 75% of salary other than in exceptional circumstances when the committee considers that a 100% limit would be appropriate.
At the end of each plan cycle, the Companys performance is assessed against the performance targets for that cycle.
The extent to which the targets have been achieved determines the actual number of shares if any attributable to each participant.
A new LTIP was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 11 May 2011 and came into effect for the 2011 13 plan cycle.
The performance conditions for the plan cycles are as follows: Performance targets 2008 10, 2009 11 and 2010 12 plan cycles Table 3.

Whilst the EPS performance target will continue unchanged, changes to the TSR performance target were approved.

If a participant ceases to be employed for good leaver reasons, the award shall normally continue in effect and vest on the original date set for vesting but with the award based on the performance during the plan cycle as a whole but reduced pro rata to reflect the fact that the participant was not an executive director for the whole plan cycle.
In all other circumstances, any provisional award would lapse on cessation of employment.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2011 53 Remuneration report continued Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP continued Vesting of historic awards 2008 10 plan cycle The TSR for the three year period was 19.8%, which ranked the Company at the 62nd percentile relative to the constituents of the FTSE All Share Index, resulting in an award of 48.8% of the TSR element.
Basic EPS decreased from 76.54p in 2007 to 49.76p in 2010 and so no award was payable for this element of the plan.
The awards were made in March 2011.
2009 11 plan cycle The TSR for the three year period was 46.2%, which ranked the Company at the 40th percentile relative to the constituents of the FTSE All Share Index.
No awards will therefore be made from either element of the plan.
2010 12 and 2011 13 plan cycles Details of the awards for the 2010 12 and 2011 13 plan cycles are set out in table 5.
Were the maximum possible awards to be made in shares to current and former directors as shown in table 5, 257,231 ordinary shares 2010: 285,149 would be awarded, representing 0.6% 2010: 0.7% of the issued share capital at 31 December 2011, excluding shares held in treasury.
In practice, awards under the LTIP are intended to be satisfied using market purchased shares.
Expected actual awards are difficult to predict with any accuracy.
The value of these awards when made was 75% of a participants basic salary.
The market value of shares at the date of the award is the average mid-market price over the 20 dealing days prior to the start of the plan 54 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2011 Remuneration report continued Share Incentive Plan SIP and Save As You Earn SAYE All directors are entitled to take part in the SIP on the same terms as all other employees.
This allows all employees to purchase shares in the Company and currently these are matched on a one-for-one basis by the Company.
Performance related SIP shares are also offered to employees if there is year on year EPS growth over the rate of inflation.
SIP shares are included in the table of directors share interests on page 42.
Executive directors may also participate in the Rathbones SAYE scheme on the same terms as all other employees.
Details of grants to directors are shown in table 6.
It is anticipated that a further grant will be made in March 2012 following the announcement of the 2011 results.
The outstanding options held by directors at the start of the year lapsed during the year.
Details are set out in table 7.

While it remains best practice to do so, treasury shares will be treated as newly issued shares for the purposes of dilution calculations.
The Company satisfies the various equity-based schemes it operates using a combination of market purchased, newly issued and treasury shares.

TSR is calculated assuming that dividends are reinvested on receipt.
The FTSE All Share Index has been selected as a comparator as it is a suitably broad market index and has been used as a performance comparator for LTIP plan cycles since 2005 07.
Pension arrangements UK employees who joined Rathbones prior to 1 April 2002 were offered membership of a defined benefit scheme, the Rathbone 1987 Pension Scheme with a normal retirement age of 60.
Prior to 1 April 2006, the accrual rate was 1 60th for each year of membership.
With effect from 1 April 2006, employees were given the choice of either remaining on a 1 60th accrual rate but increasing their contribution rate from 5% to 6.5% at 1 April 2006 and to 8% from 1 January 2008 or switching to a 1 70th accrual rate for future pensionable service but continuing to contribute at 5%.
With effect from 1 July 2009, future service benefits are based on career average revalued earnings CARE with a normal retirement age of 65 rather than 60.
Details of the Companys contributions are set out in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements.
Since 1 April 2002, new employees have been offered membership of a group defined contribution plan, established with Scottish Widows.
In the case of certain directors and senior staff, the Group contributes to their personal pension arrangements.
Paul Chavasse, Andrew Morris and Richard Smeeton are members of the Rathbone 1987 Pension Scheme.
Richard Lanyon transferred out of this scheme on 15 March 2011 and has since been paid 10% of salary in lieu of pension scheme contributions.
Ian Buckley, Richard Lanyon, Andy Pomfret and Paul Stockton participate in the scheme for death in service benefits only.
Richard Smeeton is also a member of the Laurence Keen Retirement Benefits Scheme see note 24 for service prior to 1 October 1999.
Ian Buckley and Andy Pomfret have arrangements under self-invested personal pension schemes whilst Paul Stockton is a member of the group defined contribution plan.
The changes in pension entitlements arising in the year, required to be disclosed by the UK Listing Authority, are shown in table 8.
There have been no changes in the terms of directors pension entitlements during the year.
There are no unfunded pension promises or similar arrangements for directors.
The increases in transfer values are mainly due to changed assumptions for inflation, post-retirement discount rates and future mortality.

Service contracts for executive directors The Company has service contracts with its executive directors which were reviewed and modernised in 2011.
Following his appointment as head of investment management, Paul Chavasses notice period was increased from 6 to 12 months.
It is Company policy that such contracts should not normally contain notice periods of more than 12 months.
Details of the contracts of employment of executive directors serving during the year are as shown in table 9.

Payment in lieu of notice would include basic salary, pension contributions and benefits.
There are no provisions for the payment of liquidated damages or any statements in respect of the duty of mitigation.
Compensation payments will be determined on a case by case basis in the light of current market practice.
Compensation will include loss of salary and other contractual benefits but mitigation will be applied where appropriate.
In the event of entering into a termination agreement, the Board will take steps to impose a legal obligation on the director to mitigate any loss incurred.
There are no clauses in contracts amending employment terms and conditions on a change of control.
Executive directors contracts of service, which include details of remuneration, will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
Shareholdings New executive directors are encouraged to build up and maintain a shareholding at least equivalent to the value of one years basic salary within five years of taking up their appointment.
External appointments Executive directors are encouraged to take on external appointments as non-executive directors, but are discouraged from holding more than one other position in a quoted company given the time commitment.
Prior approval of any new appointment is required by the Board with fees generally being payable to the Company.
An exception is Ian Buckley.
Following his appointment as a committee member of the Family Assurance Friendly Society on 14 December 2009, he retains the fee paid of 30,000 per annum 2010: 27,350.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2011 57 Remuneration report continued Advisers to the Remuneration Committee The remuneration committee has appointed Deloitte LLP Deloitte as advisers to the committee.
Deloitte attend at least one committee meeting per annum and advise on best practice and latest developments in senior executive remuneration.

The appointment is reviewed annually.
The committee is also assisted by the personnel department and by the company secretary.
Non-executive directors Non-executive directors do not have contracts of employment but, as with all other directors, are now required to stand for re-election annually in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The effectiveness of the non-executive directors is subject to an annual assessment.
The executive directors are responsible for determining the fees of the non-executive directors, who do not receive pension or other benefits from the Group and do not participate in any Group incentive scheme, other than the SIP.
Non-executive directors fees Fees were increased with effect from 1 January 2011 and from 1 January 2012 as shown in table 10.
