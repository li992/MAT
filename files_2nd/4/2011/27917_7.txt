Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Report of the Board to the shareholders on directors remuneration This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 and also sets out how the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code relating to executive directors remuneration are applied by the Group.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company.
Certain parts of this report are required to be audited.
Where disclosures are subject to audit, they have been marked as such.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION Remuneration Committee During the year, the Committee consisted of Edward Tilly who chaired the Committee until 27 July 2011 but remained a member after that date, Alan Fletcher who chaired the Committee from 27 July 2011, Terence Eccles, Christopher Newell and Peter Hartill from 1 June 2011, all of whom were independent non-executive directors and the Chairman of the Company, Robert Dench.
None of the non-executive directors who sit on the Committee has any personal financial interest other than as a shareholder, conict of interest arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Chairman of the Company does not participate in discussions on his own remuneration.
The Committee determines the Companys policy on executive remuneration and specic compensation packages for each of the executive directors and the Chairman.
No director contributes to any discussion about his own remuneration.
The Committee also reviews the level and structure of remuneration of senior management.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on request from the Company Secretary.
In determining the directors remuneration for the year, the Committee consulted Mr N S Terrington Chief Executive about its proposals.
The Committee also retains New Bridge Street NBS, a brand of Aon Hewitt Limited, as its independent advisor on remuneration matters.
NBS also advised the Company on various sundry remuneration matters during the year, which did not conict with its advice to the Committee.
Aon Hewitt provided administration services to the trustees of the Paragon Pension Scheme during the year.
Remuneration policy for the Chairman and executive directors The Companys policy is to ensure that the Chairman and the executive directors are fairly rewarded for their individual performance, having regard to the importance of retention and motivation.
The performance measurement of the Chairman and the executive directors and the determination of their annual remuneration packages are undertaken by the Committee.
In forming and reviewing remuneration policy the Committee has given full consideration to the UK Corporate Governance Code and has complied with the Codes provisions relating to directors remuneration throughout the year.
Moreover, the Committee has given due regard to the link between remuneration and strategy, seeking to ensure that the remuneration structures in place do not encourage excessive risk or activities that are not in line with the agreed strategy.
The remuneration packages of the individual directors are assessed after a review of their individual performances and an assessment of comparable positions in the financial sector and within a group of pan-sectoral comparators comprising a number of companies with market capitalisations similar to the Groups size, there now being no directly comparable financial services businesses in the UK.
Directors remuneration 25 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC The Executive Directors receive a combination of xed and performance-related elements of remuneration.
Fixed remuneration consists of salary, benets in kind and pension scheme contributions see under Pension contributions below.
Performance-related remuneration consists of participation in the annual bonus plan, the award of shares under the Performance Share Plan and invitations to participate in the award of shares under the Matching Share Plan from time to time.
The performance-related elements of remuneration are intended to provide a significant proportion of executive directors potential total remuneration.
Following the recent return to new lending and because of other developments within the business, the Committee believes it now to be an appropriate time to conduct a fundamental review of whether the executive remuneration arrangements remain appropriate to the Companys circumstances and strategy.
This may result in consultation with major shareholders, to ensure that any new arrangements are acceptable.
The review and consultation process is currently in progress.
The Committee pays due regard to the levels of remuneration within the Group when determining the remuneration of executive directors and other senior employees.
It also seeks to ensure that the incentive structure for senior management does not raise environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
Salary The Chairmans fees and executive directors salaries are determined by the Committee at the beginning of each year.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers remuneration levels within the Group as a whole, individual and business performance during the year and in the past has relied on objective research which gives up-to-date information on comparable companies.
Directors contracts of service will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
In view of the progress made by the Group during the year, the Committee has agreed that the Chairmans fee and executive directors salaries will be increased by 4% from 1 October 2011.
This is in line with increases for the Groups wider workforce.
Pension contributions During the year the executive directors were members of the Group Retirement Benets Plan, to which the Company contributes at the same rate as for all members.
Dependants of executive directors who are members of the Group Retirement Benets Plan are eligible for a dependants pension and the payment of a lump sum in the event of death in service.
The pension arrangements provide for a pension of 1 37.5 of basic annual salary to a maximum of 2 3 for every year of eligible service.
Where pension contributions are capped, additional payments are made to enable further provision.
Plan participants contribute 5% of eligible salary to the Plan.
Mr Terrington and Mr Heron suspended their contributions to the Plan, and the accrual of benets, prior to the beginning of the year.
This was because each director affected by the 2006 A-Day changes was offered the opportunity to terminate permanently further contributions in exchange for a cash supplement calculated to equate to the cost of the Companys contributions towards the executives future service benets had he stayed within the Plan for his future service accrual.
Following an offer by the Company to senior personal to contain the volatility of costs associated with the provision of benets under the pension scheme, Mr Keen ceased pension accrual from 1 April 2011 in return for a cash supplement calculated to equate to the cost of the Companys contributions towards future service benets had he stayed with the plan for his future service accrual.
The changes in pension entitlements arising in the financial year, the disclosure of which is required by the Financial Services Authority, are given on pages 31 and 32.
Other than as reported above in respect of Mr Keen, there have been no changes in the terms of directors pension entitlements during the year.
There are no unfunded promises or similar arrangements for directors.
26 Directors remuneration Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Performance bonuses During the year, the executive directors participated in an annual bonus scheme under which awards were determined by consideration of a several business-specic financial measures, including operating profit, cash generation and cost control: and b measures relevant to current business plans and objectives, such as the development of the Groups new lending business, borrower retention and the development and delivery of new strategies to enhance existing income streams.
These performance measures are designed to promote the long-term success of the Company by linking to the strategy and specic risk factors faced by the Company.
Consideration was also given to individual executive performance.
Corporate and individual performance are the key determinants of any bonus paid share price performance is not intended to have an impact other than in exceptional circumstances.
During the year, the total target bonus for executive directors was 100% of salary, total stretch bonus was 150% of salary and the bonus payable under the bonus scheme was capped at 200% of salary this could only be achieved for exceptional performance.
In determining bonus levels the Committee has considered the performance of the executive directors and of the Company in relation to the adverse economic and market conditions prevailing during the year.
The directors have exceeded their target bonus objectives to deliver the Groups strategy, including, inter alia, revenue generation, the effective and efficient management of the extant book, including optimising value by maintaining low redemption and arrears rates, maximising cash ow and the development of new lending and refreshing the Groups systems capabilities to increase business capacity, competitiveness and broaden capabilities.
A bonus of 175% of salary has been earned by each of Mr Terrington and Mr Keen for the year.
This bonus reects very strong individual performance and the exceeding of stretch company performance targets in terms of profits, cash generated, arrears performance, portfolio acquisition and servicing contracts and customer retention.
A bonus of 125% of salary has been earned by Mr Heron following strong individual performance, the success of the recommencement of lending and the building up of business volumes during the year whilst concentrating on high quality borrowers.
Bonus amounts in excess of 50,000 are subject to compulsory 25% deferral, whereby the deferred amount less any clawback in the event of misstatement or misconduct, which can be applied by the Committee in certain specic circumstances, is payable in shares after three years.
The Chairman and non-executive directors are not entitled to receive a bonus and do not participate in the performance or matching share plans.
Bonus objectives will continue to be focused on protecting, maintaining and enhancing shareholder value.
Specic objectives will be set concerning the management of the extant book of business, covering such aspects as managing retention, arrears, cash ow and overall cost efficiency.
Other objectives will concern the further development of the Groups new lending business and the development and delivery of new strategies to enhance existing income streams.
Performance against these objectives will be reported in next years report.
Share awards In prior years, executive directors received grants of share options under the Paragon 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS.
Executive directors no longer receive share option grants under the ESOS and the scheme has now expired.
Directors remain eligible for awards under the Performance Share Plan PSP and are able to participate in the Matching Share Plan MSP by investing up to 25% of their salary in the Companys shares.
In 2009, the Committee reviewed the appropriateness of the performance criteria it had applied to awards in the past and concluded that the traditional measures of EPS growth and relative Total Shareholder Return TSR were not appropriate.
After consultation with major shareholders, the Committee determined that the most appropriate target was relative TSR, whereby the TSR of the Company is compared to a comparator group of companies comprising the constituents of the FTSE 250.
This was the condition applied to grants made under the PSP and MSP on and after 21 May 2009.
The FTSE 250 was chosen because it is a broad-based index and because of the lack of comparable listed financial services organisations at the current time.
The performance conditions are reviewed prior to each future grant to ensure that they remain the most suitable in the Companys prevailing circumstances.
The executive directors are entitled to receive options under the Paragon UK Sharesave Plan 2009, on the same terms as other employees.
Directors remuneration 27 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Paragon Performance Share Plan PSP The PSP has an annual award limit to an individual of shares worth 200% of salary.
PSP awards granted on or after 21 May 2009 are subject to a performance condition comparing the rank of the Companys TSR against a comparator group of companies comprising the constituents of the FTSE-250 on the date of grant over the three years commencing on the date of grant.
25% of awards vest for median performance, increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for upper quartile performance.
Prior to any awards vesting, the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the requirements of a financial underpin test have been met.
During the previous year the rules of the scheme were amended such that the expiry date for each outstanding award is the tenth anniversary of the grant date.
Performance continues to be measured over a single three year period and all other conditions remain unchanged.
Awards under the PSP are made from time to time at the discretion of the Committee and during the year the executive directors were granted awards over shares equal to 200% of salary.
Paragon Matching Share Plan MSP Under the terms of the MSP, executive directors and senior management may be invited to invest in shares in the Company out of their after-tax cash bonus.
Assuming that the executives decide to invest, the shares acquired must remain held by the executives for three years.
At the end of the three-year period and, subject to satisfaction of the same performance conditions as set out for the PSP above, the executives will receive a match in shares on a two-for-one basis related to the number of shares which could have been purchased with the pre-tax equivalent of the bonus invested.
Executive directors will be invited to invest the after-tax equivalent of up to 25% of salary: at such a level, their award is over free performance-linked matching shares worth 50% of salary.
The MSP provides the facility to increase the level of potential investment up to the after-tax equivalent of 50% of salary should the Remuneration Committee feel in future years that this would be appropriate.

Mr N S Terrington, Mr N Keen and Mr J A Heron were members of the Group dened benefit pension scheme during the year.
The amounts shown below describe their entitlement in accordance with paragraph LR 9.8.

The increase in accrued pension during the year and transfer value of the increase excludes any increase for ination.
The transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the Occupational Pensions Schemes Transfer Values Regulations 1996 and the Occupational Pensions Schemes Transfer Values Amendment Regulations 2008, in force from 1 October 2008.
Members of the scheme have the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions: neither the contributions nor the resulting benets are included in the above table.
The Government has recently announced its intention to link statutory minimum pension increases to CPI rather than RPI.
This may have an impact on the plan.
The transfer values calculated have been based on the assumption that increases both revaluation in deferment and increases in payment continue to be linked to RPI as provided by the plan rules.
The following disclosures describe the pension benets earned in the year in accordance with section 421 of the Companies Act 2006.

The contributions shown are those paid or payable by the directors under the terms of the plan.
Directors remuneration 31 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC The increases in transfer values as shown in the final column largely reect the changes in assumptions underlying the transfer value basis as at 30 September 2011 and 30 September 2010, due to changes in financial conditions.
The increases also allow for the fact that the accrued pension is a year closer to the assumed date of payment.
The transfer value at 30 September 2011 has been calculated on the basis of the Occupational Pensions Schemes Transfer Values Amendment Regulations 2008.
The trustees are responsible for the assumptions and calculation of transfer values, having taken advice from the scheme actuary.
The transfer values disclosed above do not represent a sum either paid or currently payable to the individual director by the Group or the scheme.
Instead they represent a potential liability of the pension scheme should the director request a transfer, calculated at the balance sheet date.
During the year the Group made contributions in respect of further pension provision of 134,000 2010: 130,000 for Mr N S Terrington, 157,000 2010: 127,000 for Mr N Keen and 67,000 2010: 65,000 for Mr J A Heron.
