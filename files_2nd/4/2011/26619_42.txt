Annual vesting over three years.
Performance bonus The bonus pool is determined by the profitability of the business for the financial year after a charge on surplus capital.
The Audit and Risk Committee reviewed judgemental accounting items and reported to the Remuneration Committee to provide guidance determining the bonus pool.
The success of the business, within a governance framework, is therefore the direct driver of compensation levels.
Employees are measured against both delivery on business objectives, and risk management compliance with performance reviews to assess the employees contribution and potential.
Business objectives include building the sustainable profitability of the Company and managing risk within the governance framework.
The purpose is to increase the effectiveness and potential of every Man employee by ensuring that individual objectives are consistent with overall business and department goals.
Senior employees also have part of their performance bonus mandatorily deferred in shares and funds with the proportion deferred increasing as total compensation increases with maximum deferral levels at 50% of variable compensation.
Awards are through the Man Group share plans to align them with the shareholders and the future performance of the Company.
Deferred compensation awards for senior investment managers are also invested in fund based incentives to align employees with the interests of investors in funds managed by the Company.
Senior sales staff are rewarded through a mix of performance bonus and marketing incentives based on funds under management.
Executive Committee remuneration The Executive Committee members who are not executive directors have had their remuneration policy assessed to ensure that senior management are appropriately incentivised to deliver the Companys strategic plan.
A significant proportion of their remuneration has been delivered as long-term deferred awards.
Variable incentives are structured such that 50% of the awards have been deferred into share or fund based incentive arrangements this year.
This aligns their interests with the long-term return to shareholders and with the interests of investors in Man funds.
Options with an exercise price 10% above the market price at grant premium priced options have also been awarded to incentivise sustained growth with the options exercisable between 3 and 10 years from the anniversary of grant.

Policy Whilst ensuring shareholder interests are managed within a robust governance framework, the Company aims to attract, motivate and retain high calibre executive directors and align their remuneration with the interests of shareholders by paying competitive base salary and benefits, together with a performance bonus and long term incentive awards which are linked to: the achievement of individual objectives, which are consistent with the strategy of the Group and building sustainable profitability: the achievement of the Groups key financial targets: the creation of long-term shareholder value: ongoing oversight of a robust risk management framework: maintenance of strong capital and liquidity positions: and addition of senior talent, building succession for leadership and setting a strong governance structure for the Boards delegated authorities.
Man Group plc 97 Annual Report 2011 The Company operates in the alternative investment management sector and is listed in the FTSE 100, whilst the majority of its competitors are unlisted.
The recruitment and retention of talent is critical and for this reason it is important that the remuneration structure is competitive and enables the Company to attract and retain high calibre executives and employees within this specialised sector.
It is market practice in the alternative investment management industry for the total remuneration package of executives to contain a high proportion of variable pay which is consistent with the return to shareholders.
For this reason, awards of Company shares under the Companys incentive plans are a significant proportion of the executive directors total remuneration.
This harmonises the interests of executive directors and senior executives with the Groups shareholders through the promotion and encouragement of share ownership, and is subject to achieving return on equity and growth targets.
In assessing the competitiveness of remuneration, base salaries, performance bonuses and long term incentives have been reviewed against available external market data.
Internal relativities within the Company are also taken into account.
These market and internal reviews cover the individual elements of base salaries, benefits and total compensation.
Whilst the fixed component of remuneration is sufficiently high to allow the Company to operate a fully flexible bonus policy in order to preserve alignment with shareholder interests, the Remuneration Committee seeks to deliver a high proportion of total compensation as mandatory deferral into shares and into options over Company shares and as long term incentives.

To protect the Groups business interests, executive directors service contracts contain covenants which restrict the executives ability to solicit or deal with clients and also restricts their ability to solicit senior employees, to the extent permitted under the law of the relevant jurisdiction.
Under their service contracts, external appointments require Board consent.
The Remuneration Committee must approve in advance any termination payments.
The Company has purchased and maintained throughout the year directors and officers liability insurance in respect of itself and its directors.

Under his service contract, his base salary is $1,000,000.
He does not receive any employer contribution to pension: benefits are consistent with those offered to the other executive directors.
Any discretionary performance related remuneration will be considered at the end of the financial year.
Emmanuel Roman is a major shareholder: his shareholding at appointment to the Board was 19,529,418 shares.
Emmanuel Roman is a non-executive director of Grupo Prisa SA: he retains any fees in respect of this directorship.
98 Man Group plc Annual Report 2011 Remuneration Report continued Base salary and benefits Salaries are reviewed annually taking into account market benchmarks for executives of comparable status, responsibility and skill.
Salaries were reviewed but, for the third year, there was no increase.
Base Salary at Peter Clarke Kevin Hayes 1 April 2010 $925,000 $625,000 1 April 2011 $925,000 $625,000 The US dollar is the functional currency of the Company and with effect from 1 June 2008 the directors salaries were set in US dollars: this was the date of the last base salary increase.
Annual performance bonus and deferral All executive directors and senior executives are eligible for an annual performance bonus, which is non-pensionable.
Although the Remuneration Committee does not consider it appropriate to establish any maximum percentage of base salary payable by way of performance bonus, bonuses for employees including executive directors are determined by reference to the pre-tax profit after making certain adjustments, including a charge for the surplus capital held by the Group.
Executive directors are awarded bonuses from the same bonus pool as employees which is subject to the governance and risk management set out in the employee section.
To harmonise with the new accounting cycle and the rest of the Company, the executive directors had a nine month performance evaluation and bonus period ended 31 December 2010.
Performance bonuses for executive directors are discretionary.
In considering the appropriate level of bonus for each director, the Remuneration Committee considers: a Strategy assessment measured by the extent to which the individual has contributed towards achievement of Company strategic objectives: b Financial assessment measured by the extent to which the Group has achieved its financial targets: and c Qualitative assessment measured by the extent to which the individual has achieved their agreed personal objectives for the year.
In our 2010 Annual Report, we set out five strategic priorities for the firm in the 2011 financial year.
Harness new single manager content by executing on acquisitions stakes Invest in AHL to ensure that we capture the programmes full potential Maximise Man Multi-Manager by rebuilding scale and profitability Deepen our distribution reach, specifically in onshore regulated markets and across institutions worldwide Maintain focus on efficiency by continually evaluating our cost base The Remuneration Committee, in assessing performance and the bonus, is pleased to report significant progress on all five of these priorities, and particularly on our acquisition of GLG Partners, Inc. GLG.
To align executive directors with shareholders, there is a mandatory deferral of part of the annual performance bonus into Company shares which are matched by a long term incentive award in the Performance Share Plan.
A further element of the performance bonus is deferred and awarded as options over shares with an exercise price set 10% above the market price at grant.
These have been awarded under the Deferred Bonus Share and Option Plan DBSOP.
The premium pricing ensures that a return is delivered to the shareholders before the award has value for the executive directors.
The Remuneration Committee has sought to weight the award with a smaller proportion as cash bonus and a larger proportion as mandatory deferral into shares and into options set at a 10% premium price so that executive directors have the same interests as shareholders with the quantum of payout directly reflecting share price achieved.
Information about the Deferred Bonus Share and Option Plan is below.
Deferred Bonus Share and Option Plan DBSOP DBSOP Award Restricted options have been awarded to the executive directors at 10% premium price.
Additional Information Awards under the DBSOP have a three year service condition.
The options are exercisable between 3 and 10 years from the anniversary of grant.
Options may be granted at market value or premium priced at 10% or such other percentage as the Remuneration Committee determines.
Long-term share-based incentive plans Executive directors are currently eligible to participate in the Performance Share Plan and Executive Share Option Scheme, at the Remuneration Committees discretion.
The Remuneration Committee is not aware of any listed companies of substantial size whose main business activities are comparable in nature and scale to that of Man Group, and accordingly the Remuneration Committee does not see any merit in trying to benchmark performance criteria against any other companies.
The Remuneration Committee sets performance conditions to achieve absolute returns, not relative returns, for its shareholders.
These targets are considered by the Remuneration Committee to be both challenging and appropriate given the regulated nature of the Companys business.
Man Group plc 99 Annual Report 2011 Both PSP awards and ESOS awards have the same three-year growth and returns performance measures.
There is an additional one year holding period for the PSP.
These performance conditions have been chosen as relevant to the environment in which the Company operates and to the Companys business imperatives.
The growth measure of Net Management Fee Income Growth NMFIG is a critical long-term value driver for Man.
The performance conditions vesting thresholds have been selected to be challenging but motivational in current business conditions to encourage the executive directors to deliver value to shareholders.
The performance conditions for the 2011 awards have been weighted as follows: Cumulative three-year Net Management Fee Income Growth NMFIG 75%: and Average three-year Adjusted Return on Equity AROE 25%.
Vesting Performance measure Vesting Performance measure Threshold percentage Net Management Fee Income Growth NMFIG 10% 25% 50% 100% Average three-year Adjusted Return on Equity AROE 10% 25% 25% 100% There is straight line vesting between the threshold and maximum vesting.
The performance conditions are measured on the performance achieved over a three-year period with performance metrics derived from the Company financial statements in accordance with share plan rules.
The shares and options subject to these performance conditions are set out on pages 104 to 105.
The executive directors have been made awards in the long-term share-based incentive plans below.
Long Term Incentive Plans PSP Award Each year, participants are eligible to receive awards of performance shares up to a maximum of 100% of base salary.
Additionally the PSP participants will receive PSP matching shares maximum of 1:1 match for that part of their performance bonus which is mandatorily deferred into Company shares and held for at least three years.
After vesting according to performance over three years, PSP entitlements are subject to an additional one year restriction on transfer to participants dependent upon continued employment with the Company.
ESOS Award Individual share option awards are subject to annual cap of 200% of base salary, on a face value basis.
For 2010, the executive directors were awarded ESOS options equivalent to 200% of base salary.
Options issued under the Scheme may normally only be exercised between three and ten years from the date of grant and are subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions.
Performance criteria are calculated from the end of the financial year prior to the grant of option.
No re-testing of the EPS performance targets will take place for options granted since 2005.
Accordingly, if the targets attached to any option are not reached after three years, the option will lapse.
Performance target March 2011 PSP and ESOS awards: see above performance conditions.
2009 and 2010 PSP and ESOS awards: performance-related over a three year measurement period.
For all grants in July 2009 and June 2010 there is no vesting if there is negative AROE.
Vesting commences at 8% where there is positive AROE and NMFIG is 10% or above.
Vesting increases incrementally with full vesting achieved where i NMFIG is at least 30% and AROE is at least 10%: or ii NMFIG is at least 20% and AROE is at least 30% with incremental vesting between these thresholds.
Outstanding PSP awards to June 2008: performance conditions, are on the level of post-tax return on average shareholders funds Return on Equity achieved by the Group throughout the three year performance period.
No award will be transferred unless the Group maintains an average annual Return on Equity of at least 20% across the performance period.
For an average annual Return on Equity of 20%, 10% of the shares vest.
Award shares will be transferred at levels above this on a linear sliding scale.
Full benefits of an award can only be transferred when annual Return on Equity has averaged 30% or more.
Outstanding ESOS awards to June 2008: 50% of each option will continue to vest if the Companys underlying earnings per share EPS growth in the single three year performance period matches or exceeds the growth in RPI plus 5% per annum, with the entire option vesting at RPI plus 10% per annum.

Share ownership requirements The Chief Executive is required to maintain a shareholding of 200% of base salary.
The Finance Director is required to maintain a shareholding of 100% of base salary.
Vested PSP and ESOS can be taken into account in applying this test but unvested awards are not eligible for inclusion.
Executive directors are required to build up this shareholding on joining the Board or after a reduction in share price as share and option plan awards vest.
The executive directors meet these requirements.
Non-executive directors are encouraged to build a shareholding.
The shareholdings of directors are set out on page 106.
Man Group has always sought to facilitate significant share ownership by directors and senior management, principally through plans which encourage and assist the purchase of shares with their own funds or by way of bonus deferral.
The Board and employees worldwide together own an estimated 11.3% of the Companys share capital, either directly or through employee trusts established and funded for this purpose.
The Board alone directly holds 0.45% of the issued capital.
The Employee Trusts are included in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Non-executive directors fees and terms of appointment The fees of the non-executive directors are determined by the Board within the limits agreed by shareholders and set out in the Articles of Association.
