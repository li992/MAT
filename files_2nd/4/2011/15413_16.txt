2 In accordance with the special arrangements that were put in place to facilitate his recruitment, the Chief Executives award level is set at 300% of base salary, with 25% vesting at threshold performance.

Cash The number of days between Measures whether the business is 6.5% 14.6% conversion disbursement of cash and collection managing its working capital and cycle CCC of cash, taking account of inventory, converting profit into cash effectively.
1 For bonus purposes all three metrics are measured on the basis of constant exchange rates and subject to adjustments reviewed and approved by the Committee to ensure that the results are a true reflection of the actual performance.
Performance is assessed on the Groups continuing operations.
2 The effective factor weighting at maximum bonus is calculated by reference to the difference in the multipliers that apply to achieve maximum bonus versus those at threshold, calculating the relative weight of these increments.
The CCC metric is based on a straight average of the four quarter ending numbers i. e. at 30June2010, 30September2010, 31December2010 and 31 March 2011 to avoid a focus purely on the year-end numbers which may be distorted and not reflect underlying working capital and cash management performance throughout the year.
For each performance factor there is a corresponding multiplier at the threshold, target and stretch level of performance, and sliding scales between them.
How the multiplier works Target bonus PBTEA Net sales Cash Bonus % of base salary performance less cost of conversion achieved multiplier raw materials cycle as % of Chief Executive performance performance base salary 75% multiplier multiplier Chief Financial Officer 50% Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 The multipliers for the PBTEA factor are more heavily geared than for the other two factors, reflecting the fact that PBTEA is the most important of the three metrics.
Before any bonus is payable, a minimum level of profit has to be achieved, regardless of the level of performance in the net sales less cost of raw materials and cash conversion cycle metrics.
To achieve the maximum payout, performance against all three factors must be at the stretch level.
The multipliers are predetermined by the Committee and the relative weightings reflect the importance of each of the metrics for the coming year in the context of the progress made against the overall long-term strategy.
Once the performance outcome is known for each metric, the relevant multiplier is calculated for each.
The target bonus is then adjusted by each of the multipliers to arrive at the final bonus outcome.

For the award made in 2008 under the PSP, the Committee considers that the underlying financial performance of Tate & Lyle over the performance period does justify the participants receiving their shares.
Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2011 49 3-year TSR % Financial statements Governance Business review Shareholder information Governance Directors remuneration report Performance conditions 2010 awards The number of shares a participant ultimately receives depends on the Groups performance during the three-year performance period beginning on 1 April in the year of the award.
For the 2010 awards, the performance conditions comprised two elements: a Adjusted diluted Earnings Per Share EPS 50% of total award Performance is measured by comparing the compound annual growth rate CAGR of the Companys adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations over the three-year performance period against predetermined targets.
The Committee selected this metric as it is a key determinant of shareholder value creation.
b Adjusted Return On Capital Employed ROCE 50% of the total award Performance is measured by the adjusted ROCE on continuing operations achieved at the end of the three-year performance period against the predetermined targets.
The original targets of 13.0% at threshold and 16.0% at maximum vesting, as disclosed in the Notice of Meeting for the 2010 annual general meeting, were revised following the sale of EU Sugars on 30 September 2010 to 13.4% and 16.4% respectively, in each case representing an increase of 100 basis points and 400 basis points, respectively, relative to the adjusted ROCE which was also revised on a like for like basis, achieved in the year ended 31March 2010.
The Committee selected this metric as it is a good indicator of the effectiveness of strategic investment decisions and of the quality of earnings generated.
Importantly the ROCE outcome is adjusted downward by adding back any asset impairments into capital employed: this is to encourage a prudent investment strategy.
For this reason, in the event of there being an impairment of assets, the ROCE figure for PSP purposes can be significantly lower than the unadjusted ROCE number reported in the Companys accounts.
The two metrics referred to above provide better line of sight for participants than relative TSR, as Tate&Lyle has few, if any, directly comparable peers that can be used to create a peer group.
Shares awarded under the PSP in 2010 vest in accordance with the following schedule: CAGR of adjusted diluted EPS Adjusted ROCE at end of during the performance period performance period Percentage of award vesting 50% of award 50% of award 0% Below 6% Below 13.4% 1 15% 6% 13.4% On a straight line between 15% and 100% Between 6% and 15% Between 13.4% and 16.4% 100% 15% or more At 16.4% or above 1 In accordance with the special arrangements that were put in place to facilitate the Chief Executives recruitment, 25% of his award vests at threshold performance.
There is no retesting of the performance conditions.
Before any shares become eligible for release, the Committee must also be satisfied that this is justified by the underlying financial performance of the Group over the measurement period.
Subject to the Committees approval, the conditional award is then converted into a nil-cost option to acquire the appropriate number of shares.
Deferred Bonus Share Plan DBSP suspended scheme Awards were made under the DBSP from 2005 to 2008, and it was suspended in 2009.
Under the DBSP, executives had the opportunity to defer up to 50% of their annual cash bonus after deduction of tax, national insurance or other social security payments and invest the amount deferred in the Companys shares.
Subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition over the performance period, participants received awards of matching shares based on the number of shares which could have been acquired from the gross bonus amount deferred by the participant lodged shares.
The performance conditions attached to past awards is the same as that attached to PSP awards made in the same year.
The performance conditions attached to the PSP awards made in 2008 are described on page 49.
Accordingly, 88% of the maximum matching shares available under the DBSP conditional award in 2008 is eligible for release.
Change of control and voting All of the Companys share plans contain provisions relating to a change of control.
Outstanding awards and options would normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions at that time, and in proportion to the time served during the performance period.
50 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2011 Executive shareholding policy The Committee monitors the policy annually.
The Chief Executive has met his shareholding target of four times base salary, to be acquired by 1 October 2014.
The Chief Financial Officer has a target shareholding of three times base salary by 22 July 2015.
Sharesave Scheme The Scheme is open to all employees in the UK, including executive directors.
No performance conditions are attached to options granted under the Scheme since it is an all-employee scheme, and the value of individual grants is capped.
Options granted to participants are normally set at a discount of 10% to the market value of the shares at the time of the grant.
Dilution To satisfy options granted under the 1992 Executive Share Option Scheme closed in July 2000 and the Sharesave Scheme, the Company issues new shares.
To satisfy outstanding awards under the 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme, PSP and DBSP matching shares, the Company uses either treasury shares or shares that have been purchased by the Trustees of the Tate & Lyle Employee Benefit Trust.
The Company will use shares that have been purchased by the Employee Benefit Trust to satisfy awards made to Javed Ahmed and any awards to be made under the Group Bonus Plan.
In the ten-year period to 31 March 2011, awards made under the executive schemes represented 0.71% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital 2010 1.6%, leaving available dilution headroom of 4.29% 2010 3.4%.
Awards made under all share schemes represented 1.1% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital 2010 3.0% leaving available dilution headroom of 8.9% 2010 7.0%.
Pensions The Groups largest pension scheme is the UK-based Tate & Lyle Group Pension Scheme Group Scheme, a defined benefit arrangement.
The Company closed the Group Scheme to new entrants from 1 April 2002, and, since then, new employees have been offered defined-contribution type pension provision through a Stakeholder Plan, which is an insurance-based contract.
The Group Scheme closed to future final salary pension accrual from 6 April 2011 and the employee members have been offered membership of the existing Stakeholder plan.
Javed Ahmed is not a member of the Group Scheme for pension purposes and accordingly has accrued no pension benefits under it.
He is paid a cash allowance calculated as 35% of base salary, from which he can make his own retirement savings arrangements although this may include the Company Stakeholder Plan.
He has been provided with life assurance cover and has also participated in the Group Income Protection Scheme, which applies to all UK employees who are not otherwise covered for ill-health benefits under the Group Scheme.
Tim Lodge was a member of the Group Scheme until its closure and accrued pension at a rate of approximately 1 38th of pensionable earnings basic salary only for each year of service, subject to an employee contribution of 3% of pensionable salary.
The benefit accrued includes a widows pension payable on his death and a lump sum on death in service.
Once in payment, this part of his pension and any subsequent widows pension will be subject to increases in line with price inflation up to a maximum of 5%, with a minimum of 3%.
From 6 April 2011, Tim Lodge is paid a cash allowance calculated as 25% of base salary, from which he can make his own retirement savings arrangements although this may include the Company Stakeholder Plan.
Details of the accrued pension benefits for Tim Lodge under the Group Scheme are given on page 56.
Details of amounts paid in lieu of pensions to Javed Ahmed are included in the table on page 54, under pension allowance.

Contract commencement date 1 October 2009 4 December 2008 Executive directors external appointments The Board believes that the Company benefits from executive directors holding external non-executive directorships at the appropriate time.
Such appointments are subject to approval by the Board and are normally restricted to one position for each executive director.
Fees may be retained by the executive director concerned.
Neither of the executive directors holds a non-executive directorship currently.
Chairmans fees Sir Peter Gershon became Chairman on 23 July 2009 receiving fees of 275,000 per annum which remained unchanged for the year ended 31 March 2011.
The Committee reviews the Chairmans fees each year and the Chairman does not participate in discussions or decisions relating to his own remuneration.
Following the most recent review of fees, the Remuneration Committee approved an increase in the Chairmans fees to 283,250 effective 1 April 2011.
Non-executive directors fees Non-executive directors fees, reviewed annually by the Board, are set at a level to retain individuals with the necessary experience and ability to make a substantial contribution to the Group.
Fees paid are commensurate with those paid by other UK-listed companies.
In addition to the basic fee for each non-executive director and the Senior Independent Director, supplements are paid to the Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees to reflect the extra responsibilities attached to these positions.
A supplement is also paid to Dr Barry Zoumas for chairing the Tate & Lyle Research Advisory Group.
The non-executive directors do not participate in the Groups incentive or pension schemes, nor do they receive other benefits.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts or notice periods, but, under the terms of their appointment, they are usually expected to serve on the Board for between three and nine years, with a review of their terms of appointment every three years, subject to their re-election by shareholders.
Non-executive directors have no right to compensation on the early termination of their appointment.
52 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2011 The Chairman and the Deputy Company Secretary undertook a detailed review of the actual and anticipated time commitments of each of the non-executive directors excluding the Chairman.
The analysis indicated that the time commitments for non-executive directors were well in excess of the time commitment indicated in their appointment letters.
A review of market data provided by HNBS indicated that the current basic fee level was significantly below the market median for companies of similar size and complexity to Tate & Lyle.
Taking account of the current market position, and the increased time commitment required of the non-executive directors, the executive directors and the Chairman agreed that an adjustment to non-executive directors fees be made with effect from 1 April 2011.
The fees are shown in the following table.
Basic fees per annum At 1 April 2011 At 1 April 2010 Non-executive director 58 000 49 200 Senior Independent Director 64 650 55 850 Supplemental fees per annum At 1 April 2011 At 1 April 2010 Chairman of Audit Committee 15 375 15 375 Chairman of Remuneration Committee 10 250 10 250 Chairman of Research Advisory Group 21 525 21 525 Executive directors total remuneration package for the year ended 31 March 2011 The following tables show the remuneration package of the executive directors for the year ended 31 March 2011.

2 Actual annual bonus earned in respect of 2011 and LTI vesting of 81% following year-end 31 March 2011, which are valued using the closing share price on 31 March 2011.
In the case of Tim Lodge, his PSP award, which will convert into a deferred right to acquire the appropriate number of Tate & Lyle PLC shares at the end of a one year retention period subject to service conditions, represents 150,658 and the DBSP 34,350, representing the matching component of shares awarded in 2008.
3 Relates to special incentive arrangements upon recruitment to compensate for LTI awards foregone as a result of leaving his former employer.
4 The portion of bonus that exceeds 100% of base salary is deferred into Tate & Lyle PLC shares for two years.
5 Estimated value of defined benefit pension accrual has been calculated taking account of the accrual rate, salary increase effective 1 April 2010, pensionable service and the HMRC valuation factor.
6 As of 6 April 2011, the Group Pension Scheme closed to future accrual.
Tim Lodge, who was a member of the Scheme, now receives 25% of base salary as a cash allowance and no longer accrues a defined benefit pension.

2 This award to compensate Javed Ahmed for certain long-term incentives given up by him as a consequence of leaving his former employer is not subject to performance conditions.
The shares will be delivered on 1 October 2011, being the second anniversary of Javed Ahmed joining the Company.
Pending delivery, he receives a payment in lieu of dividend on these shares which will be subject to the deduction of tax.
In the event of a change of control, the shares will be delivered immediately.
3 This award is subject to the same performance condition as that which applies to awards made under the PSP in 2008.
4 This award is subject to the same performance condition as that which applies to awards made under the PSP in 2009.
5 This award is subject to the same performance condition as that which applies to awards made under the PSP in 2010.
6 The three-year performance period for all awards begins on the first day of the financial year in which the award is granted.
7 On 1 April 2011, 100% of the conditional awards made in 2007 lapsed because performance conditions were not met.
8 This was the last year in which awards were made under the DBSP prior to suspension of the arrangement with the performance conditions the same as those applying to the 2008 PSP.
The vesting will be determined based on TSR during the three-year performance period against companies positioned 50 to 130 of the FTSE index at the start of the performance period such that one matching share is awarded for each lodged share for median performance increasing on a pro-rata basis to two match shares for upper quartile performance.
As indicated on page 50, the TSR performance resulted in 88% of the maximum matching shares available under the award vesting.
