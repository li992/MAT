Remuneration Report 29 29 This report contains the information required by Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Group Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 and the relevant parts of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
The Board of Directors reports that the Company has complied with these regulations throughout the year under review.
INFORMATION NOT SUBJECT TO AUDIT Introduction and overview of the year The primary objective of the Remuneration Committee is to ensure that the remuneration paid to NEXTs senior executives is appropriate in both amount and structure.
The Committee believes that remuneration structures must be established to reward fairly personal and collective performance by employees at all levels across the Group.
This is an essential element in retaining and incentivising NEXTs staff, particularly those critical to delivering value for shareholders.
The Committee is particularly concerned that remuneration structures across the Group are consistent with, and support, NEXTs primary financial objective of delivering sustainable long term growth in earnings per share EPS.
Accordingly, the Committee pays careful attention to balancing shareholder returns with the level of remuneration paid to executive directors and senior management to ensure that there is both a strong alignment of management with shareholder interests and also an appropriate balance between incentives for annual performance and those for longer term growth.
This is achieved through a remuneration strategy which splits rewardsto management between basic salary and benefits, annual bonus and longer-term schemes.
The various incentive schemes are structured to include absolute EPS growth and relative total shareholder return targets, and comprise both cash-based and equity-based awards.
Over the previous two years the Committee made a number of significant changes to executive remuneration structures.
These changes included the cessation of the risk reward investment plan, the introduction of an annual share matching plan SMP and the re-phasing of long term incentive plan LTIP awards from an annual to a semi-annual basis.
The Committee considered whether further modifications to the overall structure for remuneration might be appropriate but concluded the reshaped arrangements were delivering the right incentives for executive directors and senior management.
No structural changes will therefore be made for the 2011 12 year.
New targets have been set for annual bonus and SMP which the Committee considers will be appropriately stretching.
At the same time the Committee determined that increases in basic salaries should continue to be kept to modest levels generally to around 1% in each of the two previous years and 1.2% for the current year.
During the year the Committee reviewed againwhether it remained appropriate to continue to use EPS as the basis for annual bonus or to include some other metrics, such as non-financial and personal targets.
After careful consideration the Committee concluded that EPS remained the most appropriate performance measure.
In reaching this conclusion the Committee particularly noted: n NEXT continues to be predominantly a single business selling products under the NEXT brand.
It is not a conglomerate or mixed brand retailer with uncorrelated revenue or profit streams.
Using a common financial measure reinforces the strengths of a team effort, whereas applying individual or non-financial targets could undermine the focus on collective Group performance.
The Committee also believes there is a danger that applying non-financial or qualitative targets might lead to bonuses being paid when there is no financial justification: n EPS has been consistently applied for many years as the core financial objective of the Group.
The achievement of sustainable long term EPS growth continues to be, in the Committees view, the best indication of the growth in long term shareholder value.
EPS growth has been enhanced over the last 11 years by a long term strategy of returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks.
All share buybacks are subject to advance Board approval and are only undertaken after the Board is satisfied that the ability of the Group to invest in the growth of business and to continue to grow the annual dividend would not be prejudiced: n the use of EPS as the basis for calculating executive directors annual bonuses and as a performance threshold for the SMP is complemented by the use of total shareholder return relative to the Groups competitors in determining any vesting under the LTIP.
NEXT has achieved record pre-tax profits and EPS in the year to January 2011, despite the challenges arising from the UKs economic situation.
All financial targets set by the Committee were met or exceeded and the Committee determined that it was appropriate that the executive directors achieved their maximum annual bonus potential.
indd 29 11 04 2011 11:02:36 Governance Remuneration Report 30 With regard to the year to January 2012, the Committee has determined the following: n an overall salary increase across the Group, including executive directors, of 1.2%: n continuation of annual bonus arrangements, save that a higher performance condition has been set by the Committee.
Details of the EPS growth target set by the Committee will be disclosed in next years Remuneration Report: n a continuation of the semi-annual LTIP programme, with awards being made in March and September after the announcement of NEXTs annual and interim results: n as last year, a further opportunity for executive directors and selected senior employees to participate in the SMP.
The Committee reviewed the level of fully diluted EPS targets to be applied to the 2010 SMP awards and, as set out on page 32, has determined that, notwithstanding the achievement of record profits and EPS, higher EPS targets should be set for awards made in 2011.
Further details of each of the components of the directors remuneration are given in the report below.
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE Members of the Remuneration Committee During the year the Committee comprised of the following independent non-executive directors: Jonathan Dawson Committee Chairman Steve Barber John Barton Nick Brookes until 18 May 2010 Christine Cross Francis Salway from 1 June 2010.
The Committee met four times during the year under review and all meetings were fully attended.
Role of Remuneration Committee The Committee determines the remuneration of the Groups Chairman and executive directors, and reviews that of senior executives.
It is also responsible for determining the targets for any performance related pay schemes operated by the Company, approves any award of the Companys shares under share option or incentive schemes to the Companys employees and oversees any major changes in employee benefit structures throughout the Group.
The Committee members have no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no director is permitted to be involved in any decisions as to his or her own remuneration.
The remuneration of non-executive directors is decided by the executive directors of the Board.
The Committees terms of reference are available on the Companys website www.
co. uk or on request from the Company Secretary.
Assistance to the Committee During the period under review the Committee received input from the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director and retained the services of Aon Hewitt to provide independent external guidance regarding executive remuneration.
Aon Hewitt also provide the Board of the Trustee to the NEXT Group Pension Plan with investment advice.
 provided independent verification services of total shareholder returns for NEXT and the comparator group of companies under the NEXT LTIP.
Remuneration policy The remuneration packages of directors are reviewed by the Committee at least annually on the same basis as other employees of the Group.
The review takes into account market practice and performance of the individual and of the business.
Other factors taken into account include the experience and responsibility of the individuals concerned, together with the Groups wider pay structures.
In particular, pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group are considered by the Committee to ensure that any differences in the pay and employment conditions of directors are justified.
From time to time, the Committee commissions benchmarking exercises by independent consultants covering all aspects of directors remuneration including share incentives and other performance related reward plans.
The Committee also receives information from various independent sources on directors remuneration and draws on members experience from other Board positions.
The components of the Groups remuneration packages and directors service contract information are detailed below.

indd 30 11 04 2011 11:02:37 Remuneration Report 31 31 Remuneration is structured with the objective that no single component or measure dominates and that interests are aligned over different time periods with other employees and shareholders.
Remuneration policy does not conflict with the Companys approach to environmental, social and corporate governance matters and the Committee believes that the current arrangements do not encourage directors to take undue business risks.
Packages include basic salary, annual bonus based on pre-tax EPS, a long term incentive plan based on total shareholder return TSR, a share matching plan based on fully diluted post-tax EPS and participation in NEXTs Group pension plan.
Board remuneration packages Salary Directors salaries are set by reference to those prevailing in the market, particularly within other major retail companies, and according to individual performance, experience and responsibility.
Where appropriate, merit increases are awarded.
With effect from 1 February 2011 an annual salary increase of 1.2% was awarded to executive directors, in line with the wider Company award.
Annual performance related bonus The executive directors participate in an annual performance related bonus scheme which is based on pre-tax EPS targets set annually by the Committee.
These targets are set taking account of a range of factors, including consensus analysts profit forecasts, the Companys own internal budgets for the relevant period and the wider background of the UK economy.
Whilst Company forecasts are not disclosed in advance for reasons of commercial sensitivity, the targets and performance against them will be disclosed in the relevant years Remuneration Report.
For the year to January 2011, performance targets were set requiring pre-tax EPS of 277 pence before any bonus became payable.
A maximum bonus of 150% of salary in the case of the Chief Executive and 100% of salary for the other executive directors was payable if pre-tax EPS exceeded 300 pence.
A sliding scale of payments operated for performance between these minimum and maximum levels.
Based on the 16.4% increase in pre-tax EPS of 305 pence per share the maximum level of annual bonus was earned.
In the case of the Chief Executive, any annual bonus in excess of 100% of basic salary is payable in shares, deferred for a period of two years and will be forfeited if he voluntarily resigns prior to the end of that period.
Long term incentive plan From 2008 the Remuneration Committee adopted a semi-annual, rather than annual, grant policy.
The Chief Executive, other executive directors and senior management receive grants of 100%, 75% and 60% of basic annual salary respectively every six months in or around March and September each year, i. e. they are able to receive awards of up to 200%, 150% and 120% of basic salary annually.
In recognition of the strategic importance of his product skills to the Group, annual LTIP awards for Christos Angelides were increased from 150% of salary to 250% p. a. for each of the four performance periods ending July 2012 through to January 2014.
No equivalent increase for other executive directors was made.
Under the plan, performance is measured over periods of three years, which commence in February and August each year, by comparing TSR against approximately 20 other UK listed retail companies.
If no entitlement has been earned at the end of a three year performance period then the award for that period will lapse and there is no retesting.
Awards made for all periods starting on or before January 2008 have now either vested or lapsed.
For periods from August 2008 onwards, before allowing any of the awards to vest, the Remuneration Committee must have regard to the performance of the Company in light of underlying economic and other circumstances, including EPS performance of the Company and of other UK retailers over the period.
Whilst not disclosed in advance, the factors taken into account in determining the awards will be disclosed in the relevant years Remuneration Report.
The comparator group of companies for the three year performance periods to January and July 2011 was as follows: Burberry Findel Kesa N Brown Carpetright French Connection Kingfisher Signet Carphone Warehouse Home Retail Group Marks & Spencer Tesco Debenhams JJB Sports Morrisons W H Smith Dixons Retail J Sainsbury Mothercare Woolworths For periods ending January 2012 to January 2013, ASOS, Halfords and HMV have been added to the comparator group and Woolworths removed.
For periods ending July 2013 onwards Ted Baker has been added to the comparator group and Findel, French Connection and JJB Sports removed.
indd 31 11 04 2011 11:02:38 Governance Remuneration Report 32 The Committee considers that the comparator group consists of UK listed retail companies which are most comparable with NEXT in size and or nature of their business and believes that comparison against such a group of companies is more likely to reflect the Companys relative performance against its peers, thereby resulting in awards being made on an appropriate basis.
If TSR is below the median ranking company in the comparator group there will be no entitlement to any of the award.
Median performance earns an entitlement to 20% of the maximum award.
For performance above the median the entitlement will rise, with the maximum award being earned for performance which places the Company at or above the upper quintile in the comparator group.
Performance against the relative TSR performance targets is calculated by .
The maximum aggregate annual award allowed under the current rules of the plan is 200% of basic salary 300% in exceptional circumstances.
Details of potential awards granted for outstanding performance periods are as follows: Maximum potential award granted % of basic salary Simon Christos David Andrew Other Performance periods commencing Wolfson Angelides Keens Varley employees August 2008 100% 75% 75% 75% 60% February 2009 100% 75% 75% 75% 60% August 2009 100% 125% 75% 75% 60% February 2010 100% 125% 75% 75% 60% August 2010 100% 125% 75% 75% 60% The Committee has discretion as to whether entitlements earned are payable in NEXT shares or cash and to date it has allowed participants the choice.
Entitlements earned are not pensionable and are based on salary and share price at the start of the performance period.
No individuals included in the plan have received grants under the management share option scheme in the same year.
Share matching plan The share matching plan SMP was approved by shareholders at the 2010 AGM and awards made for the first time in June 2010, details of which are given below.
Under the SMP selected senior executives including the four executive directors are able to invest part or all of their annual bonus in NEXT shares Investment Shares and in return they receive a conditional award of Matching Shares Matching Shares.
Investment Shares may be purchased out of the cash element of the annual bonus which, for executive directors, is currently capped at 100% of salary.
Deferred shares i. e. any compulsory deferral element of the annual bonus, which currently only applies to the Chief Executive do not count as Investment Shares.
Participants will be eligible to receive a maximum matching award of 2 Matching Shares for every 1 Investment Share calculated on the value of gross bonus used to acquire their Investment Shares, with a minimum of 0.5 Matching Shares subject to the achievement of a pre-determined performance threshold.
Vesting of matching awards will be subject to remaining in employment, the achievement of 3-year performance targets and the retention of Investment Shares.
The scheme will contain the ability to grant a higher matching ratio of up to 3:1 if the Committee considers it appropriate.
In practice, the Committee intends to operate the SMP with a maximum 2:1 match and will consult with major shareholders before any higher award is made.
Vesting of the awards made in June 2010 is dependent solely on achieving fully diluted post-tax EPS targets for the year ending January 2013.
The threshold level of vesting will require fully diluted EPS of 191.5 pence for the year to January 2013, a match of 1:1 will be earned for fully diluted EPS of 206.5 pence and fully diluted EPS of 221.5 pence will be required to achieve the maximum 2:1 match with straight-line vesting between each of the threshold points.
Details of the basis of calculation of fully diluted EPS are provided in Note 8.
The Committee has determined that, for the year to January 2014, there should be a fully diluted EPS hurdle of 231.3 pence for the minimum 0.5:1 match to vest.
The maximum 2:1 match would be achieved if fully diluted EPS for that year is at least 258.1 pence, with vesting calculated on a straight-line basis for EPS falling across the range.
The minimum threshold requires fully diluted EPS growth of 12% and the maximum match requires growth of 25% over the three years.
The Committee is able to set different performance measures and targets for future awards but will consult with major shareholders before applying targets which, in its view, are less demanding in the circumstances than these conditions.
indd 32 11 04 2011 11:02:39 Remuneration Report 33 33 Management share options The management share option plan provides for options over shares, exercisable between three and ten years following their grant, to be allocated to Group employees at the discretion of the Committee.
This plan is primarily aimed at middle management and senior store staff.
No options were granted to any directors or changes made to existing entitlements in the year under review.
No employee is entitled to be granted options under the scheme and be included in NEXTs LTIP or the SMP in the same year.
The total number of options which can be granted is subject to shareholder approved limits and there are no cash settlement alternatives.
Options are set at the prevailing market price at the time of grant.
The maximum total market value of shares i. e. the acquisition price of shares over which options may be granted to any person during any financial year of the Company is three times salary, excluding bonuses and benefits in kind.
This limit may be increased to five times salary in circumstances considered by the Committee to be exceptional, for example on the grant of options following recruitment.
Grants are generally made annually.
The exercise of options is subject to a performance condition.
If the performance condition for any option grant is not met at three years from the date of grant, the options lapse.
For the April 2008, April 2010 and April 2011 awards the condition requires the percentage growth in the Groups post-tax EPS over a three year period to exceed RPI plus a further 3% per annum.
In the light of economic circumstances at that time, the Committee determined in 2009 that an EPS growth related performance condition was not appropriate.
Instead, a specific minimum EPS performance condition of 133p is required for the year to January 2012 if the April 2009 option grant is to vest.
Sharesave options Executive directors can participate in the Companys Save As You Earn SAYE scheme which is open to all employees.
Invitations to participate are generally issued annually and the scheme is subject to HMRC rules which limit the maximum monthly savings to 250.
Options are granted at the prevailing market rate less a discount of 20% and are exercisable three, five or seven years from the date of grant.
Sharesave options granted to, or exercised by, directors in the year under review are detailed on page 39.
Dilution of share capital by employee share plans The Company monitors and has complied with dilution limits in its various share scheme rules and has not issued a significant number of new or treasury shares in satisfaction of share schemes in the last 10 years.
Currently, share based incentives are generally satisfied from shares held by the ESOT see Note 27.
The Committee may recommend further share purchases be made by the ESOT to satisfy outstanding and future option grants.
The Board has also approved in principle the use of market purchases into treasury where necessary for the future settlement of these obligations.
Group pension plan Executive directors are eligible for membership of the NEXT Group Pension Plan the Plan which has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs and consists of defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The trustee of the Plan is a limited company, NEXT Pension Trustees Limited the Trustee.
The Board of the Trustee includes members of the Plan, a pensioner member and an independent director who is also the Chairman of the Trustee.
Two of the directors are member nominated directors and cannot be removed by NEXT: the other directors, including the independent director, are appointed by and can be removed by NEXT.
All directors of the Trustee receive a fee for their services, including those directors who are also employees of NEXT.
No director of the Company is a director of the Trustee.
The Plans investments are kept separate from the business affairs of the NEXT Group and the Trustee holds them in trust.
Responsibility for investment of the Plans funds has been delegated by the Trustee to professional investment managers.
From October 2008 the Group initiated a salary sacrifice scheme whereby members from either section can elect to receive a reduced gross salary in exchange for enhanced employer pension contributions.
The participation of members in the salary sacrifice scheme does not result in any overall increase in costs to the Group.
Defined contribution section Employees of the Group can join the defined contribution section of the Plan.
Members elect to pay either 3% or 5% of their pensionable earnings which is matched by the Company.
For death prior to retirement, a lump sum of three times the members basic salary at the previous April is payable along with the current value of the members fund.
indd 33 11 04 2011 11:02:39 Governance Remuneration Report 34 Defined benefit section The defined benefit section of the Plan was closed to new members in 2000 but continues for the benefit of existing members.
This section provides members with a retirement benefit of one sixtieth or one eightieth depending on the members chosen contribution rate of final pensionable earnings for each year of pensionable service.
This section also provides a lump sum death in service benefit and dependants pensions on death in service or following retirement.
Childrens pensions are only payable on death in service.
In the case of ill-health retirement only the accrued pension is payable.
All benefits are subject to Plan limits.
Increases to pensions in payment are at the discretion of the Trustee although pensionable service post-1997 is subject to limited price indexation.
For all current members, pensionable earnings are composed of basic pay, overtime and, prior to 1 October 2006, annual performance bonuses.
No other items of remuneration are taken into account.
From 1 October 2006, sales and profit related bonuses are no longer taken into account and the normal retirement age under the Plan was increased from 60 to 65.
Members contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings, whilst the Company currently makes contributions at the rate of 17.5%.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit sections financial position was undertaken as at 31 March 2010.
Adjusting the results as at 31 March 2010 for the subsequent buy-in transaction described more fully in Note 21 resulted in a fully funded position on an actuarial basis.
The Company and the Trustees of the Plan have agreed that no further special contributions are required at this time.
As calculated in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, the surplus in the Plan at 29 January 2011 was 55.7m: further details are given in Note 21 to the financial statements.
Certain members whose accrued or projected pension fund value exceeds their personal lifetime allowance are provided with benefits through an unfunded, unapproved arrangement where they so elect.
The relevant members contribute towards the additional cost of providing these benefits by paying 5% of pensionable earnings into the Plan.
Specific information in respect of executive directors pension entitlements is detailed on page 40.
Other benefits Executive directors receive benefits which may include the provision of a fully expensed company car or cash alternative, private medical insurance, annual subscriptions to appropriate professional bodies and staff discount when purchasing the Groups merchandise.
Other employees are also eligible for certain of these benefits.
Non-executive directors receive a discount when purchasing the Groups merchandise but do not participate in any of the Groups bonus, pension, share option or other incentive schemes.
Service contracts Executive directors Each of the executive directors has a rolling service contract which commenced on 1 February 2009 and which is terminable by the Company on giving one years notice.
The Company has reserved the right to make a payment in lieu of notice on termination of an executive directors contract.
If notice of termination is given immediately following a change of control of the Company, the executive director may request the immediate termination of his contract and a payment of liquidated damages from the Company equal to the value of his basic salary and benefits in kind.
In the event of any termination payment being made to a director, the Committee will take full account of that directors duty to mitigate any loss and where appropriate the Committee may seek independent professional advice prior to authorising such payment.
Apart from service contracts no director has had any material interest in any contract with the Company or its subsidiaries.
Non-executive directors Remuneration of the non-executive directors of the Company is determined by the Chairman and the executive directors.
Remuneration consists of a basic fee for services in connection with Board and Board Committee meetings 50,000 per annum from 1 January 2011.
Additional fees of 10,000 per annum are paid for the roles of Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, Chairman of the Audit Committee and Senior Independent Non-executive Director.

indd 39 11 04 2011 11:02:41 Governance Remuneration Report 40 Directors pension entitlements All executive directors are members of the defined benefit section of the NEXT Group Pension Plan.
Directors and some senior managers receive an enhancement from the Plan, increasing the accrual of their retirement benefit up to two thirds of their final pensionable earnings on completion of 20 years pensionable service at age 65 and the lump sum payable is enhanced to four times pensionable salary.
Pension entitlements of the executive directors who held office during the year are as follows: Change in accrued Transfer Change in Change in annual value transfer Years of Accrued accrued pension of accrued value less Age at pensionannual annual net of annual pension directors January able pension pension inflation 2011 2010 contributions 2011 service 000 000 000 000 000 000 Simon Wolfson 43 16 268 18 11 3,050 2,693 323 Christos Angelides 47 18 240 21 14 3,438 2,970 443 David Keens 57 24 180 13 7 3,923 3,465 435 Andrew Varley 60 24 69 63 67 1,778 3,168 1,390 Years of pensionable service shown above may include bought in service from the transfer of other pension entitlements into the Plan.
Simon Wolfson and Christos Angelides have elected to join the unfunded, unapproved pension arrangement and the accrued annual pension and transfer value set out above includes their membership of that arrangement.
Andrew Varley ceased to contribute to the Plan from 31 October 2008.
At this date he became a deferred member of the Plan and stopped accruing pensionable service.
His pension is therefore no longer linked to salary, but will instead be increased in line with statutory deferred revaluation.
His accrued annual pension and transfer value has reduced as a result of his divorce.
Directors pension arrangements are subject to the same actuarial reduction as other employees on termination or early retirement.
