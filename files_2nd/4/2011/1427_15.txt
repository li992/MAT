Directors pensions The Remuneration committee aims to ensure that retirement benefits are in line with best practice standards adopted by major companies in continental Europe and the United Kingdom.
The Company provides a final salary, defined benefit arrangement for executives who were employed before the scheme was closed to new entrants in October 2002.
Executives employed after this date benefit from defined contribution arrangements.
Both schemes are designed to provide retirement benefits of around two thirds of final pensionable salary at normal retirement age and are HM Revenue & Customs HMRC approved.
Over the past year the Remuneration committee has been following governmental proposals relating to the taxation of pensions and the potential impact that any proposals will have on high earners.
Having reviewed the situation, the Company has now introduced flexible accrual and contribution options to enable executives to mitigate their tax liabilities.
The executive directors were both members of the defined benefit scheme, but opted out of this scheme on 5 April 2006, and since then have earned benefits in the Employer Financed Retirement Benefit Scheme EFRBS.
The EFRBS is unregistered, but is designed to broadly mirror the provisions of the final salary, defined benefit arrangements.

Companys financial results At close of business on 16 September 2011, the last trading day before the end of the financial year, the market value of the Companys ordinary shares was 1118p.
During the previous 12 months the price ranged from 940p to 1182p.
Performance review The performance graph illustrates the performance of the Company over the past five years from September 2006 to September 2011, in terms of total shareholder return compared with that of the companies comprising the FTSE 100 index.
This index has been selected because it represents a cross-section of leading UK companies.
Directors service contracts It is the Companys policy that all executive directors have rolling contracts with 12-month notice periods and that, with the exception of Galen Weston, all non-executive directors have rolling contracts with 6-month notice periods.
The board has not considered it appropriate to enter into a formal letter of appointment with Galen Weston in view of his relationship with the ultimate holding company of Associated British Foods plc, Wittington Investments Limited.
He receives no fees for performing his role as a non-executive director and Associated British Foodsplc does not reimburse him for any expenses incurred by him in thatrole.
The Companys Articles of Association require that all directors retire from office if they have not retired at either of the preceding two annual general meetings.
In any event, at this years AGM, all directors are standing for re-election in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code with the exception of Galen Weston, who has resigned from his role as a non-executive director of the Company effective as at the close of the 2011 annual general meeting.
Details of the contracts of service of directors who served during the year ended 17 September 2011 are set out below: Effective date Notice Notice Unexpired Date of of current period from period from portion of appointment contract Company director service contract Charles Sinclair 01.10.08 21.04.09 6 months 6 months Rolling contract George Weston 19.04.99 01.06.05 12 months 12 months Rolling contract John Bason 04.05.99 16.03.99 12 months 12 months Rolling contract Tim Clarke 03.11.04 03.11.04 6 months 6 months Rolling contract Lord Jay 01.11.06 01.11.06 6 months 6 months Rolling contract Javier Ferrn 01.11.06 01.11.06 6 months 6 months Rolling contract Peter Smith 28.02.07 28.02.07 6 months 6 months Rolling contract The Remuneration committee takes the view that the entitlement of the executive directors to 12 months notice of termination of employment is in line with the practice of many comparable companies.
Executive directors service contracts also provide for payment in lieu of notice at the Companys discretion.
The Remuneration committees aim is always to deal fairly with cases of termination whilst taking a robust line in minimising any compensation.
The Remuneration committee has given due consideration to the recommendations contained in the UK Corporate Governance Code regarding inclusion of explicit provisions in directors service contracts for compensation commitments in the event of early termination.
The Remuneration committee will continue to keep under review its current practice, which is not to include such provisions in order to enable it to respond appropriately to particular circumstances.
In such situations, the Remuneration committee will consider the appropriate use of mitigation.
