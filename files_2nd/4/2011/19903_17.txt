Highlights Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Directors remuneration report Dear shareholder The Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2011 is set out on the following pages.
The Report comprises five sections: Committee overview Remuneration policy Delivering remuneration policy Non-Executive Directors Detailed audited disclosures In preparing this Report, the Remuneration Committee has complied with the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups Accounts & Reports Regulations 2008.
The Report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance in relation to Directors remuneration.
During 2011, a significant element of the Committees work involved a full review of the Groups incentive arrangements.
Following that review, a new long-term incentive structure was developed and approved by shareholders in May 2011, that is designed to ensure that the Groups incentives are aligned to its business strategy and shareholders interests.
At the same time, the structure is designed to incentivise long-term sustainable profit growth and the creation of long-term value for shareholders.
In considering this Report, the Committee would highlight the following: a significant proportion of Executive Directors and other senior executives remuneration is dependent on the achievement of stretching performance conditions that support the creation of shareholder value 2011 bonus payments at 109% of base salary 76% of maximum for each of the Executive Directors who held office during the year are a result of the significant progress that was made during the year towards the Company achieving its strategic objectives the share ownership guideline for Executive Directors, other than the Chief Executive, has increased from 100% to 150% of base salary the guideline for the Chief Executive remains unchanged at 200% of base salary A resolution to approve the Remuneration Report will be put to shareholders at the AGM.

In addition, certain Executives, including Mark Allan Chief Executive and Nicola Yates Group HR Director, are, from time to time, invited to attend meetings of the Committee.
No individuals are involved in decisions relating to their own remuneration.
Role The primary role of the Committee is to: review, recommend and monitor the level and structure of remuneration for the Executive Directors and other senior executives approve the remuneration packages for the Executive Directors determine the balance between base pay and performance related elements of the package so as to align Directors interests with those of shareholders approve the annual bonus payments to Executive Directors The Committees terms of reference are set out on the Companys website.
Activities in 2011 The Committees activities during the year included: finalising 2010 bonus payments reviewing the base salaries of the Executive Directors for 2011 developing and agreeing, in dialogue with shareholders, a new long-term incentive plan LTIP for the Executive Directors and other senior executives setting LTIP performance targets in line with the Companys strategic plan setting annual performance targets in line with the Companys strategic plan for the 2011 bonus plan and determining the amounts potentially payable agreeing remuneration packages for new Executive Directors and termination arrangements for those individuals within the senior executive group whose employment ceased Remuneration policy The Group aims to balance the need to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and other senior executives of an appropriate calibre with the need to be cost effective, whilst at the same time rewarding exceptional performance.
The Committee has designed a remuneration policy that balances those factors, taking account of prevailing best practice, investor expectations and the level of remuneration and pay awards made generally to employees of the Group.
In addition to the above, the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors and other senior executives is based on the following key principles: a significant proportion of remuneration should be tied to the achievement of specific and stretching performance conditions that align remuneration with the creation of shareholder value and the delivery of the Groups strategic plan there should be a focus on sustained long-term performance, with performance measured over clearly specified timescales, encouraging executives to take action in line with the Groups strategic plan, using good business management principles and also managing risks individuals should be rewarded for success, but steps should be taken, within contractual obligations, to prevent rewards for failure Components of reward The reward package for Executive Directors and other senior executives consists of a combination of fixed and variable elements intended to provide motivation and reward for short, medium and long-term performance and to retain key executives over the longer term.
Each component is intended to fulfil a different function within the remuneration framework as set out in the table below: Component Function Fixed Base Salary To recognise the individuals skills and experience and to provide a competitive base reward Pension Pension Cash Allowance To provide an opportunity for executives to build up income on retirement Variable Performance Related Annual Bonus To incentivise and reward strong performance against financial and non-financial annual targets, thus delivering value to shareholders and contributing to the strategic plan Long-Term Incentives To drive sustained long-term performance that supports the creation of shareholder value Details of how these components are delivered are set out below in the section headed Delivering Remuneration Policy.

Shareholder alignment The Committee continues to recognise the importance of Executive Directors aligning their interests with shareholders through building up a significant shareholding in the Company.
Shareholding guidelines are in place that require Executive Directors to acquire a holding excluding shares held conditionally pursuant to LTIP awards, equivalent to 200% of base salary for the Chief Executive and since the adoption of the New LTIP see below, 150% of base salary for each of the other Executive Directors increased from the previous guideline of 100% of base salary.
Until the relevant shareholding levels are acquired, 50% of the annual bonus payable to the relevant Director is satisfied by an allocation of shares in the Company, which are held in its Employee Share Ownership Trust.
Subject to the Directors continued employment within the Group, such shares are transferred to the Director on the third anniversary of the original allocation.
Details of the Executive Directors current personal shareholdings are shown in the table on page 60.
Base salary Market positioning of base salary is approached on an individual basis, taking account of advice received from the Committees independent advisors on the rates of salary for similar roles in selected groups of comparable companies and the individual performance and experience of each Executive.
The aim is for base salary to be set with reference to the market median, dependent on the Committees view of individual and Group performance.
The Committee approved the following base salary increases with effect from 1 March 2012: Base salary from 1 March 2011 Base salary from 1 March 2012 Percentage to 29 February 2012 to 28 February 2013 increase Mark Allan 393,000 403,000 2.5% Joe Lister 230,000 255,000 10.9% The Committee is conscious that the percentage increase in salary for Joe Lister is significantly above the 2.5% increase across the Group.
However, Joe Lister has continued to develop into his role and, as highlighted in last years report, his salary was positioned significantly below comparable market levels.
The salary increase awarded reflects a strong individual performance in 2011 and brings him broadly in line with the market.
The salaries of Richard Simpson and Richard Smith were each set at 230,000 with effect from 1 January 2012 on appointment to the Board and will not be subject to further review until 1 March 2013.
Pension benefits The Executive Directors are either members of The UNITE Group Personal Pension scheme or receive a cash pension allowance.
With effect from January 2012, Executive Directors receive a pension contribution of 20% of salary or an equivalent cash allowance previously the contribution was 12.5% of salary.
The Executive Directors pension arrangements are set out on page 58.
Performance related annual bonus The Group operates an annual performance related bonus scheme that is designed to encourage the achievement of targeted levels of performance over the short-term and reward outstanding results.
The scheme has two elements: a corporate element and an individual element.
Under the corporate element of the scheme, Executive Directors bonuses for 2011 have been calculated by reference to performance criteria set in relation to net portfolio contribution NPC which is defined as net operating income NOI plus management fees, less financing costs, operational overheads and corporate costs, including share of joint venture overheads NPC : increases in adjusted diluted net asset value NAV : operating cash flow: customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction.
These reflect the Groups main KPIs for the year.
NPC, NAV and operating cash flow each have a weighting of 25%, whilst customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction each have weightings of 12.5%.
The corporate element of the bonus has been calculated on a sliding scale of amounts equivalent to between 50% and 120% of base salary, in accordance with which on target performance by the Group would have resulted in a corporate bonus of an amount equivalent to 75% of base salary.
The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 55 Directors remuneration report continued To determine the actual bonus payment to an Executive Director, a multiplier being the individual element of the scheme, ranging between 0.5 and 1.2 is applied against the corporate bonus.
That multiplier is determined following the Performance Development Programme review of each Executive Director which is carried out at the start and end of the year, and reflects the strength of that Directors individual performance over the course of the bonus plan year.
Applying the maximum individual multiplier of 1.2, against the maximum corporate bonus of 120% of base salary, results in a maximum annual performance related bonus opportunity of 144% of base salary.
However, bonus payments at that level would only be made subject to the achievement of extremely stretching corporate performance targets and exceptional individual performance by the relevant Director.
The performance related bonuses awarded in respect of 2011 reflect corporate bonuses calculated in accordance with the sliding scale referred to above, of 102% of base salary.
That percentage was arrived at as a result of the Group having been close to achieving its stretch targets in relation to NPC, operating cash flow and employee satisfaction: having modestly outperformed its NAV target: and having been marginally above its customer satisfaction target.
After applying their individual multipliers, actual performance related bonus payments awarded to each of Mark Allan, John Tonkiss and Joe Lister are 109% of their respective base salaries.
Mark Allan and Joe Lister, having reached their share ownership guidelines including the shares that will vest unconditionally in April 2012 pursuant to the NAV element of their 2009 LTIP awards, as shown below, will receive 100% of their bonus awards in cash.
As John Tonkiss has now left the employment of the Company, 100% of his bonus will also be paid in cash.
For the 2012 bonus scheme, performance targets have been set in relation to the same measures as applied in 2011, save that the weighting on operating cash flow which related to 25% of the 2011 corporate bonus, will be reduced to a 12.5% weighting, with the remaining 12.5% being based on an additional measure of NAV gearing net debt over equity.
Long-Term Incentives Following the Committees review of the Groups incentive structure, a new LTIP was adopted by shareholders in May 2011 the New LTIP.
The New LTIP replaces the LTIP adopted in 2005 the 2005 LTIP and is designed to better support delivery of the Groups strategic plan.
Key changes are as follows: the New LTIP is delivered through two new share plans The UNITE Group plc 2011 Performance Share Plan the PSP and The UNITE Group plc 2011 Approved Employee Share Option Scheme the ESOS the individual limit under the New LTIP is 150% of annual base salary although, in exceptional circumstance for example for new hires, awards of up to 200% of annual base salary may be made.
Awards for participants below Board level will not exceed 100% of annual base salary although the individual limit on awards under the New LTIP is an increase on the 100% of annual base salary under the 2005 LTIP, the increase has been accompanied by more demanding performance targets, resulting in an increase in the fair value of approximately 4% of the overall long-term incentive opportunity.
However, the New LTIP offers a greater incentive to management by paying a greater amount for achieving more stretching performance conditions and is fully aligned with the Groups strategic objectives awards made under the PSP will have a performance period of at least three years and a minimum vesting period of three years.
Vesting of awards may, at the discretion of the Committee, be deferred in whole or in part for a period of up to two years following the end of a three year vesting period.
The awards made to the Executive Directors in 2011 will vest as to two thirds after three years and one third after four years to the extent the performance conditions have been achieved over the three year performance period.
Awards made to participants other than the Executive Directors will vest as to 100% after three years to the extent the performance conditions have been achieved.
The number of shares vesting at the end of the deferral period may be adjusted by the Committee in the instance of a misstatement of results relating to the performance period the performance measures under the New LTIP are NPC, NAV and Total Shareholder Return TSR.
NPC is an additional measure compared to the 2005 LTIP and is an important measure of the long term success and profitability of the Group.
It also reduces the emphasis on NAV performance, which can be affected by external market factors and gearing levels.
However, NAV per share remains a relevant performance measure for the Group as the key balance sheet metric.
Relative TSR is also considered to remain the best measure to capture creation of shareholder value and reward management performance in comparison with the Companys peers.
TSR is measured on an outperformance rather than a ranking basis the ESOS, which operates as a HMRC approved Company Share Option Plan, is used in conjunction with the PSP to deliver a proportion of an award under the New LTIP in a tax efficient manner on a fair value exchange basis.
Awards made under the ESOS are subject to the same performance conditions as those of the PSP The LTIP awards made to the Executive Directors in 2011 will vest as follows: one third on NPC performance in 2013.
None of the NPC element of the award will vest if NPC in 2013 is below 9 million: 25% will vest for achieving NPC of 9 million: and 100% will vest for NPC of 20 million or greater one third on NAV per share growth between 2011 and 2013.
None of the NAV element of the award will vest if NAV per share growth measured as a constant annualised growth rate, is below 7% per annum: 25% will vest for growth of 7% per annum: and 100% will vest for achieving NAV growth of 13% per annum or greater one third on three year relative TSR outperformance of the FTSE 350 Real Estate Super Sector Index.
None of the TSR element of the award will vest if the Group underperforms the Index: 25% will vest for performance in line with the Index and 100% will vest for average 9% per annum TSR outperformance of the Index.
Average outperformance of 9% per annum is consistent with historical TSR outperformance at upper quintile of the peer group Awards vest on a straight line basis between threshold and maximum targets.
56 The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Highlights Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information The Committee will review the appropriateness of the performance conditions before each award cycle and will ensure that the performance targets set are no less stretching than in the first cycle.
The incentive plans under which awards were made prior to 2011 are: the 2005 LTIP: this was the only long-term incentive used for awards between 2006 and 2010.
To date, none of the awards made to Executive Directors under that scheme have vested.
However, with the Group having achieved NAV of 318pps in 2011, that will result in 64.7% of that element of the award made in 2009 being 50% of the overall award vesting in April 2012.
The extent to which the TSR element of the 2009 awards will vest will not be known until April 2012 share options: no options have been granted to Directors under The UNITE Group plc Unapproved Share Option Scheme the Unapproved Scheme since 2004 The tables on page 59 sets out the awards granted to Executive Directors under the New LTIP, the 2005 LTIP and the Unapproved Scheme.
