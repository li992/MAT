An ordinary resolution for the approval of this report will be put to the members at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The law requires your Companys auditors to audit certain of the disclosures provided.
Where disclosures have been audited, they are indicated as such.
The auditors opinion is included in their report on pages 42 and 43.
Nomination and Remuneration Committee The Board has appointed a Nomination and Remuneration Committee whose role is more fully explained on page 31 in the Directors Report.
Policy on Directors fees The Boards policy is that the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors should reflect the responsibilities of the Board, the experience of the Board as a whole and be fair and comparable to that of other investment trusts similar in size, capital structure and investment objective.
This policy will continue for the year to 31 March 2012.
Directors are not eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share options, long-term incentive schemes or other benefits in accordance with other long standing investment trusts.
Directors emoluments for the year audited The Directors who served in the year received the following emoluments in the form of fees: 2011 2010 Peter A Smith Chairman 50,000 50,000 Sir Peter Burt 30,000 30,000 Neil A Collins 30,000 30,000 Peter O Harrison 40,000 40,000 Christopher D Brady 30,000 30,000 Hamish N Buchan 30,000 30,000 Gregory E Johnson Chairman of the Audit Committee Gregory Johnson is compensated in his capacity as President and Chief Executive Officer of Franklin Resources, Inc. Directors emoluments with effect from 1 April 2011 The Board fees were set some six years ago.
Since that time, there has been inflation amounting to c. 16%, and a significant increase in regulation and associated governance requirements with a consequent increase in directorial responsibilities.
Recognising the difficulty of a Board recommending their own fee levels, the Board sought advice from Trust Associates, the market leading advisors specialising in the investment company sector.
They were asked to compare the Directors fees with those paid by similarly sized investment companies and also with those paid by investment companies in the same sector.
Trust Associates reported to the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, which made the following recommendations: Chairmans fee to be increased to 60,000: Chairman of the Audit Committees fee to be increased to 47,000: Other Directors Fees to be increased to 35,000.
These represent increases of 20%, 17.5% and 16% respectively and take effect from 1 April 2011.
In addition, the Board have decided that in future the fees will be fixed for a 3-year period with an external review at the end of each triennial period.
