The pension accrual rates for 2010 for Phil Bentley and Chris Weston were 2.65% and 2.22% of final pensionable earnings respectively.
The increase in accrued pension has been adjusted to exclude inflation by revaluing the accrued pension as at 31 December 2011 by the rate of inflation 5.6% and deducting this from the accrued pension as at 31 December 2011.
The rate of inflation used for pension increases under both the CPP and CUPS was 5.6%, the annual rate to 30 September 2011.
A change in the transfer value calculation basis was also introduced in February 2011.
Had the transfer value been calculated on the accrued pension at 31 December 2011 but using the calculation basis in force at 31 December 2010, the transfer value of the accrued pension would have amounted to 3,813,100 for Phil Bentley and 1,723,400 for Chris Weston.
The difference in the transfer value less contributions would have amounted to 650,400 for Phil Bentley, and 340,300 for Chris Weston.
