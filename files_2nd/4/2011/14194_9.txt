There have been no significant changes to the structure of the package in 2011.
More detail is provided later in the report, as appropriate.
Remuneration policy The Companys remuneration policy includes the following guiding principles such that all remuneration arrangements are designed to be: simple and understandable: competitive: strategically and culturally aligned: performance oriented: and valued by employees.
The composition and value of the Executive Directors remuneration packages in target and stretch scenarios under this policy are set out in the charts below.
These show that the proportion of the package delivered through long-term performance is in line with the long-term nature of the business and is significantly higher in the stretch scenario than in the target scenario.
As a result, the package promotes the achievement of superior long-term performance and aligns the interests of the Executive Directors with those of other shareholders.
A brief description of each remuneration element is set out below the charts.
CEO Value of package $000 CEO Composition of overall package % Target Target performance performance Stretch Stretch performance performance $0 $2,000 $4,000 $6,000 $8,000 $10,000 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Base salary Pension EAIP PSP Base salary Pension EAIP PSP CFO Value of package 000 CFO Composition of overall package % Target Target performance performance Stretch Stretch performance performance 0 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 3,000 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Base salary Pension EAIP PSP Base salary Pension EAIP PSP Base salary corresponds to 2011 salary.

The exact structure and quantum of individual remuneration packages varies by business, geography, role and level of responsibility within the Company.
In general, the proportion of variable remuneration in the total remuneration package increases with level of responsibility within the Company.
All employees base salaries are benchmarked against the appropriate market and, in light of similar factors, as described for the Executive Directors Retirement and other benefit arrangements are provided to employees with appropriate consideration of market practice and geographical differences.
The aggregate level of annual incentive funding is determined by reference to the same Corporate Scorecard as described for the Executive Directors.
This scorecard is cascaded to each business and corporate function to ensure alignment with corporate goals.
Scorecard targets are further cascaded to each employee through their performance objectives, with annual incentive awards strongly differentiated based on individual performance through linkages with the performance management system.
Members of the Leadership Team must defer a proportion of their annual incentive one quarter of any EAIP award into shares for a three-year period.
Discretionary annual equity awards are dependent on an employees level of responsibility within the Company and individual performance.
Phased vesting occurs over a period of three years with the majority vesting at the end of the three-year period, except for the Leadership Team where all of the awards vest after a three-year period.

The Committee believes this policy provides an appropriate balance between the need to retain the services of key individuals for the benefit of the business and the need to limit the potential liabilities of the Company in the event of termination.
Executive Directors contracts allow for termination with contractual notice from the Company or termination by way of payment in lieu of notice, at the Companys discretion.
The contracts also allow for phased payments on termination, with an obligation on the individual to mitigate loss.
It is the Companys policy that there should be no element of reward for failure.
Neither notice nor a payment in lieu of notice will be given in the event of gross misconduct.
The Committees approach when considering payments in the event of termination is to take account of the individual circumstances including the reason for termination, contractual obligations of both parties as well as share plan and pension scheme rules.
Details of the Executive Directors contract terms are set out in the table below.
Contract date Notice period Potential compensation on termination Angus Russell July 2, 2008 12 months 12 months base salary and the cash equivalent of 12 months pension contributions, car allowance and other contractual benefits.

3 Performance conditions attached to SAR and PSA awards granted in 2010 and 2011 are Adjusted ROIC and Non GAAP EBITDA.
Further information can be found on page 62.
4 In accordance with the plan rules, the vested PSA awards have been increased to reflect the dividends paid by Shire in the period from the grant date to the vesting date.
5 The exercise price for SAR awards granted in 2011 is equal to the three day average up to and including the date of award, of the closing mid-market price.
The exercise price for SAR awards granted prior to 2011 is the mid-market closing price on the date of award.
6 Mr. Emmens awards were granted to him while he held the position of Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
7 The percentage of the awards granted in 2008 that vested, based on the performance conditions, was 88%.
The remainder of these awards are shown in the table above as lapsed.
The percentage of the awards granted in 2009 that vested, based on the performance conditions, was 100%.
The 2008 and 2009 awards include a market condition based on relative Total Shareholder Return TSR measured against two comparator groups.
In determining the vesting percentage of a SAR award or PSA award granted to Executive Directors, 33% weighting depended upon the Companys TSR performance relative to the performance of FTSE 100 constituents, excluding financial institutions, and 67% weighting depended upon the Companys TSR performance relative to the performance of a group of international companies from the pharmaceutical sector.
Vesting was determined as follows: % vesting TSR performance level achieved 0% vesting TSR performance below the median versus the comparator companies and the FTSE 100 excluding financial institutions.
33% vesting TSR performance at median versus the comparator companies and the FTSE 100 excluding financial institutions.
100% vesting TSR performance at or above upper quartile performance versus the comparator companies and the FTSE 100 excluding financial institutions.
TSR performance between median and upper quartile versus the comparator companies and the FTSE 100, excluding financial institutions, is calculated from 33% to 100% on a straight-line basis.
The comparator group set at the time of award for the 2008 awards was Allergan, Inc. Atlana Aktiengesellschaft, Biovail Corporation, Cephalon Inc. Forest Laboratories Inc. King Pharmaceuticals Inc. KOS Pharmaceuticals Inc. H. Lundbeck A S, Medicis Pharmaceutical Corporation, Novo Nordisk A S, Schering AG, Sepracor Inc. Merck Serono S. A. UCB S. A. Valeant Pharmeuticals International Inc. and Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc.
The comparator group set at the time of award for the 2009 awards was Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Amgen Inc. BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. Biogen Idec Inc. Biovail Corporation, Celgene Corporation, Cephalon Inc. Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc. Forest Laboratories Inc. Genzyme Corporation, Gilead Sciences Inc. Ipsen Ltd, King Pharmaceuticals Inc. H. Lundbeck A S, Novo Nordisk A S and UCB S. A.
Where a company fide-lists during the performance period, the proceeds are treated as being re-invested in an index that tracks the TSR of the remaining companies.
TSR performance was measured using an averaging period of three months.
In addition, the Committee had regard to the same calculation using an averaging period of six months as part of a fairness review to ensure that vesting properly reflected underlying performance.
8 As previously disclosed, the Company moved to calculating the number of PSA and SAR Awards using an approach based on the average three-day share price at the time of grant for the awards made in 2010 and subsequently, rather than an average share price over the prior twelve month period which had historically been applied.
