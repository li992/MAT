AUDITED SECTIONS OF THE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT The following sections of the Report have been audited: the Directors remuneration table, the sections on the long-term incentive plan and pension contributions, and the executive Directors pension table.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The remuneration packages of individual executive Directors were determined by the Remuneration Committee the Committee comprised of independent, non-executive Directors.
The current members of the Committee are listed on page 20.
Hewitt New Bridge Street part of Aon Hewitt Ltd, which provides no other services to the Company, provided advice to the Committee.
Determination of the remuneration of the non-executive Directors, within the limits imposed by the Articles of Association, is the responsibility of the Board as a whole.
Remuneration Policy The Company complied in the year under review with the provisions relating to Remuneration Committees incorporated in the Combined Code as revised in 2008 the Code.
The Committee is responsible for setting executive remuneration at an appropriate level to attract, retain and motivate Directors of requisite calibre.
Any arrangements made to provide annual and longer term incentives are intended to encourage and reward performance and to benefit shareholders, as well as to ensure RITs employees are adequately remunerated compared to its industry peers.
In setting policy and making decisions, the Committee gave consideration to remuneration packages paid by similar financial institutions as well as the provisions on the design of performance-related remuneration set out in Schedule A of the Code.
In reviewing the remuneration for executive Directors, the Committee takes account of the levels of salary and incentive arrangements for other employees.
The Committee intends to continue to apply this remuneration policy in the year ending 31 March 2012, but is proposing to make amendments to the annual bonus and long-term incentive arrangements, as referred to in this report.

Basic Salary and Salary Supplements Basic salaries for the executive Directors are reviewed annually by the Committee and the last review was at 31 March 2011.
Base salary is the only pensionable component of remuneration.
Lord Rothschild received a salary supplement of 20% of his basic salary, amounting to 82,723 in the year ended 31 March 2011 31 March 2010: 80,313.
This is included in the other benefits figure disclosed above.
The supplement is equivalent to the value of his pension contributions foregone since his election to opt out from the Companys pension scheme in 2006.
The salary supplement will continue to be paid at the same proportion to salary in future.
For similar reasons, Mr Budge also elected for the Group to cease making contributions on his behalf with effect from 6 April 2006.
From that date Mr Budge has received a salary supplement equivalent to 42% of his basic salary, or 127,734 for the year ended 31 March 2011 31 March 2010: 124,014.
Annual Bonus Plan During the year ending 31 March 2011, the Committee undertook a review of the Executive Annual Bonus Plan.
The review concluded that the plan was no longer applicable or relevant to the Companys investment policies and that a new annual bonus plan should be implemented for the year ending 31 March 2012 in which executive Directors and senior management should participate.
A new plan should be simpler to operate, provide better alignment with the Companys objectives, be more consistent with market practice in the investment management sector and be payable partly in deferred shares.
The Committee intends that, under the new bonus plan, the size of the bonus pool will be linked to the Companys investment performance relative to a relevant global index.
Individual bonuses would be allocated at the discretion of the Committee taking account of personal performance.
The portion of any individual bonus that exceeds 150,000 would be delivered in a conditional award of shares vesting in equal tranches on the first and second anniversary, and subject to a clawback provision in the exceptional events of mis-stated performance or gross misconduct.
The features of the new plan remain under consideration by the Committee.
Fuller detail of the metrics used to determine any bonuses earned for the year ending 31 March 2012 and performance against such metrics will be disclosed in next year's Remuneration Report.
The Committee authorised the payments of bonuses of 150,000 to Lord Rothschild, 275,000 to Mr Breuer-Weil and 110,000 to Mr Budge in respect of the year ended 31 March 2011.
Bonuses paid to those directors in respect of the year ended 31 March 2010 were 150,869, 224,968 and 110,933 respectively.
In addition, Lord Rothschild, Mr Breuer-Weil and Mr Budge all received a 1,000 bonus which was paid to all Group employees in December 2010 and December 2009.
35 Long-term Incentive Plan The operation of the J. Rothschild Capital Management Share Appreciation Rights Plan the SAR Plan was last approved by shareholders of the Company on 17 July 2008.
The SAR Plan provides for the grant of Share Appreciation Rights SARs over a notional number of shares in the Company.
Following the expiry of a three-year vesting period, participants in the SAR Plan are entitled to exercise their SARs and receive a payment the Share Appreciation Amount equal to the growth in value of the notional shares over the vesting period.
The exercise of a SAR is ordinarily subject to the participants continued service over the vesting period and the extent to which the performance condition applying to the SAR is satisfied.
For the executive directors of the Company the performance condition that has applied to SAR awards requires that the increase in the Companys share price, plus dividends, exceeds the Retail Price Index plus 3 percentage points per annum over the three-year performance period.
The performance condition is subject to ongoing review by the Committee.
The SAR Plan is currently restricted to using cash to meet the payment of the Share Appreciation Amount.
As explained more fully in the notice of the 2011 Annual General Meeting set out on pages 91 to 94, and in the Explanatory Notes on pages 96 and 97, further to a review of the SAR Plan by the Committee which included consultation with major investors, shareholder approval is being sought for the SAR Plan to be updated to provide flexibility to use ordinary shares in the capital of the Company to settle the share appreciation amount for future and subsisting awards granted under the SAR Plan.
The following grants of SARs were made to the Companys executive Directors during the year.
All grants were made on 31 March 2011: Notional no.

Clawback For awards granted after 1 April 2011, all bonus and long-term incentive payments will be subject to claw-back provisions which provide scope for the Company to recover value from awards in the event of a material mis-statement of the Company's accounts or in the event of dismissal for gross misconduct.
Performance Graph A performance graph which measures the Companys total shareholder return calculated by reference to the Companys share price, including dividend reinvestment against that of a broad equity market index is shown below.
For this purpose the Committee considers that the MSCI Total Return World Index in Sterling and the FTSE All-Share Total Return Index are the most suitable indices for comparative purposes.
The graph below therefore compares the Companys total shareholder return to that of these two indices over the last 5 years.

Non-executive Directors The remuneration of the non-executive Directors is determined by the Board as a whole, in accordance with the provisions of the Articles of Association, which currently limits the aggregate fees payable to non-executive Directors to 400,000 per annum.
Non-executive Directors do not take part in discussions on their own remuneration.
The Board, on the recommendation of the Committee, applied the following structure for the determination of the annual fees of the non-executive Directors throughout the year ended 31 March 2011: Basic fee 25,000 Committee membership fees: Audit and risk Committee 5,000 Conflicts Committee 3,000 Nominations Committee 3,000 Remuneration Committee 3,000 Valuation Committee 6,000 Committee Chairmanship fee per committee 5,000 RIT CAPITAL PARTNERS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT 38 The above fee structure will be unchanged during the year to 31 March 2012, save that a new separate fee of 5,000 per annum has been agreed for the Senior Independent Director, effective from 1 April 2011.
The non-executive Directors each have letters of appointment that are subject to termination upon one months written notice on either side.
Directors Service Contracts It is the policy of the Committee not to grant service contracts with notice periods in excess of one year.
The terms and conditions of the Directors service contracts are detailed below and are reviewed as required.
Lord Rothschild, Duncan Budge and Mikael Breuer-Weil each have service agreements with J. Rothschild Capital Management Limited.
Lord Rothschilds service agreement is dated 29 April 1996, but was initially with an associated company and originally dated 20 October 1993.
The agreement can be terminated, inter alia, by either party giving the other not less than twelve months written notice.
It provides for benefits in kind in line with normal company practice, including pension provision, private health insurance and a company car.
The agreement is currently on a rolling one year basis.
The agreement does not specify compensation payable in the event of early termination.
Duncan Budges service agreement is dated 29 August 1996, but was originally with an associated company and dated 6 August 1985.
It provides for benefits in kind in line with normal company practice, including pension provision, life assurance, permanent health insurance, private health insurance and a company car.
Mikael Breuer-Weils service agreement is dated 9 December 2008.

It provides for benefits in kind in line with normal company practice including pension provision, life assurance, permanent health insurance, private health insurance and a company car.
The agreement does not specify compensation in the event of early termination.
When considering the size of any proposed termination payment, the Committee would take into account a number of factors including the health, length of service, age and the performance of the relevant executive, including the duty to mitigate his own loss, with a broad aim to avoid rewarding poor performance while dealing fairly with cases where the departure is due to other reasons, such as illness.
Executive Directors External Non-executive Directorships Mr Budge is a non-executive director of The World Trust Fund, a Luxembourg incorporated investment company whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Mr Budge is entitled to fees of 25,000 per annum in respect of his non-executive directorship.
These fees are retained by Mr Budge.
No other fees are paid to the executive Directors in respect of external non-executive directorships.
