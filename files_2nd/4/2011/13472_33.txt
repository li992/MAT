com 101 Governance Remuneration report: Appendix continued When remuneration is delivered Executive remuneration structure The following chart provides a timeline of when the 2011 total remuneration is delivered.
The remuneration structure for executives, including the relationship between each element of remuneration and Group performance, is summarised below: Fixed Link to Group performance Remuneration arrangements STIP and LTIP STIP cash Provides the fixed element of the Base salaries reviewed annually effective 1 March paid BDP Base salary performance New base LTIP performance remuneration package measurement salary shares and options STIP award shares Any increases are determined with reference to underlying Group and individual a effective allocated approved allocated commences Reflects an employees sustained performance, global economic conditions, role responsibilities, an assessment contribution to the organisation against relevant comparator groups and base salary budgets applying to the broader employee population Provides locally competitive post Post employment benefit arrangements include pension or superannuation and post Benefits employment and other benefits in retirement medical benefits where applicable Performance measured a cost efficient manner LTIP 3 or 4 years Other benefits include healthcare, accident insurance where applicable, provision of a car, professional advice, spouse travel, flexible perquisites and secondment costs comprising housing, education, tax equalisation and relocation payments made to and on behalf of executives living outside their home country Performance measured Deferred shares BDP STIP 3 years Performance-related At risk Focuses participants on achieving The maximum annual bonus opportunity for outstanding performance under the STIP for STIP demanding annual performance goals, executives is 200 per cent of base salary for target performance, this is 120 per cent of Base salary which are based on the Groups KPIs, to base salary for executive directors and 100 per cent of base salary for other executives create sustainable shareholder value Threshold, target and outstanding performance levels are established for all STIP 50 per cent of the STIP delivered in cash measures in order to drive high levels of business and individual performance.
The STIP and 50 per cent delivered in deferred awards for achieving these performance levels are 50 per cent, 100 per cent and 200 per Jan Mar May Dec Feb Mar shares under the BDP.
The BDP vests in cent of the STIP opportunity respectively 2011 2011 2011 2011 2012 2012 the December of the third year after the The financial performance targets for the measures identified below are established end of performance year to which they through an annual planning process, where the product group and Group plans are a Performance shares and options typically allocated in March.
Vesting is subject to continued ultimately approved by the board.
The central case or base plan delivers what the employment to ensure ongoing alignment board considers to be target performance.
Probability factors are then applied based between the executives and shareholders upon a range of potential operating and cost scenarios to establish the threshold and outstanding performance levels.
These threshold and outstanding levels are approved by the Remuneration committee at the beginning of each performance year The following measures and weightings are used to determine STIP payments for executives: Weighting for executive Weighting for a directors and Group PGCEOs Business measures executives % % Rio Tinto Group Earnings flexed and unflexed 26.25 10.50 Cash flow flexed and unflexed 26.25 10.50 Product group Earnings 15.75 Cash flow 15.75 Total financial measures 52.50 52.50 Health and safety 17.50 17.50 Total business measures 70.00 70.00 Individual objectives 30.00 30.00 Total 100.00 100.00 a Sam Walsh is considered a PGCEO with regard to STIP performance measures.
An explanation of why performance is assessed against these measures and objectives is provided below: The inclusion of health and safety in the STIP measured in relation to AIFR 40 per cent, TM SPI 25 per cent and SQRA 35 per cent is a strong reminder that the safety of our employees is paramount and should not be compromised when targeting superior financial results In order to increase the focus on the significant risks that can be addressed before people TM are injured, the weighting to the combined leading safety indicators, SPI and SQRA, was increased from 50 per cent to 60 per cent in 2011 while the weighting to the lagging safety indicator, AIFR, was reduced from 50 per cent to 40 per cent The maximum health and safety score a PGCEO, the Group executive T&I and the Group executive Business Support and Operations can achieve after a fatality is 75 per cent out of a maximum of 200 per cent.
The extent of the impact of a fatality on the STIP score for executives is based on a judgment process that assesses the impact of leadership, individual behaviour and systems in the incident.
Recommendations on the appropriate downward adjustment are made to the Remuneration committee The Committee selected the financial measures as they are KPIs used in managing the business.
In measuring performance against the annual plan, the original plan is flexed to exclude the impact of uncontrollable fluctuations in exchange rates, quoted metal prices and other prices.
Earnings and cash flow results are therefore compared against equally weighted flexed and unflexed targets Individual objectives are tailored to each executive but are generally based on the achievement of strategic initiatives, key project deliverables and leadership competencies riotinto.
