Directors remuneration report Strategy The Remuneration Committee has delegated authority from the Board to consider and approve the salaries, incentives and other benefit arrangements of the executive Directors and to oversee the Companys share-based incentive schemes.
The Committee also monitors the level and structure of remuneration for senior executives who are not board members.
The Remuneration Committee The Committee, currently comprises four members who are all independent non-executive Directors: Alexander Waugh Chairman, Christopher Keljik, Shaukat Aziz and Nicholas George.
Connal Rankin served on the Committee until his retirement from the Board on 27 June 2011.
The Chairman and Group Chief Executive Officer are invited to attend meetings as appropriate but they are excluded when their own performance and remuneration is being discussed.
No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest, other than as a shareholder, in the matters to be decided by the Committee or involvement in the day-to-day management of the business of the Company.
Committee members receive fees as non-executive Directors but do not receive any pension entitlements or performance-related incentives.
Remuneration Policy During the year, the Committee took material advice from their appointed advisers, AonHewitt Limited operating through the brand New Bridge Street and which is ultimately owned by Aon Corporation, who advised it on various matters, including the operation of the Companys share-based incentive schemes and executive remuneration arrangements.
The Company has separately received advice on the accounting treatment of share options required by IFRS2: Share-based payments.
Other than this, neither New Bridge Street nor any other part of Aon Corporation provides any other services to the Company.
The Committee believes that to promote the long-term success of the Company a good remuneration policy must attract, retain and motivate the highest calibre of executive to manage the Company in a demanding environment.
The policy of the Committee is to provide remuneration that is comparable to that of other international companies with a significant proportion based on achievement of both Company and individual performance targets.
Performance targets are designed to be stretching and to align the interests of executives and shareholders while ensuring that inappropriate risk taking is neither encouraged nor rewarded.
The total remuneration of executive Directors for the year ahead will continue to comprise the following: Package element Purpose Base salary Fixed cash compensation based on level of responsibility, individual performance, experience and market conditions Annual bonus Variable cash-based incentive to drive operational performance using stretching financial targets and personal objectives Performance share awards Variable share-based incentive to drive long-term growth in Earnings Per Share EPS and Total Shareholder Return TSR performance Pension Fixed cash contributions to a Company sponsored pension plan or cash contribution to the executive, to promote long-term retirement planning Other benefits Provision of cost effective benefits consistent with market practice 54 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Governance Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Directors remuneration report continued Directors Remuneration Levels of pay and benefits are set to reflect the performance of the Group against pre-determined budgets, the personal contribution of each Director, as well as market and competitive conditions.
The Human Resources department ensures that the Committee is aware of pay and conditions throughout the Group and that these are taken into account when framing the executive Directors remuneration policy.
The Committee remains mindful of the Best Practice Provisions on the Design of Performance Related Remuneration under Schedule A of the Corporate Governance Code.
Base Salary Base salaries are set at levels that measure each executive Directors performance, experience and market practice against those Directors from similar international companies.
Base salary levels are reviewed annually or to reflect a significant change in role.
Wong Hong Rens salary was reviewed by the Committee with effect from 1 April 2011 and increased to 425,000 per annum, his previous salary having remained unaltered since 2005.
On becoming Chief Executive Officer on 27 June 2011, his salary was increased to 650,000 reflecting his increased time commitment and responsibility.
His salary will not be reviewed again until 2013.
Wong Hong Ren resigned from his roles in the Hong Leong group of companies and no longer receives any remuneration from the Hong Leong Group.
Richard Hartman became a non-executive Director following his retirement as Chief Executive Officer on 27 June 2011.
As a non-executive Director he receives a fee of 45,000 per annum.
Mr Hartman has agreed to provide consultancy services to the Group, as and when required, for which he will be paid a consultancy fee of 1,600 per day.
No such consultancy services were provided during the year.
Annual Bonus The Group operates a non-pensionable annual bonus scheme for executive Directors awarded on the basis of the achievement of agreed profit targets as well as the personal performance and individual contribution of the executive Directors.
To provide additional focus on performance-related pay and to ensure that remuneration arrangements take full account of the highly competitive international market in which the Company seeks to recruit and retain top quality executive talent, the Committee increased the Chief Executives Officers maximum bonus payable under the scheme for the Chief Executive Office to 150% of base salary from 27 June 2011.
The maximum bonus for other executive Directors remain 100% of base salary.
The annual bonus plan structure is summarised in the table below: Chief Executive Other executive Officer Directors 1 Maximum Bonus 150% 100% Financial target Headline PBT Headline PBT 2 Stretch bonus 112.5% 75% On-target bonus 56.25% 37.5% Personal performance and contribution Agreed objectives Agreed objectives Potential bonus 37.5% 25% 1 All percentage stated are in respect of base salary.
2 The stretch-bonus would be paid for achievement of 105% or more of the agreed financial target.
In the event that bonuses are found to have been paid on the basis of any material over-statement of financial performance, the Committee will consider appropriate means of redress through bonus clawback.
The Committee may consider the payment of a special bonus in circumstances where individuals have had a direct role in generating substantial additional value for shareholders.
For the 2011 trading year, the financial targets set were not achieved and, accordingly, that element of bonus was not awarded.
The Committee has awarded bonuses for achievement of personal objectives.
Part of Wong Hong Rens remuneration package, 55 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Governance Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Directors remuneration report continued Annual Bonus continued agreed on his appointment as Chief Executive Officer, included a one-off award to reflect cessation of entitlements under his former remuneration arrangements with the Hong Leong Group.
The executive Directors annual bonus opportunity for 2012 will be structured as described on page 55.
These targets will reflect the increased bonus opportunity now available.
Share-based Incentive Arrangements Share-based incentive schemes are designed to link remuneration to the future performance of the Group.
The operation of share-based incentives is regularly reviewed by the Committee to ensure that it aligns best market practice with the particular circumstances of the Company.
The Company operates a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP for the executive Directors and other senior executives as well as the Sharesave Scheme for all UK based employees.
Details of the LTIP and a brief summary of the Sharesave Scheme are shown on pages 58 to 60.
There is no current intention to make further awards under the Companys Executive Share Option Scheme.
During the year the Committee undertook a further review of the LTIPs performance conditions and concluded that the targets needed recalibrating to ensure the LTIP continued to incentivise executive management and align their interests with those of shareholders.
The revised targets include stretching EPS targets to drive operating performance and adding TSR targets to drive long-term shareholder value.
Performance against targets is subject to independent third party verification.
Service Contracts To reflect current market practice, it is the Committees policy that executive Directors have service contracts that provide for a notice period for termination of up to 12 months.
The Committee has established a mitigation policy in the event of early termination of a Directors contract and aims to avoid rewarding poor performance.
The following table provides more detail on the executive Directors service contracts: Notice periods Provisions in contract for Name Date of contract unexpired term compensation on early termination Wong Hong Ren 29 August 2001 12 months written notice to be 12 months salary appointed 7 March 1996 given by the Company at any time and six months by the executive.

Following his retirement as Chief Executive Officer, Mr Hartman became a non-executive Director engaged on a rolling letter of appointment which may be terminated by either party on one months notice.
Other Benefits Other benefits comprise a motor vehicle or an appropriate allowance and insurances for life, personal accident, disability and family medical cover.
External Appointments The Company recognises that executive Directors may be invited to become non-executive Directors of other companies and that such appointments can broaden their knowledge and experience, to the benefit of the Group.
Fees payable to executive Directors in connection with such external appointments would be retained by them with the approval of the Committee.
56 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Governance Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Directors remuneration report continued Non-Executive Directors Fees paid to non-executive Directors are determined by the Board as a whole taking account of time commitment and responsibilities.
Fees cease immediately in the event of the non-executive ceasing to be a Director.
Non-executive Directors are not entitled to bonuses, benefits or pension scheme contributions or to participate in any share scheme operated by the Company.
City Developments Limited nominates Kwek Leng Beng, Kwek Leng Peck and Kwek Eik Sheng as Directors under the terms of the Co-operation Agreement dated 18 April 1996, as amended.
The independent non-executive Directors each have rolling letters of appointment which may be terminated by either party on one months notice.
Performance Graph The graph below illustrates the performance of the Company and a broad equity market index over the past five years.
As the Company is a constituent of the FTSE All Share Travel & Leisure Index, the Directors consider this index to be the most appropriate broad equity market index against which the Companys performance should be compared for these purposes.
Performance is measured by Total Shareholder Return share price growth plus dividends reinvested.
Total Shareholder Return TSR 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 M&C FTSE Travel & Leisure The graph shows the value, by the end of 2011, of 100 invested in ordinary 30p shares of Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc on 31 December 2006 compared with 100 invested in the FTSE All Share Travel & Leisure Index.

57 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Governance Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Directors remuneration report continued Audited Information Share Options i Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme The Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme the 2003 Scheme provides for the grant of both approved and unapproved options.
Under the 2003 Scheme options over shares worth up to two times base salary may be granted each year although, in exceptional circumstances, such as in a recruitment situation, this limit is four times base salary.
Options granted under the 2003 Scheme were subject to the achievement of stretching performance targets.
EPS targets were chosen at the time of the grant as the Committee believed that participants in the 2003 Scheme should be incentivised to deliver significant earnings growth which, in turn, should return substantial shareholder value.
The EPS performance conditions in respect of all outstanding share options have been met.
Accordingly all share options are fully exercisable.
No further awards have been made under the terms of the 2003 Scheme since 2005.
It is currently not intended that further awards will be made under the 2003 Scheme.
ii Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Long-Term Incentive Plan The Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Long-Term Incentive Plan was adopted in 2006.
Under the terms of the LTIP, the Company is permitted to make both Performance Share Awards of shares worth up to a maximum of 150% of salary 200% in exceptional circumstances and Deferred Share Bonus Awards worth no more than the cash bonus that would otherwise have been paid for the year.
The levels of awards made under the terms of the LTIP are determined by the Committee.
Vesting of Performance Share Awards is subject to the achievement of stretching performance targets.
LTIP awards are not subject to re-testing.
LTIP awards 2008 to 2010 The performance conditions applying to Performance Share Awards made from 2008 to 2010 require the Companys EPS to grow, in real terms, over a period of three consecutive financial years after award.
Performance Share Awards will vest on the third anniversary of the award being made, subject to the vesting schedule shown in the table below.
EPS growth target Proportion of award vesting EPS growth of less than an average of RPI plus 5% per annum 0% EPS growth of an average of RPI plus 5% per annum 25% EPS growth of an average of RPI plus 5% per annum to 13.5% per annum 25% 100% pro-rated EPS growth of an average of RPI plus 13.5% per annum or more 100% The Committee having considered the extent to which performance conditions had been met in respect of LTIP awards made on 25 June 2008, determined that the performance conditions had not been met and the awards lapsed.
The LTIP award made on 30 March 2009 is due to vest on 30 March 2012.
Based on the Companys EPS growth for the three years ended 31 December 2011, the Committee has determined that the Performance Share Awards will vest in full.
LTIP awards 2011 The Committee has revised the performance conditions applying to the LTIP.
Performance Share Awards made under the LTIP from 2011 are subject to performance conditions comprising both EPS growth and relative TSR performance.
58 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Governance Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Directors remuneration report continued Share Options continued EPS Performance Condition Up to half of the Performance Share Awards will vest on the third anniversary of the award being made subject to growth of the Companys EPS achieving the targets as set out in the vesting schedule shown in the table below.
Percentage of one half of an Award that vests i. e. expressed as a percentage of one half of the total number of shares EPS growth target originally subject to an Award EPS growth of less than an average of RPI plus 4% per annum 0% EPS growth of an average of RPI plus 4% per annum 25% EPS growth of an average of RPI plus 4% per annum to 10% per annum 25% 100% pro-rated EPS growth of an average of RPI plus 10% per annum or more 100% These targets are considered challenging in light of current and expected future general economic and trading conditions and provide a good balance to the relative TSR-based conditions described below.
TSR Performance Condition The remaining half of each Performance Share Award is subject to a performance condition that compares the Companys TSR against the TSR of each company within a comparator group comprising those companies within the FTSE 250 index excluding investment trusts over a period of three financial years beginning with the financial year in which the Award is granted.
Up to half of the Performance Share Awards will vest on the third anniversary of the award subject to the Companys TSR over the Performance Period being at least at the median of a ranking of the TSR of the comparator group over the same period.
If it is achieved, that part of an Award that is subject to the TSR Performance Condition will vest as shown in the table below: Percentage of one half of an Award that vests i. e. expressed as a percentage of one half of the total number of shares Rank of the Companys TSR against the TSR of the members of the comparator group originally subject to an Award Below median 0% Median 25% Between median and upper quartile On a straight-line basis between 25% and 100% Upper quartile or above 100% iii Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Sharesave Scheme The Company also operates the Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Sharesave Scheme which is an Inland Revenue approved scheme and under which the UK-based executive Directors and Group employees are eligible to participate.
