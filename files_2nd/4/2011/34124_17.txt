Remuneration Policy continued Each component of Executive remuneration is explained below.
Basic salary Basic salary is determined by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of each year and when an individual changes position or responsibility.
Appropriate salary levels are set by reference to the performance, experience and responsibilities of each individual concerned and having regard to the prevailing market conditions.
Executive Directors contracts of service which include details of remuneration will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
Salaries are reviewed annually with changes taking effect on 1 April each year, taking into account individual performance, market data and levels of increases applicable to other employees in the Company.
The salaries for the Executive Directors for the financial years beginning on 1 April 2010 and 2011 are as follows: Director 1 April 2011 1 April 2010 % increase James Gibson 267,900 262,600 2% Nicholas Vetch 244,300 239,450 2% Adrian Lee 198,300 194,400 2% John Trotman 150,000 135,000 11% The salary increase for John Trotman reflects his progress in his role, although it should be noted that his salary is still, in the view of the Committee, below market levels.
Annual head office bonuses Executive Directors participate in the Companys annual head office bonus arrangements which were originally established in 2000.
There is no separate annual bonus plan for Executive Directors.
Bonuses are discretionary and are performance related.
They are assessed annually, determined by the Remuneration Committee and based on corporate performance during the year.
The bonus arrangements are structured so as not to encourage inappropriate risk taking.
The bonuses are directly linked to the Groups profit and operating cash flow performance.
There is no deferrable element of the bonus, and it is non pensionable.
The maximum bonus potential is 25% of annual basic salary.
The Committee approved the payment of a head office bonus of 10% of basic salary for the head office staff, including the Executive Directors, for the year ended 31 March 2011.
The bonus paid to the Executive Directors for the last 5 financial years are shown in the table below: Year ended Bonus payment 31 March 2011 10% 31 March 2010 10% 31 March 2009 Bonus waived by the Directors 31 March 2008 10% 31 March 2007 15% 3.
Pension arrangements Pension contributions of 10% of basic salary are paid into a personal pension plan for each Director.
Share incentives Long Term Incentive Plan the LTIP Approval was granted by shareholders at the 2004 Annual General Meeting for a Long Term Incentive Plan.
The Remuneration Committee has determined that an incentive plan using an award of nil-priced options is the most appropriate way to provide a competitive and market-related long term equity opportunity.
The principal reasons for the Remuneration Committee favouring the use of nil-priced options are: the greater alignment of Executive reward with shareholder interests: and the reduced volatility of nil-priced options to general share price movements.
Participation in the LTIP is only available to Executive Directors and selected senior management.
Awards are made under the LTIP on an annual basis.
The first awards under the LTIP to Directors were made in June 2005 providing incentives for the period between 2005 and 2008.
Individual grants of options to Executive Directors since the inception of the LTIP scheme have been determined by the Committee.
All awards to date have been approved by shareholders, through approval of the Companys Remuneration Report.
In respect of the current year and in all future grants to Executive Directors, it is intended that the maximum annual grant of awards will not exceed 100% of a participants annual base salary, except where the Committee considers there to be exceptional circumstances which justify an award above this limit.
63 Remuneration Report continued Remuneration Policy continued 4.
Share incentives continued The Committee awarded options under the LTIP at a level of 100% of salary in 2010.
This remains at the lower end of the market, particularly in light of salary levels for the Executive Directors.
For 2011, it is proposed that the awards made to Nicholas Vetch and James Gibson will be equal to 100% of their individual salaries.
The awards for Adrian Lee and John Trotman will be apportioned equally between them to an aggregate value of 100% of their combined salaries.
The most recent awards are shown in the table below: Director 2010 grant 2009 grant 2008 grant 2007 grant James Gibson 86,419 76,200 60,000 166,666 Nicholas Vetch 78,801 69,500 55,000 133,333 Adrian Lee 63,975 42,300 45,000 50,000 John Trotman 44,427 27,800 29,000 21,750 The number of ordinary shares issuable pursuant to awards granted under this LTIP and all other employee share schemes adopted by the Company may not be more than 10% of the ordinary share capital in any ten year period.
Any award under the LTIP that does not vest at the end of the specified performance period will lapse.
The extent to which awards granted under the LTIP vest and become exercisable is determined by reference to the Companys total shareholder return TSR relative to a comparator group.
The level of vesting is set out below: Total Shareholder Return Performance Level Amount of Award Vesting % Upper Quartile Full vesting 100% Median to Upper Quartile Pro rata vesting on a straight line basis 0 to 100% Median and below Nil The LTIP vesting is also subject to the adjusted earnings per share EPS growth over three years exceeding inflation.
This EPS underpin target must be satisfied before any part of the LTIP award can vest.
For awards made in 2005, 2006 and 2007, the Committee selected the companies in the FTSE All Share Index as the comparator group because they enable the Companys performance to be compared to a broad index that reflects the corporate performance of UK companies.
The Committee reviewed the relevance of this comparator group in 2008.
It was noted that the performance of the index was heavily influenced by the financial, energy and pharmaceutical sectors and as a result had less relevance to the financial performance of the Company.
The Committee therefore concluded that the performance of companies in the FTSE Real Estate Index was a more relevant benchmark of the Companys performance.
As a result, the LTIP awards made in 2008, 2009 and 2010 are, and the proposed awards for 2011 will be, based on the performance of the Company compared to companies in the FTSE Real Estate Index.
The Committee employs a third party to report to it on whether the performance targets in respect of TSR have been met.
The Committee has considered these reports on the performance of the 2005 and 2006 LTIP option grants and determined that the criteria have been met, and the awards have therefore vested.
In 2005 the Companys TSR performance was 75th out of 574 companies, and in 2006 the Companys TSR performance was 96th out of 499 companies.
The 2007 awards did not vest and have therefore lapsed.
The Committee reserves the right to vary the Performance Condition for future grants provided that in its reasonable judgment the new targets are no less challenging in the light of the Companys business circumstances and its internal forecasts.
The Committee has been advised that zero vesting for median performance is below the market average for comparable companies but there are currently no plans to change this.
Sharesave Scheme The Groups Sharesave Scheme is open to all UK employees including Directors with a minimum of six months service and meets UK HMRC approval requirements, thus enabling all eligible employees the opportunity to acquire shares in the Company in a tax efficient manner.
The Long Term Bonus Performance Plan Background The Committee believes a key strength of the Executive team has been its ability to react quickly to changing market conditions, revising business strategy and direction as needed.
This can be illustrated by the Pramerica joint venture at the end of 2007 and the successful early refinancing in 2008 of facilities due to expire in 2010.
The Committee received external benchmarking advice from  LLP in 2009.
The benchmarking advice received by the Committee concluded that overall remuneration of the Executive Directors was at the lower end of market practice and in some areas significantly behind the market.
The Committee continues to believe it has the right Executive team in place to take the business forward but is concerned to ensure that they remain incentivised and locked in to the business through a competitive total remuneration package.
The Committee therefore concluded that the best way to achieve this, whilst as far as possible minimising any additional cash cost to the Group, was to introduce a new performance based plan, the Long Term Bonus Performance Plan the Plan or the LTBPP.
The Committee instructed  LLP to work with it to implement the Plan.
Shareholders approved the Plan at the Companys Annual General Meeting in July 2009.
Share incentives continued Mechanics 1 Summary The Plan is structured as a share plan and operates in a similar way to a deferred bonus.
Awards are subject to performance over a three year period during which the value accruing to participants can be clawed back.
Participants will be partly or wholly rewarded in shares with any shortfall delivered in cash.
Cash shortfall payments under the Plan cannot exceed 50% of any total payout due and at least 50% of any payout will be in shares and will be subject to a further lock in.
Further detail is provided below.
2 Nature of interests and performance conditions Under the Plan, the Executive Directors have been awarded restricted interests in ordinary shares in the Company.
The interest entitles a participant to benefit from the growth in the value if any of a number of ordinary shares in the Company over which the interest is acquired.
The participants interest is capped at growth in value of 2.00 per share measured from the share price at the date of award.
Vesting of interests will be subject to performance conditions.
The Committee sets a range of performance conditions each year, both financial and non-financial, which are based on the business plan.
Total shareholder return is not used: this will remain the measure for LTIP awards.
The Committee annually identifies suitable indicators of future performance against which Executive Directors should be measured.
The Committee then sets the performance targets for the Plan, on the basis of business needs and priorities it has identified.
At the end of each year, the Committee indicates the extent to which interests have provisionally vested under the Plan on the basis of the performance targets which have been set.
The Committee has the right to adjust targets and, where appropriate, introduce new targets if business needs change.
Where appropriate the Committee may claw-back any awards that have already provisionally vested if subsequent performance during the three year period is below the targets.
Interests under the Plan will not vest until the end of the three year performance period and nothing will be paid out within this three year period other than in exceptional circumstances eg a good leaver.
The Committee feels the flexibility in the Plan allows it to adapt to a rapidly changing environment.
It will also ensure that any gain made by the Executive Directors is commensurate with their performance over the period and the financial and other performance of the Company.
The Plan should avoid the disadvantage inherent in many longer term incentive arrangements, namely being constrained by performance measures set at the outset which subsequently can prove to be out of step with the objectives of the business.
3 Vesting If the performance conditions are satisfied and the awards vest, shares will be transferred to the Executive Directors equal to the growth in value of the shares under award subject to the 2.00 cap on growth in value.
If there is insufficient value in these share interests to deliver the required payout, the Executive Directors will first be entitled to exercise an option to acquire further shares to make up the shortfall, and if this is still insufficient to deliver the required payout, a top-up cash payment will be made.
However, any cash payment cannot exceed 50% of the overall payment due to the Executive Directors.
The maximum payout in shares and cash to the Executive Directors as a whole at the end of the three year period will be up to a total of 3 million.
Based on current salary levels, this represents a maximum potential reward for each Executive Director of circa 110% of salary for each performance year.
The awards that were approved at the Annual General Meeting in July 2009 were as follows: Number of shares in which Maximum value of Director Director has an interest award after three years James Gibson 500,000 1,000,000 Nicholas Vetch 500,000 1,000,000 Adrian Lee 250,000 500,000 John Trotman 250,000 500,000 As noted above, any payout will be delivered in shares as far as possible.
Shares equal to 50% of the value of any payout after permitted sales to meet tax liabilities will be subject to further restrictions.
The Executive Directors will be required to hold half of these shares for a further year following vesting and the other half for a further two years, less those sold to pay tax.
During this holding period, the Executive Directors will not be entitled to sell their shares.
This ensures that the rewards of the Executive Directors and shareholders remain aligned for up to five years.
The performance targets for the LTBPP are not disclosed for the year ahead, given the commercially sensitive nature of a number of the targets.
The Committee reports on their assessment of the key prior year targets, excluding any that are still commercially sensitive, and whether or not management has been able to meet these targets.
The report on the targets for the year ended 31 March 2010 was included in the annual report for that year.
The report on the targets for the year ended 31 March 2011, which were not amended during the financial year, is summarised in the table overleaf.

Following careful consideration of the performance targets and actual performance of the Group and the Executive Directors, the Committee has considered that the award in respect of the financial year ended 31 March 2011 has provisionally vested as to 85% of its potential amount for the year.
The assessment made at 31 March 2010 was that the award for that year had vested to 85% of its potential amount.
As highlighted above, this award is subject to clawback, and may also be adjusted upwards, in future years.
66 Directors Contracts It is the Companys policy that Executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term, providing for one years notice.
All Executive Directors have contracts which reflect this policy.
If a contract is terminated at short notice, the Company has not waived any right which it may have at law to require the Executive Director to mitigate his loss although the Company is entitled at its discretion to pay the salary to which the Executive Director would otherwise be entitled, in lieu of notice.
The dates of the Executive Directors agreements are as follows: Nicholas Vetch 25 September 1998 James Gibson 25 September 1998 Adrian Lee 31 March 2000 John Trotman 25 September 2007 Non-Executive Directors The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts with the Company.
Their appointments are governed by letters of appointment which are available for inspection on request at the Companys registered office and which will be available for inspection at the Companys AGM.
Each appointment is for a period of up to three years, usually to the date of the AGM at which a resolution to re-appoint the Director would next be put to shareholders, although the continued appointment of all Directors is considered on an annual basis.
In addition, the appointment is terminable by either party giving notice of three months.
Non-Executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Companys share options schemes and are not eligible to join the Company pension scheme.
The dates of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are as follows: Philip Burks 30 March 2007 previously an Executive Director Tim Clark 1 August 2008 Mark Richardson 1 July 2008 Jonathan Short 16 February 2000 Steve Johnson 24 September 2010 External Appointments The Executive Directors contracts do not allow them to engage in any other business outside the Group except where prior written consent from the Remuneration Committee is received.
The Company recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-Executive Directors of other companies and that this can help broaden the skills and experience of a Director.
Executive Directors are normally permitted to accept external appointments with the approval of the Board and may retain the fees for this appointment.
