35 Business Review Governance Accounts Other Information Governance Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration Introduction The remuneration of the executive directors is determined by the Board Committee on Executive Directors Remuneration the Committee within a framework set by the Board.
As at the date of this report, the Committees members are three non-executive directors, Mr Toms Chairman, Mr Johnson and Mr Cuthbert.
None of the Committee members has a personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided.
There are no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
TheTerms of Reference of the Committee are available on the Companys website www.
During the year, the Group Company Secretary attended a number of Committee meetings at the invitation of the Committee and provided advice on issues other than those relating to his own remuneration.
The Committee also received independent external advice from Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS.
HNBS was appointed by the Committee and does not provide any other services to the Company other than to the Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors Remuneration.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors apart from the Chairman is determined by the Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors Remuneration, which comprises the executive directors.
The Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors Remuneration also receives advice from the Group Company Secretary and HNBS.
The Chairmans remuneration is determined by the other non-executive directors.
Context This years remuneration report is made at the end of a year which saw significant progress in the management of the business.
Profit before tax increased from 44.4 million to 67.2 million while debt levels remained extremely low, the Group ending the year with 3.4 million of net cash, excluding preference shares.
Customer satisfaction levels improved, as did safety performance.
Succession to two key Board positions by internal management development was also determined.
The appointment of two new executive directors in the 2011 12 financial year will provide an opportunity to effect some changes to remuneration packages and contracts.
Both the new executive directors will start on basic salaries significantly below their predecessors, with a view to upward movement as they develop in their roles.
Pension contributions will also be significantly lower than the salary supplement in lieu of pension contributions which are paid to Mr Watson and Mr Leitch.
Both appointments will have new service contract terms reflecting best practice.
Long-term incentive award levels will remain in line with the previous policy.
The Committee, however, has also given further consideration to the performance targets and has consulted shareholders on possible changes to these measures.
The conclusions are set out in detail in this report.
Objectives The aim of the Committee is to ensure that the Company has competitive remuneration packages in place in order to recruit, retain and motivate executive directors in the overall interests of shareholders, the Company, its employees and its customers.
The Committee has set, as an objective, a policy of paying remuneration around the median of a peer group of similar UK housebuilding businesses, subject to experience and performance, and it is satisfied that the structure of the executives packages broadly achieves this objective.
TheCommittee has used this comparative approach to benchmarking with caution, recognising the risk of upward only reviews of remuneration.
The structure of the package has been designed to ensure that the performance-related elements of remuneration annual bonus and long-term incentive plans LTIPs constitute a significant proportion of an executives potential total remuneration package, but are only receivable if demanding and stretching performance targets are achieved.
The Committee considers that the remuneration level and structure are fully competitive with the market, with a significant element of the package payable in the form of share-based incentives, subject to long-term performance conditions.
The structure of the performance conditions for annual bonus and long-term incentives has been designed to provide a strong link to the Companys performance, namely a focus on maximising profit in a sustainable fashion and generating superior shareholder returns.
This approach generates strong alignment of interest between senior executives and shareholders.
To improve the risk profile of the policy and in line with best practice, the Company is introducing a clawback mechanism for bonus and LTIP awards in respect of the executive directors and the Group Company Secretary to allow the Company, in exceptional circumstances, to clawback some or all of the variable components of that individuals remuneration.
In framing the Companys remuneration policy for executive directors, the Committee has given full consideration to the best practice provisions in the UK Corporate Governance Code and the Association of British Insurers ABI guidance.
When determining the elements of remuneration for the executive directors, the Committee takes into consideration the pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group as a whole, paying particular attention to the levels of pay increase awarded to the workforce generally.
All employees, including the executive directors, can join the Bellway p. l. c. 2003 Savings Related Share Option Scheme 2003 SRSOS.
All employees have access to pension arrangements, most have access to life assurance benefits and a significant proportion of employees benefit from health insurance, company car or car allowance.
The Committee is apprised of any significant policy changes for the workforce generally.
Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011 36 Business Review Governance Accounts Other Information Governance Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration continued Summary of Remuneration Policy The policy in relation to each component of executive remuneration is described below: Component Policy Performance period How achieved Salary To be market competitive.
n a Salary levels set by reference to the mid market level of a peer group of similar UK housebuilding businesses, taking account of individual performance and experience.
The salaries of the two new executive directors will be positioned below the median, with a view to progressing these over time as experience is gained.
Benefits To provide a range and n a Benefits to be at the mid market level of a peer group of value which is market similar UK housebuilding businesses, and for existing competitive.
executives include a salary supplement in lieu of pension contributions, car or car allowance, life assurance, medical cover and permanent health insurance.
The policy for new executive directors is that their pension contributions will belower than the salary supplement in lieu of pension contributions which are paid to Mr Watson and Mr Leitch.
Annual Bonus To reward achievement of 1 year By providing the opportunity to earn a bonus of up to 100% a combination of financial of salary 120% for 2011 12 for outstanding operational and non-financial performance, both financial and non-financial.
Long-term incentives To encourage long-term 3 years By using share-based incentives with performance conditions performance shares and value creation, to aid which are aligned with shareholders interests, such as Total Shareholder Return TSR, which are assessed over a matching shares retention, to encourage three-year period.
shareholding, and to promote alignment of interest with shareholders.
Service Contracts and Letters of Appointment The executive directors have service contracts with a 12-month notice period from the Company and a six-month notice period from the executive.
For Mr Watson and Mr Leitch, on termination by the Company, an amount equivalent to one years salary, benefits and the average amount of the last two years annual bonus payments, would be payable.
Within six months of a change of control, if either Mr Watson or Mr Leitch serves notice to terminate the contract, the liquidated damages payment would be triggered.
The inclusion of average annual bonus in the calculation of compensation payable for early termination has ensured that there was variability in the potential level of compensation.
In particular, after a period of poor performance, it could be expected that little or no bonus would be payable, reducing potential payout in these circumstances.
Mr Watson and Mr Leitch have long service with the Company and the Committee has not considered it appropriate to re-negotiate their contracts in relation to this provision.
In accordance with best practice, the service contracts of Mr Ayres, who was appointed to the Board on 1 August 2011, and Mr Adey, who will be appointed to the Board on 1 February 2012, will not provide for the inclusion of average bonus as part of the compensation arrangements in the event of early termination and will contain no liquidated damages provision.
The details of the executive directors service contracts are as follows: Executive director First appointed as a director Current contract commencement date J K Watson 1 August 1995 16 March 2001, amended 7 October 2009 A M Leitch 1 August 2002 1 September 2002, amended 7 October 2009 E F Ayres 1 August 2011 1 August 2011 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011 37 Business Review Governance Accounts Other Information All non-executive directors have letters of appointment with the Company of no more than three years with a three-month notice period by eitherside.

Salaries and Fees Salaries are reviewed on 1 August each year, taking into account the general settlement across the Company.
Any changes are implemented from that date.
For the year under review, the executive directors received a 2.5% increase in basic salary which reflected the average percentage increase across the workforce generally.
For 2011 12, Mr Watson and Mr Leitch have been awarded a 3% increase in basic salary, which will also reflect the average percentage increase across the workforce generally.
As previously announced, Mr Stoker retired on 31 July 2011 and Mr Leitch will retire on 31 January 2012.
Mr Ayres was promoted to the Board on1August 2011 and Mr Adey will be promoted to the Board on 1 February 2012.
The new executive directors commencing salaries will be significantly below those of their predecessors, although it is envisaged that these will be progressively adjusted as they develop and adapt into their new roles.
Mr Ayres commencing salary is 250,000.
Fee levels for non-executive directors reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of the role, including membership or chairmanship of Board Committees.
Fees are reviewed annually, taking into account the level of fees for similar positions in comparable companies.
For the year under review, fees were increased by around 6% to reflect the increasing responsibilities, complexity and time commitment of their role.
With effect from1August 2011 fees have been increased by 3% which is in line with the average percentage increase across the workforce generally.
They are not entitled to any benefits with the exception of the Chairman or pension.
They do not participate in any bonus or long-term incentive plan and they are not entitled to compensation on termination of their agreements, other than normal notice provisions of three months notice given by either party.
Taxable Benefits Taxable benefits provided relate to the provision of motor vehicles, telephones and private medical insurance.
Annual Bonus Scheme For the year under review, bonuses were capped at 100% of basic salary.
The performance conditions related to a stretching target range of operating profit 80% and personal performance 20%, with personal performance being assessed by reference to board structure and succession planning, land bank management, health and safety and customer care.
The Committee considers that the focus of the bonus on the Companys primary short-term performance measure of operating profit provides a good link between short-term rewards and its strategy, which is to maximise profits sustainably.
This also ensures that bonuses are affordable out of profits and there is a consistency with broader employee bonus payments.
The focus on profitability is balanced by there being a meaningful weighting of the overall bonus on a number of core non-financial KPIs the proportion of which has been increased for 2011 12 which are considered to have a strong link to profitability and long-term shareholder returns.
The performance conditions for the annual bonus are balanced by complementary long-term performance conditions under the Bellway p. l. c. 2004 Performance Share Plan the PSP, discussed later in this report.
Details of the bonus payments are set out in the notes to the table of directors emoluments on page 40.
Annual bonuses are not pensionable.
The bonus will be payable in cash, with executives having the opportunity to invest up to 25% of their net cash bonus in Bellway shares held in the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992 the Trust under the terms of the Bellway p. l. c. 2008 Share Matching Plan the SMP.
Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011 38 Business Review Governance Accounts Other Information Governance Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration continued As explained above, in relation to the two new executive directors joining the Board in the 2011 12 financial year, the Committee is keen to ensure that the total earnings opportunity for individuals should remain sufficient to retain high quality executives and to align their performance to the interests of shareholders.
As part of this, the Committee has looked again at the maximum achievable annual bonus.
Up to 2009, this had been set at120% of salary, with 150% achievable in exceptional circumstances effectively the maximum limit.
In 2009, as the housebuilding sector encountered extremely difficult trading conditions, the maximum was reduced to 100%.
The management have successfully steered the Company through this difficult period and trading conditions have become more stable.
Since then a number of other peer housebuilders have raised their bonus potential to well in excess of the Bellway level.
Following consultation with major shareholders, the Committee intends to return the Bellway maximum to 120%, but without the previous provision for 150% in exceptional circumstances.
The Committee will ensure that performance targets to achieve the maximum will be challenging.
The 2011 12 bonus will be based on profit 90% and personal performance targets 30% with the latter being assessed by reference to land bank management, health and safety and customer care.
The Committee considers that outperformance of targets in relation to annual profitability and non-financial metrics provide a good link to the long-term performance of the business.
Long-term Incentive Plans The Company operates two LTIPs which are designed to focus executive directors on longer term value creation, provide a strong retentive element and alignment of interest with shareholders.
The PSP was introduced for the Companys executive directors and the Group Company Secretary.
Under the PSP, executives have been granted awards over shares worth 100% of basic salary each year, subject to the achievement of TSR-based performance conditions or, in respect of the award granted in January 2008, a combination of TSR and Return on Capital Employed ROCE conditions.
Awards will vest to executives after three years, subject to the achievement of performance conditions based around TSR.
TSR measures the total return share price growth and dividend on a notional investment in Bellway shares, compared to the return on the same notional investment in shares of the other UK housebuilders.
Management is rewarded for Bellways total return outperforming the other UK housebuilders.
During 2010 11 the Committee reviewed the performance conditions in respect of the vesting of future long-term incentive awards.
For recent awards under the PSP, the TSR performance condition has been based on TSR relative to an index of the larger quoted UK housebuilders.
Therationale has been that this represents the peer group most directly comparable with the Company.
However, it presents two issues.
Firstly, there are now only six large comparator housebuilders, which means that relative TSR can be volatile, driven by erratic performance by other companies in the sector.
Secondly, in principle, Bellway has to compete for capital with investment opportunities beyond the housebuilding sector.
The Committee, after consultation with shareholders, has decided that for awards to be made in 2011 12, the TSR performance condition will be intwo parts.
Half will be measured by reference to the housebuilders index as before, and the other half will be measured by reference to the FTSE250 Index excluding investment trusts and financial services.
This change should not make the achievement of the vesting conditions easier, orindeed harder, over the long term, but it should make it less erratic.
As there are a higher number of comparator companies in the FTSE 250 comparator group, performance of each company in the group will be assessed and ranked.
Awards will start to vest at 25% if Bellways TSR matches the median of the companies in the group, increasing on a straight-line basis so that full vesting would be achieved if Bellways TSR reaches the upper quartile.
Grant levels will remain unchanged at 100% of basic salary.
The Committee has also consulted shareholders on the possibility of incorporating additional performance conditions into the PSP for future years and this will be considered further as and when appropriate.
TSR is recognised as enabling alignment with the interests of institutional shareholders by providing a reward mechanism for delivering superior stock market performance.
TSR calculations are independently calculated for the Committee by the Companys brokers.
Further, regardless of TSR performance, for the award to be granted in the 2011 12 financial year, no part of the TSR element of an award will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that there has been an improvement in underlying financial performance over the performance period, taking into account, inter alia, operating profit, operating margin, ROCE and Net Asset Value NAV.
The Committee will scale back the level of vesting indicated by the TSR performance condition potentially to zero in circumstances where there has not been an improvement.
The SMP operates in conjunction with the annual bonus.
Under the SMP senior executives may invest up to 25% of their net cash bonus, on a voluntary basis, in Bellway shares, which must be held for a minimum of three years in the Trust.
Invested shares will not be subject to a risk of forfeiture and executives will enjoy full beneficial ownership including voting rights and dividends.
In return for investing in shares under the SMP, an award of matching shares is granted.
The level of matching is on a gross basis to the net of tax bonus invested in shares.
Matching shares will vest subject to the executive remaining employed, retention of the invested shares and also subject to performance conditions.
No awards have been made to date.
For any awards which may be made, the performance conditions will be the same as will apply to the award under the PSP in the same period.
In addition to the two executive plans detailed above, the 2003 SRSOS is available to all employees, including the executive directors.
Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011 39 Business Review Governance Accounts Other Information Shareholding Guidelines There is a policy for a minimum shareholding requirement for the executive directors, equivalent to 100% of basic salary.
As at 31 July 2011, and at the date of this report, Mr Watson and Mr Leitch held shares with an equivalent value well in excess of 100% of their basic salary.
In response to the appointment of Mr Ayres to the Board on 1 August 2011 the Committee has established the following mechanism to ensure that new executive directors acquire the requisite shareholding.
Within a period of three months of appointment an executive director must acquire a minimum of 1,000 ordinary shares in the Company and must retain at least 50% of any shares awarded under the PSP or SMP, after allowance for paying tax, untilthe requisite number of shares has been accumulated.
If personal circumstances make this difficult, the Committee would exercise discretion.
Directors Interests The directors interests including family interests and holdings in which the directors are interested only as trustees in the ordinary share capital of the Company are set out below: Fully paid ordinary 12.5 pence shares 1 August 2010 or date Beneficial interests 31 July 2011 ofappointment if later H C Dawe 143,634 143,634 J K Watson 400,527 400,527 P J Stoker retired 31 July 2011 540,000 540,000 A M Leitch 132,473 132,473 P M Johnson 4,300 4,300 M R Toms 1,500 1,500 J A Cuthbert 6,000 6,000 The directors interests including family interests in the preference share capital of the Company are set out below: Fully paid cumulative redeemable 1 preference shares Beneficial interests 31 July 2011 1 August 2010 H C Dawe 709,164 679,164 P J Stoker retired 31 July 2011 300,000 150,000 A M Leitch 150,000 150,000 There has been no change in any of the above interests between 31 July 2011 and the date of this report, apart from Mr Ayres, who joined the Board on 1 August 2011, who holds 3,073 ordinary shares in the Company, and Mr Stoker who retired from the Board on 31 July 2011 and whose interests at the date of this report are no longer disclosable.
Pensions In July 2008 Mr Watson, Mr Stoker and Mr Leitch took enhanced transfer values from the final salary section of the Bellway p. l. c. 1972 Pension Scheme, and therefore have no accrued pension entitlements.
Since 1 June 2008 they have received a cash payment in lieu of pension contributions amounting to 30% of basic salary.
Following advice to the Committee, this amount was agreed as being reasonable in the circumstances and was less than the annual accrual foregone by the executive directors under the previous final salary arrangements.
Mr Ayres is a member of the Companys Group Self Invested Personal Pension Plan GSIPP and from 1 August 2011 the Company makes a contribution of 16% of his basic salary to the GSIPP on his behalf.
Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011 40 Business Review Governance Accounts Other Information Governance Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration continued The auditors are required to report on the information contained in the following part of this report.
Taxable benefits relate to the provision of motor vehicles, telephones and private medical insurance.
The annual bonus is payable in November 2011 for performance during the year ended 31 July 2011.
The performance conditions for the 2010 11 bonus were operating profit pre-exceptional items 80% and non-financial performance 20%, with non-financial performance being assessed by reference to board structure and succession planning, land bank management, health and safety and customer care.
The actual bonus payments against each of these metrics were determined on the following basis: operating profit was 75.21 million, with no exceptional items, an increase of 46.7% over the previous year.
This was substantially above City expectations of underlying profitability and at the top end of the target range.
The maximum bonus of 80% of salary was therefore achieved.
in respect of the non-financial elements, the Committee took account of performance against each metric.
In 2009 10 the non-financial metrics had not paid out in full, but in 2010 11 the Company had achieved a significant improvement in its customer care score from 86% to 91%, and reduced its rate of over three-day lost time accidents per 100,000 employees to 767.90 from 945.18 and had achieved its land bank target for the following financial year.
It also completed the successful succession plans for the replacement of Mr Stoker and Mr Leitch.
This performance triggered a full payout of the non-financial metrics.
Taxable cash payment in lieu of pension contribution amounting to 30% of basic salary.
Mr Stoker did not receive any payment for loss of office on his retirement from the Board.
Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011 41 Business Review Governance Accounts Other Information Directors Interests in the PSP The executive directors have a potential future beneficial interest in certain shares held in the Trust pursuant to the allocation of shares under the PSP.
Further information on the PSP is set out on page 38.

Market value on 18 January 2011, which was the day the shares in respect of Mr Watson and Mr Stoker vested, was 679.50p.
Market value on 30 March 2011, which was the day the shares in respect of Mr Leitch vested, was 700.00p.
The awards vested at 48.3% of the full entitlement.
Aggregate gross gains made by the above directors on vesting of these awards under the PSP in the year were 511,267 2010 610,420.
The performance conditions for each award are summarised below: a For awards made on 16 January 2008, two performance conditions applied to separate parts of the award: i 50% of the award was based on a TSR condition comparing Bellways TSR against an index of the TSR of other housebuilders the Housebuilders Index.
Bellways TSR was compared to that of the Housebuilders Index.
If Bellways TSR matched that of the Housebuilders Index, 25% of the TSR part of the award vested reduced from the previous vesting profile whereby 33% of the award vested at median.
Full vesting would be achieved for 7.5% per annum outperformance of the Housebuilders Index.
The companies comprising the Housebuilders Index are Barratt Developments PLC, The Berkeley Group plc, Bovis Homes Group PLC, Persimmon plc, Redrow plc and Taylor Wimpey plc.
ThisTSR condition was achieved at 96.6% of the maximum.
ii The remaining 50% of the award was based on a range of ROCE based targets requiring average annual ROCE of 15% per annum at which point, 25% of the ROCE part of the award would have vested to 22% per annum for all of this part of the award to have vested.
Awards would have vested on a straight-line basis in between these two points.
Thisperformance condition was not achieved.
b For the awards made on 4 November 2008, 29 October 2009 and 21 October 2010 the TSR part of the award applied as the sole performance condition compared to the same companies as for the award made on 16 January 2008. c For the awards made on 4 November 2008 and 29 October 2009, regardless of TSR performance, no part of the TSR element of an award will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that the Companys TSR over the performance period is reflective of underlying financial performance.
For the 21 October 2010 award and for future awards, no part of the TSR element of an award will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that there has been an improvement in underlying financial performance, taking into account, inter alia, operating profit, operating margin, ROCE and NAV.
The market price of the ordinary shares at 31 July 2011 was 660.00p and the range during the year was 510.50p to 753.00p.
There has been no change in the above potential future beneficial interests between 31 July 2011 and the date of this report.
Following Mr Stokers retirement from the Board on 31 July 2011, the full three year holding period of each of these awards is to apply up until the normal vesting dates.
In respect of the awards granted on 4 November 2008 and 29 October 2009, Mr Stoker may exercise the full allocation of shares awarded subject to, and calculated by reference to, the relevant performance conditions and subject to the relevant financial underpin.
In respect of the award granted on 21 October 2010, Mr Stoker may exercise up to 50% of the allocation of shares awarded subject to, and calculated by reference to, the relevant performance conditions and subject to the relevant financial underpin.

Annual Report and Accounts 2011 43 Business Review Governance Accounts Other Information Governance Statement of Directors Responsibilities in respect of the  The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts and the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU: and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent companys transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors Report, Directors Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Companys website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the directors in respect of the Annual Report and Accounts We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole: and the Directors Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the issuer and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
