Annual report and accounts 2003 Remuneration report The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee consists of the following Directors: Keith Hamill Linda Wilding Chair Alan Goldman John Williams Robert Wickman Michael Payne The members of the Committee are independent Directors who have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in the matters addressed by the Committee, and have no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships.
The Committee meets as required but at least twice each year, and operates within agreed terms of reference.
The Committee has responsibility for making recommendations to the Board on the Companys general policy relating to executive remuneration, and to determine, on behalf of the Board, specific remuneration packages for the Executive Directors.
During the year, the Committee appointed Keplar Associates, remuneration consultants, to advise on directors remuneration.
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Remuneration Committee in the absence of the Chairman and led by Mr John Williams, the Senior Independent Director and the Board.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board, excluding the Non-Executive Directors.
Remuneration Policy General The Remuneration Committee determines the Companys policy on Executive Directors remuneration.
The objectives of the policy are: To ensure that senior executive rewards and incentives are directly aligned with the interests of the shareholders, in order to optimise the performance of the Company.
To provide the level of remuneration required to attract, retain and motivate executive Directors of an appropriate calibre.
Salaries and other benefits are reviewed annually and the Remuneration Committee takes into account the performance of the individual, comparisons with peer group companies within the industry, institutional guidelines and reports from specialist consultants.
The experience of the individual and level of responsibility are also taken into account.
Consistent with this policy, the benefit packages awarded to executive Directors of Luminar are intended to be competitive and comprise a mix of performance-related and  remuneration, designed to incentivise Directors, consistent with the principles of corporate governance.
Basic salaries Salaries of Directors are set by reference to those prevailing in the market, particularly within peer group companies in the same sector.
Bonus Under current arrangements, which are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee, Executive Directors may earn up to 75% - 100% of salary subject to the attainment of specific and stretching objectives which are set for each individual.
The objectives principally relate to the financial performance of the Company, but can also include operational and functional performance: a quantifiable and measurable target is set for each objective.
On obtaining the target performance, 50% of the maximum available bonus will be paid.
Share Options It is the intention of the Remuneration Committee to grant share options to all Executive Directors to incentivise future performance.
Share options can be granted under the terms of two schemes, both of which have been approved by shareholders.
The 1999 Scheme, which has been approved by the Inland Revenue, and the unapproved 1996 Scheme.
It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee to set performance criteria, as provided for in the scheme rules, for the exercise of any option granted.
The criteria currently operated by the Committee is that growth in pre-tax Earnings Per Share EPS must exceed RPI 3% compounded, over the relevant three-year period.
Luminar plc 21 Annual report and accounts 2003 Remuneration report continued The achievement of the condition is measured by reference to the annual accounts of the Company for the relevant year, and Government statistics for inflation.
The Remuneration Committee consults with the Auditors to confirm the calculation of pre-tax EPS growth.
These methods were chosen as commonly available and easily understood by the participants in the scheme.
The Remuneration Committee has not amended the performance condition for any Directors share options during the year under review.
Save-As-You-Earn Share Option scheme Since 1996 the Company has operated an all-employee Save-As-You-Earn share option scheme.
Executive Directors, and employees of the Company with more than one years service, may participate in the scheme.
Options have been granted at the prevailing market rate, less a discount of up to 20%, as permitted by Inland Revenue regulations.
Options are normally exercisable three years after the date of grant.
Warrant scheme In February 1999 the Luminar plc Employee Trust was established, holding approximately 3.2 million Warrants.
Each Warrant carries the right to subscribe 1 for one Ordinary Share at a subscription price of 667 2 pence per share.
The Trust at 2 March 2003 held 1,620,129 Warrants, which are to be allocated to employees at the absolute discretion of the Trustees who may call for guidance from the Remuneration Committee.
The Trust was established with the approval of shareholders, to ensure that the Company had an appropriate scheme to incentivise and reward senior employees in the group during a period of exceptional earnings growth.
Warrants over approximately 1,600,000 shares were issued in June 2002.
The Warrants were issued subject to a performance condition, that average growth in pre-tax EPS exceeded 20% per annum compounded over the three financial years ended February 2002.
As reported in last years Remuneration Report, the performance condition has been achieved and the Warrants can therefore be allocated to participants.
It is the intention of the Trustee to allocate 50% of the Warrants remaining in the Trust within the 28-day period following publication of this report, and the remaining 50% during the following year.
Share OptionsInterests of Directors Details of each Directors interests in the share options and warrants of the Company are set out on pages 26 to 28 of the Report.
No other Directors have been granted options over the shares of the Company, or other Group entities.
The attention of shareholders is drawn to the table in the Directors Report, indicating the number of warrants held by Directors other than in relation to service with the Group.
Owing to a change in legislation, for all awards of share options after 2000 the participant and the Company are required to pay National Insurance contributions relating to the options.
The Committee has recognised this in its awards since that date.
Participants are required to pay employees N. I. contributions.
None of the terms and conditions of an option grant were varied during the year.
All grants were undertaken on a basis consistent with that described earlier in this report.
All options were granted at nil cost to the Directors: the right to exercise the option is conditional on the relevant performance condition being achieved.
1 The mid-market price of the Companys shares at 2 March 2003 was 3.07 2, and for the year then ended the range was between 9.35 and 2.55.
Warrants to subscribe for shares are listed for trading on the London Stock Exchange, and various Directors realised their award of warrants from the Employee Benefit Trust by the sale of the warrants.
The market price of the warrants on the day the were sold 30 May 2002 was 2.37.
The gain for each Director on options and warrants for the year is as follows- 2003 2002 Options Warrants Total Total 000 000 000 000 S C Thomas 2,472 2,472 135 A R Burns 577 577 285 A G Burford 178 178 J N Aust 178 178 B McLoughlin 22 Luminar plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Remuneration report continued Targeted remuneration The targeted composition of each Directors remuneration is as follows:  related Executive Stephen C Thomas 32% 68% Andrew R Burns 32% 68% Alistair G Burford 30% 70% John Aust 31% 69% Brendan McLoughlin 30% 70% Non-Executive Keith Hamill 0% 100% Alan Goldman 0% 100% Robert Wickman 0% 100% Linda Wilding 0% 100% John Williams 0% 100% Michael Payne 0% 100% Directors Service Contracts It is the policy of the Company that contracts for new Executive Directors should have a notice period on each side not exceeding one year, and that the contractual termination payment should not exceed the salary of the Director during the previous calendar year.
Non-Executive Directors, in accordance with best practice, are not appointed on service contracts.
They are appointed for a fixed initial period of three years, and may be re-appointed for further fixed periods, up to a total of nine years.
Non-Executive Directors are issued on appointment or re-appointment with a letter confirming the terms of their appointment.
Non-Executive Directors are required to give three months notice of resignation.
In addition, Stephen Thomas has a contract with the Company containing a requirement for either party to give two years notice of termination.
Under the contract, he also has a two-year restrictive covenant relating to competitive activity.
Any compensation under the contract is subject to mitigation.
These arrangements were agreed at the time of the flotation of the Company when the Company was advised that investors would require arrangements of this type.
Subsequent corporate governance practice requires that termination periods of this length be disclosed and explained.
The Board reported last year that it regarded these arrangements as in the best interests of the Company.
During the year to 28 February 2003, one major shareholder requested to renegotiate this contract although it subsequently sold its shares.
The Board intends to await the findings of the CBIs review of practices in this area Chaired by Sir Nigel Rudd before reconsidering this issue.
The details of the service contracts of those who served as Executive Directors during the year are as follows: Contract Unexpired Notice date term period Contractual termination payment Stephen C Thomas 12.4.

02 N A 364 days Payment equivalent to 364 days of final salary plus bonus, pension, PHI and car payments All of the Executive Directors are employed on rolling contracts with a retirement age of 60.
The contracts of Mr Burns, Mr Burford and Mr Aust contain a provision entitling the Company to make a payment in lieu of notice.
No such provision is made in the contracts of Mr Thomas and Mr McLoughlin.
It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee to seek to mitigate termination payments in appropriate circumstances.
Luminar plc 23 Annual report and accounts 2003 Remuneration report continued Mr SC Thomas is entitled, in the event of his contract being terminated on grounds of redundancy or in the event of wrongful dismissal, to a payment representing the difference between the option price and the fair value of any share options he holds at that date.
No valuation for such a right is included in the above figures, as the exercise price for all options currently exceed the market value of ordinary shares.
The details of the service arrangements for the Non-Executive Directors through the year were as follows: Contractual Appointment Term termination date expires payment Keith Hamill 16.1.

Other employees are also eligible for these benefits.
Details of contributions made by the Company to the Luminar Leisure Limited 1998 Retirement and Death Benefit Scheme, on behalf of the Executive Directors, are set out below.
As disclosed in last years report, between March 2002 and May 2002 John Williams was asked to undertake additional work for the Company, pending the appointment of a new Property Director.
The additional fees for this work, amounting to 15,000, and indicated in the figures above were approved by the Board, who considered that the benefits to the Company would be significant and that no significant damage would be done to independence.
24 Luminar plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Remuneration report continued Directors Pension Entitlements Pension Policy It is the policy of the Committee that all Executive Directors will be invited to join the Luminar Group pension plan, which has been approved by the Inland Revenue.
The scheme is a contributory, defined contribution scheme and also provides for dependents pensions and lump sums on death in service of four times basic salary.
The Trustees of the Scheme are appointed in accordance with the Member-Nominated Trustee Regulations.
The Company makes no pension provision in respect of the Non-Executive Directors.
For each Executive Director, the payments made by the Company in the year in respect of their pension provisions are as follows: 2003 2002 000 000 Stephen C Thomas 370 85 Andrew R Burns 28 44 Alistair G Burford 22 3 John N Aust 19 3 Brendan McLoughlin 21 3 - The comparative for these Directors is from the date of appointment, 1 January 2002.
At the start of the year the Remuneration Committee conducted a periodic review of the remuneration of the executive team with the advice of remuneration consultants.
This resulted in some changes to basic salaries, bonuses and benefits.
The review also identified that the pension arrangements for Stephen Thomas were very materially below those for equivalent executives and pension contributions to his defined contribution pension fund were increased from 15% of salary to 45% of his average salary for the three years to 28 February 2004, when they will revert to 25% of salary.
This resulted in payments to his scheme of 370,000 covering the two years to 28 February 2003.
The results of the remuneration review were implemented after consultation within the Companys larger shareholders.
