Directors remuneration report This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
It also meets the requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors remuneration.
A resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the Companys Annual General Meeting to be held on 3 July 2003.
Unaudited information Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee is chaired by Jim Forbes.
The other current members of the Committee are David Dunn, John Sievwright and Martyn Williams, all of whom are Non-Executive Directors.
Martyn Williams replaced George Law who served as Non-Executive Employee Director until 31 December 2002.
With the exception of Martyn Williams, none of the members of the Committee has any personal financial interest other than as a shareholder in the matters to be decided, conict of interest arising from cross-directorships or any involvement in the day-to-day running of the business.
They do not hold any share options nor do they participate in any Group share or pension schemes.
Martyn Williams is an employee of one of the Groups operating subsidiaries.
In that capacity, he is entitled to participate in employee share schemes from time-to-time and to be a member of one of the Groups pension schemes.
Although he would therefore not be regarded as independent in strict corporate governance terms, the Committee considers it very important that the Groups employees are given a voice on the Board and that employees views are taken into consideration, in particular when the remuneration of the Executive Directors is determined.
The Committee, which has written terms of reference, generally meets at least once a year and also as required to consider matters related to the remuneration of Executive Directors.
In the year under review, it met six times and all its members attended each of those meetings.
In determining the Executive Directors remuneration for the year, the Committee considered publicly available information, including the remuneration packages of those holding equivalent posts at the Companys peers within the transport industry and the FTSE 250 generally.
In addition, the Committee has also received advice in relation to certain specic remuneration and pension-related matters from Watson Wyatt, a rm of independent remuneration consultants.
Watson Wyatt also provided advice to the Company during the year on remuneration and pension-related matters in respect of staff below main Board level.
Remuneration policy Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain individuals of the high calibre needed to maintain the Groups position as a leader in the public transportation sector.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors and senior management, namely basic salary, annual cash and deferred share bonus, share option incentives and pension arrangements.
The remuneration package for each Executive Director is viewed as a whole and the individual elements making up the package are balanced to ensure that overall, the remuneration received by an executive is not excessive, is competitive with the remuneration received by the individuals equivalents in other similar quoted companies, contains an appropriate balance of xed and variable performance-related compensation and provides longer-term share incentives designed to align his interests with those of shareholders.
A high proportion of the total remuneration package is performance-related.
Basic salary and other benets in kind The basic salary and benets in kind for each Executive Director is determined by the Committee prior to the beginning of each financial year and when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a whole and also the packages received by similar individuals at the Companys peers in the public transport sector and the FTSE 250.
Details of the salaries and benets in kind paid to each of the Executive Directors in the year are shown on page 23.
F FIRST IRST 19 19 Directors remuneration report FirstGroup plc Executive Annual Bonus Plan Payment of bonuses under this plan is linked to achievement of budgeted Group operating profit targets and personal objectives including certain safety-linked targets.
In the case of Mike Mitchell, the payment of a bonus is also linked to the profitability of the UK Bus and UK Rail Divisions.
The Committee considers and agrees the Group objectives that must be met for each financial year for a bonus to become payable.
The personal objectives for the Executive Directors are agreed with the Chief Executive.
Bonus payments comprise a mixture of cash and deferred share awards.
Share awards, which are structured as nil-cost share options, are deferred for three years and will lapse if the Director leaves the Group during that period for reasons other than redundancy, retirement or ill-health.
The Committee considers that it is appropriate for part of the annual bonus to be paid in the form of deferred shares as this more closely aligns Directors interests with those of shareholders and provides an incentive for the relevant executive to remain with the Group.
As the award of any bonus is already dependent upon the achievement of performance targets in a particular year, the Committee does not consider it appropriate to impose any further performance criteria on vesting of the deferred share element of any bonus award, other than that the relevant Executive Director remains employed by the Group and has not tendered his resignation at the end of that three-year period.
The Group sets yearly budget targets for the Group as a whole and for each business unit within the Group.
These targets are, of necessity, extremely challenging.
The Committee has determined that bonuses would be payable for Group performance against budget between 90% and 110%.
The level of bonus payable is heavily skewed towards performance in excess of 100% of budget.
However, even if the budgetary targets are met, a proportion of the bonus which would otherwise be payable is dependent on personal performance.
The maximum level of bonus payable to an Executive Director is 80% of basic salary, although awards for the year ended 31 March 2003 were 58.85% for each Executive Director.
The Committee has determined that awards should be calculated on this basis for the 2003 04 financial year and, going forward, will review on a yearly basis what performance criteria are appropriate for future years.
Share Option Schemes Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The Company operates an Executive Share Option Scheme for Executive Directors and other senior management.
Under this scheme, options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee at levels of up to 200% of basic salary.
The exercise price of the options granted under the scheme is based on the average of the middle market quotations for shares in the Company for the three dealing days prior to the date of grant.
The Committee has agreed that the following performance targets should continue to apply for option grants made in the 2003 04 financial year.
Options will be exercisable if the growth in the Companys annualised earnings per share EPS for the three-year period following the financial year ending before the date of grant exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index RPI over the same period by an average of at least 3% per annum.
If at the end of the three-year period the performance target has not been met, EPS growth will be measured over an additional year and must show an average growth of 3% in excess of RPI over the full four year period.
If the EPS criterion is met, the option may be exercised at any time during the rest of its ten-year life, without any further condition.
If the holder leaves the Group before the end of the performance period by reason of injury, ill-health, disability, redundancy or retirement, an option may be exercised within 12 months if the performance target has been satisfied at the date of such cessation.
Early exercise of options may also be permitted within specic periods in the event of a change of control of the Company resulting from a takeover, reconstruction, amalgamation or voluntary winding-up of the Company but only to the extent that any performance targets have then been achieved on a pro rata basis.
Grants for the 2002 03 financial year were set at 1.33 times basic salary for Moir Lockhead and 1 times salary for other Executive Directors.
Going forward, the Committee will consider what performance criteria and levels of award are appropriate for each financial year.
The performance criteria and annual levels of grant have remained unchanged since the scheme was adopted in 2001.
At that time, the scheme was designed to attract and retain key individuals in the face of competition for talented and effective staff and the performance criteria and levels of grant were considered appropriate to achieve this aim whilst better aligning the interests of the individuals concerned with the longer-term interests of shareholders.
The Committee believes that these performance criteria and levels of grant remain appropriate for the current financial year.
In the current climate, the RPI-related target is a realistic challenge and the overall levels of grant are not considered to be excessive when compared to the Groups principal competitors and FTSE 250 companies more generally.
20 20 F FIRST IRST Save As You Earn SAYE Scheme The Company also operates a Save As You Earn SAYE Share Option Scheme for eligible employees under which options may be granted on an annual basis at a discount of up to 20% of market value.
The Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the SAYE Share Option Scheme.
The Company no longer operates any long-term incentive schemes other than the share option schemes described above.
No amendments are proposed to be made to the terms and conditions of any entitlement of a Director to share options.
Buy As You Earn BAYE Scheme At the Companys AGM in 2001, shareholders approved the establishment of a new all-employee Share Incentive Plan.
This replaced the Employee Share Ownership plan ESOP.
The Company was no longer able to operate the ESOP following a change in the law governing approved profit sharing schemes.
The final appropriation under the ESOP was made in June 2002 in respect of the financial year ended 31 March 2002.
During the year, the Company launched the new Share Incentive Plan under the title Buy as You Earn.
This scheme, which is open to all UK employees of the Group including the Executive Directors, enables employees to purchase partnership shares from their gross income i. e. before income tax and National Insurance deductions.
The Company provides one matching share for every two partnership shares bought by employees, subject to a maximum Company contribution of shares to the value of 15 a month.
The shares are held in trust for up to five years, in which case, no income tax and national insurance will be payable.
The matching shares will be forfeited if the corresponding partnership shares are removed from trust within three years of award.
Retirement benets Executive Directors are members of a number of dened benefit Group pension schemes.
Their dependants are eligible for dependants pensions and the payment of a lump sum in the event of death in service.
Further details are set out on page 25.
Service contracts It is the Companys policy to restrict notice periods for Executive Directors to a maximum of 12 months.
In line with this policy, all of the Executive Directors have service contracts with an undefined term but which provide for a notice period of 12 months.
There are no contractual provisions governing payment on early termination of these contracts.
If it becomes necessary to consider termination of a service contract, the Company will have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including mitigation, when determining any compensation to be paid.
Details of their contracts are set out below: Date of Service Contract Moir Lockhead 5 March 2001 1 Robbie Duncan 5 March 2001 Iain Lanaghan 29 November 2002 Mike Mitchell 2 July 1997 1 Retired as a Director on 31 March 2003 Executive Directors are permitted to accept a limited number of outside non-executive directorships, recognising that this is an effective way to broaden their knowledge and expertise and, unless the appointment is in connection with Group business, the individual Director is entitled to retain any fees received.
No such appointment can be taken up without prior Board approval.
Non-Executive Directors All Non-Executive Directors have a letter of appointment and their remuneration is determined by the Board based on independent surveys of fees paid to non-executive directors of comparable companies.
Non-Executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Companys share option schemes and are not eligible to join the Companys pension scheme.
Each of the Non-Executive Directors, other than Martyn Williams, has elected to receive 40% of his fees in the form of shares in order to ensure that their interests are more closely aligned to those of the Companys shareholders.
The shares are purchased on a monthly basis in the market.
The appointment of each of the Non-Executive Directors is subject to early termination without compensation if he is not reappointed at an Annual General Meeting when he is up for re-election.
