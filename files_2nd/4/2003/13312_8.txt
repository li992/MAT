Remuneration Report INTRODUCTION This Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 as formerly set out in the Directors Remuneration Regulations 2002 Schedule 7A and The Combined Code, appended to the Listing Rules, as issued by the Financial Services Authority Combined Code.
This report also makes reference to the revised Combined Code on Corporate Governance Revised Code which will come into effect for reporting years beginning on or after 1st November 2003, which will apply in relation to the companys annual report and accounts for 2004.
In framing its remuneration policy the committee has given full consideration to the matters set out in Schedules A and B to the Combined Code and has endeavoured to take full account of the matters set out in section B to the Revised Code.
A resolution resolution 2 to approve the report will be proposed at the annual general meeting to be held on 27th May 2004.
The regulations require the auditors to report to the companys members on the matters set out in Part 3 of Schedule 7A and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
Items 1 to 4 in the last section of this report entitled Pay and Benefits have been audited.
THE The companys remuneration committee Committee is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the REMUNERATION Combined Code and the Revised Code and its terms of reference are available on the companys website.
The COMMITTEE AND Committee makes recommendations to the board on the framework of executive remuneration and its cost.
ITS PROCESSES It determines, without reference to the board, the pay and benefits of the executive directors and sector managing directors and the company secretary, in the light of the recommendations of the chief executive other than in relation to himself and professional advice and external sources of information referred to below.
The members of the Committee during the year under review were Mr B D McGowan, Mr P J Long, Mr P Mason and Mr R R Spinney, who are all independent non-executive directors, and the Committee was chaired by Mr McGowan.
Mr P Mason joined the Committee after his election to the board at the annual general meeting held in May 2003.
At the beginning of 2004, the board approved a number of changes to the terms of reference of the Committee.
The principal changes being as follows: to make the Committee responsible for setting targets for performance related pay schemes for executive directors and senior executives: to advise the board on major changes in employee benefit structures throughout the company: and to advise the board on the contractual terms applicable to termination payments for executive directors and senior executives.
In addition, the Committee has assumed responsibility for making recommendations to the board on the level of the chairmans fees which was formerly undertaken by the chairmans fees committee, which has now ceased to exist.
The Committee seeks to obtain information from suitable sources regarding directors remuneration.
In this context it and the company have obtained reports from Towers Perrin, who operate one of the most extensive management pay databanks in the UK.
It specifically commissioned the remuneration consultants, Watson Wyatt, to advise on the discretionary share option schemes and the Deferred Share Award Plan, which were introduced in 2000, and that firm continues to provide advice to the Committee on the performance conditions applicable to these incentive arrangements.
None of the members of the Committee participates in company incentive arrangements or has any personal interest other than as shareholders in the matters under consideration, conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships, or any day-to-day involvement in running the business.
No director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC 29 Remuneration Report POLICIES General The policy of the board towards remuneration matters is to provide pay and benefits packages for the executive directors, the sector managing directors and the company secretary that are appropriate to attract, retain and incentivise the best staff in order to meet the objective set by the board to achieve superior performance.
Specifically, with regard to executive directors, the objective of the policy is to ensure that executive directors should receive remuneration that reflects their responsibilities and performance.
Account is also taken in the case of sector managing directors of the relative success of the different parts of the business for which they are responsible and the extent to which the strategic objectives set by the board are being met.
The Committee monitors competitive market practices, particularly through the use of generally available external independent data, such as that provided by Towers Perrin.
The Committee also takes into account the size, complexity and international nature of the companys operations when assessing comparative data.
Remuneration packages for executive directors, sector managing directors and senior management generally contain the following principal elements: Salaries Bonuses Share options Pensions Benefits The Committee has developed remuneration packages designed to align the interests of executives with those of shareholders.
Consistent with the boards policy, the remuneration packages awarded to directors are intended to be competitive and provide a mix of performance-related and other remuneration designed to incentivise directors but not detract from the goals of Corporate Governance.
The executive directors and sector managing directors are entitled to bonuses, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions see sub-section entitled Bonuses below.
50% of bonuses are paid in the form of shares that vest after one year in accordance with the terms of the companys Deferred Share Award Plan.
Sector managing directors bonuses are based in part on the achievement of turnover and profit targets for the performance of the businesses for which they are responsible and in part on their membership of the Bonus and Deferred Share Award Plan their relative entitlements under both schemes are abated to reflect the fact that they participate in both.
Generally, the personal targets of senior managers other than executive directors and sector managing directors are tied into the performance of those profit centres to which they contribute.
Both shortterm rewards base salary, annual bonuses and fringe benefits and longer-term benefits share options and pension benefits reflect the responsibilities and performance of individual executives.
The companys policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors should be performance related.
As described on page 31, executive directors and sector managing directors may earn annual incentive payments with a maximum of between 53.3% and 80.0% of their basic salaries together with the benefits of participation in share option schemes.
30 RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC The relative importance of the performance related elements of the executive directors remuneration in 2003 is summarised below: PERFORMANCE BONUS INCLUDING AWARDED UNDER BASE SALARY AND THE DEFERRED SHARE BENEFITS AWARD PLAN 2003 SHARE OPTIONS TOTAL J C F Wilde 66% 4% 30% 100% R C Payne 75% 3% 22% 100% E F Brown 79% 2% 19% 100% Note: The value of share options have been calculated in accordance with the Black-Scholes model.
Executive directors are entitled to accept one non-executive directorship or similar appointment outside the company, provided that the boards permission is obtained and fees from any such appointments are paid to the company.
Currently, no executive director holds an outside appointment.
Salaries Executive directors basic salaries are determined by the Committee at the commencement of each year and when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers salaries in the company at a senior level as a whole and relies on objective research which gives up-to-date information on executive directors remuneration in British companies in both the support services sector and generally for example, survey of executives remuneration prepared by Towers Perrin referred to above.
Bonuses The Committee establishes the performance criterion that must be met for each financial year if a cash bonus is to be paid and deferred shares awarded to executive directors under the Deferred Share Award Plan.
In setting appropriate bonus parameters the Committee has taken advice from the remuneration consultants, Watson Wyatt.
The Committee believes that any incentive compensation awarded should be tied to the interests of the companys shareholders and that, in the context of bonus entitlement, is best measured by movements in the companys basic earnings per share.
The performance criterion for the Bonus and Deferred Share Award Plan 2003 was that for every 1% increase and pro rata for lesser percentages in the companys earnings per share over the earnings per share for the previous year over 2% in excess of the rate of inflation Mr J C F Wilde would receive a bonus of 10% of basic salary maximum 80.0%, Mr R C Payne would receive 6.65% of basic salary maximum 53.3% and the sector managing directors including Mr E F Brown would receive 3% of basic salary maximum 24.0%.
The Committee considers that earnings per share growth of 2% in excess of the rate of inflation should be expected and that if that rate is exceeded and only if that rate is exceeded should the performance be rewarded.
The performance criteria for the Senior Executive Bonus Scheme 2003, which applies to sector managing directors, was as follows: a For each 1% of turnover in excess of 97% of budget, the sector managing director will receive 1% of salary as a bonus with a maximum bonus of 13% i. e. achievement of 110% of budgeted turnover.
b For each 1% of profit in excess of 90% up to 95% of budget the sector managing director will receive 0.5% of salary as a bonus.
For each 1% of profit in excess of 95% of budget the sector managing director will receive 1% of salary as a bonus.
RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC 31 Remuneration Report c Where turnover achieved is on or in excess of 100% of budget the profit bonus in b for over 95% will be doubled giving 2% of salary for each 1% of profit over 95%.
The total entitlement in respect of the above is subject to a maximum of 50% of basic salary.
Sir Clive Thompson is not entitled to a bonus in respect of 2003.
Bonuses for executive directors for the year ended 31st December 2003 are summarised in the Pay and Benefits section of this report starting on page 37.
The maximum bonuses for executive directors for the year ending 31st December 2004 will range between 53.3% and 80.0% of basic salary and are summarised below: 2004 MAXIMUM BONUSES 2003 BONUSES AS % OF AS % OF BASIC SALARY BASIC SALARY J C F Wilde 80.0% 3.5% R C Payne 53.3% 2.4% E F Brown 74.0% 1.2% Note: 2003 basic salaries for the purposes of this table are the rates of salary as at 31st December 2003.
2004 salaries are those effective at 1st January 2004.
Bonuses are awarded on or about 1st March following the end of the financial year to which they relate.
In accordance with the companys Bonus and Deferred Share Award Plan, 50% of the annual bonus as calculated above, is paid in cash with the remaining 50% being satisfied by the award of shares in the company.
The number of shares awarded is calculated by reference to the two prices shown in the quotations for the companys shares immediately preceding the date of the award plus one quarter of the difference between these two prices.
The Rentokil Initial Employee Share Trust holds these shares in trust on a conditional basis for a period of one year from the date of award.
The directors interests in shares awarded under the Deferred Share Award Plan in respect of 2002 and 2003 are summarised in the Pay and Benefits section of this report starting on page 37.
Share options The company has share option schemes for approximately five hundred senior executives worldwide.
Schemes have operated since 1973 and new schemes were established with the approval of shareholders in 1989, 1996 and 2000.
The exercise price for share options is the mid-market closing price immediately preceding the date of grant.
Grants of share options up to and including 1999 were based upon individual performance and conditional on the achievement of a 15% increase in basic earnings per share in the financial year preceding the date of grant, which was duly achieved.
Share options granted in the period 1996 to 1999 inclusive were subject to an exercise condition under which the earnings per share of the company needed to be at least 2% 3% in 1999 in excess of the UK rate of inflation over a period of three years, which was duly achieved.
Grants of share options under the Discretionary Approved and Discretionary schemes Discretionary Schemes, which were approved by shareholders in 2000, are calculated by reference to base salaries and management grade in the company.
The Committee sought the advice of the remuneration consultants, Watson Wyatt, on both the structure of the Discretionary Schemes and the level of benefits payable under them.
The Committee believes that performance criteria set out below best satisfy the alignment of shareholders interests with those of executive directors in particular and executives in general by ensuring that benefits under the Schemes are only realisable if there has been a material real growth in earnings per share.
There are two levels of qualification under the Discretionary Schemes, Level 1 which 32 RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC applies to all senior executives including executive directors and Level 2 which applies to executive directors and sector managing directors, which may be summarised as follows: Level 1: Before the exercise of an option under Level 1, the companys annual growth in earnings per share on average over the first three consecutive calendar years, commencing in the year in which the option is granted, is at least 4% per annum in excess of the UK rate of inflation or, failing this, the companys annual growth in earnings per share on average over a greater period up to a maximum of ten years is at least 4% in excess of the UK rate of inflation.
Until 2003, the grant of options under Level 1 was in the range of 25% to 150% of basic salary depending on the position of the executive in the company.
During 2003 the Committee reviewed the factors applied to directors and executives salaries when calculating entitlements and accordingly on options granted in 2003 the range of percentages of salary was reduced to 16.7% to 100% of basic salary for further information on executive directors see below.
A summary of the progress towards satisfaction of the performance targets for Level 1 share options, granted since 2000, is set out in the following table: EXERCISE AVERAGE TARGET AVERAGE EPS GRANT PRICE PENCE PERIOD GROWTH % GROWTH % 2000 156.5 2000 to 2003 6.3 4.7 2001 205.25 2001 to 2003 6.1 10.6 2002 266.75 Minimum period has yet to elapse N A N A 2003 204.5 Minimum period has yet to elapse N A N A Level 2: The exercise condition under Level 2 is by reference to total shareholder return calculated by Watson Wyatt, i. e. the appreciation of the share price including reinvested dividends in comparison with the performance of the FTSE 100 Index and a defined group of support services companies being used as comparators, during three consecutive calendar years commencing in the year in which the option is granted, on the following basis: If the company achieves a median performance in relation to the FTSE 100 Index, then 25% of the Level 2 share options will vest, rising pro rata to 50% if the company achieves a performance in the upper quartile of the FTSE 100 and in addition, if the company achieves a median performance in the group of support services companies, then 25% of the Level 2 share options will vest, rising pro rata to 50% if the company achieves a performance in the upper quartile in a group of support services companies.
Before 2003 the number of Level 2 share options granted was 50% to 100% of basic salary depending on the position of the executive in the company, but following the review in 2003 referred to above, the range of factors used in 2003 was 33.3% to 66.6% for further information on executive directors see below.
The performance conditions for Level 2 share options granted have been satisfied as follows: PERCENTAGE EXERCISABLE EXERCISE PERIOD FIXED PERIOD ANY BALANCE GRANT PRICE PENCE OF 3 YEARS WILL HAVE LAPSED 2000 156.5 2000 to 2002 85% 2001 205.25 2001 to 2003 100% 2002 266.75 2002 to 2004 To be established 2003 204.5 2003 to 2005 To be established Note: The exercise price will be adjusted to reflect the cost of holding the shares less the dividend income thereon.
RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC 33 Remuneration Report The companys policy is to grant share options to directors and senior executives annually.
The entitlements of executive directors to the grant of options under the Discretionary Schemes in 2003 see table below were calculated by multiplying their basic salaries by the factors set out below and then dividing by the strike price i. e. the mid-market closing price for the companys shares on the trading day immediately preceding the date of grant : MR J C F WILDE MR R C PAYNE MR E F BROWN Level 1 1.0 0.6666 0.6 Level 2 0.6666 0.4444 0.3333 Note: no share options were granted to Sir Clive Thompson, in either 2002 or 2003 as he retired as an executive in April 2003 and, under the rules of the Discretionary Schemes, no participant is entitled to be granted share options in the period of 18 months preceding his or her retirement.
The Committee is currently reviewing the factors to be applied in 2004.
Executive directors are also members of the savings-related share option scheme, which is approved by the Inland Revenue and which was introduced in 1998.
Details of the executive directors outstanding share options are shown in the Pay and Benefits section of this report starting on page 37.
Pensions Executive directors are members of the Rentokil Initial Pension Scheme.
Their dependants are eligible for dependants pensions and the payment of a lump sum in the event of death in service.
The pension arrangements provide for a pension on retirement of 2 3 basic annual salary after 20 years eligible service.
No other payments to directors are pensionable and there are no unfunded pension promises or similar arrangements to directors.
The executive directors are members of the companys defined benefit pension scheme and their accrued entitlements under the scheme are as set out in the Pay and Benefits section of this report starting on page 37.
Sir Clive Thompson retired as an executive in April 2003 and, on his retirement, receives a pension from the Rentokil Initial Pension Scheme.
Contracts It is the companys policy that executive directors should have rolling contracts subject to one years notice by the company.
The executive directors have rolling contracts which are subject to one years notice by the company and six months notice by the relevant director and are dated as follows: Mr J C F Wilde, 8th April 2002: Mr R C Payne, 7th March 2002: and Mr E F Brown, 6th April 1999.
The companys policy in respect of the notice periods for the termination of executive directors contracts conforms with the Revised Code.
The Committee is fully aware that, under the Revised Code it should take a robust line in reducing compensation to reflect departing directors obligations to mitigate loss.
Sir Clive Thompsons contract as an executive director expired on his retirement on 4th April 2003.
As non-executive chairman, with effect from 5th April 2003, he now has a rolling contract, dated 28th May 2002 subject to twelve months notice by either the company or him.
34 RENTOKIL INITIAL PLC All non-executive directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the board on the recommendation of the non-executive directors fees committee within the limits set by the Articles of Association and based on independent surveys of fees paid to non-executive directors of similar companies.
The basic fee paid to each non-executive director in the year was 35,000.
The chairmen of the remuneration and audit committees are each paid an additional 5,000 per annum.
Also, the deputy chairman receives additional fees of 10,000 per annum for fulfilling that role.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts and they do not participate in any of the companys share option schemes or bonus schemes and are not eligible to join the companys pension scheme as active members.
At the annual general meeting held on 29th May 2003 shareholders approved a proposal that the limit on the annual fees for non-executive directors, which was last reviewed in 1997, be increased from 500,000 to 1,000,000.
The new limit allows for a larger number of non-executive directors required by the most recent corporate governance developments and future increases in directors fees to allow for inflation, changes in duties and market developments.

The performance criterion for a bonus to be paid and deferred shares awarded under the Deferred Share Award Plan is established by the Committee at the commencement of the relevant financial year.
Following the release of the companys preliminary results in respect of the financial year to which the plan relates and if the performance criterion is met, then bonus and deferred shares are respectively paid and awarded.
Deferred shares are held in trust on a conditional basis by the Rentokil Initial Employee Share Trust until the expiry of one year from the date of the award.
The value of shares vested in 2004, in respect of deferred shares awarded on 3rd March 2003, reflects the mid-market closing price for the companys shares of 189.5p on the last trading day before the vesting of the shares.
All share options granted before 2000 are exercisable.
Level 1 share options granted under the Discretionary Schemes in 2000 and subsequently cannot yet be exercised as the performance criteria have yet to be satisfied save for those granted in 2001 where the performance criteria have been satisfied.
85% of Level 2 share options granted in 2000 and 100% of Level 2 share options granted in 2001 are exercisable see table on page 33.
Level 2 share options granted in 2002 and 2003, cannot yet be exercised as the relevant performance criteria have yet to be satisfied.
As a result of the companys total shareholder return in 2001 to 2003 being above the upper quartile of the FTSE 100 Index and above the upper quartile as measured against a sector comparator group see Performance graph and charts on pages 35 and 36, 100% of the Level 2 options granted in March 2001 became exercisable on the third anniversary of their grant in March 2004.
Sir Clive Thompson exercised 993,974 share options in 2003 at a strike price of 122.165p which had a value of 173p per share at the date of exercise namely the mid-market closing price on the date of exercise of the share option and resulted in a total notional gain of 505,287.
No other directors were granted options in the shares of the company or any other group entities.
None of the terms and conditions of share options granted were varied during the year.
All share options must be exercised by the expiry of ten years from their date of grant.

The accrued pension entitlements shown are those that would be paid annually on retirement based on years of service to date.
The increase in accrued pension entitlement during the year reflects additional service.
There were no changes to accrued benefits during the year.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the Actuarial Guidance Note GN11 as published by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries.
The transfer values disclosed above represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of the directors pension benefits.
They do not represent sums payable to individual directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The transfer value of the increase in accrued benefits, required by the Listing Rules, discloses the current value of the increase in accrued benefits that the director has earned in the period, whereas the change in his her transfer value, required by the Companies Act discloses the absolute increase or decrease in his her transfer value and includes the change in value of the accrued benefits that results from market volatility affecting the transfer value at the beginning of the period, as well as the additional value earned in the year.
Members of the scheme have the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions: neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above tables.
No director is a member of a money purchase scheme sponsored by the company.
The information given regarding Sir Clive Thompson takes into account the actuarial position as at 31st December 2003, although he retired in April 2003 and receives a pension from the Rentokil Initial Pension Scheme.
