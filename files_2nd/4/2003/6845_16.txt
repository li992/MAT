DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Composition of the remuneration committee The remuneration committee is appointed by the board and comprises David McCall chairman, Alan Bowkett, Graham Greene and Howard Phillips, all of whom are independent non-executive directors.
There are no cross-directorships or other factors that may interfere with their judgement.
Terms of reference and reporting The committee determines, and annually reviews, all elements of executive directors remuneration.
It approves all contracts of executive directors, and any compensation arrangements arising from their termination.
It also approves all grants of share options to directors and reviews best practice in executive remuneration.
Advisors to the remuneration committee The committee took advice on general remuneration levels and comparator information from Towers Perrin.
Towers Perrin do not provide other services to the company.
The committee received internal advice from Tim Bridge, chief executive, in determining appropriate remuneration and incentive packages for the other executive directors.
Remuneration policy The company operates in a highly competitive market and must attract, motivate and retain high quality directors.
The committee considers current market practice and makes comparisons with turnover, market capitalisation and operational details in a selection of other companies.
The committee has regard to pay and conditions elsewhere within the group.
No director plays any part in determining his own remuneration.
A significant proportion of each executive directors potential remuneration is performance-related, thus aligning the directors interests with those of shareholders and encouraging performance at the highest levels.
Components of directors remuneration The remuneration package of each executive director consists of the following elements: Annual pay Annual pay reflects the responsibilities, market value and sustained performance level of executive directors.
Pay is reviewed annually or when a change in responsibility occurs.
Benefits in kind A range of taxable benefits are available to executive directors, which are listed on page 43.
Bonus Bonus payments are determined by the remuneration committee and awarded where justified by performance.
The executive directors are eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus of up to 75 per cent of their annual pay.
The amount payable is based upon the achievement of financial performance targets for the period, which are agreed in advance by the committee and relate to operating profit and profit before tax, exceptional items and goodwill.
Pensions Tim Bridge and Michael Shallow are entitled to receive a pension of up to two-thirds of annual pay on retirement, subject to their length of service and Inland Revenue limits, under the groups defined benefit pension scheme, which also provides a cash lump sum accrual.
The directors contribute five per cent of their annual pay to the scheme and have a retirement age of sixty.
David Elliott participates in the groups defined contribution pension scheme.
Neil Gillis and Rooney Anand participate in independently arranged defined contribution pension schemes, to which the company contributes at a level equivalent to that of David Elliott.
No element of remuneration other than annual pay is treated as pensionable.
Tim Bridge and Michael Shallow participate in the groups defined benefit pension scheme for death-in-service purposes.
David Elliot, Neil Gillis and Rooney Anand participate in a group death-in-service insurance scheme.
Death benefits in excess of the Inland Revenue maximum, where applicable, are provided through additional insurance.
The cost of this insurance is taxable as a benefit in kind on the directors concerned and disclosed as such in the emoluments table below.
41 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Executive share option scheme Executive directors are rewarded for delivering long-term performance by the phased granting of share options.
The scheme offers them an annual grant with a value of up to the level of their annual pay.
In certain special situations, the remuneration committee can issue shares with an exercise cost of up to four times annual pay.
The committee approves all grants of share options to directors and does not grant options at a discount to the prevailing mid-market price.
Options issued under this scheme can only be exercised between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant and then only if the stretching performance conditions have been met.
These conditions relate to the growth in audited adjusted earnings per share and for awards granted in 2003 04 growth must exceed RPI inflation by 3% per annum, measured over periods of 3, 4 or 5 years relative to the year of grant.
Earnings per share growth has been chosen as the most appropriate performance measure as it directly aligns the long-term interests of shareholders with individual incentive arrangements.
The specific performance measures were selected to ensure that options can only be exercised if shareholders had first benefited from material earnings growth in real terms over a number of years.
Long-term incentive plan The company is proposing a new long-term incentive plan to shareholders at this year's annual general meeting.
Full details of the plan and its position in the company's ongoing remuneration policy are contained in the separate chairman's letter and shareholders' circular accompanying the annual report and accounts.
Employee share schemes In common with all other employees, the executive directors are also entitled to participate in the sharesave and profit share schemes which are offered once each year by the company.
Further details of these schemes are given later in this report, together with the directors entitlements under them.
Remuneration for non-executive directors The fees paid to the chairman and the other non-executive directors are determined by the board as a whole.
They are agreed after taking external advice and making market comparisons, and relate to the services of the directors in connection with the companys business.
The non-executive directors do not have service agreements, cannot participate in the pension schemes, the bonus scheme or share option schemes.
David McCall has a consultancy agreement with the company, details of which are set out below.
No nonexecutive director participates in any decision relating to his own remuneration.
Service agreements Newly appointed executive directors are offered rolling agreements with a notice period required from the company to terminate employment that does not exceed one year.
In the event of the employment of an executive director being terminated, the committee would pay due regard to best practice and take account of the individuals duty to mitigate their loss.
Tim Bridge and Michael Shallow each have a rolling service agreement with the company dated 29 September 1995 that entitles them to a two year notice period from the company to terminate their employment.
The agreements provide for the company to augment the directors pension entitlements if their term of service is terminated early.
The other executive directors have one year contracts which do not have any additional terms relating to compensation for termination of employment.

43 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT The Inland Revenue earnings cap restricts the pension that the scheme can provide for Michael Shallow.
The scheme pension will, therefore, be supplemented through a funded unapproved pension arrangement, operating on a targeted defined contribution basis.
Following an actuarial review, some deficit funding is now being undertaken.
As a result, the companys contribution to the fund for the period in respect of Michael Shallow is 80,600 2002 - 78,500.
Similar restrictions apply to the pensions for David Elliot, Neil Gillis and Rooney Anand, who therefore participate in funded unapproved arrangements operating on a defined contribution basis.
The company pays a supplement to pay in respect of the tax liability incurred from payments to funded unapproved arrangements and such supplements are disclosed as other cash benefits in the emoluments data shown above.
Payments from the company made in the financial year in respect of defined contribution pension arrangements are shown in the table below.
2003 2002 Rooney Anand 18,989 13,512 David Elliott 26,734 25,056 Neil Gillis 19,687 18,515 Two former directors receive additional pension income from the company.
John Bridge, who retired as a director on 31 December 1989, receives a pension of 10,123 pa in excess of his scheme entitlements and Bernard Tickner, who retired as a director on 27 August 1992, receives a pension of 8,035 pa in excess of his scheme entitlements.
As required by law, both of these figures are stated net of their company-funded pension in payment at 31 March 1997.
