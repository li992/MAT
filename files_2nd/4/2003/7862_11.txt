This is reviewed by the most senior executive within the relevant business and any major risk issues are referred to the Executive Committee at least quarterly.
The Executive Committee makes regular reports to the Board on major business risks faced by individual operations and by the Group and how it is proposed that those risks be managed.
Through this process business risks are identified, assessed and ranked according to their nature and urgency and the Board considers what measures would be appropriate in order to manage such risks.
The Board has clearly defined those matters which are reserved to it and the respective delegated authorities of its committees and the executive directors.
The Group has a clear organisational structure and well established reporting and control disciplines.
Managers of operating units assume responsibility for and exercise a high degree of autonomy in running day-to-day trading activities.
