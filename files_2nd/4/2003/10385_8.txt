Remuneration Report This Report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 which introduced new statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after 31 December 2002.
The Report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, a Resolution to approve the Report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Regulations require the Auditors to report to the Companys members on the auditable part of the Directors Remuneration Report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the Report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
The Report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Information Not Subject to Audit Remuneration Committee The Committee consists of four of the Companys Non-Executive Directors, Donald C Macpherson Chairman, Sir John Jennings, Manish J Chande and David C Ord.
Nigel F Swiffen was a member of the Committee until shortly prior to his retirement on 29 January 2003.
The Committee consults the Chairman and Chief Executive about its proposals and has access to professional advice from outside the Company.
During the year, the Committee did not receive any material assistance from any external professional advisers.
Remuneration Policy The basic salaries and other benefits of the Executive Directors are determined by the Committee in the light of the need to attract, retain and motivate Directors of the calibre needed and to reward them for enhancing value to Shareholders.
The Committee has regard to executive remuneration packages of similar jobs in comparative groups of companies.
There are no current plans to change this package for future years.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the Company providing permission is sought from the Chairman or Chief Executive.
Components of Remuneration Components of remuneration are: Basic salary determined by the Committee and reviewed annually on 1 April.
Performance related bonus based on improvements in profits before taxation and or earnings per share.
Ruby McGregor-Smiths bonus was guaranteed until 1 April 2003 when her terms became consistent with the other Executive Directors.
Pension contributions through membership of the Companys pension scheme.
Basic salary alone is pensionable.
Contracts of Service All Executive Directors have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of one years notice.
There are no provisions for compensation payable upon early termination in the Directors contracts.
Non-Executive Directors Remuneration The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board and reflects the knowledge and experience which they bring to the Group.
They do not participate in the Companys bonus or share schemes.
They are appointed under fixed term agreements, and, are not members of the Company pension scheme nor do they receive taxable benefits in kind.
Sir John Jennings, Donald C Macphersons, Manish J Chandes and David C Ords remuneration comprises shares in MITIE Group PLC at the market value on the issue date.
Performance Graph MITIEs TSR vs FTSE Mid 250 index The following graph shows the Companys performance, measured by total shareholder return TSR, compared with the performance of the FTSE Mid 250 index over the past five years.
The Committee believes that this comparison provides a clear picture of how well the Company has performed relative to a range of companies of a comparable size.
TSR is defined as the return Shareholders would receive if they held a notional number of shares and received dividends on those shares over a period of time.
It measures the percentage growth in the Companys share price together with the value of any dividends paid, assuming that the dividends are re-invested into the Companys shares.
