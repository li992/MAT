Directors Remuneration Report Introduction This Report has been prepared in compliance with the UKLA Listing Rules and the disclosure provisions under Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985.
In accordance with these provisions, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Companys AGM in May.
Details of the resolution can be found in the Circular accompanying this report.
Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee consists entirely of Non-Executive Directors and its members for the first part of the year were Mr Collum Chairman, Mr Jackson and Dr Jaffe.
Following the retirement of Mr Jackson and Mr Collum from the Board, Dr Read, Mr Rogerson and Mr Cadbury were appointed to the Committee Dr Read as Chairman.
Dr Jaffe remains a member of the Committee.
The Committee met three times during 2003 and seeks independent advice, where appropriate, for the purpose of determining all aspects of the remuneration of Executive Directors.
The remuneration of each Executive Director is determined by the Committee including the award of annual bonuses and share options, as are the terms of their service agreements.
When appropriate, the Committee invites the views of the Group Chairman, Dr Fellner, Group Chief Executive Dr Ando, Group Human Resources Director, Mr Nicholls and commissions reports from expert remuneration consultants.
In determining salary and bonus levels for 2003, the Committee took account of a report on executive directors remuneration published by Deloitte & Touche in October 2002.
During 2003 Deloitte & Touche has provided general taxation advice to the Company.
The Committee also recommends to the Board the fees paid to the Chairman.
The members of the Committee do not participate in determining or recommending their own fees.
The fees of the NonExecutive Directors are determined by the Board on the joint recommendation of the Chairman and the Chief Executive.
Policy on remuneration of Executive Directors In determining the Groups policy on remuneration, the Committee has concluded that there is need for an updated review of the current benchmarks and measures used to determine Executive Directors remuneration.
The Committee has recently appointed Deloitte & Touche to advise the Committee on this review which, in proposing a forward-looking remuneration policy, will take full account of current best practice and the Companys size and complexity and business sector comparisons.
Celltech is one of Europes largest biotechnology companies and also operates a significant business within the US.
It is and will continue to be Celltechs policy to provide remuneration generally at levels that are competitive with companies of equivalent size and complexity.
It remains the objective of the Board, advised by the Committee, to provide remuneration packages that are competitive and designed to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and senior management of the highest calibre.
As well as base salaries, Executive Directors are eligible for performance-related bonuses and medium long-term incentives thus providing for a high proportion of total remuneration to be performance related.
Performance measures are balanced between absolute financial measures and company comparator indicators with the aim of achieving alignment between Executive Director and shareholder objectives.
All medium and long-term incentives are delivered in the form of Celltech shares and share options.
In order to link further each Executive Directors interests to the interests of shareholders, Celltech expects Executive Directors to commit to building and maintaining a personal shareholding of approximately one times base salary.
The application of the Companys current policy to the remuneration of any person who serves as an Executive Director of the Company is set out below.
Components of the remuneration package The principal components of Executive Directors remuneration packages are base salary, short-term incentives, medium long-term incentives, and pension benefits.
The policy in relation to each of these components, and key terms of the various incentive and benefit programmes, are explained further below.
Base salary Base salaries are reviewed annually taking into account recommendations on individual performance and salary levels in comparable companies.
In determining salary levels for 2003, the Committee took into account the findings of the report published by Deloitte & Touche in October 2002, referred to earlier, as a reference for its comparator company review.
The Committee continued the policy, based upon the framework established in 2001, of setting Executive Directors salaries in broad alignment with the mid-points of a bespoke comparator group drawn from the lower 30 constituents of the FTSE 100 and the upper 50 constituents of the FTSE mid-250 index adjusted to reflect company size and complexity.
This bespoke group, whilst not providing sector-specific benchmarks, is based on comparator companies which are more comparable to Celltech in terms of company size and are therefore, potentially, more relevant benchmarks.
Performance-related bonuses Executive Directors are eligible for an annual discretionary bonus, whereby performance objectives for each Executive Director are established at the beginning of the financial year by reference to corporate and individual achievements.
Performance-related payments may be paid annually, dependent upon achievements measured against objectives.
Executive Directors are entitled to bonuses in the form of cash and a deferred bonus under the Companys Deferred Bonus Plan.
Cash bonuses are limited to a maximum of 40 percent of base salary for each Executive Director with a maximum of 50 percent in the case of the Group Chief Executive.
Deferred bonus awards may be made over shares having a value of up to 100 percent of the Directors annual cash bonus, which, as stated above, is itself based on individual performance objectives being met and is not, therefore, subject to any further performance conditions.
Deferred awards vest in two equal tranches, on the first and second anniversaries of the date on which the award is made and on vesting, the award converts to a share option which is exercisable over 10 years.
Participation is at the discretion of the Committee.
Celltech operates the 28 Celltech Annual Report 2003 Plan in order to provide additional incentives to its key senior executives, recognising that the retention and recruitment of such employees is critical to the Companys long-term success.
The overall effect allows for Executive Directors to be awarded up to 80 percent of their base salary as performance-related bonuses 100 percent in the case of the Group Chief Executive.
Longer-term performance incentives Executive Directors are also incentivised by the grant of share options.
Executive options are granted under the rules of the Celltech Group plc 2001 Discretionary Share Option Scheme adopted by shareholders at the AGM in 2001.
The allocation of discretionary share options takes into account the future potential contribution of each Director.
Options are subject to a performance requirement determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Currently, this performance requirement is that options granted under the Scheme will only become exercisable if Celltechs share price has exceeded the median growth in share price of a comparator group of companies over a period of three to five years from the date of grant of the options.
The performance criterion is measured cumulatively over the performance period, which means that if the performance criterion has not been met on the third anniversary of the date of grant, the options may still be capable of exercise provided that the performance criterion is met during the performance period commencing at the date of grant and ending on or prior to the fifth anniversary of the date of grant.
If the performance measure has not been met after the fifth anniversary of the date of grant of the option, the option is not normally capable of exercise other than for a period of six weeks prior to expiration of the options on the tenth anniversary of their grant, when options are capable of exercise without restriction save for continued employment.
The scheme was proposed on the basis that measurement of performance from a fixed date, coupled with non-exercisability of options after five years if the target was not met, reflected the core principles of the Association of British Insurers Guidelines applicable at the time.
The scheme will be reviewed as part of the overall remuneration policy review to be undertaken with Deloitte & Touche in 2004.
The Committee reviews annually the most appropriate performance measures based upon which options may be granted and or become exercisable.
The Committee concluded that whilst it is utilising income generated from its pharmaceuticals business primarily to fund its Research and Development R&D programmes for its new products, the most appropriate measure of performance remains share price growth against a group of comparator companies of a similar size.
It will continue to review whether, at an appropriate time in the future, growth in earnings per share or another measure may be more appropriate.
The comparator group selected for performance measurement was a total of approximately 80 companies, comprising larger members of the FTSE mid-250 index and smaller members of the FTSE 100 index.
This comparator group is reviewed at the time each grant of options is made.
Performance will be measured by calculating the share price growth for each company within the comparator group.
The median ie, the middle when ranked from highest to lowest of the calculated growth figures will be taken and will then be compared with share price growth, over the same period, for Celltech.
The current constituents of the comparator group applicable to 2003 awards, excluding the Company, are: Dixons Group Taylor Woodrow Whitbread Wimpey Shire Pharmaceuticals Debenhams delisted 5.12.03 Exel AWG ICI Enterprise Inns Capita Group Johnston Press Reuters Group First Group Tomkins Barratt Developments Rexam William Hill Granada now ITV Cattles Cable & Wireless RMC Group Xstrata Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Canary Wharf Group ICAP Alliance Unichem Aggregate Industries Provident Financial Matalan Schroders plc IMI Hays Berkeley Group Friends Provident Pennon Group GKN International Power Rank Group BBA Group Tate & Lyle Easyjet Hammerson Egg Antofagasta EMI Group Associated British Ports Hldgs Wood Group Slough Estates LogicaCMG BPB Wilson Bowden P&O Viridian Group Burberry Group United Business Media Signet Group Close Brothers Trinity Mirror Northern Foods Rolls-Royce Galen Holdings Persimmon Davis Service Group plc Jardine Lloyd Thompson MFI Lonmin Thistle Hotels Travis Perkins Inchcape Brambles Industries Arriva Misys WH Smith Cobham Eurotunnel PLC Electrocomponents Kelda Group British Airways Celltech Annual Report 2003 29 Directors Remuneration Report continued The limit on the market value of shares, which may be placed under option annually for each Executive Director, is set by the Committee.
The overriding limit on the grant of options to an individual in any year under the 2001 Scheme is normally four times remuneration, except in very exceptional circumstances at the discretion of the Committee.
This limit does not include options granted solely for the purpose of compensating UK employees for the cost of bearing Celltechs liability to employers National Insurance Contributions.
In practice, this limit has not normally exceeded 1.5 times a participants annual remuneration ie, salary plus annual cash bonus opportunity.
Options that are over shares worth more than two times remuneration will be subject to more demanding conditions.
It is the current policy that, for such options, share price growth must exceed the median by at least 5 percent.
Executive Directors also hold options under the Celltech Chiroscience 1999 Executive Share Option Scheme and the Celltech Group 1993 Executive Share Option Scheme.
The performance conditions applicable to options under these schemes are set out on pages 36 and 37.
Options are no longer granted under these schemes.
Since 2001, executive options have been granted under the Celltech Group plc 2001 Discretionary Share Option Scheme.
The Company also operates a SAYE Share Option Scheme for eligible employees and Directors.
Under this Scheme, all eligible Directors and employees are invited to subscribe for options, which, may be granted at a discount of up to 20 percent of market value.
This is an all-employee plan to which performance conditions do not apply.
Full details of Directors interests in ordinary shares of the Company, together with options granted and exercised in 2003, are set out on pages 34 to 36.
Pensions and other benefits audited Dr Fellner is a member of a contributory money purchase scheme funded with the objective to provide a pension of up to two-thirds of final pensionable salary by a normal retirement age of 60.
In recognition of the significant and valuable services Dr Fellner provided to the Company in his 12 years as Chief Executive the Remuneration Committee unanimously agreed to fulfil the Companys obligation to provide a pension to Dr Fellner at the age of 60.
Accordingly, a full years contribution was made in 2003 to Dr Fellner to his normal retirement age of 60 as at 31 December 2003.
The Companys contribution is disclosed in the remuneration table on page 33.
Mrs Ingelise Saunders is a member of the Celltech Group Personal Pension Plan, which is a defined contribution scheme.
Dr Gran Ando, Mr Peter Allen and Dr Melanie Lee participate in the Executive Director tier of the Celltech Pension and Life Assurance Scheme CP&LAS.
The CP&LAS is a funded, Inland Revenue approved, final salary occupational pension scheme providing a pension of up to two-thirds of final pensionable salary by Normal Retirement Age NRA.
The NRA in the Executive Director tier of the Scheme is 60.
The potential benefits arising from the CP&LAS in 2003 were as follows: Name P V Allen M G Lee G Ando Age 48 45 55 Service 11 years 5 years 259 days 325 days 92 days Accrued pension as at 1 1 03 35,283 13,776 Inflation 600 234 Increase in annual pension accruing in 2003 3,356 3,322 2,342 Accrued annual pension as at 31 12 03 39,239 17,332 2,342 Transfer value of accrued pension at the start of the year based on market conditions at 31 12 02 321,378 114,220 Employee contribution 5,913 5,913 4,188 Increase in cash equivalent transfer value of pension arising in 2003 less member contributions paid in 2003.

30 Celltech Annual Report 2003 Appointment of Directors and service contracts Service contracts for Executive Directors including those subject to election at this years AGM provide for 12 months notice of termination by the Company.
A Director or the Company may also serve three months notice of termination within six months after a change of control of the Company.
The Committee believes that the inclusion of a change of control provision in a Directors service contract is in the best interests of the Company and provides a means for attracting, retaining and motivating Directors.
Contractual compensation payable on termination following a change of control is no greater than that payable on termination subject to 12 months notice as set out below.
The Committee has determined that all future appointments to the Board will be on the terms of a contract that can be terminated by the Company at any time on 12 months notice.
Typically, on termination, Directors have been paid contractual compensation salary, bonus and noncash benefits in lieu of 12 months notice as set out below.
