36 P&O Annual Report 2003 Directors remuneration report Directors remuneration report This report complies with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations, has been approved by the directors and will be put to stockholders for approval at the annual general meeting on 14 May 2004.
Remuneration committee The remuneration committee consists entirely of independent non-executive directors and is chaired by Sir John Collins.
The other members of the committee during 2003 were Rodney Galpin, Michael Everard and Sir David Brown.
Towers Perrin, who provide advice on other remuneration issues from time to time, were appointed by the committee to provide independent advice to the committee on executive directors remuneration.
In addition, the committee consults with the Chairman and Chief Executive officer as appropriate with regard to its proposals relating to the remuneration of the executive directors.
Policy The policy of the committee is to review executive directors remuneration based on an independent assessment of market practice.
The total remuneration package of the executive directors is structured to attract, retain and motivate executive directors.
The committee has, in consultation with its advisers, conducted an annual review of executive directors remuneration, including bonuses and long term incentives, to ensure consistency with market practice, local conditions and business objectives.
The major proportion of the remuneration package for executive directors is performance-related assuming maximum performance in respect of the performance-related elements.
This includes participation in the Companys long term incentive plans, which consist of a Deferred Bonus and Co-investment Matching Plan the Matching Plan and an Executive Stock Option Plan the ESOP, which are described in more detail below.
The performance conditions and policies relating to long term incentives and directors remuneration packages were approved by stockholders in October 2000 and have not been materially altered since that date.
The total remuneration package is designed to align the interests of executive directors with those of stockholders.
The Company intends as set out under Other share related benets below, to amend the rules of the ESOP, subject to stockholder approval.
The remuneration committee further intends to undertake during 2004 a comprehensive review of directors remuneration.
In any event, in recognition of the views of our investors, the Company proposes to grant no further options which provide for re-testing of the performance hurdle.
This report sets out the Companys policy on executive remuneration for 2004 and, so far as practicable, for subsequent years.
The inclusion in the report of remuneration policy in respect of years after 2004 is required by the Regulations.
The committee cannot be certain that its remuneration policy will continue without amendment in 2004 or subsequent years.
The committee considers that a successful remuneration policy needs to be sufciently exible to take account of future changes in the Companys business environment and in remuneration practice and, as stated above, a comprehensive review of directors remuneration will be undertaken in 2004.
In addition, where necessary in order to recruit a director of sufficient calibre the remuneration committee may consider it appropriate to enter into special arrangements for the benefit of that director.
Any changes in policy will be described in future reports, which will continue to be subject to stockholder approval.
All statements in this report in relation to remuneration policy for years after 2004 should be read in light of this paragraph.
Except as noted above, there are no current proposals to change this policy.
Components of remuneration The remuneration package of executive directors comprises annual salary, an annual bonus scheme, share option and long term incentive plans, pension arrangements and certain benets in kind for example health cover, car benets and accommodation where relevant to their role.
In some cases directors take their pension and other benets in the form of a cash equivalent payment.
Base salary Base salaries of executive directors are reviewed annually and are set at levels which reect the level of responsibility of the executive directors concerned and ensure that they are competitive with pay for executive directors holding equivalent positions in comparable companies.
The benchmark levels represent remuneration data across industries and reect factors including company size, reporting level and international accountability.
Annual performance bonus Executive directors participate in a bonus scheme which is linked to the achievement of demanding business and corporate objectives including return on capital employed and other key performance indicators.
Bonus targets for 2003 were based on return on capital employed and other financial targets set for the Group and the main operating divisions.
These targets are generally profit related but may include performance against business-specic performance indicators.
Bonus targets for 2004 for Head Ofce directors will also include the requirement to achieve key strategic objectives set by the remuneration committee.
All incentive targets are set by the committee and are designed to be demanding.
Financial targets are normally set above those for the prior year, but having regard to the anticipated trading environment.
The maximum annual bonus that can be earned is generally 75 per cent of salary.
Two thirds of any bonus up to 75 per cent of salary is paid in cash with the balance awarded as a Stock Award under the Matching Plan, as described below.
The committee has over-riding discretion in determining the payment of bonuses.
Long term incentives As stated above, the Companys long term incentive plans comprise the Matching Plan and the ESOP.
P&O Annual Report 2003 37 Directors remuneration report The Matching Plan The Matching Plan provides participants with the opportunity to receive matching awards of deferred stock depending upon the performance of the Company over a two year retention period following the year in which an original bonus-related award is earned.
As noted above, one third of any annual bonus awarded to directors and other executives who are participants in the Matching Plan is in the form of a Stock Award which is automatically invested in the Matching Plan.
The Board believes that, in order to further align participants interests with those of stockholders, participants should be encouraged to commit their own resources to the Matching Plan.
Therefore participants also have a choice of investing their own funds in further deferred stock in the Company described as Invested Stock subject to an overall limit for directors on the amount invested in the Matching Plan in any one year of 75 per cent of base salary.
Subject to the discretion of the Matching Plan Trustee, Matching Plan participants receive Matching Awards.
Matching Awards entitle the participants to acquire a maximum amount of deferred stock which, at the date of grant, has a value equal to the aggregate value of the executives Stock Award and Invested Stock valuing Invested Stock on a gross of tax basis.
The amount of deferred stock over which a Matching Award may be exercised is dependent on the Companys total shareholder return TSR over the retention period compared to that of the other companies in the FTSE 350 index.
If the Company achieves median performance a participant is entitled to exercise 25 per cent of his Matching Award and if the Company achieves upper quartile performance, a participant will be entitled to exercise 100 per cent of his Matching Award.
For performance between median and upper quartile, entitlement is calculated on a straight line basis.
These targets are subject to review by the committee in subsequent years.
Matching Awards are only exercisable if a secondary validating performance condition is also met.
This requires earnings per share growth after appropriate adjustments to ensure consistency throughout the period over the retention period to exceed the growth in the UK Index of Retail Prices by an average of at least 3 per cent per annum.
The rules of the Matching Plan permit the adoption of a different performance condition if at the time of a grant of awards under the Matching Plan it is thought appropriate to do so, provided that the replacement conditions are no less demanding.
During 2002, the Company reported a negative EPS and accordingly application of the formula for EPS growth would result in a less stretching hurdle.
Therefore, the remuneration committee resolved that the secondary validating performance condition for the 2002 awards under the Matching Plan would be that the growth in P&Os pre-tax and exceptional items profit per 1 nominal of deferred stock over the retention period must exceed the growth in the UK Index of Retail Prices by an average of at least 3 per cent per annum.
These performance conditions were chosen since they were considered the most appropriate for determining the Companys performance.
They were established after consultation with the Association of British Insurers and the Companys largest stockholders.
Other share related benets In 2003 the executive directors were eligible to receive annual grants of stock options under the ESOP.
Annual grants are normally made up to an aggregate face value of 150 per cent of base annual salary subject to the employers national insurance contributions adjustment referred to below unless the committee considers that exceptional circumstances exist to justify a higher amount.
Options under this Plan are generally exercisable three years after the date of grant subject to the achievement of performance conditions and remain exercisable until the tenth anniversary of grant.
Performance conditions are generally based on the achievement of earnings per share EPS growth after appropriate adjustments to ensure consistency throughout the period of an average of at least 3 per cent per annum in excess of the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index over a period of at least three years from grant.
This was considered to be an appropriate hurdle and consistent with market practice at the time the ESOP was adopted.
The Company reported negative EPS for 2002 and accordingly application of the formula for EPS growth would result in a less stretching hurdle.
Therefore, the remuneration committee resolved that options granted during 2003 will not normally be exercisable unless the growth in P&Os pre-tax and exceptional items profit per 1 nominal of deferred stock over a period of at least three years from grant exceeds the percentage increase in the UK Index of Retail Prices by an average of at least 3 per cent per annum.
The Company will not grant further options which allow re-testing of the performance hurdle.
There is a facility for the Company to require optionholders to assume the Companys liability for employers national insurance contributions due on the exercise of unapproved stock options.
The Company may grant additional options in recognition of the liability that optionholders assume.
As noted in the report of the directors, it is proposed to seek stockholder approval to amend the rules of the ESOP to enable the Company to satisfy the exercise of both existing and future options by the issue of only that amount of stock which has a value, at the time of exercise, equal to the net gain resulting from the exercise, that is, the difference between the market price on the day of exercise of the amount of stock under the option and the total exercise price payable.
Further information on this proposal and the accompanying stockholder resolution are set out in the notice of meeting.
Executive directors may also participate, subject to the usual limits, in the P&O Save As You Earn Stock Option Scheme the P&O SAYE Scheme on the same terms as other employees.
The P&O SAYE Scheme operates within specic tax legislation including a requirement to finance the exercise of the option using the proceeds of a monthly savings contract and exercise of the option is not subject to satisfaction of a performance target since this is an all employee share scheme.
As part of his remuneration package to rejoin the Company as Chief Financial officer, Nick Luff was granted certain one-off long term incentive benets as set out under Directors interests in shares on pages 40 to 43.
Service contracts No executive director has a service contract of more than twelve months with the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
All executive directors service contracts are reissued with effect from 1 January in each year and are subject to twelve months notice by either party except that in the exceptional circumstance where an executive director will be or has been materially adversely affected by the pension taxation changes in the Finance Act 2004 or any subsequent legislation he will be entitled to give six months notice.
Lord Sterling will retire as Chairman at the 2005 annual general meeting.
The Chairman and the executive directors have service contracts which provide for payments in lieu of notice equivalent to 38 P&O Annual Report 2003 Directors remuneration report 12 months base salary and benets.
Compensation payable upon early termination other than under the payment in lieu of notice provisions would be based on the contractual entitlement to salary and benets subject to mitigation.
Non-executive directors The remuneration of non-executive directors is decided by the Board.
Non-executive directors receive a base fee and they also receive fees for additional services such as being a member of or chairing a Board committee.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for incentive schemes or other benets.
Currently, the Companys Regulations limit the base fee for non-executive directors to 25,000 per annum.
This excludes fees for additional services such as membership or chairmanship of Board committees.
The base fee of non-executive directors of the Company has not been increased since 1994.
During that period the time commitment of non-executive directors together with the complexity and responsibility of the role have increased signicantly.
Non-executive directors of the Company are now required to commit to provide up to 25 days per annum of their time as required by the Company.
A resolution will be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting that the limit on the total remuneration of the non-executive directors in aggregate, excluding the remuneration of the Chairman, should be increased to 0.5 million per annum including the fees for additional services, committee membership and chairmanship.
This increased limit takes account of the Companys intention to increase the number of its non-executive directors in order to comply with the revised Combined Code and the need to recruit and retain the high calibre candidates that the Board wishes to attract.
Such a limit also provides headroom for further changes in non-executive directors remuneration which the Board determines in the future.
Subject to the passing of such resolution, the Board intends to adopt the following revised remuneration structure for non-executive directors, which will be subject to annual review by the Board: Base fee 30,000 per annum Committee membership fee 5,000 per annum per committee Committee chairmanship fee 5,000 per annum Senior non-executive director 5,000 per annum Remuneration, Audit and Risk Committee only The unexpired term of service of the non-executive directors subject to re-election by stockholders is: Sir David Brown: 15 January 2007 Sir John Collins: 31 December 2005 Michael Everard: 31 December 2005 Rodney Galpin: 31 March 2005 All letters of appointment are subject to twelve months notice by either party.
Performance graph Cumulative TSR Performance In line with the Regulations, the following graph compares the 175 performance of the Companys deferred stock on a TSR basis for the past five years against the FTSE 350 Index.
This index 150 has been selected as P&O is a constituent of the FTSE 350 and uses this index for its comparator group for the Matching Plan.
125 However, the line representing the FTSE 350 on the graph is based on the market index weighted by market capitalisation 100 whereas the Matching Plan is based on the performance of the companies comprising the FTSE 350 at the commencement of 75 the relevant performance period.
TSR is shown as the value of 100 invested in P&O and in the FTSE 350 index over the five year period.
50 P&Os TSR data has been adjusted to exclude the value 25 attributable to P&O Princess Cruises by reference to the proportionate value of the two businesses at the demerger date.
0 TSR is calculated for each year relative to the base date of Jan-99 Dec-99 Dec-00 Dec-01 Dec-02 Dec-03 1 January 1999 and taking the percentage change of the market price over the relevant period, reinvesting any dividends at the P&O using historically adjusted P&O data ex-dividend date.

The remuneration committee agreed that within three months after the date of his appointment as Chief Financial officer on 14 May 2003, Nick Luff could contribute two tranches of invested stock to the Matching Plan, being the 2004 Award and the 2005 Award.
Accordingly on 18 June 2003, Nick Luff purchased a total of 135,000 nominal of deferred stock which was split equally between a 2004 Award and a 2005 Award.
It was also agreed that a Matching Award of 112,500 nominal of deferred stock would be granted in relation to each of the 2004 Award and the 2005 Award.
It was agreed that the performance period applicable to the 2004 Matching Award shall be the period starting on 1 January 2003 and ending on 31 December 2004 and the performance period applicable to the 2005 Matching Award shall be the period starting on 1 January 2003 and ending on 31 December 2005.
The performance targets for these awards are the same as for other awards granted under the Matching Plan during 2003 and described above.
The remuneration committee also agreed that Nick Luff would be granted an option under the ESOP to acquire such amount of deferred stock as has an aggregate exercise price being the closing market value of the stock at the date of grant of 2.5 times his basic annual salary.
This option was granted on 18 June 2003 at an exercise price of 223p and further details of the grant are set out on page 43.
The Companys register of directors interests which is open to inspection at the Companys head ofce contains full details of directors holdings of stock and options.
No director had interests, whether beneficial or non-beneficial, in the Companys preferred stock or debenture stocks or in the share capital, loan stocks or debenture stocks of the Companys subsidiaries at the beginning or end of the year or at the date of this report.
No director had a material interest in any contract of signicance with the Company or any subsidiary, joint venture or associate during the year.
As potential beneciaries of the P&O Employee benefit Trust, the executive directors are technically deemed to be interested in deferred stock of the Company held by the Trust.
At 31 December 2003, the Trust held 7,327,038 nominal of deferred stock.
The interests in the deferred stock of four executive directors have increased by a total of 203 nominal of deferred stock as a result of the reinvestment of dividends in their personal equity plans and individual savings accounts between 31 December 2003 and the date of this report.
96 97 LTIP Awards Prior to the demerger of P&O Princess Cruises on 23 October 2000, the Company operated a Long Term Incentive Plan the LTIP.
Awards granted under the LTIP in relation to the 1996 97 performance period vested on 1 January 2000 and remain exercisable until 27 March 2005, however all such awards held by directors have now been exercised.
42 P&O Annual Report 2003 Directors remuneration report P&O LTIP Roll over Awards At the time of the demerger, awards granted under the LTIP in relation to the 1996 99 performance period were allowed to vest and participants could choose to exercise such awards and acquire the underlying deferred stock.
Executives were also given the opportunity to release such awards in consideration for the grant by the Company of replacement awards and related matching awards under the rules of the Matching Plan.
The amount of deferred stock that may be acquired under the matching awards is dependent on the TSR performance of the Company relative to that of the FTSE 350.
The value of the deferred stock over which the LTIP roll over awards were granted was equivalent to the value of the deferred stock the subject of the released LTIP award after adjustment for notional reinvestment of the P&O Princess Cruises shares received on demerger.
One half of an individuals LTIP roll over award represented a 2001 LTIP award and the other half represented a 2002 LTIP award.
The 2001 LTIP award became exercisable from 7 March 2002 and the 2002 LTIP award became exercisable from 6 March 2003.
The related matching awards were linked to the TSR performance of the Company over the period from 24 October 2000 to 31 December 2001 and 31 December 2002 respectively.
The Companys TSR performance over the period from 24 October 2000 to 31 December 2001 resulted in a ranking position of 141 out of 324 companies.
Therefore, each participants 2001 LTIP roll over matching award became exercisable over deferred stock equal to 45 per cent of their 2001 LTIP roll over award.
For the period from 24 October 2000 to 31 December 2002, the Companys TSR performance resulted in a ranking position of 129 out of 315 companies resulting in each participants 2002 LTIP roll over becoming exercisable over deferred stock equal to 53 per cent of their 2002 LTIP roll over matching award.
All P&O LTIP Roll over Awards have now been exercised.
Stock Awards No Stock Awards were granted to directors during 2003 in respect of bonus payments for the 2002 financial year, because the executive directors waived their entitlement to bonus payments for 2002.
The Trustee waives its right to receive dividends on stock held in the Trust and the amount of stock to which Stock Awards relate increased during the year, due to additional P&O deferred stock purchased by the Trustee which had a value equivalent to the value of the dividend foregone.
Stock Awards are eligible for Matching Awards in accordance with the rules of the Matching Plan as described above.
The terms of the Matching Plan are summarised on page 37.
Stock Awards are subject to a retention period of two years from the date of grant.
Stock Awards granted in 2002 are exercisable from 4 March 2004.
The period in which a replacement option is exercisable is identical to that of the option it replaced.
The exercise of replacement options is not subject to performance conditions.
The other options shown above were granted as part of general grants of options to a large number of executives, further details of which are provided above.
1 Previously exercisable from 1 April 2002 to 1 April 2009: performance conditions amended on cessation of directorship 2 Previously exercisable from 17 March 2003 to 17 March 2010: performance conditions amended on cessation of directorship 3 Previously exercisable from 23 October 2003 to 23 October 2010: performance conditions amended on cessation of directorship 4 Previously exercisable from 17 September 2004 to 17 September 2011: performance conditions amended on cessation of directorship 5 Previously exercisable from 24 September 2005 to 24 September 2012: performance conditions amended on cessation of directorship References above to amendment of the performance conditions refer to the waiver of such conditions by the exercise of a discretion as provided under therules of the ESOP.
There were no gains made by directors on the exercise of options in 2003 or 2002.
The mid-market price of the deferred stock at 31 December 2003 was 230p 2002 165p.
The highest mid-market price during the year was 285.5p and the lowest mid-market price was 145.25p.
No directors options lapsed during the year.

Lord Sterling has ceased to accrue further pension rights.
The pension in columns C and D above, reect the UK Schemes late retirement provisions.
The transfer values indicated in columns E, F and G demonstrate the change in cost to the UK Scheme of providing the late retirement benets, given prevailing market conditions.
In accordance with Inland Revenue Regulations he is not entitled to transfer his benets out of the UK Scheme.
Sir Bruce MacPhail has ceased to accrue further pension rights.
The explanations provided above in relation to Lord Sterling also apply to Sir Bruce MacPhail.
Michael Gradons pension rights in the event of early retirement would be affected by various historical provisions, which have not been available to new directors for some years.
The actual pension payable would depend on his age and service and whether his retirement was voluntary or compulsory.
The various provisions would start to apply from age 47 and begin to fall away gradually after age 55.
The maximum effect of these provisions would be on retirement from service at age 55, where the value of the standard provisions reected above could be enhanced by up to 40 per cent.
Russ Peters joined the Board on 11 June 2003.
The pension and transfer value indicated in columns A and B above allow for service from 11 June 2003.
All other pension and transfer values indicated in columns C to G above reect all pensionable service in the UK Scheme.
Charles Rice stood down from the Board and left the Group on 30 June 2003, at which point his accrued pension in the UK Scheme became payable.
In accordance with the UK Scheme rules, he elected to commute part of his pension for a cash sum of 300,000.
The gures in columns A and B above allow for both the pension in payment and the commutation payment and are calculated as at 30 June 2003, based on market conditions at 31 December 2003.
The transfer value quoted in column E above is the value of the pension in column C. Having met the 25 year service and the age criteria by 30 June 2003 he was entitled to receive an early retirement pension of two thirds basic salary.
However, a lesser pension augmentation was agreed with him, for which the Company paid 856,000 into the UK Scheme.
Peter Smiths pension rights are restricted by the current earnings cap, which was introduced by the government in 1989.
The Company has therefore established a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benets Scheme FURBS which operates on a dened contribution basis.
The Companys contribution to the FURBS is paid quarterly in arrears and it amounted to 42,002 in 2003 2002 43,807.
Robert Woods accrued pension in column C is the total pension earned, which could be paid immediately in the event of retirement.
For the purpose of the UK Listing Authoritys Listing Rules the gure in column A is consistent with him being entitled to an immediate pension last year.
Nick Luff joined the Board on 14 May 2003 and receives no pension benefit from the Company.
The Company provides life insurance for which an insurance policy is in place, the cost of which is included within the directors emoluments table on page 39.
Joanne Curin had a dened contribution pension arrangement.
P&O Annual Report 2003 45 Directors remuneration report General provisions of the UK Scheme The Normal Retirement Age for Senior Executives is 60.
The maximum pension is normally two thirds of pensionable salary.
Only basic salary is pensionable.
The UK Schemes rules guarantee pension increases during retirement fully in line with RPI increases up to 3 per cent, subject to the minimum introduced in the Pensions Act 1995.
Increases above 3 per cent are not guaranteed but the trustee has the power to grant them, if circumstances permit, without referring to the Company.
Increases greater than 80 per cent of the increase in RPI may only be given with the agreement of the Company.
The current policy of the Company and the trustee is to fund the UK scheme for increases up to 80 per cent of the increase in RPI, subject to the above guarantees, allowance for which is made in transfer value calculations.
In the event of death before retirement, the UK Scheme provides a capital sum equal to four times basic salary or four times the earnings cap for those joining after 1989 plus spouse pensions or, at the trustees discretion, a dependents pension of up to 66 per cent of the members pension.
Childrens allowances are also payable at the rate of 25 per cent of the spouse dependents pension.
