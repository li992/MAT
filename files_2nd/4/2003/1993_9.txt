Remuneration Report The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the Companys broad policy for executive remuneration and the terms of employment and remuneration of Executive Directors.
It consists exclusively of the independent Non-executive Directors as listed on pages 18 and 19.
They are Mrs V M Mitchell Chairman, Mr H A Palmer and Mr F Wellings.
Mrs V M Mitchell became Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on 11 June 2003 following the resignation from the Main Board of Mr D S Sach, the previous Chairman.
In fullling its responsibilities, the Remuneration Committee has given full consideration to Section B of the principles of good governance annexed to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and the requirements of Statutory Instrument 2002 1986 The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the new Regulations.
This report will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of the Company in accordance with the new Regulations.
Remuneration policy The Companys policy on Executive Directors remuneration is to provide an appropriate package having regard to factors such as overall responsibilities, individual and Group performance as well as market rates.
In setting Executive Directors remuneration, the Remuneration Committee has had particular regard to the principle that remuneration committees should provide packages needed to attract, retain and motivate Directors of the quality required, but should avoid paying more than is necessary for this purpose.
In the view of the Remuneration Committee, this is to a great extent a subjective decision and one in which common sense plays a large part.
However, as recommended in the best practice provisions, the Remuneration Committee has considered the issue of comparability and relative performance within the industry sector.
During the year, Kepler Associates were appointed by the Remuneration Committee to assist in its consideration of all matters relating to Executive Directors remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee also consulted with the Group Chairman and Group Managing Director.
In constructing and reviewing remuneration packages for Executive Directors, the emphasis is on linking pay to performance through a combination of xed salary and benets and performance related elements performance bonuses and long term incentives with a weighting towards performance.
The performance related elements are determined by reference to the operating performance of the Group or specic relevant division in respect of Group Main Board members with divisional responsibilities.
Base salary Base salary is designed to reect individual Executive Directors responsibilities, experience, contribution and market value.
To determine market competitive salaries both published information on, and surveys comparing public companies of a similar size and from a similar sector are considered.
Performance bonus Bonus levels for Executive Directors are chiey related to the achievement of pre-agreed annual profit before tax targets, determined by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of each financial year.
Bonuses for Messrs Lewis, Pidgley and Perrins are predominantly linked to Group profits.
Messrs Carey, Farrow, Fry and Hutchinson receive bonuses generally linked to the performance of the divisions for which they are responsible.
In setting the targets, the Remuneration Committee takes into account the Groups overall strategy and market positioning.
profit before tax is used as the basis for setting performance targets as it reects, in the view of the Remuneration Committee, the best measure of organic growth and operational performance, also having regard to the cost of nancing those operations.
It is also easily measured by reference to audited results.
Long-term incentives a The Long Term Incentive Plan The principal form of long term incentive, eligible to Executive Directors, is through the Berkeley Group Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP or the Plan.
The Plan is intended to deliver rewards to a participant only if there has been strong underlying performance in the Group or, in the case of Executive Directors with specic divisional responsibility, the division for which those Directors are responsible.
Under the LTIP, which is administered by a special committee comprising the members of the Remuneration Committee, individuals may be granted an award annually, the vesting of which is subject to the attainment of pre-determined performance targets measured over a three-year period.
Awards are intended to deliver a pre-determined cash value and a number of shares, each worth at the outset 50% of the value of the total annual award.
The shares element is xed by reference to the market value of the Companys shares at the date of grant.
In general, participants will not be granted awards under the LTIP and any of the Executive Share Option Schemes in the same year, unless exceptional circumstances prevail.
The Berkeley Group plc Annual Report 2003 23 Remuneration Report continued The maximum value to be delivered under an award based on the share price at the date of grant is 200% of an individuals annual salary excluding bonuses and all other benets as at the date of grant.
In practice, it is envisaged that awards above 100% of an individuals annual salary excluding bonuses and all other benets will be made only to a limited number of individuals.
The cash element is payable following the third anniversary of the date of grant of the award provided the performance targets has been met.
The participant is normally only entitled to the share element following the fourth anniversary from the date of grant of the award, by which time the value of the underlying shares will have increased or decreased in line with the Companys share price performance over the period since the date of grant.
Performance under the LTIP is measured according to the level of audited cumulative pre-tax profits of the division or Group company in which the participant is employed over the relevant period.
Achievement is determined on an all or nothing basis over a period of three years with no opportunity for re-testing.
For awards under the LTIP to vest, the audited net assets of each division or Group company, after taking account of changes in share capital and dividend distributions, must also have increased by at least a cumulative rate of 10% per annum since the base year.
For the reasons stated previously, profit before tax is believed to be the most appropriate target against which to measure executive performance.
By introducing a net asset criteria as an additional target for the LTIP, participants must have regard to the long-term condition of the business.
Details of awards made under the LTIP are provided in the table on page 28 of this report.
b The Long Term Executive Incentive Scheme Prior to the establishment of the LTIP, the Company had established The Berkeley Group plc Long Term Executive Incentive Scheme the Scheme 1995 and 1996: the final awards to Directors being made in respect of the 1996 Scheme on 1 May 1996.
These schemes entitled eligible participants to receive an award in the provisional allocation of rights to Company shares in each of the five years from commencement.
To receive awards, relevant performance targets based upon earnings per share growth, increase in net asset value and share price performance for that year needed to be satisfied.
Participants remaining in employment received the provisionally allocated shares after a period of approximately six years from commencement of their participation in the Scheme.
In addition, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, a final cash sum may be payable to each participant based on the achievement of similar performance targets over the period of five years.
During the year ended 30 April 2003, two Directors received their share allocation in respect of the 1996 Scheme, having completed their participation therein on 30 April 2001 see page 26.
At 30 April 2003, one senior manager remained entitled to shares under the 1996 Scheme.
c Executive Share Option Scheme The Remuneration Committee believes that executive option schemes also have an important part to play in motivating senior executives.
Two new plans were introduced in 2000 to replace the existing approved and unapproved schemes.
The SAYE scheme remains in place.
Under the option plans, individuals may be granted options annually over shares worth up to 100% of annual salary excluding bonuses and all other benets.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to vary this amount in exceptional circumstances, in which case the limit is 200% of annual salary excluding bonuses and all other benets.
Exercise of any option is conditional upon meeting dened performance targets based on the increase in earnings per Ordinary Share over a three-year period.
On 30 April 2003, following the conclusion of a review of the Groups financial strategy and Executive Incentive arrangements, a grant of options under the Executive Share Option Schemes was made to Mr A W Pidgley, details of which are shown on page 29.
The options granted had a value of 200% of his annual salary and the number of shares granted under this special option was calculated using an average three-month share price.
The vesting of the options will be based on share price growth rather than the EPS based conditions mentioned above.
The options will vest in full only if the Companys share price rises by at least 50% within a three to five-year period based on the three-month average share price set on the date of grant.
The number of shares vesting will be calculated on a sliding scale for share price growth between 20% and 50%.
At 20% growth, 10% of the options vest.
If the performance condition has not been met within five years the options will lapse.
It is intended that Mr A W Pidgley can benefit from similar awards in the future with performance targets based on a measure of share price growth.
