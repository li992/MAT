McCarthy & Stone plc Directors Remuneration Report This report is not subject to audit, with the exception of the sections dealing with Remuneration by Director, Directors interests in Share Options and Directors interests in Deferred Bonus Plan Shares.
Remuneration Policy The remuneration of the Executive Directors is determined by the Remuneration Committee with the objective of ensuring that the Group attracts, motivates and retains high quality management.
The remuneration package is intended to include a significant proportion of performance-related remuneration, set against challenging objectives.
The Remuneration Committee is composed of the Non-Executive Directors, Sir George Young Chairman and S E K Purser and, until his resignation on 7th August 2003, J S McCarthy.
Independent professional advice on remuneration has been sought over the financial year from Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow, and earlier this year Watson Wyatt LLP was appointed by the Board to advise the Committee in respect of the review of Executive Directors remuneration packages to take effect from 1 October 2003.
Neither firm provided any other services to the Group during the year.
The Group Finance Director, Matthew Thorne, provided information to the Remuneration Committee to enable it to review Executive Directors' salary and incentive packages and the Committee also sought the views of the Chairman & Chief Executive, Keith Lovelock, on such matters.
The Companys solicitors, Travers Smith Braithwaite, have advised the Committee on aspects of the Deferred Plan, referred to below, and during the year the Committee received assistance from the Company Secretary, Trevor Green.
Remuneration of the Directors includes annual salary, bonuses, benefits, personal pension plans and participation in short and long-term incentive arrangements.
The remuneration of each Director is determined to reflect the duties and responsibilities of his role and his performance in that role.
The Remuneration Committees objective is to pay salaries at the median compared to companies in the sector of comparable size and complexity of operation and to provide overall packages at the upper quartile level, subject to the achievement of challenging performance targets.
The Committee seeks specific independent advice on remuneration levels, trends in executive remuneration packages and addresses corporate governance and best practice in making its determinations.
Service Contracts The Executive Directors have rolling service contracts with the Company terminable on the length of notice indicated below:- Executive Director Date of Contract Length of Notice K Lovelock 23.12.93 2 years M W J Thorne 27.05.93 2 years M J Jennings 10.03.98 1 year H P S Phillips 07.08.95 1 year G N Day 5.11.03 1 year The Remuneration Committee is mindful of the fact that the termination periods on some of the Directors service contracts are greater than one year.
Those service contract terms are historic and the Remuneration Committee will consider this point in all future contract negotiations but does not consider it appropriate to change at this time.
The intention of the Committee is to approve future service contracts terminable upon notice of no more than one year, save in exceptional circumstances.
The above Service Contracts do not contain any special provision for payment of compensation on early termination, save in respect of K Lovelock and M W J Thorne.
By virtue of a Supplemental Agreement entered into on 22nd December 1995, in the event of a takeover K Lovelock and M W J Thorne may, within six months of such event, elect to terminate the Service Contract on three months notice and be paid a termination payment of up to twice the value of annual basic salary and pension contributions.
The purpose of this provision was to ensure that the Directors concerned were not disincentivised should such an event occur.
The consent of the Board is required for all external appointments, particularly where it may give rise to conflicts of interest.
For J S McCarthy the above amounts relate to the period during which he was a Director but also include the remuneration due under his contract until its expiry on 31 December 2003.
The fees paid to S E K Purser and Sir George Young include compensation paid to them during the year for additional time required in connection with the approach received from the McCarthy family and issues arising therefrom.
In addition, the annual fees paid to S E K Purser were increased following his appointment as Deputy Chairman on 7 August 2003.
Share Option Schemes The Company believes that share ownership by Executive Directors and senior executives can strengthen the link between their personal interests and those of the shareholders.
"The Company introduced a Company Share Option Plan the ""Share Option Plan"" at its Extraordinary General Meeting held on 5 October 2000."
This plan is designed to reward Directors and other senior executives for delivering long-term returns to shareholders.
The Share Option Plan contains an Inland Revenue approved and an unapproved part.
Details of the interest of the Directors in options over the Company's Ordinary Shares are set out later in the report.
Options are granted at prevailing market prices at the time of grant.
Options granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme 1996 consisting of grants made on or after 27 November 1996 are subject to a performance condition.
These options only become exercisable if the Company's share price growth over a three year period exceeds the increase in the Retail Price Index by at least 6% over that period.
The new Share Option Plan introduced on 5 October 2000, has replaced the Executive Share Option Scheme 1996.
Options may be granted under the Share Option Plan up to a maximum of three times salary each year.
The Remuneration Committee considers past performance in deciding the level of grant on each occasion.
The approved part of the Share Option Plan is used to allocate up to an aggregate of 30,000 of options to each executive, with the associated potential tax benefits.
All grants in excess of this Inland Revenue limit are made under the unapproved part.
Grants to Executive Directors and senior executives are approved on a discretionary basis by the Committee following consultation with the Chief Executive.
For options granted under the new Share Option Plan stretching performance targets of earnings per share growth over a three year period to exceed the increase in the Retail Prices Index by a minimum percentage per annum have been imposed by the Committee as a condition of exercise, as follows:- Date of Grant Minimum Percentage p. a. over RPI November 2000 10% November 2001 8% December 2002 8% Details of options granted are set out in the table on page 32.
The Remuneration Committee considers that the performance conditions are appropriate both because of the Companys focus for management of the business on growth in earnings per share and because of the transparency and ascertainability of the measure.
The mid price of the ordinary shares at 1 September 2002 and 31 August 2003 was 330.5p and 487.5p respectively and the range during the year was 304.5p to 530.0p.
"Page 32 McCarthy & Stone plc McCarthy & Stone plc Directors Remuneration Report Gains on exercise of share options based on mid market price on date of exercise or same day sale price if lower : 2003 2002 000 000 K Lovelock 168 44 M W J Thorne 179 44 M J Jennings 438 - H P S Phillips 37 318 G N Day 5 827 406 Performance Related Bonuses and McCarthy & Stone plc Deferred Bonus Plan the ""Deferred Plan"" The Remuneration Committee believes that it is important that Directors should focus both on short-term performance and the impact that short-term actions will have on longer term outcomes."
The annual bonus plan and the Deferred Plan are therefore linked.
The terms of the Deferred Plan were approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 21 December 2001.
Annual bonuses are payable on achievement of specific targets set by the Remuneration Committee early in each year in relation to Group profit before tax.
On achievement of the prescribed performance target the bonus will amount to 30% of a Directors salary.
Above that target the bonus will increase on a percentage basis and is uncapped.
Achievement below a minimum target figure will result in no bonus becoming payable.
For the financial year ended 31st August 2003, the target figure at which bonus would amount to 30% of salary was set in December 2002 at pre-tax profit of 96m against a pre-tax profit figure for the year ended 31st August 2002 of 75.4m, representing an increase of 27% in pre-tax profit before the target 30% of salary was achieved.
The Remuneration Committee considered this target to have been a demanding one.
The Directors' cash bonuses are awarded in conjunction with the Deferred Plan.
Above 40% of salary, bonuses are paid entirely in shares, which must be retained to qualify for additional shares, thereby aligning the interests of Directors and shareholders.
In respect of the financial year ended 31 August 2003, a bonus has been awarded of 96.6% of each Executive Directors salary for the year then ended.
"As the bonus exceeded 40% of base salary, the aggregate cash bonus payable amounts to 505,000 and participants are required to use the balance of their bonus amounting in aggregate to 714,000, subject to the payment of income tax, to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company ""Bonus Shares""."
"These Bonus Shares will be held on behalf of participants, who are beneficially entitled to them, by the Trustee of the Company's Deferred Bonus Trust for a holding period the ""Holding Period"" being, the earlier of three years from the date of acquisition of Bonus Shares, the participant ceasing to be employed or a change in control of the Company."
The costs of acquiring the bonus shares will be borne by the Company and an accrual for this is made in the accounts of the Company at the year end.
Depending on the duration of the Holding Period, participants will have the right to call for free shares in the Company.
If the Holding Period is between one and two years, participants will be able to call for one free share for every four Bonus Shares held.
If the Holding Period is between two and three years, participants will be able to call for one free share for every three Bonus Shares held.
If the Holding Period is three years, participants will be able to call for one free share for every two Bonus Shares held.
Any free shares so acquired by participants will be subject to payment by them of Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions on the value of such shares at the time of acquisition.
The Deferred Plan is part of the Company's policy of seeking to retain quality management, as well as encouraging share ownership by Executive Directors.
Directors will only benefit from the Plan to the extent that they have achieved the challenging performance targets determined annually by the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee will monitor retention of shares both during and after the Holding Period.

The Executive Directors are beneficially entitled to the Bonus Shares held by the Trust on their behalf.
Shares are held by the Trustee of the Companys Employee Benefit Trust the Trust.
The Executive Directors as potential beneficiaries of the Trust are deemed to have an interest in the ordinary shares in the Company in which the Trust is interested.
The shares purchased on 27 11 02 were purchased for 283p and the shares purchased on 28 11 02 were purchased for 317p.
Total Shareholder Return The Remuneration Committee, together with the Executive Directors, has further considered the most appropriate comparator group for the illustration of total shareholder return.
For remuneration purposes, the comparator companies include the housebuilding subsector and other companies outside the construction sector.
However, for illustration purposes, a line graph comparing the total shareholder return of the FTSE 250 index of companies, of which the company forms part, is shown below.
The Board is conscious of the wish of shareholders to see that Directors interests are in line with those of shareholders.
In aggregate the Directors hold 991,000 shares, as detailed in the Directors Report, valued at 4.8m at 31 August 2003.
In terms of the Executive Directors this is, in aggregate, a 3.7 multiple of salary.

Pensions Each of the Executive Directors has one or more personal pension plans.
The Company makes set contributions to these plans at a rate of 25% of salary up to the age of 55, and at 30% of salary thereafter.
FURBS arrangements have been established in previous years for the benefit of M W J Thorne, M J Jennings and H P S Phillips, and during the financial year a FURBS arrangement was set up for G N Day, as in each case the amounts payable exceeded the cap on personal pension contributions.
The cost shown is the total of the contributions payable by the Group for the year.
Non-Executive Directors Non-Executive Directors fees comply with the limits set out in the Articles of Association and are set at levels which fairly represent the responsibilities of, and time spent by, NonExecutive Directors on company affairs.
Regard is also had to the level of fees payable to Non-Executive Directors in other comparable companies.
Non-Executive Directors fees are determined by the Board as a whole and Non-Executive Directors do not participate in discussions and decisions relating to their own remuneration.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in pension, share option or bonus schemes.
Sir George Young and S E K Purser, Non-Executive Directors, held office during the year upon letters of appointment which were not for specified terms provision A6.1.
Since the year end they have agreed to new letters of appointment under which they will hold office for a specified term, and J Stevenson has also been appointed as a Non-Executive Director for a fixed term.
The reappointment of Non-Executive Directors is not automatic.
J S McCarthy resigned as a Director of the Company on 7th August 2003.
He continues to receive remuneration under the terms of his existing fixed term contract, dated 20 December 2000, which expires on 31 December 2003.
The contract does not contain specific notice period or compensation for loss of office provisions.
