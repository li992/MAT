Directors interests in shares The following table and the tables on pages 33 and 34 show the beneficial interests of the directors who held office at the end of the year in the ordinary shares of the company and the interests of the executive directors who served during the year in the companys share schemes: LTIS total LTIS total Shareholdings Shareholdings allocations allocations as at as at as at as at 31 December 1 January 31 December 1 January Directors as at 31 December 2003 2003 2003 2003 2003 Executive directors Phil Bentley 111,188 80,095 637,330 453,857 Mark Clare 472,762 354,625 835,542 840,895 Sir Roy Gardner 2,360,222 771,661 1,365,749 1,382,870 Roger Wood 498,080 366,011 769,692 800,876 Non-executive directors Helen Alexander 2,800 2,800 Roger Carr 4,700 4,700 Patricia Mann 2,142 2,142 Sir Michael Perry 25,900 15,900 Robert Tobin 20,000 Paul Walsh 5,000 i Shareholdings shown as at 1 January 2003 or subsequent date of appointment of the director.
ii As at 9 February 2004, the beneficial shareholdings of the executive directors had increased from the totals shown at 31 December 2003 by the following numbers of shares: Phil Bentley 81: Mark Clare 81: and Sir Roy Gardner 81. iii As at 31 December 2003, 21,200,505 shares 1 January 2003: 27,238,473 were held by the trustee of the employee share trust for the purposes of the LTIS.
As with other employees, the directors are deemed to have a potential interest in those shares, being beneficiaries under the trust.
These interests remained unchanged as at 9 February 2004. iv From 1 January 2003 to 9 February 2004, none of the directors had any beneficial interests in the companys securities other than ordinary shares, nor any non-beneficial interests in any of the companys securities, nor in those of its subsidiary or associated undertakings.
Accordingly, 100% of the allocations were released on the vesting date of 1 October 2003 following the expiry of the two year retention period.
These shares were subject to income tax at the individuals marginal rate and national insurance contributions NICs at the rate of 1%, based on the market value of the shares at the date of vesting.
The income tax and NICs liability was satisfied by the sale of sufficient shares and, accordingly, the directors only received the net number of shares following disposal, which is reflected in the shareholdings as at 31 December 2003 in the second table on page 32. ii At the end of the performance period to 30 September 2002, the company ranked fourth in the relevant LTIS comparator group.
Accordingly, 100% of the allocations are being held in trust for a further two years, at the end of which time they will be released to the directors at the trustees discretion.
iii At the end of the performance period to 1 October 2003, the company ranked in fortieth position in the relevant LTIS comparator group.
Accordingly, 75% of the original allocations are being held in trust for a further two years, at the end of which time they will be released to the directors at the trustees discretion.
iv The respective performance periods relating to these allocations will end on 30 September 2004, 1 April 2005 and 31 March 2006.
If, and to the extent that, the performance conditions are met, the allocations will vest and the relevant number of shares will be released to the directors at the trustees discretion.
v Details of the treatment of allocations on Mike Alexanders retirement from the board on 28 February 2003 appear on page 31. vi The end of the qualifying period is the date on which it is judged whether or not the qualifying conditions see LTIS section on page 30 have been fulfilled.
vii The vesting date was the next business day after the end of the qualifying period.
Details of the operation of this scheme are provided on page 30. ii Sharesave scheme The company operates an Inland Revenue approved all-employee savings related share option scheme.
The scheme is designed to provide a long term savings and investment opportunity for employees and is described on page 26. iii Restructured executive share option scheme RESOS Options granted to company employees under the British Gas plc executive share option scheme prior to February 1997 were cancelled and replaced at demerger by non-Inland Revenue approved options to acquire Centrica shares.
The replacement options were granted on the same terms as British Gas executive share options, with the same exercise date and aggregate exercise price per share, and the number of shares placed under option was adjusted to take account of the demerger.
No further options have been or will be granted under this scheme.
iv Exercise of share options Options were exercised at the following dates and prices: a 28 August 2003 at 177 pence: and b 4 April 2003 at 158 pence.
The closing price of a Centrica ordinary share on the last trading day of 2003 31 December was 211 pence.
The range during the year was 212.75 pence high and 131.5 pence low.
34 Centrica plc report 2003 Directors pensions The pension arrangements for the executive directors, all of whom are members of the Centrica pension scheme, are shown below.
The Centrica pension scheme is a funded, Inland Revenue approved, final salary, occupational pension scheme.
Its rules provide for the following main features: normal retirement at age 65 see note on normal retirement age below : right to an immediate, unreduced pension on retirement at age 60: right to an immediate, unreduced pension on leaving service after age 55, subject to 10 years service and company consent: right to an immediate, unreduced pension on leaving service on reorganisation or for redundancy after age 50: life assurance cover of four times pensionable salary: spouses pension on death in service payable at the rate of two thirds of the members prospective pension and, on death after retirement, two thirds of accrued pension.
Childrens pensions are also payable: members contributions payable at the rate of 4% of pensionable earnings: pension payable in the event of retirement due to ill health: pensions in payment and in deferment guaranteed to increase in line with the increase in the RPI: and no discretionary practices are taken into account in calculating transfer values.
All benefits are subject to Inland Revenue limits.
Where such limitation is due to the earnings cap, benefits are increased to the level that would otherwise have been paid and are provided via the Centrica unapproved pension scheme.
This scheme is unfunded but the benefits are secured by a charge over Centricas assets to give security equivalent to the pensions provided to other employees.
An appropriate provision in respect of their accrued value has been made in the companys balance sheet.
Normal retirement age Having considered external market practice and the retirement provision made within Centrica for other senior managers, it has been agreed that the executive directors and certain other senior executives will be offered a one-off opportunity to leave the Centrica pension scheme and join the Centrica management pension scheme.
This offer is consistent with the historical treatment of the Centrica senior management population.
The Centrica management pension scheme has a normal retirement age of 62.
Individual accrual rates in respect of past and future service will be increased so that the pension expectations of individuals transferring across will be the same at the retirement age of 62 as they would have been had they retired at age 65.
No individual transferring will receive benefits from Centrica which when added to their retained benefits elsewhere exceed two thirds of their final pensionable salary.
Further, any request for early retirement will require company consent.
For those members who are affected by the operation of the earnings cap, Centrica provides top up benefits via an unapproved arrangement.
The benefits that arise under this are treated as being subject to the same rules as apply in respect of the approved portion of the members benefits.

The increase in accrued pension adjusted to exclude inflation may be derived by discounting the figure in the first column by the rate of inflation 2.8% see note iv and subtracting the figure in the second column.
iii Contributions were paid in the year by the directors under the terms of the scheme up to the maximum rate of 15% of the earnings cap.
iv The rate of inflation used was 2.8%, the annual rate to 30 September 2003, the date used for pension increases under the scheme.
v The accrued pension shown for Mike Alexander includes a credit in relation to a transfer from a previous employers pension scheme.
