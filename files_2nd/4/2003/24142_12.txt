Advice was originally taken from PwC in 2002 about of the executive directors would, for on-target performance, the expected value of the awards and the level of the represent around 50% of base salary.
To illustrate this, the challenge inherent in the targeted performance.
The following chart shows the proportions of salary, benets, expected value of the awards was estimated to be 25% the annual performance-related bonus earned during 2003 of the share price at grant in respect of the ESOS and and the estimated value of long term incentives granted 55% in respect of the LTIP.
To make the awards broadly during 2003. equivalent in value under the two schemes, a ratio of two ESOS shares to one LTIP grant was applied.
By combining awards under the ESOS and the LTIP and by using appropriate performance criteria, the Committee sought to ensure that the schemes usage is part of a balanced and well thought out remuneration policy.
As mentioned at paragraph 12 above, the stance in relation to the awards under the long-term schemes is being reviewed.
The quantum of the award can be inuenced by the desired positioning relative to the market in terms of overall package value, the desired mix between the elements of remuneration within a given package value, the limitations of best practice on grant levels for executive directors, the strength of the performance conditions applied in the schemes, and dilution limits to 19.
