Report on remuneration The remuneration committee The remuneration committee comprises, with the exception of the Group chairman, Rob Margetts, all the independent non-executive directors namely Julie Baddeley chairman, Fabiola Arredondo, Andrew Bonfield appointed July 2003, Roberto Mendoza appointed October 2002, Matthew Miau and Sir Christopher ODonnell.
Gran Lundberg had been the chairman of the remuneration committee until his retirement on 4 March 2003.
Whilst neither the Group chairman nor the chief executive are members of the remuneration committee they both attend the meetings by invitation but are not present when their personal remuneration is discussed and reviewed.
The human resources director acts as secretary to the committee and provides it with information and data from national and international surveys.
In addition, during the year the remuneration committee appointed Towers Perrin to review the remuneration arrangements for senior executives.
No other services are provided by this adviser.
The remuneration committee sets the overall remuneration policy of the Group and makes recommendations to the board on the framework of executive remuneration.
Individual member attendance at the meetings is shown on page 53.
The terms of reference are reviewed annually to ensure that they conform with best practice.
Specifically, the remuneration committee determines, on behalf of the board, the detailed terms of service of the executive directors and other members of the executive management team including basic salary, performance related bonus arrangements, benefits in kind, long-term incentives and pension benefits.
The remuneration committee also reviews the remuneration of the chairman, following a recommendation from the chief executive and the senior independent director.
The board as a whole determines the non-executive directors fees.
Remuneration policy BOCs remuneration policy for executive directors and other executive management is designed to attract and retain executives of the highest calibre so that the Group is managed successfully to the benefit of its stakeholders.
In setting remuneration levels the remuneration committee takes into account the remuneration practices found in other UKlisted companies of similar size, internationality and complexity and seeks to benchmark executive remuneration at about the median level for this group.
During 2002 the remuneration committee reviewed the executive remuneration packages and decided that a realignment was necessary to support the companys business strategy to improve both earnings growth and capital efficiency and to ensure that the packages were market competitive.
To this end, a proposal to adopt new long-term incentive arrangements was put to shareholders and approved at the 2003 Annual General Meeting.
These arrangements comprise a long-term incentive plan and an executive share option scheme.
They are intended to encourage innovation and value-added growth and strengthen the link between short-term performance and sustainable improvement in shareholder value over the longer term.
It is the view of the remuneration committee that performance-related remuneration should form a substantial element of total remuneration.
As such, these arrangements together with the variable compensation plan, which is a performance related cash plan, form the variable elements of executive remuneration.
It is expected that the achievement of on targetperformance of these variable elements will amount to about 60 per cent of total executive remuneration.
No changes to the framework of executive remuneration are proposed for 2004.
The remuneration committee will, however, review the policy on a regular basis and make any amendments it deems appropriate to ensure that it meets the objectives of recruiting, retaining and motivating high performing individuals and ensuring that the Group is market competitive.
Remuneration components Basic salary Salaries for executive directors and executive management board members are based on median market rates drawn from two external market data sources and take account of an executives experience, responsibilities and performance.
Performance is assessed both from an individual and business perspective.
Executive salaries are normally reviewed annually by the remuneration committee.
Remuneration for those executives of businesses outside the UK is denominated in the local currency.
Benefits in kind Benefits in kind comprise company car benefits and membership of BOCs health care insurance scheme.
Where appropriate, directors on international assignment receive overseas allowances such as housing and childrens education fees.
These allowances are on similar terms to those applying to other employees on the international programme.
Such benefits are in line with those offered by peer group companies.
Benefits in kind do not form part of pensionable earnings.
Variable compensation plan The executive directors and senior management participate in the variable compensation bonus plan.
The plan focuses on annual objectives and links individual performance with business plans.
The financial targets for the executive directors and other executive management board members are set on an annual basis by the remuneration committee and performance against these targets is reviewed by the remuneration committee on a six-monthly basis.
The remuneration committee considers that a six-monthly review acts as a significant incentive and is conducive to sustaining performance throughout the year.
The financial targets are based equally on adjusted earnings per share EPS and adjusted return on capital employed ROCE at Group level.
Adjusted means excluding exceptional items.
Bonuses are assessed two-thirds on these financial targets with the remaining third based on personal objectives derived from BOCs strategic priorities, including safety and growth initiatives.
During 2002 the remuneration committee reviewed the plan and agreed the maximum bonus payable for the achievement of financial and personal objectives would be 80 per cent of salary.
There is a threshold performance level below which no bonus is paid.
The bonuses for the executive directors and other members of the executive management board are paid half yearly following the remuneration committee review.
Details of the payments to directors are included in the  for the year on page 64.
60 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Current long-term incentive arrangements Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP Executive directors, members of the executive management board and a number of other key executives selected from the companys global operations participate in the LTIP.
The remuneration committee has the discretion to grant awards up to a maximum of two times salary.
The award made in February 2003 to the chief executive was based on 1.5 times salary and for other board directors one times salary.
There are three performance conditions:total shareholder return TSR, adjusted earning per share EPS and adjusted return on capital employed ROCE.
Up to one third of the award could vest in respect of each performance condition.
The TSR performance condition compares BOCs TSR performance with two separate comparator groups, a UK comparator group comprising 31 industrial and manufacturing companies and a global industrial gases group of six leading companies as follows: UK group Aggregate Industries BPB Invensys Scottish & Southern Energy AMEC Centrica Johnson Matthey Scottish Power Anglo American Corus Group Kelda Group Severn Trent AWG FKI National Grid Transco Shell Transport & Trading BAE Systems Hanson Pilkington Smiths Group BG Group IMI Rio Tinto Tomkins BHP Billiton ICI RMC Group United Utilities BP International Power Rolls-Royce When determining BOCs performance relative to the global gases group, the TSR for BOC and the comparator companies will be amended amended TSR so that it reflects the excess or shortfall in returns relative to the local stockmarket index where each company has its primary listing.
The nationality and the local stockmarket index that will be used to calculate the amended TSR for each company is shown in parentheses below.
Global gases group Airgas US S&P 500 Index Air Liquide France CAC 40 Index Air Products & Chemicals US S&P 500 Index Linde Germany DAX 30 Index Nippon Sanso Japan NIKKEI 225 Index Praxair US S&P 500 Index The BOC Group UK FTSE 100 Index For the awards made in 2003 the target set by the remuneration committee is such that if the companys TSR position measured over a three year period is median in respect of both comparator groups, then 40 per cent of the shares in respect of the TSR part of the award will vest.
If the companys TSR position is upper quartile all of the shares in respect of the TSR part of the award will vest.
If the TSR performance is between the median and upper quartile a proportion of between 40 per cent and all of the shares in respect of the TSR part of the award will vest.
If the companys TSR position is below the median for both comparator groups the TSR part of the award will lapse.
The adjusted EPS performance condition is based on the companys EPS before exceptional items relative to three year targets on a sliding performance scale.
For the award made in 2003 the target set by the remuneration committee requires a five per cent per annum growth rate over three years for minimum vesting.
If this is achieved, 40 per cent of the shares in respect of the EPS part of the award will vest.
All of the shares in respect of the EPS part of the award will vest if the company achieves a ten per cent per annum growth rate over three years.
If the growth rate is between five per cent and ten per cent a proportion of between 40 per cent and all of the shares in respect of the EPS part of the award will vest.
If the growth rate is less than five per cent per annum over the three year period the EPS part of the award will lapse.
The adjusted ROCE performance condition is based on the companys ROCE before exceptional items relative to three year targets on a sliding performance scale.
The minimum target set by the remuneration committee for awards in 2003 is 13 per cent at the end of the three year performance period.
If this is achieved 40 per cent of the shares in respect of the ROCE part of the award will vest.
All of the shares in respect of the ROCE part of the award will vest if the company achieves a ROCE of 14.5 per cent.
If the ROCE performance is between 13 per cent and 14.5 per cent a proportion of between 40 per cent and all of the shares in respect of the ROCE part of the award will vest.
If the ROCE is less than 13 per cent the ROCE part of the award will lapse.
In setting three performance conditions for the LTIP award, the remuneration committee took the view that these were the most important measures that drive or measure sustainable improvements in shareholder value the TSR performance condition measures comparative performance while EPS and ROCE reflect a core part of the companys business strategy, which is to improve both earnings growth and capital efficiency.
Executive Share Option Scheme 2003 ESOS 2003 Executive directors, members of the executive management board and other selected middle and senior management throughout the companys global operations participate in the ESOS 2003.
The remuneration committee have the discretion to grant awards up to a maximum of two times salary.
The awards made in February 2003 to the chief executive and other members of the board were based on 1.75 times salary.
The performance condition set for the ESOS 2003 by the remuneration committee is that the growth in the adjusted EPS over a three year performance period must be equal to or greater than the growth in the UK retail prices index RPI plus three per cent per annum over the three year performance period.
The performance is assessed on the companys published results.
If the performance condition is satisfied at the end of the performance period then the awards would be exercisable in full.
In the event that the performance condition is not satisfied over 61 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 Report on remuneration continued the original three year period then the remuneration committee has the discretion to re-test performance after five years, but only where the remuneration committee believes the extension to be a fair and reasonable basis for assessing the sustained underlying performance of the company.
In line with current corporate governance best practice there is no rolling re-testing of performance.
The remuneration committee considers this performance condition to be a challenging performance hurdle when compared to the companys adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate over the last ten years of around four per cent.
Awards under the LTIP and ESOS 2003 may be satisfied in cash or other assets, for example, where it is necessary for legal or tax reasons.
The amount to be paid will, in the case of share options, be equal to the participants gain on the exercise of the share option.
Also, the remuneration committee may decide, prior to grant, that an award shall be expressed to be a right to acquire a cash sum rather than shares.
This type of award, known as a phantom award, will normally only be granted to participants in jurisdictions where, because of local security laws or exchange control provisions, it is difficult to issue or transfer shares to employees.
The LTIP and ESOS 2003 awards may be satisfied by using existing shares purchased in the market through The BOC Group plc Employee Share Trust or by issuing new shares.
Awards under the LTIP and ESOS 2003 are not pensionable.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme UK based directors are eligible to participate in the BOC Savings Related Share Option Scheme.
The scheme is approved by the Inland Revenue and it is open to all UK employees with one years service or more.
Former long-term incentive arrangements Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 The last grant of options to the executive directors and members of the executive management board took place in February 2002 and the last award to other Group employees took place in December 2002.
No further awards will be made under this scheme.
The options vest when the companys adjusted EPS growth is equal to, or exceeds, the growth in the retail prices index RPI by three per cent per annum over any three year performance period.
Senior Executive Share Option Scheme, 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme, Executive Share Purchase Plan The last grants under these schemes took place in November 1994, February 1994 and August 1994 respectively.
In line with market practice at the time when these schemes were introduced the vesting of these awards was not subject to performance conditions.
Share Incentive Unit Plan Between 1989 and 1995 awards were made to executives under an incentive arrangement linked to the growth in the companys share price.
No awards have been made under the plan since 1995.
The final payment was made in November 2002.
Retirement benefits Pension arrangements for executive directors are in line with those of comparable executives in the countries in which the directors are located.
In the UK, the BOC Senior Executive Pension Scheme is a funded, tax-approved, defined benefit pension arrangement.
Where necessary, the directors pensionable pay is limited by the earnings capprovisions of the Finance Act 1989.
In such cases, the company pays the director a salary supplement on earnings above the earnings cap to reflect the loss of pension coverage.
This supplement is recorded in the directors emoluments and is not taken into account in calculating bonuses or any other form of remuneration.
BOC closed its UK defined benefit pension arrangements to all new employees on 30 June 2003.
Pension arrangements for new employees will be provided for under a defined contribution Retirement Savings Plan.
The company will make contributions to the plan equal to two times the employees core contributions which can be three, four or five per cent of salary.
In the US, the BOC Top-Hat Pension Plan is an unfunded, non-tax-qualified, defined benefit pension arrangement.
In Australia, the BOC Gases Superannuation Fund is a defined contribution arrangement underpinned by a defined benefit guarantee for long-serving employees who were members under a prior benefit structure.
Shareholding guidelines The remuneration committee encourages executive management to grow personal shareholding in the business over time.
It is anticipated that each executive would build towards a shareholding of one times salary.
The remuneration committee believes that the vehicle of the long-term incentive arrangements will facilitate the building of such a shareholding over a period of time.
Details of directorsindividual remuneration, share options, LTIP awards, share incentive units and share holdings are given on pages 64 to 68.
As set out in the remuneration policy statement performance related remuneration is expected to amount to about 60 per cent for each of the executive directors.
The performance conditions for each current and former share option and long-term incentive plan are set out above.
Non-executive directors Non-executive directors are generally appointed for an initial period to the next Annual General Meeting and subject to reappointment at the meeting, for a further three year term.
Subsequent reappointment is with the agreement of the board and approval of shareholders.
The fees are set at a level which will attract individuals with the necessary experience and ability to make a significant contribution to the Groups affairs.
The responsibilities of, and the time commitment expected from, non-executive directors have increased in recent times and fees paid to non-executives are increasing to reflect this.
As a result, from 1 January 2004 the non-executive directors fees will increase from 37,000 to 40,000 per annum, 10,000 of which, less tax, will be invested in BOC shares.
The fees for chairing a 62 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2003 committee will increase from 8,000 to 10,000 per annum, 5,000 of which, less tax, will be invested in BOC shares.
The fee for the chairman, Rob Margetts, is set at 225,000.
The non-executive directors do not have contracts of service nor do they participate in the Groups variable compensation arrangements, its long-term incentive arrangements or its pension arrangements, nor do they receive any benefits in kind.

It shows BOCs TSR performance, assuming dividends are reinvested, compared with all FTSE 100 companies.
This has been chosen because it provides a basis for comparison against companies in a relevant, broad based equity index of which BOC is a constituent member.
The remuneration committee decided that other comparator groups were more appropriate as performance measurement for the LTIP.
A graph showing BOCs TSR performance compared with the six major gases companies relative to respective local indices, which is one of the comparator groups chosen for the LTIP, is shown in the chairmans statement on page 5.
Service contracts The companys policy is for all executive directors to have contracts of employment that terminate on the attainment of retirement age.
In order to mitigate its liability on early termination, the companys policy is that it should be able to terminate such contracts on no more than 12 monthsnotice, and that payments on termination are restricted to the value of salary, car benefit and bonus entitlement calculated on the basis of the average of actual payments over the preceding two years for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
Pension provisions on termination are detailed in the individual service contracts below.
