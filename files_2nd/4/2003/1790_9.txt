Directors pensions Executive Directors participate in the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund.
The scheme provides for a pension at a normal retirement age of 62 and each Director pays an annual contribution equal to 5% of pensionable salary.
The pension for a Director who can complete 20 or more years pensionable service at normal retirement age is targeted at two-thirds of final pensionable salary, subject to Inland Revenue limits.
Directors have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions, but neither the contributions nor the resulting benets are included in the tables below.
The salaries of Jim Cohen, Malcolm Eckersall, Anthony Rabin and Ian Tyler were subject to the Inland Revenue earnings cap for pension purposes and details of the Companys contributions to additional arrangements for them are noted underneath the table on page 43.
The table below sets out the accrued deferred pension which would be paid annually from the scheme at retirement based on each executive Directors service to 31 December 2003 as well as the additional pension benefit secured in respect of service during the year.

ii During 2003, the Trustee of the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund reviewed its transfer basis in common with many other pension schemes and as a result adopted a Fund specic basis towards the end of 2003.
In the majority of cases this revised transfer basis would result in a higher transfer value than that calculated under the MFR basis.
The transfer values shown represent the transfer value of the accrued deferred pension and associated benets as at 31 December 2002, but calculated using this Fund specic transfer basis.
iii The gure is the difference between the transfer value of the accrued benets at the start and end of the period, less the Directors contributions during the period.
The transfer value at the start of the period used is that calculated on the revised transfer basis, referred to in Note ii above, in order to eliminate distortion caused by the change in calculation basis.
iv The transfer value is the present value of the accrued deferred pension and associated benets at 31 December 2003, calculated using the transfer basis then in force and on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
Malcolm Eckersall left the Company on 31 October 2003 and decided to take an immediate pension of 5,521 per annum, so the gure quoted in the above table is the actuarial value of his immediate pension.
The salaries of Jim Cohen, Malcolm Eckersall, Anthony Rabin and Ian Tyler were subject to the Inland Revenue earnings cap for pension purposes, and the Company has contributed to a Funded Unapproved Retirement benefit Scheme FURBS for each of them.
In 2003, the Companys contribution to Jim Cohens plan was 30,764, to Malcolm Eckersalls 30,449, to Anthony Rabins 41,541 and to Ian Tylers 36,051.
Benets under these FURBS are additional to those set out in the tables above.
The contribution to Malcolm Eckersalls FURBS ceased on his leaving the Company on 31 October 2003.
No past Director of the Company has received or become entitled to receive retirement benets in excess of his entitlements on the date on which those benets first became payable, or 31 March 1997 if later.
