London Merchant Securities plc 30 Remuneration Report of the Board of Directors Remuneration Committee The members of the Remuneration Committee are: Mr P J Grant Chairman Mr G C Greene Mrs J fide Moller Mr D Newell Lord Remnant was a member of the Committee until his retirement from the Board on 25th July 2002.
The Secretary of the Committee is Mr S C Mitchley.
The Committee appointed Towers Perrin to provide market information on directors remuneration and considered advice from Clifford Chance, who also provided other legal services to the Company during the year.
The Committee considered advice from the Hon R A Rayne and Mr M A Pexton, but they were not involved in discussions about their own remuneration.
Policy on directors remuneration The Companys policy is to provide an overall remuneration package which will attract, retain and incentivise directors of the right calibre.
Non-executive directors receive a fee and necessarily incurred expenses.
They do not participate in any bonus or incentive arrangements.
Their remuneration is established by reference to market rates.
The constituent elements of the remuneration package for each executive director are: base salary annual performance-related bonus long-term incentives Basic salary In recommending basic salaries for executive directors the Remuneration Committee takes into account information from an independent source on market rates in comparable companies.
Annual bonus Each executive director is eligible for an annual bonus based on the performance of the individual and of the aspects of the business for which they are responsible.
The Chief Executive may receive a bonus of up to 100% of basic salary for the year in question, while other directors may receive a bonus of up to 50% of basic salary.
The annual bonus is the primary element of remuneration related to financial performance.
Long-term incentives All executive directors participate in the Executive Share Option Scheme, which is designed to increase the alignment of their interests with those of other shareholders.
The Companys policy is to make an annual grant of options up to a maximum value of one times basic salary, in order to provide a continuing incentive.
The Remuneration Committee will take individual performance into account in recommending the level of any grant of options.
The performance condition for exercise of the options granted from September 2002 onwards is that in the first three year period after grant of the options shareholders funds must have increased by a percentage greater than the increase in the Retail Price Index plus 9%.
This performance condition, which was approved by shareholders in 2001, is designed to support and encourage focus on the Companys commitment to good long-term shareholder returns.
Approval is being sought from shareholders for several changes to the Executive Share Option Scheme, which are designed to update the Rules to bring them into line with current practice.
Among the changes included in the Notice of the Annual General Meeting is a proposal to allow on recruitment the grant of options worth up to three times salary, in order to facilitate the recruitment of directors and staff of the appropriate calibre.
If approved, it is intended to apply this to Mr N R Friedlos, who was recruited to the Company in January 2003.
A Long-Term Incentive Plan was established for Mr M A Pexton as part of the terms of his recruitment to the Company in April 2002, prior to his appointment as an executive director in October 2002.
Under the Plan he has cash-settled options with the same performance conditions as those governing the Executive Share Option Scheme.
It is not intended to make further grants to him under this Plan.
The Chief Executive, Mr R A Rayne, participates in the Carried Interest Plan, which applies to certain executives who have responsibility for investments made by the venture capital division, and was approved by shareholders in 2001.
The Plan is intended to correspond to the incentive arrangements applicable in the venture capital industry.
Mr Rayne is entitled to 7% of the pre-tax net capital gains realised on the cost of direct investments i. e. excluding investment in funds after a preferred return to LMS of 6.5%.
The percentage of realised capital gains which may be allocated to participants in aggregate may not exceed 20%, after the return of capital.
No payment was made to Mr Rayne under the Plan in the year ending 31st March 2003.
London Merchant Securities plc 31 Executive directors, other than Mr Rayne, are eligible to participate with staff in the Companys Share Incentive Plan, which allows employees to be granted free shares and to purchase shares which are matched equally by shares bought by the Company.
They are also eligible to participate alongside other employees in the Companys Sharesave Scheme, established under the Save As You Earn legislation.
Under the Scheme employees make regular payments into a savings account which, after a predetermined period, can be used to purchase shares at a price set at the start of the savings period.
Notice periods Executive directors contracts are rolling contracts terminable with one years notice.
Non-executive directors appointments are not for specific periods as it is considered that the process whereby they are re-elected by shareholders at least every three years provides a satisfactory means for the Board to keep appointments under review.
Executive directors contracts contain no specific provision for payments on termination of employment, other than following a change of control, where there is provision for payment of 95% of annual salary and benefits.
In determining the amount of any termination payment the Board will take into account the duty of the executive to mitigate loss.
