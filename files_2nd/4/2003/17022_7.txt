Remuneration report The Board of Directors presents its Remuneration report for the year ended 28 February 2003 in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
A resolution will be put at the Annual General Meeting inviting shareholders to consider and approve this report.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for advising and making recommendations to the Board on all aspects of each executive directors remuneration within agreed terms of reference.
Throughout the year and to date, the Committee comprises G K Maddrell Chairman, G P F Inge and D R Wilson, each of whom the Board considers to be independent.
The Chief Executive attends meetings of the Remuneration Committee, but is absent when his own remuneration is under consideration.
In determining levels of remuneration the Committee was advised in the year by Monks Partnership a division of our auditors and also consulted the Chief Executive and the Groups Personnel Director, Mrs C P Hipkiss.
The Committees policy is to provide a remuneration package which will attract and retain directors with the ability and experience required to manage the Company and to provide superior long term performance.
It is the aim of the Committee to reward directors competitively and on the broad principle that their remuneration should be in line with the remuneration paid to senior management of comparable public companies whilst recognising the particular features of the housebuilding industry.
For guidance, the Committee uses specific job-matched surveys of similar companies and from time to time commissions specific surveys.
This report sets out the Companys policy on executive directors remuneration for 2003 04 and, so far as practicable, for subsequent years.
The report also sets out the remuneration policy which has applied in 2002 03.
There are five main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors.
Basic salary Annual cash bonus Long term incentives Benefits Pension It is the policy of the Committee to ensure that a significant proportion of the total remuneration package is delivered through variable pay with payment dependent upon achieving stretching performance targets.
Total remuneration is aligned with Group performance against a range of short and medium term strategic, financial and operational goals.
Basic salary Salaries are reviewed annually on 1 March and are based on market competitive salaries for quoted UK housebuilders.
Salary levels reflect the experience, responsibility, effectiveness and market value of the executive and are generally set at around the median level for each job function.
Annual bonus The annual bonus is payable in cash following the completion of the financial year concerned.
These bonuses are performance related and are not pensionable.
The performance conditions are based on targets related to Group earnings per share growth, regulated for return on average capital employed ROACE and quality targets, and Business Operating Profit growth regulated for targets within those businesses.
There is a cap applied to bonus as a percentage of basic salary.
The performance targets for each executive director for 2002 03, which will also apply for 2003 04 are set out below: Name Performance criteria Bonus limit as % of basic salary Martin Donohue EPS 75 John Bennett EPS 75 Colin Cole EPS Profit of Homes Business 100 Robin Davies EPS Profit of Space4 100 Nigel Fee EPS Profit of Homes Business 100 A lower percentage of salary applies to Messrs Donohue and Bennett than other executive directors because Messrs Donohue and Bennett are eligible for participation in the new Long Term Performance Bonus Plan by reference to a higher percentage of salary.
regulated for ROACE and quality targets regulated for other business targets Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP During the financial year ended 28 February 2003, all the executive directors received awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan approved by shareholders at the 1997 Annual General Meeting.
Under the rules of the scheme, a participant may receive in respect of any year a maximum award of options over shares with a market value when the award was made equivalent to 50% of basic salary.
Each award is made subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria and the options may only be exercised at the end of three years.
There is no cost to the participants in the scheme of exercising the options.
If delivery of the shares is 34 Westbury plc Annual Report 2003 Remuneration report deferred for a further two years then the number available will be increased by one quarter.
The extent to which the awards may be exercised will be determined by two measures of performance: Total Shareholder Return TSR and Earnings Per Share EPS growth, each measured over a three-year performance period.
For awards granted for 1997 to 2000, each of the performance measures related to half of the shares awarded.
For the award granted in 2001 and 2002, 70% of the shares were subject to the earnings per share measure and 30% to the TSR.
Under the TSR measure the performance is judged against the following companies: Barratt Developments, Bellway, Berkeley, Bovis, Persimmon, Redrow, Taylor Woodrow, Wilson Connolly, Wilson Bowden and Wimpey.
There will be no vesting of shares under the TSR measure for below median performance, with 10% vesting at median performance and full vesting at upper quartile performance.
The vesting under the EPS measure is determined by the excess of the annual rate of growth of earnings per share above the annual rate of increase in the Retail Prices Index.
If the growth rate excess is less than 2% per annum then no shares vest.
If thegrowth rate excess is at 2% per annum then 10% of the shares vest and if at 8% or above then 100% of the shares vest.
For both measures vesting on a pro rata basis applies between the upper and lower limits.
At the Extraordinary General Meeting on 16 June 2000 the Long Term Incentive Plan was amended to allow more than 50% of salary to be awarded to directors.
Any award made in this manner would be termed Achievement of Excellence awards and the performance measures applying to any such awards would be more than usually stretching.
There have been no such Achievement of Excellence awards in the current or previous financial years.
Subject to the new Long Term Performance Bonus Plan, described below, being approved by shareholders the LTIP will not operate in 2003 or subsequent years in which the new plan is operated.
Long Term Performance Bonus Plan The Remuneration Committee has determined that, subject to shareholder approval, a new Long Term Performance Bonus Plan will initially be operated for the four years commencing 1 March 2003.
The plan is to be put forward for shareholder approval at an Extraordinary General Meeting to be held immediately after the completion of the Annual General Meeting on 20 June 2003 and full details of the plan are set out in the circular containing the EGM Notice.
For the initial awards, under this new plan a bonus equivalent to a percentage of basic salary for 2002 03 will be paid in May 2005 and May 2007 subject to performance against targets.
The plan is split in three sections for executive directors and other senior managers in the Group.
The targets described below, which relate to the initial awards, have been selected as they closely reflect the key indicators of the Companys business performance, and therefore align managements interests with those of shareholders.
The initial Group targets are: Earnings per share targets for the two years ending February 2005 and four years ending February 2007.
Space4 financial performance for the year ending February 2005 and for the year ending February 2007.
Process improvement in the Homes Business including build cycle, NHBC rating and customer service through to February 2005 and to February 2007.
The initial Homes Business targets are: Operating profit target for the two years ending February 2005 and four years ending February 2007.
Utilisation of Space4 product in each of the four financial years to February 2007.
Process improvement in the Homes Business including build cycle, NHBC rating, customer services and ROACE.
The initial Space4 targets are: The same as Group targets for earnings per share.
Profit targets for each of financial years 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007.
Process improvement within the Space4 facility to improve business efficiency and operating margin through to February 2005 and to February 2007.
The amounts payable under awards made in 2003 will be adjusted upwards or downwards for the percentage increase or decrease in the Group share price through to May 2005 and May 2007 from the base price of 311p per share being the average share price for the 2002 03 financial year.
Westbury plc Annual Report 2003 35 Remuneration report Under this plan, the maximum amounts payable to the executive directors, expressed as a percentage of basic salary for year ended 28 February 2003 and subject to the share price adjustments, are as follows: Name Performance criteria May 2005 May 2007 Martin Donohue Group targets 200% 200% John Bennett Group targets 200% 200% Colin Cole Homes targets 150% 150% Nigel Fee Homes targets 150% 150% Robin Davies Space4 targets 150% 150% Employee Share Schemes The Group operates an all-employee Share Incentive Plan and allocations are made to eligible employees in May each year.
Executive directors are eligible to participate on the same terms as other employees.
The Company operates two Executive Share Option Schemes approved by shareholders in 1984 and 1995.
The 1984 Scheme expired on its tenth anniversary in December 1994.
Under the rules of the schemes, options cannot be exercised under three years after they are granted.
At an Extraordinary General Meeting on 16 June 2000 certain changes were made to the 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme.
The total value of all shares which a participant is permitted to acquire is limited to no more than one and one-half times remuneration each year.
A director may be granted options in the same year in which the director is granted options under the Long Term Incentive Plan.
This has only occurred on one occasion during the year ending 28 February 2001 when options were granted to N T Fee, C J Cole and R J Davies.
No options have been or will be issued at a discount to the market price on the date that the award is granted and the exercise of options under the 1995 Scheme is subject to the achievement of performance measures relating to earnings per share for senior managers and specific performance targets for those executive directors who are also granted options under the Long Term Incentive Plan in the same year.
No new options were granted to executive directors under the 1995 Scheme in 2002 03, and the Committee does not intend to make grants to executive directors under this scheme during the life of the Long Term Performance Bonus Plan.
Service contracts It is the Companys policy that executive directors who are appointed after 1 March 1994 should have service contracts terminable on one years notice from the Company.
In accordance with this policy, N T Fee and C J Cole have service contracts 9 July1996 and 1 March 2001 respectively which are terminable on one years notice.
The service contracts of M C Donohue, J H Bennett and R J Davies which are dated 27 March 1986, 2 November 1992 and 29 November 1993 respectively are terminable by the Company on two years notice.
These contracts pre-date the adoption of the policy referred to above and, when entered into, were considered necessary to secure the requisite calibre of executives within the housebuilding industry.
The Remuneration Committee does not believe that, at the current time, it is in the Companys interest to seek to alter the terms of these existing contracts, but this matter will be reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee.
The directors service contracts do not make specific provision for compensation payments in the event of early termination.
The Remuneration Committee will consider individual cases when necessary, with the objective of minimising termination payments in the event of poor performance, whilst dealing fairly with individuals and complying with any legal obligations.
Benefits The executive directors remuneration package includes a fully expensed company car or cash allowance, private medical insurance and long term illness insurance.
These benefits are not pensionable.
Non-executive directors Non-executive directors, including the Chairman, serve the Company under letters of appointment, and, do not have service contracts.
They are paid a fee which is non-pensionable.
The Board as a whole determines the fees of the non-executive directors.

M C Donohues annual bonus of 183,000 includes an amount of 36,000 which was paid to a money purchase pension arrangement for his benefit as a result of a request by him that up to 36,000 of any bonus that might otherwise have been awarded to him for the 2002 03 financial year be paid as a pension contribution in the manner described.
Westbury plc Annual Report 2003 37 pence Remuneration report Pensions Executive directors in the employment of the Company are eligible to join a defined benefits pension scheme, under which contributions are payable by the Company.
Members currently pay contributions at the rate of 7% of pensionable earnings.
Prior to April 2002, members were contributing at a rate of 5% of pensionable earnings.
For executive directors, the scheme provides a pension upon retirement at the normal pension age of 60 equal to one thirtieth of final pensionable earnings or some lower fraction if restricted by Inland Revenue limits for each year of service.
A spouses pension equal to one half of the members pension is payable on the members death: childrens pensions may also be payable.
A lump sum of four times the members salary is also payable in the event of death in service.
Once in payment, pensions are guaranteed to increase at a rate of 3% per annum for benefits accrued before 5 April 1997 and in line with price inflation up to a maximum of 5% per annum for pensions accrued after that date.
Except in the case of M C Donohue and C J Cole, the remuneration on which these benefits are based is subject to the Statutory Earnings Cap.
In the case of J H Bennett, the pension benefits which the Company has committed to provide which will be subject to the Earnings Cap will be calculated without regard to retained benefits under a personal pension arrangement.
The effect of this commitment has been included in the figures below.
Messrs Donohue, Davies and Cole have potential maximum pensions of two-thirds of final pensionable salary, which is subject to the Earnings Cap in the case of Mr Davies.
In previous years accounts, disclosure of these benefits has been made under the requirements of the Stock Exchange Listing Rules.
These Rules are still in place but it is now also necessary to make disclosure in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
As indicated above, the Company paid 36,000 to a money purchase pension arrangement for the benefit of M C Donohue, following a request by him that any bonus which the Company might otherwise have awarded to him should be reduced by a corresponding amount.
The table below sets out the disclosure for the executive directors who are members of the scheme under the two sets of requirements: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Increase in Transfer value of accrued pension Accumulated total the increase in Increase in over the year to accrued pension accrued pension accrued pension Transfer value of Transfer value of Increase in 28 February 2003 at the end over the year over the year to accrued pension at accrued pension at transfer value net of inflation of the year net of inflation 28 February 2003 28 February 2002 28 February 2003 over the year M C Donohue 20,602 156,618 292,177 22,876 1,830,401 2,481,184 631,577 R J Davies 3,108 28,318 16,086 3,529 213,029 210,749 8,915 J H Bennett 3,295 33,210 35,558 3,795 362,398 435,427 66,395 N T Fee 3,301 36,720 25,213 3,860 339,119 363,234 17,481 C J Cole 16,120 55,997 88,598 16,787 282,659 355,127 62,171 Notes 1.
The transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the actuarial professions Guidance Note GN11.
The transfer values in columns 4 and 8 are shown net of the directors contributions paid over the year.
The assumption underlying the calculation of transfer values changed during the year resulting in higher values for each directors benefits than would have previously been the case.
The first four columns are consistent with the disclosure in last years accounts.
The final four columns are required to comply with the new Regulations.
