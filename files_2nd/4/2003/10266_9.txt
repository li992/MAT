24 Annual Report and Accounts 2003 PERFORMANCE GRAPH The graph below illustrates the performance of the Company and a broad equity market index over the past five years.
As the Company is a constituent of the FTSE All Share Leisure and Hotels Index, the Directors consider that index to be the most appropriate broad equity market index against which the Companys performance should be graphed.
Performance is measured by Total Shareholder Return share price growth plus dividends reinvested.

AUDITED INFORMATION Share Options i Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Executive Share Option Scheme No further options have been granted under the Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Executive Share Option Scheme the 1996 Scheme.
Options outstanding under the 1996 Scheme may be exercised if the Companys earnings per share increases over a three year period by the Retail Price Index plus 6%.
ii Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme The Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme the 2003 Scheme provides for the grant of both approved and unapproved options.
Under the 2003 Scheme options over shares worth up to two times base salary may be granted each year although, in exceptional circumstances, such as in a recruitment situation, this limit is four times base salary.
The size of actual option awards will be determined by the Committee, which will take into account a number of factors, including the financial performance of the Group and the successful attainment of specified objectives.
The exercise of options granted under the 2003 Scheme are subject to the achievement of stretching performance targets, which are equally applicable to all directors.
Earnings per share EPS targets have been chosen as the Committee believes that participants in the 2003 Scheme should be incentivised to deliver significant earnings growth which, in turn, should return substantial shareholder value.
The performance condition applying to the exercise of options granted under the 2003 Scheme in 2003 will be based upon the extent to which the Companys EPS grows in real terms from an notional base figure of 17.8p, over a period of at least three consecutive financial years after grant measured from a fixed base.
To the extent that the performance condition is not satisfied by the fifth anniversary of grant, the options will lapse.
The Committee believes that it would be inappropriate to apply the notional base EPS of 17.8p to awards granted under the 2003 scheme in 2004.
Due to economic and political factors entirely outside the companys control, if the notional base EPS of 17.8p was applied to the awards, the Scheme would not fulfil its two primary aims of acting as an incentive and retention mechanism.
Therefore, following consultation with major shareholders, for options granted under the 2003 Scheme in 2004, the notional base EPS figure will be 15p.
Options granted from 2004 onwards will not be subject to re-testing and to the extent that the performance condition is not satisfied by the third anniversary of grant, the options will lapse.
25 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Subject to the rules of the 2003 Scheme, options will become exercisable as follows: EPS growth target from notional base EPS Proportion of option exercisable EPS growth of less than an average of RPI plus 3% per annum 0% EPS growth of an average of RPI plus 3% per annum 25% EPS growth of an average of RPI plus 3% per annum to 10% per annum 25%-100% pro rated EPS growth of an average of RPI plus 10% per annum or more 100% In determining the extent to which if at all the EPS targets are achieved, the Committee believes that the most appropriate approach is for the calculations to be undertaken internally and then verified by an independent third party.
iii Milllennium & Copthorne Hotels Sharesave Scheme The Company also operates the Millennium & Copthorne Hotels Sharesave Scheme Sharesave which is an Inland Revenue approved scheme and under which the UK-based executive directors and Group employees are eligible to participate.
All grants of share options conform to institutional dilution guidelines.

All of the options were granted for nil consideration.

26 Annual Report and Accounts 2003 PENSIONS A contributory pension plan exists for the UK-based executive directors providing up to two-thirds of final salary subject to Inland Revenue limits at age 65 plus a spouses death in retirement pension of two-thirds of the pension payable to the member at date of death.
In addition, death-in-service benefits are provided comprising a lump sum benefit of four times the members pensionable salary at date of death.
Company pension contributions for directors were set at 17.3% until 31 March 2003 and, following actuarial recommendation, increased to 20.6% of salary from 1 April 2003.
All of the UK-based directors entered service after 31 May 1989 and therefore the benefits provided for them by the Companys pension scheme are restricted by the operation of the earnings cap.
Accordingly, a salary supplement of 15% of salary above the earnings cap was paid to these directors for the period to 31 March 2003 which was subsequently increased to 20.6% for the remainder of the year.
No pension is provided for Mr Wong Hong Ren.
