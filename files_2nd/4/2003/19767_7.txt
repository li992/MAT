Directors Remuneration Report The following disclosures of this report contain information which is not subject to audit.
The Remuneration Committee the Committee meets at least once a year to consider all aspects of executive directors remuneration, performance and employment and to review the Companys remuneration policies.
The fees of the non-executive directors are a matter for decision by the Board and are reviewed annually taking into account fees paid by comparable companies and the role and responsibilities of the directors.
Composition of the Remuneration Committee The Committee comprises the four non-executive directors of the Company, each of whom served throughout the year: Charles Scott Chairman, G Stanley Thomas, Tim Simon and Gareth Jones.
None of the directors have any personal interest in the matters to be decided other than as shareholders of the Company, any potential conflict of interest arising out of cross-directorships or any day to day involvement in the management of the Groups business activities.
During the year the Company Secretary, Roger Clifton, procured and provided information relating to executive directors remuneration in comparable companies from external sources that materially assisted the Committee.
Compliance with the Combined Code The constitution and operation of the Committee is, and has been throughout the period, in compliance with the principles incorporated within the Combined Code on Corporate Governance the Combined Code appended by the Financial Services Authority to the UK Listing Authoritys Listing Rules.
Policy The Committee aims to establish a level of remuneration sufficient to attract, retain and motivate executive directors of the calibre required to achieve the Groups objectives.
Reviews of the remuneration policy are carried out regularly.
In order to ensure that the range and level of emoluments and incentive schemes are competitive in the market place, the Committee uses survey data provided by external independent bodies on the remuneration policies of companies whose turnover and or business activities are similar to the Group.
In addition, if the Committee considers it necessary it will seek advice from independent consultants.
The components of executive directors remuneration packages include: Basic salary and non-cash benefits Salary and non-cash benefits, including company cars, life assurance, permanent health insurance and medical insurance, are determined by the Committee taking into account individual performance and information from independent sources on rates of salary and benefits for directors in comparable positions.
Bonus The annual bonus scheme provides for performance related bonuses to be paid to executive directors of up to 100% of salary.
In determining a directors bonus, the Committee takes into account the individuals performance, the financial performance of the Group in light of its commercial and acquisition activities, and market and competitive pressures.
Bonus payments are non-pensionable and are not payable to non-executive directors.
Pensions Under the terms of their service agreements, the executive directors are entitled to a contribution to their personal pension plans equivalent to 10% of their basic salary during the year.
At its most recent meeting, the Committee decided that the service agreements of Keith Brooks and Caroline Price be amended so that contributions to their respective personal pension plans be increased to 15% of their basic salary with effect from 1 April 2003.
The other executive directors continue to be entitled to contributions equivalent to 10% of their respective basic salaries.
Executive share options The Companys philosophy is to link the personal interests of the executive directors with those of shareholders through share ownership.
The Group operates three executive share option schemes, participation in which is open to executive directors and senior employees.

TBI plc 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme This scheme has been approved by the Inland Revenue under the provisions of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
Options granted to individuals will normally be exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of grant.
The exercise of these options is primarily subject to the following performance criteria: For grants before December 1998: The increase in the Companys share price must fall within the top 40% of companies when ranked against the increase in the share prices of a peer group of companies in the property sector from the date of grant to the third anniversary of the date of grant.
The peer group of companies were as follows: Allied London, Argent, Asda Property, Birkby, Capital & Regional, Chesterfield, Derwent Valley, Evans of Leeds, Greycoat, Hambro Countrywide, Helical Bar, Mucklow A&J, Pillar Property Investments, Raglan Property, Scottish Metropolitan, St Modwen, Tops Estates, Town Centre, Waites City of London and Warner Estates.
At the time that these share options were granted, the Company was classified in the property sector and so a peer group of property companies was the most appropriate benchmark.
For grants during and since December 1998: The Companys TSR must fall within the top 50% when ranked against the TSRs of those companies which made up the FTSE 250 Index on the date of grant.
The TSRs of the Company and its comparator group may be measured over any three year rolling period between that date of grant and ending on the tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
Measurement of TSR performance may be done every three months after the initial three year period.
Provided the performance criterion has been satisfied over any three year period, an option may be exercised at any time during its life.
TBI plc 1995 Unapproved Executive Share Super-Option Scheme Options granted under this scheme will be exercisable between the fifth and seventh anniversaries of the first day of the accounting period in which the date of grant fell.
The exercise of these options is primarily subject to the following performance criteria: For grants before December 1998: The increase in the Companys share price must fall within the top 25% of companies when ranked against the increase in the share prices of a peer group of companies in the property sector from the date of grant to the fifth anniversary of the first day of the accounting period in which the date of grant fell.
The same peer group of companies were used as given above for grants before December 1998 under the TBI plc 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme.
For grants during and since December 1998: The Companys TSR must fall within the top 30% when ranked against the TSRs of those companies which made up the FTSE 250 Index on the date of grant.
The TSRs of the Company and its comparator group may be measured over any five year rolling period between the date of grant and ending on the seventh anniversary of the date of grant.
Measurement of TSR performance may be done every three months after the initial five year period.
Provided the performance criterion has been satisfied over any five year period, an option may be exercised at any time during its life.
TBI plc 1998 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme The Finance Act 1996 restricted the value of options which could be granted to an individual under the 1995 Approved Scheme to 30,000.
The 1998 Unapproved Scheme was adopted on 7 August 1998 and allows options with a value up to four times an individuals eligible earnings to be granted, this being the limit which, but for the Finance Act 1996, would have been applied under the 1995 Approved Scheme.
The same performance criterion applies under this scheme as for grants during and since December 1998 under the 1995 Approved Scheme.
TBI Sharesave Scheme The scheme was adopted on 7 August 1998 and was approved by the Inland Revenue on 1 September 1998 under the provisions of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
Invitations to participate in the scheme are made periodically to permanent employees, including directors, who have been with the Group for at least one year.
Those who choose to participate save between 5 and 250 per month for a three year period after which they may use their savings to exercise an option to buy shares in the Company at a price determined at the start of the savings period.
The last invitation to participate in the scheme was made in November 2001.
Contributions to the scheme commenced in December 2001 and the options may be exercised between 1 January 2005 and 30 June 2005 at an exercise price of 52.65 pence.
Any previous options issued under the scheme have lapsed.

4 In order to resolve an oversight in the year ended March 1996, the Remuneration Committee agreed to provide a combination of further options and cash bonuses to Keith Brooks and Caroline Price: some of these options have since lapsed.
In the case of those options that remain, a cash bonus is payable on exercise.
The cash bonus is calculated as half the number of options exercised multiplied by the difference between 67.50p and 53.00p, the latter being the exercise price originally intended by the Committee.
5 These options have satisfied their performance criteria.
The market price of the Companys shares at the end of the financial year was 40.00p and the market price during the year was in the range 40.00p to 73.00p.
In addition to the above, Paul Kehoe, Caroline Price and Larry Gouldthorpe each held 18,043 options under the TBI Sharesave Scheme, which were granted in December 2001.
These options will be exercisable in 2005 at an exercise price of 52.65p.
The Companys register of directors interests, which is open to inspection, contains full details of directors shareholdings and options to subscribe.
