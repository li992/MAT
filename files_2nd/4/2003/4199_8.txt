Report on the directors remuneration The directors remuneration is determined by the remuneration committee.
Its members are given on page 34.
The parts of this report which are subject to audit by  LLP are indicated with an asterisk.
Directors remuneration policy The remuneration of executive directors and senior executives is determined by the remuneration committee.
The key objectives of Crodas executive remuneration policy are nto ensure that individual rewards and incentives are comparable with those provided by similar companies having regard to the Groups turnover, business sector and market worth and the need for skills to manage international businesses nto enable the Group to attract and retain high calibre people nto give full consideration to the relevant principles on directors remuneration set out in the 1998 Combined Code the Code nto ensure a balance between fixed and performance related remuneration, the latter being related to objective measurement of the financial performance of the Company.
The committee believes that the interests of shareholders and directors are more closely aligned to cash profitability and the control of working capital of the Group, rather than being based on performance relative to peer groups where external factors beyond the control of the directors can have a disproportionate influence on bonus payment, both favourable and adverse.
Basic salary and benefits The basic salary and benefits of the executive directors are set in relation to those paid by companies comprising the FTSE mid 250 in view of the difficulty in establishing a list of companies who are true comparators with the Companys operations.
In 2003 we used salary information as published by Income Data Services.
Performance-related bonus schemes The Company operates bonus schemes for its directors and senior executives.
Bonus payments are not pensionable.
In respect of 2003, the bonus scheme for executive directors was related to target income incorporating an element for the control of working capital and with bonuses payable on a graduated scale from 0.5% of salary for each 1% that performance percentage exceeds 90% of target income rising to 3% of salary for each 1% of performance percentage above 112.5% of target income.
The maximum amount of bonus payable is 100% of salary with the element of any bonus in excess of 50% of salary being deferred until 31 December 2004, and any bonus up to 50% of salary paid by 31 March 2004.
None of the directors earned a bonus in respect of 2003.
For 2004 a similar bonus scheme will apply.
Target income is defined as the Group EBITDA for continuing operations before exceptional items less a notional interest charge on working capital employed, with the performance percentage being the target income for 2003 expressed as a percentage of the target income per the Group strategic plan for 2003.
Share options Senior Executive Share Option Schemes are in place.
Options which may be exercised between three and ten years from the date of issue are granted to executive directors and senior executives both in the UK and overseas.
The share options are based on market prices of the Companys ordinary shares at the time of grant.
The aim of the option schemes is to identify closely the interests of the executive directors and senior executives of the Company with those of its shareholders.
To this end the options granted under the option schemes, which were extended by a resolution passed at the Companys 1995 AGM, will be subject to satisfaction of performance conditions before they can be exercised.
Options granted between 1995 and 1999 cannot be exercised for a minimum period of three years after the date of grant, but are then exercisable at any time during the following seven years provided the Companys basic earnings per share before exceptional items have increased by more than 2% plus the rate of UK inflation per annum in any period of three consecutive years following the date of grant.
27 Report on the directors remuneration The rules of the Senior Executive Share Option Schemes adopted with effect from 1 January 2000 enable options to be awarded annually in the absence of special circumstances on a graduated scale awarding the Group Chief Executive options to a value of one years salary, 80% of salary for other executive directors and decreasing percentages for other senior employees.
Basic earnings per share before exceptional items must grow at RPI plus 7% per annum for 100% of the options allocated to be exercisable.
With earnings per share growth at RPI plus 5% per annum 75% of the options are exercisable and at RPI plus 3% per annum 50% of the options are exercisable.
The performance period commences at the date of grant and lasts for a minimum of three years and a maximum of ten years until an average growth rate of at least RPI plus 3% per annum over the whole period has been achieved.
Details of options granted to directors are shown in the table on page 31.
With the likely introduction of a new accounting standard covering share based payments and its consequent impact on Group profits, it has been decided that no options will be granted under the Senior Executive Share Option Scheme in 2004.
The Company intends to introduce a new bonus scheme, which may include a share element, approval for which will be sought at the 2005 AGM if necessary.
It is the Companys current intention to satisfy the exercise of share options primarily from shares purchased in the market and not by the issue of new shares.
Details of shares held for this purpose are given in note 27 on page 64.
Pension and other benefits Pensions, company cars, medical insurance, annual leave and other benefits are in line with those provided to executive directors in similar businesses.
Benefits in kind are not pensionable.
Croda has a number of different pension plans in countries in which it operates.
Pension entitlements for Crodas executives are tailored to local market practice, the length of service and age of the participants.
The principal pension plans in the UK are defined benefit schemes which provide a pension based on a proportion of final salary.
Service contracts and external appointments M Humphrey and B M Richmond have service agreements with the Company which are terminable on either side on six months notice.
In addition, if the service agreements are terminated by the Company without just cause, a termination payment equivalent to eighteen months remuneration is payable by the Company.
The Chairman and non-executive directors do not have service contracts, and thus have no entitlement to contractual termination payments, but each is appointed for a fixed term as shown below.
Appointment date Unexpired term Notice period A R Beevor 20.12.01 1 year 3 months 12 months D M Dunn 26.04.00 2 years 2 months N A M A Ward 24.04.01 3 years 2 months N A Appointment extended for a further three year term on 24.02.03.
Appointment extended for a further three year term on 23.02.04 Executive directors are permitted to accept non-executive appointments by prior agreement.
It is normal practice for executive directors to retain fees provided for non-executive appointments.
Throughout 2003 B M Richmond was a non-executive director of Carclo Plc for which she received fees of 19,500.
Apart from service agreements and share schemes, no director has had any material interest in any contract with the Company or its subsidiaries requiring disclosure under the Companies Act 1985.
28 Performance graph Total shareholder return monitoring: Croda vs FTSE 250 In the opinion of the directors the FTSE 250 is the most appropriate index against which the total shareholder return of Croda International Plc should be measured because it is an index of similar sized companies to Croda International Plc.

A bonus was paid for the year ended 31 December 2002 but no bonus was paid for the year ended 31 December 2003.
The Chairmans and non-executive directors fees are determined on the basis of current fee levels in similar businesses.
Fees are reviewed every two years.
The fee for the Chairman of 90,000 per annum has not changed since January 1997.
Fees for the non-executive directors were increased to 29,000 with effect from 1 January 2003 following a review of current practice.
Supplementary fees are paid for committee chairmanship and for special duties beyond the norm expected of a non-executive director, to give total fees of 35,000 for D M Dunn and 32,000 for M A Ward with effect from 1 January 2003.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for pensions, incentives or any similar payments other than out-of-pocket travel and accommodation costs in connection with the performance of their duties.
29 Report on the directors remuneration Pension rights Pension benefits of M Humphrey are funded under the Croda International Supplemental Scheme CISS.
He will be entitled on retirement at age 60 to a pension equal to two-thirds of his final annual pensionable remuneration.
Because of his length of service with the Group he is not subject to limitation on the level of final remuneration known as the earnings cap.
If directors retire before age 60 a reduced pension is payable unless retiring at the Companys request.
In the event of death a pension equal to two-thirds of the directors pension would become payable to the surviving spouse.
Pensions in payment are guaranteed to increase in line with the rate of inflation up to a maximum of 10% per annum.
During the year, B M Richmond was paid 50,022 2002: 43,125 in addition to her basic salary to enable her to make independent provision for her retirement.
B M Richmond is also entitled to death in service benefits from the CISS up to the Inland Revenue earnings cap with the balance being administered by the Company, but receives no other benefits from that fund.
