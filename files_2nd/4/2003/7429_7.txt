com Directors remuneration report The Board presents its Remuneration Report to the members of the Company.
In preparing this report and establishing its policy the Board has given full consideration to, and follows the provisions of, the Combined Code and the Companies Act 1985.
In accordance with the Companies Act the tables setting out Directors pension arrangements, remuneration, interests in shares and share options of the Company and benets under long-term incentive schemes, on pages 44 to 48 have been audited.
The other information on pages 41 to 43 and 48 and 49 is not required to be audited.
Constitution of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee, which is chaired by Roy Brown and also comprises David Kappler, Lesley Knox, Mark McCafferty, Eric Nicoli and Steven Tadler meets as required each year not normally less than four times a year on behalf of the Board and the shareholders.
The Remuneration Committees remit is, to determine the Companys policy for executive remuneration, to determine the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and certain other senior executives, including pension rights and compensation payments, and to oversee the implementation and operation of share incentive schemes.
Advisers The Remuneration Committee takes advice and or obtains services from the following individual and entities all of whom were appointed by the Company: a externally, from Inbucon-Meis, on executive salaries, incentives and employee share schemes: b externally, from Watson Wyatt LLP on pension matters: c externally, from Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw LLP and DLA, solicitors, on employment contracts and associated legal issues.
Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw LLP also provide other legal services to the Group: and d internally, from the Group Human Resources Director, Mike Lymath: Mr. Lymath assists the Remuneration Committee by preparing an annual report on succession planning together with recommendations on share option grants and reviewing incentive arrangements.
Mr Lymath is not present for any discussion about his own emoluments.
The Chief Executive of the Company, Alan Giles, is normally invited by the Remuneration Committee to attend meetings of the Committee but is not present for any discussion about his own emoluments.
General policy The Companys remuneration policy aims to align the interests of Executive Directors and other senior executives with those of its shareholders.
It is the Remuneration Committees policy that variable performance-related pay and incentives should account for an increasing proportion of the overall remuneration package of Executive Directors so that the remuneration of Executive Directors is aligned with the Groups performance.
In setting the Companys remuneration policy, therefore, the Remuneration Committee believes that the Company should: a provide competitive awards, which will attract and retain high calibre management necessary to enable the Company to operate in the highly competitive retail sector and which reect individual responsibilities and experience: and b provide incentive arrangements which are subject to challenging performance targets reecting the Companys objectives and which motivate executives to focus on both annual and longer term performance.
Performance targets are designed to provide maximum awards for exceptional performance.
The Remuneration Committee intends that Executive Director basic salary be positioned at or around the median level in the marketplace with the incentive arrangements if performance targets are met bringing overall remuneration into the upper quartile for the marketplace.
Executive Directors remuneration is currently provided in the form of a combination of basic salary, an annual and a deferred share bonus, and share options further details of which are given below through the HMV Group plc Incentive Plan for Senior Executives the HIP Scheme.
This remuneration policy was originally adopted by the Board in 2001 and the Remuneration Committee intends to continue to recommend this policy to the Board for the next financial year and financial years after that.
There are no current intentions to change this policy.
It is the Companys policy that no Executive Director should have a xed term service contract or notice period exceeding one year and that no Non-Executive Director should have a letter of appointment for a term of more than three years.
All the current Directors service contracts or letters of appointment comply with this policy.
com Directors remuneration report continued Components of the Executive Directors remuneration The main components of the Executive Directors remuneration are: Salary The basic salary for each Executive Director is determined by taking into account an assessment of that Executive Directors performance, experience, responsibilities and market value.
Salaries are reviewed with effect from 1 July each year.
Benets in kind Benets in kind include provision of a company car or car allowance, pension, medical and life insurance, permanent health insurance, fuel allowance, relocation allowance and staff discount.
The HIP Scheme In 2001 the Company introduced the HIP Scheme.
The HIP Scheme has three elements an annual non-pensionable performance related cash bonus, a deferred performance related annual bonus payable in shares save for the award in 2001 and share options.
The HIP Scheme is designed to provide an incentive for senior management to achieve and exceed targets set by the Remuneration Committee and to ensure that annual remuneration varies in line with corporate performance.
Annual bonus The annual bonus the initial award awarded to each Executive Director is a percentage of salary based on the performance of the Group.
The annual bonus is a payment in cash after the end of the financial year to which the performance relates.
Deferred annual bonus The HIP Scheme is currently operated so that an annual deferred bonus the deferred award is awarded to the Executive Directors based on the performance of the Group.
This normally vests following the third anniversary of the end of the financial year in respect of which the award is made.
The maximum value of the deferred award at the time the award is made is the amount of the initial award paid in respect of the same year and vesting of such award is subject to further demanding cumulative performance targets based on the performance of the Group over that three year period the targets being cumulative budgeted Group EBITDA after notional interest and the performance of the individual.
The award for the financial year 2000 01 vests not at the end of the three year period but instead a proportion of the award is paid at the end of each of the financial years in that three year period provided the further performance targets have been met.
Payments for the 2000 01 award will be made in cash.
The payments for the 2001 02 award will be made in shares and it is intended that all awards in respect of future financial periods will be made in shares.
Where payment is made in shares, the number of shares awarded is determined by reference to the value of the shares at the time the award is made, not when it is paid.
Performance targets in respect of the annual bonus and deferred annual bonus Performance targets to determine the amount of the initial award and the maximum value when awarded of the deferred award are measured by reference to a target EBITDA after notional interest, target EBITDA and target stockturn.
If the target EBITDA after notional interest is reached then, for the Executive Directors, a sum equivalent to 25% of their salary is awarded under both the initial award and the deferred award.
If the target EBITDA after notional interest is not reached, the Executive Directors may still receive an award on a sliding scale of up to 25% of salary for each of the initial award and the deferred award for performance between 90% and 100% of target EBITDA after notional interest.
For performance above target EBITDA after notional interest and providing that target EBITDA has been achieved, awards are made to the Executive Directors on a sliding scale of up to a further 50% of salary making a maximum award of 75% of salary for both the initial award and deferred award.
The stockturn target must also be met for the maximum award to be made.
For the 52 weeks to 26 April 2003 all of the relevant targets have been met and the maximum awards of 75% of salary for each of the initial award and the deferred award will be made to the Executive Directors.
The performance targets outlined above were chosen by the Remuneration Committee because they align the interests of the Executive Directors with those of the Companys shareholders.
The assessment of whether these performance targets have been met has been carried out by the Remuneration Committee by reference to the audited accounts.
The deferred awards made to date are set out on page 46.
com Share options Until the Initial Public Offering of the Company in 2002 the Company operated the HMV Group plc Senior Executive Share Option Scheme the 1998 Scheme : no further grants will be made through the 1998 Scheme.
All grants made under the 1998 Scheme were subject to performance targets, as set out below.
Details of the options held by the Executive Directors under the 1998 Scheme and not yet exercised are set out on page 47.
Outstanding grants made on 22 January 1999 are currently exercisable following the achievement of the relevant EBITDA targets for the 1998 99, 1999 00 and 2000 01 financial years.
Grants made on 7 September 2000 and 26 February 2002 became exercisable in tranches upon and following the Initial Public Offering of the Company in May 2002 achievement of the Initial Public Offering being the performance target.
The first tranche of these options became exercisable upon the Initial Public Offering.
The second tranche became exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of Initial Public Offering May 2003 and the third tranche will become exercisable on the second anniversary of the date of Initial Public Offering May 2004.
Prior to the Initial Public Offering a new executive share option scheme, the HMV Group plc 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme the 2002 Scheme was adopted.
It is intended that this scheme be used for further grants of options to the Executive Directors under the HIP Scheme.
Options to acquire shares under the 2002 Scheme will be granted on a regular basis usually annually thus ensuring reward is spread over a number of years and is allied to the long term growth in shareholder value.
The options can normally only be exercisable after three years and then subject to the achievement of earnings per share targets imposed by the Remuneration Committee at the date of grant.
The grants of options made to the Executive Directors under the 2002 Scheme are also set out on page 47.
For these options 40% of the option shall be exercisable if the Companys earnings per share exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index by at least 3% per annum.
100% of the option shall be exercisable if the Companys earnings per share growth exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index by at least 7% per annum.
Vesting will occur on a straight line basis between these two points.
Earnings per share was determined by the Remuneration Committee to be the appropriate criterion given its clear linkage with shareholder value.
The assessment of whether these performance conditions have been met will be carried out by the Remuneration Committee by reference to the audited accounts.
The next grant of options under the 2002 Scheme is expected to take place in July 2003.
SIP The Company also adopted in 2002 the HMV Group plc Share Incentive Plan the SIP : this plan is intended to allow the Company to align the interests of all employees including the Executive Directors, all of whom are eligible to participate more closely with the interests of shareholders.
The Company has established two new employee benefit trusts the UK Trust and the Overseas Trust to facilitate the operation of these schemes.
Under the SIP employees may acquire Ordinary Shares in three ways.
First, the Company can use the SIP as part of its broad incentive arrangements by awarding free shares to employees: in this regard an award of 120 Free Shares was made to every eligible employee, including the Executive Directors, on the Initial Public Offering.
The Free Shares are, for UK employees, held by the UK Trust, subject to the rules of the SIP, and are not normally vested in the individual employee until she he has completed one years service from date of award.
There are no current plans to award further Free Shares to any employees.
Secondly, the Company may invite employees to purchase Ordinary Shares, known as Partnership Shares, and thirdly, the Company may, if it wishes, agree to match the shares purchased with additional shares, known as Matching Shares.
The Company has matched on a one for one basis since the inception of the plan and these Matching Shares do not vest until the employee has completed one years service from the date of the award.
All the Executive Directors participate in the SIP and their awards are set out on page 48.
Performance graph The graph below shows the percentage change in the total shareholder return from the date of otation to the end of the financial year against both the FTSE 250 and the FTSE General Retailers Index, both of which the Board considers to be appropriate peer groups for the Company as the Company forms part of both these indices.

The normal retirement date for Executive Directors is 60.
Alan Giles is currently a member of the HMV Group Pension Scheme HMV Scheme which is a contracted-out dened benefit scheme providing him with benets of up to one-thirtieth of final pensionable pay for each year of service.
Mr Giles contributes 4% of his base salary annually as a contribution to the HMV Scheme.
In the event of his death during employment his dependants would receive a pension and a lump sum.

In the event of his death during employment, his dependants would receive a pension and a lump sum.
As at 26 April 2003 Neil Bright was a member of the EMI Fund: Mr Bright joined the EMI Fund after 31 May 1989 and is therefore subject to the salary capping provided for in the Finance Act 1989.

Mr Bright contributes 4% of his capped salary annually as a contribution to the EMI Fund.
