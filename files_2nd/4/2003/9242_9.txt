THE LAIRD GROUP PLC 31 Directors remuneration report for the year to 31 December 2003 The Directors remuneration report sets out the Companys policy on the remuneration of executive and non-executive directors together with details of directors remuneration packages and service contracts.
The Remuneration Committee, which met four times during the year, is responsible for recommending to the Board the Companys general policy on remuneration and in particular to determine the remuneration packages of the Chairman and the executive directors, and the grant of all options and awards of shares.
The members of the Committee are appointed by the Board and the membership of the Committee will be reviewed at least annually.
The Chairman of the Committee will be appointed by the Board and will not be the Chairman of the Board.
The Chief Executive is given notice of all meetings and at the request of the Chairman of the Committee, attends the meetings.
The Chief Executive may request that he attends and speaks at Committee meetings.
In normal circumstances, the Chief Executive will be consulted on general policy matters and matters concerning the other executive directors and employees.
The written Terms of Reference are available from the Company on request and will be on display at the Annual General Meeting.
The Remuneration Committee, chaired by Mr J B McDowall, comprises the Chairman, Mr N J Keen, and MrJB McDowall, Mr D Morton, Sir Geoffrey Owen, Mr M A Smith and Dr W R Spivey, all independent non-executive directors.
Mr Keen, who as Chairman fulfilled the independence criteria at date of appointment set out in the new Code on Corporate Governance, is a member of the Committee because the Board considers it essential that he be involved in setting remuneration policy.
Mr D J L Hudson, the Company Secretary, acts as Secretary to the Committee.
The Board, as a whole, is responsible for setting the remuneration of the non-executive directors.
The Remuneration Committee over the past year has appointed Watson Wyatt LLP and New Bridge Street Consultants to provide independent external professional advice.
Watson Wyatt also provide pension actuarial services to The Laird Group and to the Trustees of two Laird Group pension schemes.
The Remuneration Committee has also sought the views of the Chief Executive, Mr Hill, during the year.
In addition, shareholders representative bodies and certain of The Laird Groups principal shareholders were consulted in connection with the new framework for share incentive awards which was approved by shareholders in May 2003.
Remuneration Policy The Remuneration Committee has established a policy on the remuneration of executive directors and the Board has established a policy for the non-executive directors for the current and subsequent financial years.
Executive Directors The current policy for deciding appropriate levels and forms of remuneration for the executive directors is to have an incentive driven remuneration package which promotes the alignment of interests of executive directors and shareholders.
That policy is based upon the following principles:- the reward opportunity offered to executive directors should be sufficiently competitive to recruit and retain management of the appropriate calibre and experience: and the need to provide a total compensation package which reflects the international complexity of the Groups operations.
Performance linked incentives are a key component of the total remuneration package and during the year, the Remuneration Committee proposed a new framework for share incentive awards, encompassing new executive share option plans and a Long Term Incentive Plan, which was approved by shareholders at the 2003 Annual General Meeting.
A summary of these arrangements is set out below.
Service Agreements Each of the executive directors has a service agreement.
New service agreements were entered into with effect from 8 March 2004.
In line with the Companys policy the executive directors service agreements are not for a fixed term and provide for no less than twelve months written notice of termination from either party.
The terms of employment terminate automatically at the executives Normal Retirement Date of age sixty.
The Companys policy on termination is to comply with the contractual terms and conditions set out in the service agreement.
The Company may, at its election, make a payment in lieu of notice.
The payment would be calculated as the total of the directors basic salary plus the value of his benefits, in each case by reference to the period of the unexpired notice of termination.
The arrangements for the executive directors which provided additional compensation in the event of a change of control of The Laird Group which were disclosed in the 2002 Annual Report and Accounts have been terminated with effect from 1 January 2004.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts but their appointments are subject to review every three years and the rotation provisions of the Companys Articles of Association.
Shareholding Guidelines Shareholding guidelines, under which executive directors will be expected to retain as shares all of the after-tax profit on the gains made on the vesting of Long Term Incentive Plan awards and the exercise of existing or future executive share options, until they have acquired a shareholding equal in value to their basic salaries, were introduced in 2003.
Non-Executive Directors The Laird Groups policy is to establish and maintain a body of non-executive directors with a breadth of international skills and experience that is relevant to The Laird Groups global businesses.
In this context, it is the Boards policy for the non-executive directors to be paid a level of fee that reflects market conditions and is sufficient to attract individuals with appropriate knowledge and experience.
32 THE LAIRD GROUP PLC Directors remuneration report continued for the year to 31 December 2003 Executive Directors Remuneration Basic Remuneration The executive directors receive base salary, annual performance awards, pensions and other benefits, and long term performance awards.
Base salaries, benefits and performance awards of the executive directors are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee.
Base salaries are determined with reference to an appropriate comparator group of companies which is reviewed annually.
Benefits comprise the provision of a car, life, disability and health insurance, participation in the annual performance scheme and a pension.
A contributory pension at the age of sixty of up to two thirds of base salary is provided, related to the length of service, together with a dependants pension on death in service or retirement.
Neither performance incentive awards nor benefits in kind are pensionable.

Mr Drabble received a payment of 66,700 in respect of a medium term bonus scheme, established prior to his appointment as a director, based on the performance of Laird Security Systems over the three year period ending in 2002.
No further payments are due under this scheme.
Annual Performance Incentive Awards The executive directors participate in an annual Group Performance Incentive Scheme.
Prior to 2003, beneficiaries of the scheme could elect to take all or part of the award in the form of Laird Group shares instead of cash.
If this election was made, the Company co-invested a further 50% of the number of shares.
All the shares vest with the beneficiary if they are held in trust for a minimum of three years.
The remaining shares for Messrs Drabble and Silver of 11,166 and 37,965 relating to 2000 will vest on 27 March 2004.
There are no qualifying performance conditions for vesting as the award was dependent upon historical performance.
Following the shareholder approval of the new share incentive arrangements referred to above, the Companys co-investment is no longer available.
The awards in 2003 for the executive directors were determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Up to a maximum of 75% of base salary could be earned.
The level of the award for 2003 took account of the improvement in financial performance and the achievement of targets and progress in meeting the strategic objectives of the Group as well as the improvement in total shareholder return.
Pensions G Drabble, P J Hill and J C Silver are members of a Group contributory defined benefits plan, which is supplemented, where necessary, by unfunded arrangements to maintain the same level of benefits as if the earnings cap did not apply.
The main benefits are a pension at age sixty of two thirds final salary, excluding bonuses and other benefits, and dependent on service: a dependants pension of 60% of the members pension on death in retirement: on death in service, a lump sum of four times salary and a dependants pension of 20% of salary or 60% of the members expected pension if higher.
The Governments proposed changes to the tax regime applying to private pension schemes to take effect from 6 April 2005 are being reviewed.
Pensions in payment are guaranteed to increase by the lesser of the increase in the retail price index or 8.5% per annum compound.
Transfer values provided on leaving service do not include any allowances for discretionary benefits.

THE LAIRD GROUP PLC 33 Long Term Incentive Plan The Long Term Incentive Plan involves the award of shares which only vest after the achievement of demanding performance targets over three years.
Executives are eligible for annual awards of shares.
The maximum annual award value under the Plan is one times basic salary.
In setting the level of awards the Remuneration Committee takes into account options granted to executives under the 2003 executive share option plans in the same financial year.
The extent to which awards granted under the Plan in 2003 vest will be determined by reference to the Companys total shareholder return relative to FTSE 250 companies excluding investment trusts and the following targets will apply: Total Shareholder Return Amount of Award Vesting Performance Level % Upper Quartile Full vesting Median to Upper Quartile Pro rata between 30% and full vesting Below Median Nil These performance conditions will be measured only over a single three year period.
There is no provision for retesting.
In addition, no awards will vest unless the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the Companys underlying financial performance.
The Long Term Incentive Plan may use either market purchased shares or new issue shares, provided that any new shares issued will count against the overall dilution limit.
During 2003, awards under the plan took the form of nil cost options over existing shares held in the ESOP.
Further details on the ESOP are on page 35.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account during the year in respect of the Long Term Incentive Plan granted to the directors was 233,000.
The directors interests in the Long Term Incentive Plan are as follows: Granted Vested 1.1.

Share Options The executive directors have outstanding options under the 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme and the 2003 Executive Share Option Plan No.
In May 2001 changes to the basis for granting options to executive directors and other employees were agreed by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
The main change was to alter the basis for calculation of the maximum grant of options to the equivalent of shares with a market value at the time of grant of up to one times salary in any one year and up to two times salary in special circumstances, such as the recruitment or promotion to a key management position.
Following the move to annual awards in 2003 the date on which awards are made is being harmonised to bring the timing more into line with the Companys financial year.
The exercise of all options granted to UK employees since 1994 has been subject to meeting performance criteria set by the Committee.
The criteria used has been to measure the increase in earnings per share against the rate of UK retail price inflation plus a fixed per cent per annum over a rolling three year period.
The Committee considers that growth in earnings per share is an appropriate performance target as it is a good guide to the underlying financial performance of The Laird Group.
In special circumstances, such as a change of control, death or retirement, the option scheme rules permit the waiver of performance criteria.
A new share option scheme as described above to replace the 1994 scheme which expires in November 2004 was approved by shareholders at the 2003 Annual General Meeting.
No new awards have been made under the 1994 scheme since the 2003 plans were approved.
34 THE LAIRD GROUP PLC Directors remuneration report continued for the year to 31 December 2003 1994 share option scheme The 1994 scheme granted options over new shares to be issued at time of exercise and also over existing shares.
The exercise of options under the 1994 scheme is dependent upon attainment of performance criteria set by the Remuneration Committee.
The scheme permits the grant of both approved and unapproved options.
Options were granted at the middle market price on the last dealing day prior to grant and are exercisable after three years but not more than ten years from the date of grant.
The performance criteria set by the Remuneration Committee for grants in 2002, the last date on which options were granted under this scheme, is that the increase in earnings per share must not be less than the increase in the rate of United Kingdom Retail Price Inflation plus an average of 3% per annum over a three year period.
If the performance conditions are not met the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to extend the period up to a maximum of a further two years but keeping the same base year.
Each time options were granted, the Remuneration Committee set the performance criteria for the exercise of the options.
The 2003 Executive Share Option plans There are two plans which were approved by shareholders in 2003.
One plan is Inland Revenue approved in order to enable grants of options to be made to individuals who may be eligible for capital gains tax relief on exercise of options, otherwise both plans are identical in all material respects.
The value of shares under options granted to an executive in any financial year will be limited, as under the previous 1994 scheme, to one times basic salary, unless there are exceptional circumstances e. g. a high level recruitment, in which case the limit will be twice basic salary.
When granting options, the Remuneration Committee will take into account both the level of awards made to executives under the new Long Term Incentive Plan and the prevailing share price.
The performance conditions under the plans will be based on the Companys earnings per share growth adjusted to exclude items which do not reflect the Companys underlying financial performance.
The following targets applied for options granted in 2003 and the earnings per share growth is measured from a base point of 17.5p.
Tier of Option Grant Applicable Performance Target: Average Annual growth in earnings per share in excess of inflation Up to 0.5 x salary UK RPI 3% per annum 0.5 x salary 1 x salary and above UK RPI 3% to 5% per annum applied pro rata to the multiple of salary The performance conditions will be measured over a three year period.
To the extent that the performance conditions have not been met after three years, the options will lapse.
In order to allow for the grant of options to employees who are not executive directors, there is an overall dilution limit of 10% of the ordinary share capital in issue from time to time for allocations in respect of newly issued shares over a ten year period under these plans and all other share schemes operated by the Company.
The directors interests in options under the 1994 executive share option scheme in respect of new shares to be issued are shown in the table below: Exercised Granted Lapsed 1.1.
1 plan in respect of new shares to be issued are shown in the table below: Exercised Granted Lapsed 1.1.
The performance criteria is that the average annual growth in the Companys earnings per share is at least UK RPI plus 3% to 5% per annum, applied pro rata to the multiple of salary at time of grant for the three year period ending 31 December 2005.
THE LAIRD GROUP PLC 35 The breakdown of the outstanding options is shown in the table below: Number of shares under option as at Exercise 31 December 2003 price p Exercise period P J Hill 1994 Executive Scheme 393,651 157.5 2.11.04-2.11.11 222,873 170.5 10.12.05-10.12.12 2003 Executive No.
13 690,000 There have been no changes in these interests since the year end.
The middle market share price at 31 December 2003 was 268p.
During the year the share price was in the range 144.5p to 286p.
ESOP The ESOP is operated through a Trust, which purchases and holds shares in The Laird Group to meet the requirements of share elections for awards made under the annual Group Performance Incentive Scheme, share option awards and grants under the Long Term Incentive Plan.
Currently there are no outstanding share options.
The Trust, which is financed by a loan of 2.9m from the Company, currently holds 1,064,131 ordinary shares of which 484,000 shares relate to the Long Term Incentive Plan.
49,131 shares relate to the annual Group Performance Incentive Scheme and the cost of acquiring those shares was charged against profits in the year to which the awards related.
The balance of the shares are unallocated.
No options were held by the executive directors under the ESOP during the year ended 31 December 2003.
Pursuant to section 324 of the Companies Act 1985, the executive directors have an interest in the shares held in the ESOP.
Independent Non-executive Directors Chairman Under an arrangement between the Company and Imperialise Limited Mr Keen is retained to act as Chairman of the Company.
Mr Keens fees were increased to 145,000 p. a. with effect from 5 June 2003 for his services for which he must account to Imperialise Limited.
In addition Imperialise is paid a sum equivalent to the National Insurance on those fees of 18,500, whereas National Insurance in respect of the non-executive directors is paid directly to the UK Inland Revenue and not included in the table below.
Mr Keens initial period of appointment as Chairman was for three years commencing 5 June 2000, subject to rotation.
His term of appointment was extended by The Laird Group Board for a further three years commencing 5 June 2003, subject to rotation.
The appointment may be terminated by either party giving not less than six months notice.
Non-executive Directors The non-executive directors are paid an annual fee of 25,000.
M A Smith, J B McDowall and Dr Spiveys emoluments include fees of 6,000 p. a. to reflect their chairmanship of Board and other Committees.
