This amount is described as Retirement benefits The remuneration paid to Mr Goodyear for the year ended in the table in section 4.1.
This amount is also payable 30 June 2003 is set out in the first table on page 54 of this where a payment is made in lieu of notice.
Any entitlement Mr Goodyear might have in relation to short and long-term incentives is covered by the GIS details of which are set out in section 3.3.
The rules of that Scheme outline the circumstances in which Mr Goodyear and any other participant would be entitled to receive any Deferred Shares, Options or Performance Shares that had been granted but which had not vested at the date of termination.
The rules of the GIS also outline the circumstances in which Mr Goodyear would be entitled to a cash bonus payment for the performance year in which he leaves the Group.
Those circumstances depend on the reason for his departure.
The rules of the GIS confer on the Committee discretion in relation to the entitlements of an employee on termination in some circumstances.
One such circumstance is where the employee is classified as an other leaver.
This will include situations where the employee does not resign or is not terminated for cause.
In an effort to provide the Group, its shareholders and Mr Goodyear with as much certainty as possible in relation to his entitlements at termination, the Committee has considered what Mr Goodyears entitlements might be if he and the Group reached a mutual decision to depart.
The Committee has resolved that, providing Mr Goodyear has served as Chief Executive Officer for no less than three years, he would be entitled to: any Deferred Shares or Options that had been granted but were not exercisable at the date of departure.
The Committee recognises that the performance measures for the grant of these Deferred Shares or Options have already been met, save for the requirement that they be held for two years from the date of grant.
The Committee believes that a mutual decision to depart would override that additional requirement to hold these Shares or Options for the balance of the two-year period.

The actual Deferred Shares will be awarded to Mr Goodyear subject to approval by shareholders at the annual general meetings in 2003.
Mr Goodyear can elect to receive Options instead of Deferred Shares, or a combination of both.
2 Other benefits Mr Goodyear is entitled to certain benefits including medical insurance, health insurance, and the use of certain Group facilities.
Mr Goodyear also received a tax impact allowance, relocation allowances and expenses, professional fees and car allowance.
The tax impact allowance was designed to compensate him for any additional tax payable on his personal assets as a result of his move from the US to Australia and subsequently to the UK.
3 Retirement benefits comprise cash gratuity paid in lieu of retirement benefits during the year.
4 Long-term share-based compensation The amount in respect of long-term share-based compensation represents the estimated value of awards granted under the long-term incentive schemes.
The estimated value has been calculated using a modified Black-Scholes option pricing methodology.
Details of outstanding awards and awards vesting in the year are set out in the two tables below.
5 In accordance with UK GAAP, 100 per cent of the value of Deferred Shares earned during the 2003 year is included in remuneration in the column headed Value of Deferred Shares.
Under Australian GAAP, such remuneration is to be included over the vesting period in this case, the three years from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2005.
The column headed Adjustment represents this difference.
Hence, the addition of the columns headed Value of Deferred Shares and Adjustment represents the remuneration associated with Deferred Shares under Australian GAAP.
6 Total remuneration paid to Mr Goodyear while a Director of the Group during 2002 was US$1 285 402.
This was made up of base salary US$408 618, annual cash bonus of US$562 330 and other benefits of US$314 454.
