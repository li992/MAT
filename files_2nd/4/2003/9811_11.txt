The Committee is responsible for: setting the framework and policy for the remuneration of the Executive Directors: and determining the specific elements of the Executive Directors compensation arrangements and contractual terms.
In setting policy and compensation levels, the Remuneration Committee has due regard to the Combined Code.
The Committee took advice on specific issues during the year from the Chief Executive, Ralph Findlay, however, Ralph Findlay did not provide any advice in relation to his own remuneration.
Following the year end, the Board, with the approval of the Remuneration Committee, appointed consultants, Deloitte, to undertake a full review of Executive Director remuneration to ensure that the policy is in line with best practice and that remuneration is competitive.
Remuneration policy The Companys remuneration policy for the current financial year and for the future is to ensure that the remuneration of Executive Directors is competitive, to enable the Company to retain and motivate existing Directors and attract high quality performers in the future.
The Company aims to incentivise and reward its senior executives in a way that is consistent with the Companys commercial objectives and to align the interests of the Directors with those of shareholders.
To achieve this, the Executive Directors total remuneration comprises both fixed remuneration and variable reward which is linked to Company performance and individual achievement.
The main fixed and performance-related variable elements for Executive Directors in 2003 were as follows: Fixed basic salary: benefits in kind detailed in the notes to the Directors emoluments table below : and pension benefits.
Variable annual award of share options vesting after three years, subject to long-term performance conditions being met: and annual bonus related to Company performance and personal objectives.
The Companys remuneration policy in respect of Non-executive Directors is to pay annual fees which reflect the responsibilities and duties placed upon them, also having regard to market practice.
W&DB Annual Report 2003 25 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Service contracts The Companys policy is that Executive Directors contracts are for a duration of 12 months and are subject to 12 months notice when terminated by the Company and six months notice when terminated by the Executive Director.
However, Derek Andrew has had a two-year rolling contract since 1987 and David Thompson has had a six-month rolling contract since July 2003.
All service contracts expire on the Director reaching age 60 unless the Company subsequently agrees that the Director may continue to work beyond the age of 60.
The following table details the Directors service contracts.
Date of Notice period Notice period contract Company Director Derek Andrew 15 Aug 01 24 months 6 months Alistair Darby 16 May 03 12 months 6 months Ralph Findlay 15 Aug 01 12 months 6 months Paul Inglett 22 Mar 02 12 months 6 months Stephen Oliver 15 Aug 01 12 months 6 months David Thompson 24 Jan 02 6 months 6 months Payments to Directors upon termination of their contracts will be equal to the Directors basic salary for the duration of the notice period.
There is no reduction for mitigation or for early payment.
With the exception of David Thompson, the Non-executive Directors do not have a service contract and their appointments may be terminated without compensation at any time.
The Committee has reviewed these arrangements in the light of current market practice and of the relevant provisions of the Combined Code and considers that they are appropriate and in the interests of shareholders, the Company and the individuals concerned.
Salaries Salaries for Executive Directors were reviewed as at 1 October 2002.
The aim of the Company is to provide a competitive remuneration package and salary levels are determined by considering them against practice in an appropriate peer group and in the context of other pay awards made in the Group.
Bonuses Bonus objectives for Executive Directors for 2003 were set based on a combination of Group profit achievement and personal objectives.
There is a maximum possible bonus of 50% of basic salary, payable in December 2003 where 35% is allocated on the basis of profit achievement and 15% based on personal objectives.
All such bonuses are non-pensionable.
Bonus objectives and level of awards for 2004 are currently under review.
Share incentive schemes The Company operates three executive share option schemes.
The 1985 and the 1994 Executive Share Option Schemes are Inland Revenue approved schemes and the 1997 Executive Share Option Scheme is a non-Inland Revenue approved scheme used to make awards to Executive Directors and other selected employees above their 30,000 tax efficient limit.
The 1985 scheme expired in January 1994.
Executive share options are awarded by the Remuneration Committee at the prevailing market rate on the date of grant to selected employees as a means of long term incentive.
Options are exercisable upon the achievement of stated performance criteria.
26 W&DB Annual Report 2003 The exercise of executive share options granted under the 1994 and 1997 Schemes is subject to the Group achieving growth in earnings per share in excess of the growth in the retail price index by an average of 2.0% per year over a three-year performance period.
The Committee believes the EPS performance condition to be appropriate and provides relative alignment with the Groups economic performance.
The 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme will expire in January 2004 and it is proposed that the Company will adopt a new Executive Share Option Scheme to replace both the 1994 and 1997 Schemes.
The new scheme will comprise an Inland Revenue approved scheme with the ability to grant unapproved options over and above the individual 30,000 limit.
Shareholder approval for the new Executive Share Option Scheme is currently being sought.
In addition the Company is seeking shareholder approval for a Long Term Incentive Plan the LTIP.
Full details of both the LTIP and the new Executive Share Option Scheme and their part in the overall remuneration policy of the Company are set out in the accompanying shareholders circular.
The Company also operates an Inland Revenue approved Save As You Earn SAYE Scheme for all eligible employees, including the Executive Directors.
Options are granted at a discount of 20% of the market value of the Companys shares at the date of grant.
Other cash benefits include cash allowances paid in lieu of a company car and fuel and holiday flex payments.
The fees relating to the services of Miles Emley and Lord Hodgson were paid to St. Ives plc and Johnson Brothers & Co Limited respectively.
No Executive Directors earn fees outside their employment.

W&DB Annual Report 2003 29 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Total shareholder return graph The graph below represents the comparative total shareholder return TSR performance of the Company against the FTSE All Share Index during the previous five financial years.
The FTSE All Share Index has been selected as a comparator because this is a broad market index of which the Company is a member.
The Company believes it would have been less meaningful to use a narrower index such as the Leisure and Hotels index for comparison purposes.
The TSR indices used in the chart have been calculated in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 relative to a base date at the end of September 1998.

The UURBS was replaced by a FURBS from 15 August 2001.
The Company contribution to the FURBS for the period ending 27 September 2003 was 38,250.
Paul Inglett has participated in a FURBS since 11 March 2002.
The Company contribution to the FURBS for the period ending 27 September 2003 was 28,560.
Pension arrangements During the year the Group operated a final salary pension scheme and a Group Personal Pension Plan GPPP.
During the year, for the final salary scheme the Group contributed 16.5% of the pensionable payroll for all members to 1 April 2003, 18.5% of pensionable payroll from 1 April 2003 to 1 September 2003 and 32.0% of pensionable payroll from 1 September 2003.
Members contributed in accordance with the Rules.
All employees in the Group final salary pension schemes have death-in-service life assurance cover to the value of four times pensionable salary.
The Group introduced the GPPP for new entrants with effect from 29 September 1997 to which it contributes 7.0% of pensionable salary and members contribute a minimum of 3.5% of their pensionable salary.
Membership of the GPPP includes death-in-service life assurance cover to the value of between two and four times pensionable salary.
During the year, the Group operated a final salary pension scheme for employees who joined the Scheme prior to 29 September 1997.
The funds of the Scheme are administered by Trustees and are separate from the Group.
A valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 1 September 2003.
This resulted in a long-term Group contribution rate of 32.0% of members total earnings.
The increase from 16.5% in the 1 October 2000 valuation was mainly due to falling equity markets.
The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the funding position of the Scheme are those relating to the differences between the long-term rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in earnings.
The 1 September 2003 valuation for the Scheme assumed that the long-term investment return pre-retirement would exceed salary increases by 3.9% per annum and price inflation by 4.9% per annum.
It assumed that the long-term investment return after retirement would exceed salary increases by 2.1% per annum and price inflation by 3.1% per annum.
The market value of the Scheme assets was 135.3m, which was sufficient to cover 78.5% of members accrued benefits, after allowing for future increases in earnings at the long-term rate.
A provision of 3.0m 2002: 3.1m is included in creditors representing the cumulative excess of pension costs charged to the profit and loss account over the Group contributions paid.
