A contribution at half the rate on basic salary in excess of the pensions cap is also made to the Furbs in respect of the UK directors average of cash bonus payments received during the previous three years.
This is justified as bonus payments for all other uncapped employees in the MEPP are pensionable on the same basis and, unlike for uncapped employees, contributions are not made in respect of the value of other taxable benefits.
As the Furbs is a deferred contribution arrangement, there is no effect on the future funding liabilities of the Company.
