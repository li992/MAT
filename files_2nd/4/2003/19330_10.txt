Service contracts The company has service contracts with its executive directors.
It is company policy that such contracts contain a 364 day notice period that can be given either to or by the director.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts or notice periods.
Details of their letters of appointment are set out in the table below.
Compensation for loss of office is, therefore, limited to a maximum of 364 days of basic pay benefits and linked pension, with no allowance for previous bonus or future potential entitlements under CRISP.
There is no enhancement for a change of control of the company or in any other circumstances and it is the Remuneration Committees policy to recommend to the board that compensation is paid in instalments and not to introduce liquidated damages provisions.

As required by recent legislation regarding the directors remuneration report, graph A illustrates the performance of the company measured by total shareholder return share price growth plus dividends paid against a broad equity market index over the period since the August 2002 return of capital.
As the company is a constituent of the FTSE All Share Real Estate sector this index is considered to be the most appropriate benchmark for the purposes of the graph.
Given the short time that has elapsed since the return of capital, the Remuneration Committee felt that it would be helpful to provide an additional graph B illustrating performance compared with the FTSE All Share Real Estate sector over the previous five years of the company and its predecessor.
A graph C of the companys NAV per share and the IPD All Property annual index is also illustrated to show how the underlying assets of the company have performed.
