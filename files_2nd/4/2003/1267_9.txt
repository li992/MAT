co. uk Directors Remuneration Report 1 Introduction All matters relating to the remuneration of the executive directors are determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The Committee, which is chaired by Mr. M. J. Allen, is appointed by the Board and comprises four members all of whom are independent non-executive directors: the quorum for the valid transaction of business is three and no executive director has any right of attendance or membership.
The principal objective of the Remuneration Committee is to ensure that the executive directors are both highly motivated and fairly rewarded for their contribution to the Groups overall performance having due regard to the interests of the shareholders, the overall remuneration structure within the Group and practices adopted by comparator companies.
When considering the remuneration of the directors, the Committee benchmarks the value added to shareholders interests by the company with that of a comparator group comprising representative companies from the passenger transport and support services sectors.
The Committee is required to determine and agree with the Board, and keep under review, both the policy and the detailed elements of the remuneration packages of the Chairman and the executive directors together with the broad policy relating to the remuneration arrangements for senior managers.
In formulating its policy the Committee will have due regard to the practices adopted by the comparator group.
The remit of the Committee requires it to regularly review targets and benefits under any performance related pay arrangements to ensure that they remain consistent with the long term interests and expectations of the shareholders.
Periodically the Committee will critically evaluate the merits and effectiveness of performance related pay schemes as they affect the Board.
The Remuneration Committee considers all elements comprising executive remuneration, including basic salary, performance related bonus, share option scheme grants, awards under the companys Long Term Incentive Plan, pension provision, benefits in kind and service agreement terms.
From 1 January 2000 directors bonus has not been taken into account in computing pension benefits.
In the case of the executive directors, the Remuneration Committee takes independent advice from specialist consultants in developing its remuneration policy and ensuring that the overall reward package remains competitive.
It is the policy of the Committee that the benchmark for executive directors salaries should be the median of equivalent roles in comparable companies in the transport and support services sectors.
During 2003, Mercer Human Resource Consulting Ltd reviewed all aspects of executive director remuneration and its recommendations were adopted and implemented by the Remuneration Committee with effect from July 2003.
With effect from January 2004, the base salaries of the executive directors were increased by 5%.
The executive directors participate in a performance related bonus arrangement with bonus being paid on the attainment of specified targets established by the Remuneration Committee and agreed with the director.
The Chief Executive is targeted on group performance with the other executive directors being targeted on group, divisional and personal performances.
The Group performance and divisional performance elements are based on the achievement of budgeted earnings per share and budgeted divisional profit: the personal performance element is entirely at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and is a qualitative element reflecting individual performance against key personal objectives.
The non-executive directors do not participate in any performance related pay arrangements.
Benefits in kind are awarded as the Remuneration Committee considers appropriate and currently comprise company cars or a cash allowance on a basis that is cost neutral to the company, fuel, medical insurance and telephone costs.
The non-executive directors fees are currently limited to 200,000 per annum in the aggregate by the Articles of Association and have been at that level since 1997: however, in order to meet the future anticipated needs for further high calibre non-executive director representation on the Board, the Notice of the Annual General Meeting contains a Special Resolution which, if approved, will increase this aggregate sum to 400,000 per annum and will provide for this cap to be increased annually in line with the index of wage inflation.
Within the aggregate cap the annual fee for each nonexecutive director is determined by the Board, the non-executive directors taking no part in the deliberations.
With effect from 1 January 2004 the fee for each of the non-executive directors was increased by the payment of a supplement at the rate of 3,000 per annum in recognition of the increased obligations arising from Corporate Governance requirements and additional responsibilities associated with chairing the Boards principal Committees.
Each of the non-executive directors is appointed for a fixed term not exceeding three years.
The appointments are renewable with the agreement of both parties again for terms not exceeding three years.
The maximum period of aggregate service for a non-executive director is nine years.
Each of the executive directors has a rolling service contract which is subject to twelve months notice.
With the exception of Mr. S. P. Lonsdale, all the executive directors have contracts dated 19 November 2001: Mr. S. P. Lonsdales contract is dated 5 September 1997.
Each of the executive directors service contracts contain an explicit provision for compensation payment on termination, except in the case of misconduct.
Where a directors service contract is terminated by the company, a severance payment will be made comprising the sum of: i the directors basic annual salary at the time of notice: and ii the performance related element estimated to be payable to the director in respect of the financial year in which notice is served: and 32 Arriva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 www.

In principle the Board will permit the executive directors to accept appointments outside the company.
However before accepting such appointments the director s involved must receive the prior written approval of the Board.
In considering such cases the Board will always satisfy itself, as far as is possible, that such appointments will not detract from the executive directors expected contribution to the company, nor that such appointment will create any conflict of interest.
Any fees earned by an executive director in such a capacity will be assigned to the company as in the case of Mr. R. J. Davies appointment as a non-executive director of Geest plc, where the non-executive directors annual fee of 25,000 is paid directly to the company on a quarterly basis.

The aggregate benefit accruing to Mr. E. A. R. Cameron and Mr. A. M. Saxton from the Arriva Pension Scheme and the FURBS is equivalent to 1 30th of basic annual salary for each year of service.
A. Ray commenced drawing his pension from the Arriva Pension Scheme upon his retirement from the Board: the pension disclosed as at 31 December 2003 represents the pension in payment: Mr. E. A. R. Cameron has elected to draw his pension from the Arriva Pension Scheme following his retirement on 31 December 2003.
The reduction in the accrued pensions and their associated values for Mr. E. A. R. Cameron and Mr. J.
A. Ray, reflects the actuarial reduction applied on the crystallisation of their benefits.

The executive directors have residual interests in one or more of the Groups share option schemes.
The Executive Share Option Scheme and the Share Incentive Scheme both incorporate performance target requirements which must be achieved before the exercise of the share option is permitted.
The performance targets are set by the Remuneration Committee and may be varied from time to time.
The current target requires the companys earnings per share over a period of three consecutive years prior to any exercise to exceed the Retail Prices Index by a minimum of 2 per cent p. a. i. e. 6 per cent over the three year period.
Following the introduction of The Long Term Incentive Plan in 2000, the executive directors are no longer eligible to participate in option grants under the companys executive share option schemes.
