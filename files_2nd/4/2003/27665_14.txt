40 | Remuneration Report REMUNERATION REPORT This Remuneration Report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee referred to in this section as the Committee and has been approved by the Board of the Company.
The figures included in the sections of this Remuneration Report headed Directors Emoluments and Directors Interests Under Employee Share Plans have been audited by KPMG Audit Plc as required by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
Their audit report is set out on page 54 of this document.
MEMBERSHIP AND ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE The Committee consists exclusively of non-executive directors who are considered by the Board to be independent.
Mr C D Collins is Chairman of the Committee and the other members throughout 2003 were Mr N D T Andrews, Mr N N Broadhurst and Mr W A M Clewlow.
Mr P G Joubert and Mr C M Stuart were also members of the Committee until 26 June 2003 and 28 July 2003, their respective dates of retirement from the Board.
The Company Secretary, Mr M C Murray, acts as Secretary to the Committee.
The Committee meets at least twice a year and is responsible for: determining the remuneration, incentive arrangements and benefits, including pension rights and any compensation payments, of the executive directors: determining the remuneration of the Chairman of the Board and monitoring the level and structure of remuneration of certain other senior executive employees of the Group: and reviewing, monitoring and approving, or recommending for approval, share incentive arrangements including option schemes of the Company.
The full terms of reference of the Committee are published on the Companys website www.
com and are also available on request from the Company Secretary.
During the year under review, the Committee met on four occasions.
The meetings were attended by all of the then members of the Committee, save for one from which Mr Clewlow was absent.
The Board accepted the recommendations made by the Committee during the year without amendment.
The Committee appointed Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow, a leading firm of UK remuneration consultants, as its independent advisers in June 2003 and a representative of that firm is now a standing invitee to all meetings of the Committee so that the Committee may obtain immediate and impartial professional advice.
Any work that the Company wishes Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow to do on its behalf, rather than for the Committee, now has to be pre-cleared with the Chairman of the Committee so as to ensure that no conflicts of interest arise.
Hewitt Bacon &Woodrow advised the Company during the year in connection with its employee share plans and retirement benefit arrangements.
The Committee was also assisted during the year by Judy Gathercole, Stephen Mulliner and Kevin Stacey of the Group Human Resources department.
This department is a specialist function within the head office of the Company and provides supporting materials for the matters that come before the Committee, including in particular comparative data and justifications for proposed salary, benefit, bonus and share awards and criteria for performance targets and appraisals against those targets.
It uses the services of external advisers as necessary.
The Chairman of the Committee has access to, and regular contact with, members of the Group Human Resources department independently of the executive directors.
REMUNERATION POLICY The Company embraces the principles and complies with the provisions of the Combined Code relating to directors remuneration.
The guiding principles which the Committee has applied throughout the period since demutualisation of the Group in 1999, and which it intends to continue to apply in 2004 and future years, in setting the remuneration of the executive directors of the Company are as follows: to take account of benchmarks and comparators for remuneration appropriate to the person concerned, being, in the case of UK-based executive directors, other companies in the UK FTSE 100 Index: to make a significant percentage of potential maximum rewards conditional on both short and long term performance.
These rewards include share-based incentives, in order to align the executive directors interests closely with those of the Companys shareholders: and to provide an opportunity for overall remuneration packages to be in the upper quartile of the comparator group through payments under short and long term incentives if superior performance is delivered, while the fixed elements of remuneration remain benchmarked to median levels of peer companies.
Remuneration Report | 41 The Committees objective in setting the executive directors remuneration has been to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the exceptional calibre needed to lead the development of the Group as it internationalises.
Its policy has been influenced by the need to be competitive with other international financial services groups.
In calibrating the various components of the UK executive directors remuneration packages, the Committee has adopted, for 2004, a broad guideline of some 35% of the maximum achievable being basic salary and benefit allowance, some 25% being short term performance-based annual bonus, and some 40% being long term share option and restricted share awards subject to performance targets.
In valuing share option awards for this purpose, the Committee has regard to, but does not rely exclusively on, Black-Scholes modelling of share option values.
DIRECTORS REMUNERATION PACKAGES Remuneration during 2003 for Mr Roberts and Mr Sutcliffe comprised a basic salary, a benefit allowance, an annual performance-based bonus and participation in the Companys employee share plans.
Mr Laubscher ceased to be an executive director of the Company on 8 December 2003 upon stepping down as Chief Executive of the Companys banking subsidiary, Nedcor.
He received, for his role as an executive director of the Company and in addition to his remuneration from Nedcor, a basic salary and participation in an annual Group performance-related bonus scheme and in certain of the Companys employee share plans.
His remuneration from Nedcor comprised a guaranteed remuneration package which included employer contributions to Nedcors defined contribution pension funds and participation in Nedcors performance bonus scheme and share incentive arrangements.
Details of individual directors remuneration and share options and of the termination arrangements for Mr Laubscher are set out later in this Remuneration Report.
BENEFITS AND BENEFIT ALLOWANCE The Company has adopted a cash-based package approach for its UK-based executive directors and other senior UK executives.
The benefit allowance equal to 35% of basic salary for Mr Roberts and Mr Sutcliffe is provided in lieu of contributions to retirement funds, full life and disability insurance and medical cover and certain other benefits that would be usual at their level, such as the provision of an expensed car.
Recipients of the benefit allowance may use it to purchase benefits appropriate to their needs from independent suppliers of their choice or may, if they wish, participate at their own expense in certain benefit arrangements established for Group employees in the UK.
Participation in any Group defined contribution pension arrangement is on a commercial basis, which must be fully funded from the benefit allowance.
Life cover up to four times the UK statutory earnings cap and disability cover up to the free cover limit were provided at the Companys expense during the year to Mr Roberts and Mr Sutcliffe as part of a Company-wide insurance policy.
ANNUAL BONUS The executive directors targets for annual bonus for 2003 had various constituent parts, together amounting to a maximum potential bonus equal to 100% of basic salary from the Company.
Achievement of financial targets based on the Groups results for the year accounted for a potential maximum of 70% of basic salary for Mr Laubscher and Mr Roberts and 80% of basic salary for Mr Sutcliffe.
The financial performance targets were subdivided between adjusted earnings per share EPS, which accounted for 70% of the financial targets component, and return on average equity RoAE, which accounted for the other 30%.
The EPS component was calibrated in such a way that the maximum payment would only be made upon the attainment of EPS of 15.1p, and no part of this element of the bonus would be paid if EPS was less than 11.3p which was the EPS achieved in 2002.
As EPS and RoAE for the year were each below the bottom of the bonusable range, none of the elements of bonus related to financial performance was paid.
The balance of the bonus targets equal to a potential 30% of basic salary for Mr Laubscher and Mr Roberts and 20% of basic salary for Mr Sutcliffe was based upon the fulfilment of certain specific individual personal and strategic objectives agreed by the Committee in advance, which were then subject to a formal performance appraisal process.
These objectives were tailored to the specific priorities that the individuals were tasked to focus on during 2003.
42 | Remuneration Report REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Performance appraisals were conducted on each of Mr Laubscher, Mr Roberts and Mr Sutcliffe against the targets set in their respective performance statements and the results of these were reported to the Committee.
Based on those reports, the Committee determined that, out of their maximum 30% performance-related bonuses, no bonus should be paid to Mr Laubscher and 20% to Mr Roberts and, out of his maximum 20% performance-related bonus, 16% should be paid to Mr Sutcliffe.
The Committee looks afresh at the make-up of bonus targets each year in the light of what it considers to be the key deliverables to be focused on by each member of executive management under its remit.
No bonus was paid to Mr Laubscher by Nedcor for the year ended 31 December 2003.
The number reported in the Remuneration table for the year ended 31 December 2003 in Directors Emoluments on page 43 below includes a payment to Mr Laubscher by Nedcor of bonus of R1,500,000 121,000 for the year ended 31 December 2002 which was only finalised in March 2003.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS SERVICE CONTRACTS Directors holding executive office have service contracts with the Company, the terms of which are considered by the Committee to provide a proper balance of responsibilities and security between the respective parties.
The Companys policy is to fix notice periods for executive directors at a maximum of 12 months.
Compensation for loss of office, where applicable, is tailored to reflect the Companys contractual obligations, but also to reflect the obligation on the part of the employee to mitigate loss.
Mr Sutcliffe and Mr Roberts have service contracts terminable by the Company on 12 months notice.
If not terminated, these contracts can continue until the director attains the age of 60 i. e. until 20 April 2016 for Mr Sutcliffe and 7 June 2017 for Mr Roberts.
Their current contracts are dated 6 February 2002 and 15 November 2002 respectively.
Mr Roberts contract contains a liquidated damages provision under which, if the Company terminates his employment other than for cause or if he is constructively dismissed, the Company is required to pay him compensation for the period of unexpired notice equal to three-quarters of his then salary and benefit allowance plus a further three-eighths of salary on account of potential bonus entitlement, this being agreed to constitute a genuine pre-estimate of his loss over the notice period after taking into account appropriate mitigation.
Mr Sutcliffes contract does not contain any provisions quantifying compensation that would be payable on early termination.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS TERMS OF ENGAGEMENT The terms of engagement of the seven non-executive directors other than the Chairman, Mr Levett provide for their positions to be held at the will of the respective parties, i. e. on terms that they may be terminated by either side without notice.
However, they also state that it is envisaged that they will remain in place on a three-year cycle, in order to provide assurance to both the Company and the non-executive director concerned that the appointment is likely to endure.
The first three-year cycles applicable to Messrs Broadhurst, Clewlow and Collins all of whom were appointed as directors from 25 March 1999 expired during 2002 and were extended for a further three years i. e. until 24 March 2005, when they will be further reviewed.
Mr Liebenbergs appointment which began on 25 March 1999 was also renewed in 2002, but he is expected to retire on or before 2 October 2004, his seventieth birthday.
Mr Bognis, Mr Andrews and Mr Marks appointments are each expected to last for an initial term of three years from their dates of appointment i. e. until 31 January 2005, 31 May 2005 and 31 January 2007 respectively and then be considered for renewal.
The Board has determined that, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, no non-executive directors cycle of appointment should be renewed more than twice, i. e. that non-executive directors should serve a maximum of nine years in that role, and that no non-executive director should continue in office beyond his seventieth birthday.
The renewal of non-executive directors terms for successive three-year cycles is not automatic and the continued suitability of each non-executive director is assessed by the Nomination Committee before renewal of his appointment takes place.
It was agreed, as part of the change in Mr Levetts role to non-executive Chairman from 1 November 2001, that his initial tenure of that new position would be until 30 June 2003 the retirement date under his pre-existing contract as Chairman and Chief Executive.
In conjunction with the Nomination Committee, the Board has now extended Mr Levetts chairmanship until the Annual General Meeting in 2005.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS FEES Non-executive directors fees from the Company are reviewed by a sub-committee appointed for the purpose by the Board, on which none of the non-executive directors whose fees are being determined sits.
The basic fee for non-executive directors other than the Chairman was 35,000 p. a. during 2003.
A further 2,500 p. a. was paid during 2003 for membership of the three principal standing committees Audit, Nomination and Remuneration of the Board, a further 8,000 p. a. for the chairmanship of each of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and a further 1,500 p. a. for membership, and 5,000 p. a. for chairmanship, of the two standing sub-committees Actuarial Review and Group Compliance and Risk Management of the Audit Committee.
Remuneration Report | 43 From 1 January 2004 certain of the Committee fees have increased to reflect the additional responsibilities of these Committees following recent corporate governance reforms.
Chairmanship and membership of the Audit Committee and chairmanship and membership of the Remuneration Committee now attract fees of 14,000 p. a.
The separate fees for the Group Compliance and Risk Management Committee have been discontinued from 1 January 2004 as a consequence of the role of that sub-committee now being reassigned to Audit Committees at Group and subsidiary levels.
Mr Levetts engagement as non-executive Chairman included the provision until 19 April 2003 of residential accommodation in the UK at the Companys expense.
The Company had prepaid for the accommodation concerned for the period up to 19 April 2003 prior to Mr Levetts change of role.
It was agreed as part of his new terms when he became non-executive Chairman that he would continue to be provided with this accommodation for the residue of the prepaid term, on the basis that it would be treated as having a value of 50,000 p. a.
When the prepaid lease term of the flat ended, his cash fee was increased by 50,000 p. a. to 250,000 p. a.

Certain of the directors waived in favour of the Company or its subsidiaries fees for non-executive directorships held in subsidiary companies totalling 81,000 during the year ended 30 December 2003.
These waivers are expected to continue in effect in the future.
2 TERMINATION ARRANGEMENTS FOR MR LAUBSCHER In connection with Mr Laubschers stepping down as Chief Executive of Nedcor and consequently as an executive director of the Company from 8 December 2003, the following arrangements were agreed.
The Company paid Mr Laubscher his remuneration of 100,000 p. a. through to 31 December 2003 and agreed to honour his bonus for the year, in accordance with what he would have received if he had remained an executive director until year end no bonus was in fact payable see Annual Bonus above.
The Committee also approved Mr Laubscher retaining his share options under the Companys Share Option and Deferred Delivery Plan until 30 December 2004 free from performance conditions.
To the extent not exercised by that date, they will lapse.
Nedcor paid Mr Laubscher his remuneration of R3,042,575 246,000 p. a. through to 31 December 2003.
No bonus was paid to him for that year.
The Board of Nedcor, acting in conjunction with Nedcors Remuneration Committee, also agreed to a payment of R1,566,860 127,000 to Mr Laubscher in recognition of his 32 years service to the Nedcor group, the last ten as Chief Executive.
A further payment of R328,436 1 27,000 was made to Mr Laubscher, in accordance with Nedcor employment terms, in relation to 33 2 days of accrued holiday which he had not taken: this is included under Salary and fees in the Remuneration table in section 1 above.
He was also permitted to retain his Nedcor share options for a maximum period until 30 June 2005, to remain a member of the Nedcor Medical Aid Scheme, and to retain cover under the Nedcor Limited Group Life Assurance Policy until he reaches the age of 60.
Remuneration Report | 45 3 PENSION BENEFITS Mr Roberts and Mr Sutcliffe continued to contribute from their benefit allowance to the Old Mutual Staff Pension Fund which is a defined contribution scheme during 2003.
The accumulated value of Mr Roberts funds in that scheme was 67,000 at 31 December 2003 37,000 at 31 December 2002 and the accumulated value of Mr Sutcliffes funds in that scheme was 41,000 at 31 December 2003 17,000 at 31 December 2002.
Mr Laubscher had defined contribution retirement fund benefits in relation to his 32 years of service with Nedcor under its Defined Contribution Provident Fund and Executive Provident Fund totalling 1,497,000 at 31 December 2003 1,079,000 at 31 December 2002.
He transferred his accrued funds of 1,379,000 R16,456,000 out of the Defined Contribution Provident Fund on 12 January 2004 and his accrued funds of 138,000 R1,648,000 out of the Executive Provident Fund on 27 January 2004 in order to purchase an immediate annuity from an Old Mutual Group company.
Save as mentioned above, none of the other directors of the Company had any accrued pension fund benefits in any Group pension fund at 31 December 2003 and none of them contributed to any Group pension fund during 2003.
DIRECTORS INTERESTS UNDER EMPLOYEE SHARE PLANS A SHARE OPTION AND DEFERRED DELIVERY PLAN SOP The SOP is generally used for the grant of executive options or, in the case of South African participants, deferred delivery shares to qualifying senior level employees around the Group.
Regular annual grants were made under this plan in February 2003 and interim grants, for new appointments or promotions, were made in August 2003.
Options and deferred delivery shares awarded during 2003 have a maximum life of six years.
All grants made under the SOP in 2003 were subject to i as to one half of the shares comprised in each grant, a Sterling-denominated EPS performance target linked to the UK Retail Price Index UK RPI : and ii as to the other half of the shares comprised in each grant, a Rand-denominated EPS performance target linked to the South African Consumer Price Index SA CPI.
The minimum target specified, for option grants of up to 100% of salary, was that growth in EPS must exceed the accumulated growth in i as to one half of the shares, UK RPI over the three-year vesting period plus 9%: and ii as to the other half of the shares, SA CPI over the three-year vesting period plus 9%.
Higher targets apply to grants in excess of 100% of salary, namely up to 12% above UK RPI SA CPI for multiples of between 100% and 200% of salary and up to 15% above UK RPI SA CPI for multiples where applicable of between 200% and 300% of salary.
The Committee considers these to be demanding performance targets in the current market environment.
B RESTRICTED SHARE PLAN RSP The RSP is used i to assist in recruiting and retaining key individuals by making awards of shares which are restricted for three or more years and are subject to forfeiture in the event of early termination of employment, unless special circumstances apply: ii as an adjunct to the annual bonus arrangements for the executive directors, to provide contingent matching awards of shares, subject to performance targets and to some or all of their annual bonus being invested and retained for the three year matching period in shares in the Company: and iii to make contingent awards of shares subject to a three year holding period as an alternative to share options based on value equivalence criteria approved by the Committee for certain employees of the Group.
The Committee has determined that each of Mr Roberts and Mr Sutcliffe may elect to defer some or all of his entitlement to annual bonus for 2003 from the Company into shares in the Company for three years on terms that, provided i in relation to one half of the shares under the matching award, the Groups EPS in Sterling increases by a factor of at least 9% above UK RPI over that period and ii as to the other half of the matching award, the Groups EPS in Rand increases by a factor of at least 9% above SA CPI over that period, and subject to the participant remaining employed by the Group until the end of that three-year period, he will then receive free shares under the RSP to the value at the date of grant equal to the gross amount of the bonus deferred.
In choosing the performance targets for the SOP and the RSP, the Committee has considered the merits of EPS-based targets against alternative possibilities, such as comparative performance against a basket of other companies or growth in embedded value.
The Committee has determined that EPS is currently the most appropriate criterion, as the Companys mix of businesses and geographical profile makes it difficult to establish a suitable basket of comparator businesses, and growth in embedded value would not, because of the way in which embedded value is calculated, reflect the full contribution to the Groups performance of its important asset management and banking activities.
In 2002 and 2003, in recognition of the significant adverse impact on the achievability of Sterling EPS targets caused by the decline in the Rand in 2001, the Committee agreed that it would be more appropriate for EPS to be tested, for the purposes of performance targets applicable to awards made in those years, in both Sterling and Rand terms and awards were therefore split as to one half UK RPI-based and as to the other half SA CPI-based.
The Committee intends to continue to apply this during 2004, but keeps the whole matter of the suitability and incentivising effect of performance target-linked share-based remuneration under periodic review.
It also recognises that the application of International Accounting Standards IAS to the Groups results from 2005 onwards will affect reported EPS and the direct comparability between EPS for different years preand post-IAS, which it will need to consider in due course.
46 | Remuneration Report REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED C SAVINGS-RELATED SHARE OPTION SCHEME SHARESAVE The Group operates a savings-related share option scheme, which provides a savings and investment opportunity for full-time and part-time employees of the Groups participating UK businesses The options may normally be exercised after three or five years at a price equivalent to not less than 80% of the market value of the shares at the date of invitation to participate.
Remuneration Report | 47 NOTES: 1 Options granted under the SOP on 8 March 2001 lapsed on 23 February 2004 because the performance condition relating to growth in the Companys EPS between 2000 and 2003 was not fulfilled.
2 Restricted share awards made on 15 March 2001, which related to matching of annual bonus for the year ended 31 December 2000 invested into shares in the Company, lapsed on 23 February 2004 because the performance condition based on growth in the Companys EPS between 2000 and 2003 was not fulfilled.
3 Restricted shares, which are to be released in equal tranches on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of Mr Roberts appointment i. e. on 21 August 2004 and 2005, subject to his still being in employment with the Group on those dates.
Mr Roberts is entitled to the dividends on these shares, pending vesting.
4 Subject to the fulfilment of performance targets prescribed by the Committee, under which: options granted on 4 March 2002 will only be exercisable if the Companys EPS in the year ending 31 December 2004 increases by prescribed factors of between at least 9% and at least 15% in excess of as to one half, UK RPI, and as to the other half, SA CPI, in comparison to EPS for the year ended 31 December 2001.
The basic factor of at least 9% over UK RPI SA CPI applies to multiples of up to one times basic salary, with a sliding scale up to at least 15% applicable to multiples between one and three times basic salary: restricted shares awarded on 5 March 2002, in conjunction with the investment by the director concerned of his net bonus for 2001 in shares in the Company, will only be released if the Companys EPS in the year ending 31 December 2004 increases by at least 9% in excess of as to one half, UK RPI, and as to the other half, SA CPI, in comparison to EPS for the year ended 31 December 2001.
No entitlement to dividends applies to these restricted shares, pending vesting: options granted on 26 February 2003 will only be exercisable if the Companys EPS in the year ending 31 December 2005 increases by prescribed factors of between at least 9% and at least 15% in excess of as to one half, UK RPI, and as to the other half, SA CPI, in comparison to EPS for the year ended 31 December 2002.
The basic factor of at least 9% over UK RPI SA CPI applies to multiples of up to one times basic salary, with a sliding scale up to at least 15% applicable to multiples between one and three times basic salary: restricted shares awarded on 26 February 2003, in conjunction with the investment by the director concerned of some or all of his net bonus for 2002 in shares in the Company, will only be released if the Companys EPS in the year ending 31 December 2005 increases by at least 9% in excess of as to one half, UK RPI, and as to the other half, SA CPI, in comparison to EPS for the year ended 31 December 2002.
No entitlement to dividends applies to these restricted shares, pending vesting.
5 The Sharesave option price was determined as 20% below the average of the Companys share price on 7, 8 and 11 March 2002 103.75p.
The Companys share price at the date of grant 5 April 2002 was 109p.
6 Options granted under the SOP on 26 February 2003 were based on the middle market price at which the Companys shares had traded on the London Stock Exchange on the preceding trading day 25 February 2003.
7 The numbers of shares awarded under the RSP on 26 February 2003 were calculated by reference to a price of 87.25p per share, being the price at which shares were bought for the account of the director concerned with some or all of his net of tax bonus for the year ended 31 December 2002.
8 As part of his termination arrangements, Mr Laubscher has been allowed to retain these options until 30 December 2004 and the performance conditions no longer apply.
48 | Remuneration Report REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED During the year the following restricted shares that were awarded as joining grants under the RSP were released.
In each case the recipient paid the associated tax arising from their receipt out of his own funds, enabling him to retain all of the shares.

Most entitlements to OMGA shares outstanding at the date of demutualisation have been converted into entitlements linked to Old Mutual plc shares and those entitlements continue to be governed by the OMGA rules.
Rights under the OMGA Share Incentive Scheme were awarded on the basis of the performance of the grantee, but were not linked to future performance criteria.
Details of directors share interests arising from the OMGA Share Incentive Scheme and outstanding at 31 December 2003 are set out below: Number Price per Date of of Company Company Date of grant shares share expiry M J Levett 01.10.98 607,068 R8.98 30.09.04 01.10.98 698,544 R9.07 30.09.04 Remuneration Report | 49 E SUBSIDIARIES SHARE INCENTIVE SCHEMES The Companys separately listed subsidiaries, Nedcor and Mutual & Federal Insurance Company, have their own share incentive schemes which are under the control of the remuneration committees of their respective boards.
The performance conditions previously applicable to the awards made in 2001, 2002 and 2003 no longer apply.
On 6 August 2003 options over 50,000 Nedcor shares at R95.00 each, which had been granted to Mr Laubscher under the Nedcor Group 1994 Employee Incentive Scheme on 6 August 1997, lapsed.

During 2002 and 2003, helped by significant appreciation of the Rand against Sterling, the total shareholder return on the Companys shares outperformed that of the FTSE 100 Index, whilst underperforming that of the J200T Index.
In the opinion of the directors, the FTSE 100 Index and the J200T Index are the most appropriate indices against which to measure total shareholder return of the Company, as they are indices of which Old Mutual plc is in each case a member and relate to the two markets where most of the Companys shares are held and traded.
SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF THE REMUNERATION REPORT An advisory vote on the Remuneration Report will be put to shareholders at this years Annual General Meeting in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
