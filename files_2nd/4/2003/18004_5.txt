Michael Price ceased to be Chairman of Franklin Mutual Advisers and Franklin Mutual Series Fund on 30 October 2001 and as such is no longer regarded as the nominated representative of Franklin Resources Inc. To the extent that Michael Price is now considered an independent non-executive director and Paul Reichmann is no longer a member of the Committee, the composition of the Committee has fully complied with the provisions of the Combined Code since 11 September 2002.
Non-committee members only attend meetings upon invitation from the Committee chairman.
Neither the group chairman or the group chief executive is involved in deciding their own remuneration.
Function of the Committee The Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the board on the framework of executive remuneration and for determining the specific remuneration packages for each of the executive directors, including pension rights and any compensation payments.
The Committee consults the chairman, group chief executive and group personnel manager as appropriate on remuneration proposals.
The Committee has also sought external advice on various aspects of remuneration from New Bridge Street Consultants and Clifford Chance LLP the groups legal advisers.
Remuneration Policy It is recognised that the ability to recruit, retain and motivate executives and senior managers of the highest calibre is essential to the success of the group.
The overall remuneration structure for the current year and, subject to any changes in circumstances, future years is therefore designed to provide competitive packages within the context of the property sector.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements 32: Remuneration Report The remuneration of the executive directors and senior managers is based on the following guidelines: Total rewards will be set at levels to attract, motivate and retain high-calibre staff having regard to any special expertise or particular market requirements: Performance-related elements of remuneration should form a significant proportion of the total remuneration package of executive directors, be designed to align their interests with those of shareholders and provide such executives incentives to perform at the highest levels: In determining such executive remuneration, the committee will be sensitive to a wide range of factors, including pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the group, and the property sector generally, especially when determining annual salary increases: and Incentive plans, performance targets and conditions will be structured to be rigorous through all stages of the development of the Canary Wharf estate.
The individual components of the remuneration packages of the executive directors and senior managers seek to balance long and short term goals in three elements: base salary and benefits, annual bonus and long term incentive arrangements.
These components are reviewed each year to ensure that they are supportive of the groups business objectives and in the creation of shareholder value.
An outline of current practice with regard to each component is set out below: Base Salary and Benefits Base salary consists of a fixed sum which recognises the worth of an executive director or senior manager in terms of ongoing market value.
The base salary of executive directors is reviewed annually by the Committee having regard to individual performance and the performance of the group relative to its competitors and the practice of comparative companies.
Details of individual directors base salary and benefits can be obtained from the Directors Emoluments and Compensation paragraph on page 37.
All employees, including executive directors, are eligible to participate in employment related benefits, principally life insurance, private medical health insurance and the Canary Wharf 2001 All Employee Share Plan.
Annual Bonuses The annual bonus is designed to encourage executive directors and senior managers to achieve the highest level of corporate and personal performance.
The awards are not contractual and are subject to the Committees consideration of individual and corporate performance against industry practice and factors affecting the overall property market.
Details of the directors annual bonuses can be obtained from the Directors Emoluments and Compensation paragraph on page 37.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements :33 Long-term Incentive Arrangements Executive Share Option Plans The company has adopted two executive share option plans, the Canary Wharf Group plc Company Share Option Plan, which is Inland Revenue approved, and the unapproved Canary Wharf Group plc 1997 Executive Share Option Plan together the Plans.
Both Plans are discretionary and are designed to incentivise executive long-term performance, with the only grants to date being made either in preparation of or, at the time of, the companys flotation.
No payment is required on the grant of an option and an option may be granted over new or existing shares in the company.
Performance Criteria Since March 1999 the Plans have been subject to performance conditions as follows: Performance Condition A: Provides that vesting of the options is conditional on the achievement of the following annual total shareholder returns TSR calculated by reference to the growth in the share price from grant of the options on a compound basis as set out below: TSR average over a one month period Total of options available for vesting 15% All 12% Two-thirds 10% One-third Below 10% Nil In April 2002 following the achievement of a TSR of 10% one third of the options vested.
In May 2002 following the achievement of a TSR of 12% a further third vested.
The performance condition, however, requires that the options vesting may only be exercised in three equal tranches over three years from 2002.
Performance Condition B only applies to the unapproved Canary Wharf Group plc 1997 Executive Share Option Plan : Options subject to this condition may only be exercised after 1 January 2006, and are subject to achievement of the TSR targets specified in Performance Condition A see above from grant to January 2006.
These options are also subject to an additional condition requiring the completion of 90% of properties identified in the listing particulars at the time of flotation and the leasing of 90% of these completed properties.
Performance conditions A and B are designed to provide a direct long-term link between the rewards of the executive directors and senior managers and the returns to shareholders.
At the end of each relevant period performance against the above-mentioned tests is reviewed and the results verified by independent external advisers.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements 34: Remuneration Report At the annual general meeting of the company held on 13 November 2002, the shareholders approved the payment of a special dividend.
At the same time, authority was obtained amending the rules of the Plans, enabling the board to adjust all outstanding options under the Plans to reflect the payment of the special dividend, or any other distribution which in the opinion of the board would be considered a capital distribution.
The authority granted did not permit the adjustment of options in the event the company declares an ordinary dividend.
The details of the adjustments made to reflect the special dividend are set out in Note 19 of the financial statements.
An earlier grant made in 1998 became exercisable on 1 April 1999.
Out of the 9,954,000 options granted, 1,584,685 as adjusted to reflect the special dividend paid in November 2002: 1,312,000 before adjustment remain outstanding.
Details of the executive directors share options including the adjustments made to reflect the payment of the special dividend can be obtained from the Directors Options paragraph on page 38.
Other Employee Share Plans Long Term Incentive Plan In 1999 the company introduced the Canary Wharf Group plc Long Term Incentive Plan the LTIP under which allocations may be made to senior managers and employees who do not participate in the executive share option schemes.
Executive directors are not eligible to participate in the LTIP.
Qualifying employees are entitled to receive an award of ordinary shares three years after the date of grant, subject to the following performance criteria: Performance Criteria Grants made in 1999 are subject to the company being in the top 50% of those in the FTSE Real Estate index at the date of the award.
This condition was tested and confirmed as satisfied in April 2002 by New Bridge Street Consultants.
Grants made in 2000 require that at least 90% of the total space identified in the listing particulars at the time of flotation shall be constructed or under construction and that at least 90% of that space shall have been committed.
The performance period for this grant will expire on 31 October 2003 at which point the performance criteria will be tested and verified by external advisors.
The measurements specified for each of the performance criteria were, at the time of each grant, thought to be the most reflective measurement of achievement in the light of the flotation of the company and the proposed development programme at the respective grant dates.
Both the 1999 and 2000 grants were specifically designed to incentivise staff through what was recognised to be a particularly demanding development and construction period.
Canary Wharf Group plc 2003 Report & Financial Statements :35 Canary Wharf 2001 All Employee Share Plan the Plan This Inland Revenue approved plan is open to all executive directors and employees who have been with the group for more than six months.

The shares acquired are held in trust for not less than three years at which time they may be withdrawn from the trust.
Five years after the date of acquisition the shares may be taken out of the trust free of tax.
To reflect the special dividend paid in November 2002, participants of the Plan were given the opportunity to either take the dividend in cash or re-invest it in shares of the company.
Under the terms of the Plan over the period to 30 June 2003, employees acquired 439,358 shares as partnership and dividend shares and the group acquired a further 729,481 shares which were held on behalf of these employees.
Pensions The group operates two defined contribution pension schemes.
The assets of those schemes are held independently.
None of the executive directors at 30 June 2003 were members of the schemes.
Non-executive Directors The fees payable to the non-executive directors are considered and approved by the entire board and reflect the responsibilities and time spent by the directors on the affairs of the company.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts nor do they participate in any of the share incentive schemes or the group pension schemes.
They are, however, all subject to retirement by rotation or removal by ordinary resolution, in accordance with the articles of association of the company.
All of the non-executive directors letters of appointment, with the exception of Gerald Rothman, expired on 13 November 2002 the date of the 2002 annual general meeting.
All were subsequently re-appointed subject to the required rolling expiry provision.

The company applies the principle of mitigation in the event of early termination.
In the event an executive director wishes to accept an external appointment, each request received by the Board will be considered at the particular time, taking into account the benefits to the company of the executive accepting such an appointment.
