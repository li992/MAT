10666.01 Pages 22-41 14 04 2004 19:43 Page 31 Remuneration report The Remuneration Report is presented to shareholders by the Board and sets out the remuneration policies operated by the Company and details the remuneration of each director.
The Remuneration Report will be put to the Annual General Meeting for approval by the shareholders.
The Board has an established Remuneration Committee, the members of which are disclosed on page 28.
John Amerman, Bernard Fournier and Lord Hannay also served on the committee during the year under review.
New Bridge Street Consultants have been appointed by the Remuneration Committee to provide advice on directors remuneration and the Companys share incentive schemes.
New Bridge Street Consultants provide no other services to, nor have any other connection with, the Company.
Remuneration policy In determining the remuneration packages of the executive directors, the Committee has regard to two fundamental principles: The importance of attracting, motivating and retaining management of the highest calibre: and Linking reward to the Groups performance.
The Committee has applied, and continues to apply, these principles to develop remuneration packages which: Provide a competitive base salary designed to attract and retain executive directors of the highest calibre and to reflect their role and experience: Provide incentive arrangements which are subject to challenging performance targets, reflect the Companys objectives and recognise the importance of providing sustained motivation of management to focus on annual, as well as longerterm, performance: and Align the interests of the executive directors with those of shareholders.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Committees approach is that a substantial proportion of the overall remuneration package should be linked to performance, through participation in short-term and long-term incentive schemes.
The Committee determines remuneration packages with regard to the prevailing pay and benefits conditions across the Groups markets.
Remuneration package of executive directors The main components are: Base salary and benefits Base salary and benefits are determined on an annual basis by the Committee after a review taking into account the individuals performance, market trends and the performance of the Group as a whole and, where relevant, the performance of the business for which the executive is responsible.
For guidance, the Committee has regard to available research and published remuneration information on companies within the same industry and markets in the countries in which the executives are based.
A summary of the benefits payable to executive directors is given on page 34.
Bonus schemes All of the executive directors participate in the Groups Annual Cash Bonus Scheme based upon achievement of individual objectives and financial targets profit before tax and management charges linked to Group and, in the case of directors with operational responsibilities, regional performance.
This may result in the payment of cash bonuses of up to 25% of base salary for on-target financial performance, with the opportunity to earn higher bonuses for exceptional performance up to 75% of base salary 100% for the Chief Executive Officer.
Additionally, the executive directors with operational responsibilities Adrian Chedore and David Verklin participate in a separate deferred annual cash bonus scheme based on achievement of a demanding year on year excess profit above target financial performance of the businesses for which they are responsible.
The payment of half of any such bonus is deferred for one year.
This deferred bonus will normally be forfeited in the event that the director leaves the Group.

These schemes replaced all of the previous share-based incentive schemes and were designed to reflect changes in the guidelines issued by institutional shareholders and developments in market practice.
No further awards will be made under the previous closed schemes, although awards granted in the past will continue to be exercisable in accordance with the rules of each respective scheme.
The closed schemes are the 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme, the 1998 Management Incentive Scheme and the Leveraged Investment Plan.
Details of the 2003 schemes and the performance conditions of these and the closed schemes are given on pages 37 and 38.
Details of all share incentive awards outstanding for each executive director serving during 2003 are set out on pages 35 to 38.
All executive directors future entitlements are subject to the performance conditions applicable to the relevant scheme or plan as disclosed in this report.
Pensions All UK executive directors participate in Inland Revenue approved defined contribution pension schemes.
Douglas Flynn also makes his own unapproved pension arrangements funded by additional salary payments.
Pensionable salary is limited to base salary excluding all bonuses and other benefits.
Non-UK executive directors have arrangements in line with market conditions and statutory obligations operating in their own countries.
Service contracts Details of the service contracts of those who served as executive directors during the year are set out below.
All directors have rolling service contracts which expire at normal retirement age unless terminated beforehand in accordance with the terms of the individual contract.

98 6 months or 12 months in the event of a 6 months change of control of the Company Name Contractual termination payments in addition to any payments in respect of notice periods Doug Flynn An amount equal to two times any bonus received in the previous 12 months.
In the event of a change of control Doug Flynn may, within 6 months, give notice to terminate his employment and receive a payment equal to 24 months salary and benefits plus an amount equal to any bonus received in the previous 12 months.
David Verklin An amount equal to 12 months salary and benefits.
Note: Bruno Kemoun and Eryck Rebbouh left the Company and resigned as directors on 5 November 2003 having been on service contracts with 6 months notice periods from both themselves and the Company and 18 months contractual termination payment clauses in addition to any payments in respect of notice periods.
The termination payments made to them are shown in the Directors remuneration table on page 34.
Unless there are exceptional circumstances, it is the Companys policy that under any new service contracts, notice periods to be given by the Company will n0t exceed 12 months whether or not a change of control of the Company occurs.
In addition, new contracts will not normally include liquidated damages clauses and any termination payments will be calculated on normal contractual principles taking into account a directors duty to mitigate loss.

The share price on 30 March 2004, the latest practicable date prior to publication of the Annual Report and Accounts, was 95.5p.
Audited performance conditions for the 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme The option price will be the market value of the Companys shares shortly before options are granted.
The value of the shares under options granted to an executive in any financial year may not normally exceed three times basic salary.
The exercise of options is based upon the Companys earnings per share EPS growth relative to inflation RPI, and the following performance conditions apply: Average annual EPS growth in excess of RPI Proportion of option grants exercisable 3% 0.5 x salary 3% to 5% 0.5 to 1 x salary pro rata, on a straight-line basis 5% to 10% 1 to 2 x salary pro rata, on a straight-line basis 10% to 15% 2 to 3 x salary pro rata, on a straight-line basis The performance conditions are tested after three years beginning with the year in which awards are made.
If they are not satisfied at the end of the third year, the performance conditions may be retested after a further one year from the same fixed base point but to the extent that they are not then met, the options lapse.
Audited performance conditions for the closed option schemes 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme That Earnings Per Share growth over the performance period exceeds a composite retail price index plus 5% per annum: and That the Companys total shareholder return TSR performance must be greater than that of the FTSE 100 company ranked 33rd over the performance period.
1998 Management Incentive Scheme That the Companys TSR over the performance period must be not less than 15% per annum compound: and That the Companys TSR over the performance period must at least match that of the FTSE Actuaries 350 Index.
Audited awards under the 2003 Performance Share Plan The table below details awards to executive directors under the 2003 Performance Share Plan: Maximum potential Maximum potential award of shares Awards granted Awards lapsed award of shares Name at 1.1.
The number of shares shown represents the maximum number of shares which is capable of vesting at the end of the performance period, if the performance conditions are satisfied to the fullest extent.
The value of shares which may be conditionally awarded to an executive in any financial year may not normally exceed two times salary.
The extent to which awards vest is determined partly by reference to the Companys TSR performance relative to a group of similar businesses and partly by reference to the Companys EPS growth relative to RPI.
37 10666.01 Pages 22-41 14 04 2004 19:43 Page 38 Aegis Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Remuneration report continued The following TSR targets apply: TSR performance relative to peer group Proportion of award vesting Median or below nil Median to 1st or 2nd nil to 50% pro rata, on a straight-line basis 1st or 2nd 50% The following companies will be included in the peer group for calculation of TSR performance: Dentsu Inc. Pearson plc Grey Global Group Inc. Publicis Groupe S. A. Havas SA Reed Elsevier plc The Interpublic Group of Companies Inc. Taylor Nelson Sofres plc IPSOS S. A. Viacom Inc.
The News Corporation Limited VNU N. V. Omnicom Group Inc.

There is no provision for retesting.
To the extent that the performance conditions are not satisfied, the awards lapse.
The Committee believes that TSR and EPS growth are the most appropriate methods of assessing the Companys relative returns to shareholders and its underlying financial performance.
The assessment of these performance conditions will be carried out by New Bridge Street Consultants, in their capacity as advisers to the Committee.

No further options or Performance Share Plan awards will be granted unless executives retain shares in accordance with these guidelines.
Performance graph The following graph illustrates the Companys total shareholder return since 31 December 1998 relative to the FTSE Media & Entertainment Index, in accordance with paragraph 4 of the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
Aegis Group plc is a member of the FTSE Media & Entertainment Index and the Remuneration Committee considers that a comparison of the Companys total shareholder return relative to similar businesses is more appropriate than a comparison with a general FTSE Index, in order to reduce the impact of general stock market trends.
