Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2003 25 Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration For the year ended 31 December 2003 Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations and also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
The report describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors remuneration and, in accordance with the Regulations, a resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the annual general meeting of the company.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the companys members on the auditable part of the directors remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited Information Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee comprises the three independent non-executive directors, D A Haxby, B Cottingham and N N Broadhurst.
D A Haxby acts as Chairman to the Committee.
None of the Committee members has any personal financial interest in the company other than as a shareholder, nor have they any day-to-day involvement in the running of the business or conicts of interests arising from cross-directorships.
The primary purpose of the Committee is to determine the policy of the group on the remuneration of executive directors.
The Committee has access to executive remuneration consultants to ensure that it receives the best independent advice.
During 2003, the Committee considered that a review of its remuneration consultants was appropriate and, following presentations by a shortlist of candidates, it appointed New Bridge Street Consultants LLP as its advisers.
The Chief Executive and the Treasury & Risk Director also advise the Committee but are not permitted to participate in any discussions relating to their own remuneration.
Remuneration Policy Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the high calibre necessary to maintain the groups strong growth and profit performance and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders.
The performance measurement of the executive directors and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the Committee.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors: Basic salary and benets: Annual bonus: Long term incentives: and Pension and life assurance arrangements.
The companys policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors should be performance related.
As described below, each of the executive directors may earn annual incentive payments of up to 75% of their basic salary, together with the benets of participation in long term incentive arrangements.
Fees paid to the Chairman of the Board are determined by the Remuneration Committee, excluding the Chairman of the Board, in consultation with the Chief Executive.
Fees paid to non-executive directors, other than the Chairman, are determined by a committee of the Board comprising the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive and the Finance Director.
26 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2003 Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration Basic Salary and Benets The basic salary for executive directors is determined by the Remuneration Committee, prior to the beginning of each year, taking into account the responsibilities of the individual director and having regard to relevant market comparisons from independent sources based on objective research.
The policy is to provide basic salaries in the range of median to upper quartile levels by comparison to relevant comparable companies.
There is the potential for upper quartile earnings when justied by corporate and individual performance.
Following the Committees review in late 2003, the Board agreed the following changes to the annual salaries of the executive directors with effect from 1 January 2004: 1 January 1 January 2004 2003 000 000 S P Mahon 470 420 M W G Collins 230 205 J J Corr 230 210 I S Cummine 305 275 In making these recommendations to the Board, the Committee took account of the outstanding performance of the group over a number of years, including 2003.
In addition to basic salary, the executive directors receive certain benets in kind, principally a car and private medical insurance.
Annual Bonus The targets which trigger annual cash bonuses are set by the Remuneration Committee.
In 2003 these targets comprised the following three internal measures of performance: i the groups actual earnings per share growth: ii funds utilisation efficiency as measured against budget: and iii the achievement of each directors personal objectives.
The maximum potential bonus payment to executive directors is restricted to 75% of their basic salary, in respect of the three elements in aggregate.
Bonuses do not form part of pensionable earnings.
Long Term Incentives The Remuneration Committee believes that share ownership by executive directors and senior executives strengthens the link between their personal interests and those of shareholders, and provides the opportunity for longer term motivation and retention.
The companys policy is that the executive directors are encouraged to build up and retain a shareholding in the company, primarily from their long term incentive arrangements, equivalent to their annual salary over a reasonable period.
Restricted Share Scheme This scheme, established in 1994, is structured to provide longer term incentives for the attainment of improved group performance over an extended period.
The participants include the executive directors and some other key senior executives who are best placed to inuence such performance.
In relation to the awards made contingently under the scheme, each participant is notionally awarded shares up to one times basic annual salary each year.
The limit is calculated by reference to the market value of the shares subject to the award on the date it is made.
The number of long term incentive shares which a participant ultimately receives will depend upon performance over a period measured by real growth in earnings per share.
Earnings per share is calculated on the same basis as stated in the groups financial statements, subject to the Committee making such adjustment as it sees t to take account of any material short term effect arising from an acquisition or any exceptional item of profit or loss in the groups financial statements in a particular year.
Any such adjustment to earnings per share by the Committee would be made in consultation with the external auditors.
The shares will not vest absolutely in the participants until after the end of three years and then only if they are still in the groups employment at that time.
The rules cover the possibility of shares vesting at an earlier date in the event of death, or employment ceasing because of injury, disability or normal retirement.
In the event of a change of control of the company, any shares already Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2003 27 awarded as a result of the performance goals having been attained will vest in the participants.
Any balance of the notional award for future accounting periods will not vest.
The participants have no voting rights or entitlements to dividends in respect of the shares until they vest.
Earnings per share growth is believed by the Committee to be an appropriate measure upon which to base the groups success over time, because earnings per share is a widely used statistic in gauging a companys performance and in valuing its shares and can be most directly inuenced by the performance of the executive directors.
Earnings per share must grow by a minimum pre-determined amount, set by the Remuneration Committee at the time of the award, over a three year performance period before participants will become entitled to any shares.
Target earnings growth is as follows: Three year Notionally awarded Earliest vesting date target earnings growth January 2001 April 2004 45% i January 2002 April 2005 45% January 2003 April 2006 45% January 2004 April 2007 45% i In excess of the increase in the Retail Price Index: all other years in excess of the increase in the Retail Price Index to the extent that it exceeds 5%.
The provisional award of shares is established by comparing the actual earnings growth achieved by the company against the pre-determined target set for the relevant period.
The maximum award will be made where the target has been met or exceeded.
If the earnings growth achieved by the company is less than the target, then the provisional award will be reduced on a straight line basis, such that where the earnings growth is less than 50% of the target in respect of awards made in 2001 and 2002, and 66.67% of the target in respect of awards made in 2003 and 2004, no provisional award is made.
When the provisional award has been calculated, the earnings growth achieved by the company is then compared with the average earnings growth achieved by the constituent companies included in the FTSE All Share Index and the Speciality and Other Financials Index.
If the earnings growth achieved by the company is less than that achieved by the constituent companies of either index, the provisional award is reduced by 1% for every 4% by which the earnings growth of the company falls below that of the constituent companies in either index.
The provisional award may be reduced by a maximum of 25% as a result of this comparison.
Equally, if the earnings growth achieved by the company exceeds that achieved by the constituent companies of either index, then the provisional award is increased by 1% for every 4% by which the earnings growth of the company exceeds that of either index, subject to the original notional award not being exceeded.
Awards are at the sole discretion of the Committee, which determines from time to time which executives shall be invited to participate and the level of awards of shares to be made to each of them.
The scheme operates in conjunction with an employee benefit trust, the trustee of which is Cattles Trustee Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cattles plc.
The directors of the trustee company are the members of the Remuneration Committee, all of whom are non-executive directors of the parent company, and none of whom is a beneciary under the scheme.
The Trust purchases shares in the market for the purpose of the scheme, hence there is no issue of new shares.
The Trust will at no time hold more than 5% of the issued share capital of Cattles plc.
The scheme is funded by loans from the company to the Trust, which then acquires Cattles plc shares for the purpose of the scheme.
The loans are repayable over the life of the scheme out of contributions from Cattles plc, which are taken as a charge against profits each year.
28 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2003 Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration Sharesave Scheme This scheme was approved in 2003 as a replacement for the 1993 Sharesave Scheme which had reached the end of its xed 10 year life span.
The scheme enables all employees, including executive directors, with more than two years service at the date of invitation, to enter into a SAYE savings plan.
At the end of five years, participants can exercise an option to acquire shares in the company at a xed price determined at the outset of the savings contract in accordance with the scheme rules.
The exercise of options under this scheme is not subject to any performance conditions, in accordance with Inland Revenue rules.
The timing of invitations under this scheme is determined by the Board acting upon the recommendation of the Committee.
Share Incentive Plan The Share Incentive Plan was introduced in 2003.
It is open to all eligible UK employees, including executive directors, and is an Inland Revenue approved all employee share plan.
Each year an amount is set aside as determined by the Board acting upon the recommendation of the Committee.
The amounts attributable to eligible employees are determined by a formula linked to their salaries and the profit performance of the operating unit in which they are employed.
The maximum award to any one employee during a year is 3,000.
Share Scheme 1994 The beneficial UK tax relief available to employees under this scheme was withdrawn by the Inland Revenue for any appropriation of shares after 31 December 2002.
Consequently, no further appropriations will be made under this scheme.
Executive Share Option Schemes Executive directors and senior executives do not participate in the Executive Share Option Schemes subsequent to their being invited to participate in the Restricted Share Scheme referred to above.
No executive director has options outstanding or unexercised under either the 1994 or the 1996 schemes.
Grants of options to other senior executives of the group are made by the Committee under two schemes.
These are the Cattles Executive Share Option Scheme 1994, an Inland Revenue approved scheme, approved by the shareholders in 1994, and the Cattles Executive Share Option Scheme 1996, approved by the shareholders in 1996.
The 1996 scheme was introduced to enable grants of options to be made, where appropriate, in addition to those granted under Inland Revenue approved schemes.
The exercise of options under both schemes is dependent upon the achievement of earnings per share-based performance criteria.
Pension and Life Assurance Arrangements S P Mahon, J J Corr and I S Cummine have individual personal pension plans into which the company has contributed 20% of basic salary.
M W G Collins is a member of the Cattles Staff Pension Fund and is subject to the statutory pension cap.
He therefore receives payments representing 20% of the difference between his basic salary and that cap for contribution to additional pension schemes.
No other payments to directors are pensionable.
Cattles Staff Pension Fund is a funded, Inland Revenue approved, final salary occupational pension scheme with a contribution rate of 5% of pensionable salary from the employee.
Its main features, which apply to all members on the same terms, are: i pension is payable at normal pension age of 65 at 1 60th of final pensionable salary for each year of pensionable service up to a maximum of 40 60ths ii death in service life assurance cover is provided at four times pensionable salary iii pension is payable in the event of early retirement due to ill health and to spouse on death of member.
The directors are provided with death in service life assurance cover of four times basic salary.
Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2003 29 Performance Graph of Total Shareholder Return Five Years to 31 December 2003 In the opinion of the directors, the FTSE 250 index is the most appropriate index against which the total shareholder return of Cattles plc should be measured because it is an index containing similar sized companies to Cattles plc.
The graph shows the value of 100 invested in Cattles plc on 31 December 1998 compared with the value of 100 invested in the FTSE 250 index.
The result being that the FTSE 250 index has outperformed Cattles plc, on that basis, over the following five years.
Similar calculations over the past two, three or four years would show that the company has outperformed the FTSE 250 during that time: 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 31 Dec 1998 31 Dec 1999 31 Dec 2000 31 Dec 2001 31 Dec 2002 31 Dec 2003 Cattles FTSE 250 Service Contracts It is the companys policy that executive directors service contracts should be rolling contracts requiring a notice period of one year to be given by the company and six months to be given by each director.
Each of the executive directors entered into service contracts, including these terms, on the date of their appointment to the Board.
In order to reect changes in other terms agreed since the original service contracts were entered into and to incorporate changes in employment legislation, the executive directors entered into new service contracts on 5 March 2003.
The company has the right to terminate a directors employment by paying to the director the remuneration which he would have been entitled to receive from the company in respect of the relevant period of notice.
It is the Committees policy that, when determining the amount of any compensation paid to a departing director, the Committee will take into account the directors obligation to mitigate his loss.
Non-executive Directors Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial period of one year, renewable annually, with the intention that they will serve for a minimum period of three years.
They are subject to re-election at an annual general meeting at least every three years in common with all directors.
They do not have service contracts and may not participate in any bonus scheme, share scheme, pension scheme, car scheme or healthcare scheme operated by the company.
The dates of their letters of appointment are: B Cottingham 30 June 1999: D A Haxby 22 June 1999: and N N Broadhurst 23 March 2001.
Reasonable expenses that they may incur in the furtherance of their duties are repaid by the company.

Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2003 33 The accrued pension entitlement shown in respect of M W G Collins is the amount that would be paid each year to the director in the form of a pension on retirement at age 65 in the event of him having left service at the end of the year.
The accrued entitlement includes, where relevant, entitlements earned as an employee, prior to becoming a director, as well as those earned for qualifying services after becoming a director.
The increase in the accrued entitlement is the difference between the accrued benefit at the year end and that at the previous year end.
Transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement in respect of qualifying services represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of the directors pension benets that they earned in respect of qualifying services.
They do not represent sums payable to individual directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The increase in the transfer value less directors contributions is the increase in the transfer value of the accrued benets in respect of qualifying services during the year after deducting the directors personal contributions to the scheme.
