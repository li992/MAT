Directors Remuneration Report Introduction This report sets out the remuneration policy and details of the remuneration of the executive and non-executive directors of the Group for the year ended 26 April 2003.
The report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and approved by the Board for submission to shareholders.
A resolution will be put to shareholders at the annual general meeting on 3 September 2003 inviting them to approve the report.
The Companies Act, as amended by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, requires the auditors to report on the auditable part of this report.
The report has, therefore, been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited Information Remuneration Committee composition The Remuneration Committee the Committee consists entirely of non-executive directors.
As at 26 April 2003, the members of the Committee were Louise Patten Chairman, Alan Giles, Mike Firth and Peter Wilson.
Peter Wilson joined the Committee on his appointment to the Board on 15 May 2002, Mike Firth on his appointment to the Board on 26 June 2002.
Gareth Jones was a member of the Committee until his retirement from the Board on 31 August 2002: Derek Williams was also a member until his retirement on 5 September 2002.
There have been no changes to the composition of the Committee between the year end and the date of this report.
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
The Committee met 12 times during the year.
Of these meetings, eight dealt with substantive issues of policy or principle, four were purely formal meetings to implement decisions to award share options under the Companys discretionary share option schemes or to make redundancy determinations as required by the rules of those schemes.
Terms of reference The Committee is responsible for considering and making recommendations to the Board on the Companys framework of executive director remuneration and its cost and for determining, on the Boards behalf, specific remuneration packages for each of the executive directors and members of the Group Executive Committee, and the terms of any severance packages.
It is also responsible for deciding on the grant of share options under the Companys discretionary share option schemes.
No directors are involved in setting their own remuneration.
Material assistance to the Committee During the year, in order to assist it in determining remuneration for the directors and senior executives, the Committee has consulted the Chairman and the Human Resources Director.
The Committee had already appointed Towers Perrin to provide advice to the Committee on remuneration matters, primarily on executive incentive awards, and sought their advice throughout the year.
Towers Perrin do not provide any other services to the Company.
The Chairman and Human Resources Director attend meetings of the Committee when it is considering the performance and remuneration of the other executive directors.
Remuneration policy statement The Committees goal is to provide and operate a remuneration policy which is consistent with the Groups objectives and with emerging best practice requirements.
The aim is to attract and retain high quality board directors and other senior executives and to align executive rewards with growth in earnings per share and return on capital employed using a combination of base salary and other benefits including, in particular, highly focused incentive arrangements designed to improve performance over both the short and long term.
Remuneration policy The Committee followed the approach described in the Remuneration policy statement in reviewing executive director remuneration arrangements in 2002 03 and, subject to review by the Committee in the light of changes in business performance, the regulatory environment or market practice, intends to follow that approach in reviewing and determining such arrangements in the future.
In making its recommendations to the Board and determining individual packages, the Committee has given consideration to the relevant provisions of the Combined Code and this report follows the provisions of Schedule B to the Combined Code as well as the requirements of the Companies Act as amended by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
In deciding on individual packages, the Committee pays regard not just to salaries, benefits and incentive arrangements in comparable businesses but to the need to balance rewards across the business as a whole.
The relative importance of the fixed and variable elements of the packages described below will vary according to the results achieved.
Annual bonuses and longer term incentive packages will not deliver any value to directors if the targets and performance conditions are not met.
The maximum annual bonus entitlement is generally fixed at 60%: where awards of share options are considered to be appropriate, entitlements are generally set at one or two times salary on a rolling basis to ensure that directors are incentivised to improve performance over the long term.
Total remuneration The total remuneration package of the executive directors consists of the following elements: Base salary Base salary is reviewed annually.
The base salary for each executive director is determined by the Committee taking into account performance and advice and information from independent sources on the rates of salary for similar levels of responsibility in a selected group of comparable companies.
Pay levels and pay reviews within the Group are also considered as part of the annual review.
Somerfield plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 2003 47 Directors Remuneration Report Continued Annual performance related bonus Each executive director is normally eligible to participate in an annual bonus scheme in which payments are conditional on achieving financial performance targets determined by the Committee.
The targets for 2002 03 were not met but the Committee agreed to pay discretionary bonuses of 50,000 each to Robin Whitbread and Gordon Wotherspoon for exceeding the financial objectives set for the Group Buying and Group Property Departments.
The performance of those Departments enabled the Group to meet its revised operating and cash flow targets set for the second half of the year.
Steve Backs service agreement included provision for a guaranteed bonus of 30,000 payable in July 2003.
There is no further guarantee for subsequent years: guaranteed bonus payments are common market practice for executives joining part way through a financial year.
Details of all of these payments are set out on page 50.
Share options new executive incentive plan The Committee has decided that it will not ordinarily make any further awards of share options to directors under the existing discretionary executive approved and unapproved share option schemes.
Awards may continue to be made, on a limited basis, to other employees, including senior executives who are not on either the Board or the Group Executive Committee.
Share options were awarded to Robin Whitbread on his appointment to the Board in July 2002, and to Steve Back on his appointment to the Board in November 2002.
Full details of those awards and all other share options and long term incentive plan awards held by the executive directors are set out on page 52.
The performance conditions applying to all outstanding share options are set out on page 53.
For 2003 04 and beyond, the Committee has designed a new executive incentive plan which it is proposed be put to shareholders for approval at the annual general meeting.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme The Company has operated an Inland Revenue approved Savings Related Share Option Scheme since flotation in 1996.
The scheme operates for the benefit of all employees with at least six months service, including directors.
Under this scheme, employees save on a one or four weekly basis via a bank or building society with an option to buy shares in the Company at the end of a three or five year period at a discount of 20% on market value at the time the option was granted.
There are no performance conditions attached to savings related share options.
Buy As You Earn In September 2002, following approval at the annual general meeting, the Company launched an Inland Revenue approved Buy As You Earn share incentive plan for the benefit of all employees with six months service, including directors.
Under this scheme, employees save on a one or four weekly basis to buy shares in the Company at market value on the date of purchase.
Pensions The Company contributes to personal pension arrangements for its executive directors.
There is also a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme the Somerfield FURBS.
Contributions to the Somerfield FURBS are included as other emoluments within the table of total directors emoluments on page 50.
John von Spreckelsen is not a member of the Somerfield Kwik Save Pension Scheme.
The Company contributes a sum equal to 25% of his base salary towards the provision of a pension.
To the extent that the contribution exceeds the maximum permissible contribution to a personal pension under capping legislation, the excess is paid to John von Spreckelsens personal FURBS.
None of the other executive directors is in the Somerfield Kwik Save Pension Scheme.
The Company contributes a sum equal to 20% of each directors base salary towards the provision of a pension for those directors.
To the extent that the contribution exceeds the maximum permissible contribution to a personal pension under capping legislation, such excess is paid either to the Somerfield FURBS or as additional salary.
Bill Williams has elected to have the whole contribution paid into the Somerfield FURBS.
Benefits In addition to base salary, bonus, pension and other share option arrangements described in this report, the Company provides a range of benefits in kind including a company car or cash allowance, a disability income replacement scheme, private medical insurance, life and accident insurance, mobile phone and employee discount card.
Non-executive directors Fees for non-executive directors are determined by the Board as a whole.
The non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in the Companys bonus, pension or share option schemes but do receive an employee discount card.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts.
They are appointed under letters of engagement which, in every case, envisage an initial or renewed term of three years or to the nearest annual general meeting beyond such three year term.
None of the letters of engagement provides for payment of compensation on termination.
All non-executive directors are considered to be independent of management under the more stringent test of independence contained in the Higgs Report and free from any business or other relationship which could interfere with their exercise of independent judgement.
Alan Giles has been a non-executive director of the Company and its predecessor, the privately owned Somerfield Holdings Limited, since 1993 and the Board continues to value Alan Giles contribution as a director with executive experience in another listed retailer.
As none of the present executive directors has been employed by the business for longer than three years, the Board is satisfied that Alan Giles is entirely independent, not being reliant on the Company for his primary income, not having any previous executive role in the business and not being involved in any cross-directorship with any other director, executive or non-executive.
48 Somerfield plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002 2003 Service contracts and compensation All executive directors are employed under rolling service contracts entitling them to a notice period of 12 months.
All contracts terminate automatically on the director reaching normal retirement age, currently 65.
Full details are set out in the table which follows.
The Boards policy is to engage directors on rolling service contracts with notice periods limited to 12 months save in exceptional circumstances to be considered by the Committee should the need arise.
Four directors left the business during the year.
Full details of their severance payments are set out on page 50.
In settling these severance terms, and in accordance with its policy on negotiating termination payments, the Committee gave full consideration to the need for mitigation but, having regard to the ages of the outgoing directors and their prospects for obtaining alternative employment as judged at the time the payments were negotiated, the Committee decided to meet the Companys contractual obligations in full.
Two of the outgoing directors, Stephen Barnett and Martin Gatto, were made redundant so remained entitled to exercise their share options for periods varying from six 1 months from termination for unapproved options to 3 2 years from the date of grant for approved options.
Details of the exercise of certain of these options are set out on page 52.
