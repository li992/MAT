REMUNERATION REPORT 30 The Directors have pleasure in presenting their Remuneration Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2003, in accordance with section 234B of the Companies Act 1985.
The Report will be put to shareholders for approval at the forthcoming AGM.
It also contains additional information required by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and, where possible, information required by the new Combined Code referred to in the Corporate Governance Report on page 22.
The sections marked with an asterisk have been audited by KPMG Audit plc.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee determines the remuneration packages of the executive Directors of the Company and St. Jamess Place UK plc, including the overall supervision of the operation of the executive share option and bonus schemes.
Determination of the remuneration of the non-executive Directors, within the limits imposed by the Articles of Association, is the responsibility of the Board as a whole.
The Committee comprises The Viscount Weir as Chairman, Derek Netherton, Charles Bailey and Michael Sorkin.
The Company Secretary, Hugh Gladman, acts as Secretary to the Committee, providing advice on legal and regulatory issues and the operation of the share option and bonus schemes.
At the Committees request, Committee meetings are also attended by Mike Wilson, the Chief Executive, who makes recommendations to the Committee regarding changes to the remuneration packages of individual directors excluding himself or policy generally.
Such recommendations are discussed by the Committee and adopted or amended as the Committee sees fit.
No Director is present at any part of a meeting of the Committee when his own remuneration or contractual terms are being discussed.
The membership and terms of reference of the Committee are reviewed at least annually and the terms of reference are available on request.
Details of the number of meetings of the Committee during the year can be found in the Corporate Governance Report on page 25.
The Committee also has access, as required, to professional advice and market data and this was provided by Monks Partnership, remuneration consultants, in 2003.
Monks Partnership were appointed by the Committee and have not provided any other services to the Company.
During 2003, the Committee carried out a review of its remuneration consultants.
A number of remuneration consultants were considered by the Committee and, after consideration, the Committee decided to retain the services of its existing consultants, Monks Partnership, to assist the Committee in their deliberations on executive remuneration, long term incentives and other issues.
Remuneration Policy The Committee has regard to the principles set out in the Combined Code when setting remuneration policy.
Overall, the Committee aims to set executive remuneration at an appropriate level to attract, retain and motivate executives of the necessary calibre.
REMUNERATION REPORT continued 31 In terms of salary, the Committee aims to model salaries around the median position for companies of similar size in the UK financial services market and elsewhere.
The salaries paid to individual directors are then set taking into account the responsibilities and accountabilities of each role, the experience of the relevant individual and his or her marketability and future potential.
Fringe benefits are generally in line with other comparable organisations, although the Company does not operate a defined benefit final salary pension scheme for Directors.
The annual bonus scheme is designed to incentivise the Directors to achieve the corporate and personal targets set for the year.
The long term incentive plans are aligned with the delivery of shareholder value and are designed with a view to both incentivise and retain the Directors.
The Committee supports the view of the Board that annual performance targets for executives should be stretching so as to incentivise above average results in terms of sales growth and other business plan targets.
Linked to these targets, the Committee puts in place an annual discretionary bonus scheme, the shape of which is geared to motivate the Directors and other senior executives to achieve and, if possible, better those targets.
50% of the benefits under the scheme are paid in cash and a matching amount is used to buy shares in the Company which do not vest to the individual for three years, thus being retentive as well as linking the value of the award to movements in the share price, in line with shareholder interests.
The Committee has put in place an executive share option scheme for Directors and senior executives, with the awards being conditional on the satisfaction of performance targets linked to growth in earnings per share, so as to create further commonality of interests with shareholders.
The Committee has followed the provisions of Schedule A to the new Combined Code in designing schemes of performance-related remuneration.
Further details of all of the above elements of remuneration are set out below.
Salaries Salaries are reviewed annually in January, using data on the salaries and benefits for executives of other financial services groups and companies in other sectors of a comparable size to the Company.
In January 2004, the Committee increased the salary of Ian Gascoigne to 220,000 following a review of market data by Monks Partnership.
The salaries of all the other executive Directors remained unchanged.
Annual Bonuses In relation to 2003, annual cash bonuses of 25% of salary were awarded by the Committee to the executive Directors following a review of the performance targets set by the Committee at the start of the year.
REMUNERATION REPORT continued 32 For 2003, as in previous years, the performance targets set by the Committee related primarily to sales growth, although the achievement of other objectives set out in the business plan e. g. control over expenses and individual performance was also taken into account by the Committee when assessing individual awards.
The Committee made a reduction in the award that would otherwise have been paid for 2003 as a result of the fine imposed on the Group by the FSA in November 2003 for compliance issues relating to inadequate documentation.
In January 2004 the Committee decided to amend past practice in relation to the annual cash bonus scheme.
For 2004, up to 30% of salary will be awarded by reference to targets set by the Committee relating to the performance of the Group as a whole, primarily in connection with sales growth, control over expenses and compliance matters.
An additional award of up to 30% of salary will be awarded by reference to individual performance of each Director against their own personal objectives for the year.
"So, the maximum annual cash bonus award for 2004, as in previous years, is 60% of salary, which would be payable if the Committee considered that ""outstanding"" performance was achieved by the Group and also by the individual Director concerned."
No executive Director has a contractual right to receive an annual bonus award and the performance targets set by the Committee are based on a sliding scale, which is geared to encourage top-end achievement.
The satisfaction of the targets will be assessed by reference to the Companys internal management information systems, which the Committee believes is the most appropriate method, given the internal nature of the performance targets.
Connected to the annual cash bonus scheme is the deferred bonus scheme under which any amount payable to a Director by way of annual cash bonus in any year is matched by an equal amount paid pursuant to the deferred bonus scheme.
Accordingly, for 2003, 25% of salary was paid into the deferred bonus scheme for each executive Director.
Under the deferred bonus scheme, the deferred element of the annual bonus is used to purchase shares at market value in the Company to be held in an employee trust.
The shares held in the trust vest to the Director after three years and are not subject to further performance conditions due to the performance targets which apply prior to any entitlement being granted, although entitlement to the award is normally lost if the executive Director ceases to be employed by the Group prior to vesting.
The Committee believes that the deferred bonus scheme is an effective incentive for the executive Directors, whilst at the same time offering strong retentive characteristics going forward, as well as being aligned with shareholder interests due to the value of the award on vesting being dependent on share price performance.
The following table sets out details of the awards held by the executive Directors under the deferred bonus scheme during 2003, the benefits of which are still to vest.
REMUNERATION REPORT continued 33 Deferred bonus scheme shares held during 2003 Director Balance as at Balance as at 1 January 2003 31 December 2003 David Bellamy 31,963 31,963 Ian Gascoigne 28,442 28,442 Mike Wilson 75,849 75,849 Notes: i 23,855, 21,686 and 57,831 shares were awarded to David Bellamy, Ian Gascoigne and Mike Wilson respectively on 28 March 2001 and will be held in trust for a restricted period ending on 28 March 2004. ii 8,108, 6,756 and 18,018 shares were awarded to David Bellamy, Ian Gascoigne and Mike Wilson respectively on 2 April 2002 and will be held in trust for a restricted period ending on 1 April 2005. iii No award under the deferred bonus scheme was made to the executive Directors in relation to the year ended 31 December 2002.
Executive Share Option Scheme Since 1997 the Company has operated a discretionary share option scheme for executive Directors and senior employees under which options are granted at market value, such options normally being first exercisable between 3 and 5 years from date of grant, subject to the achievement of certain individual and or corporate targets relating to earnings growth.
The earnings condition applicable to options granted to the executive Directors between July 1997 and April 2002 was that the embedded value earnings of St. Jamess Place Wealth Management Group plc and its subsidiaries have increased over a period of 3 consecutive years by 5% per annum more than the rate of inflation over the same period.
Since May 2002 the Committee has granted options to the executive Directors on an annual basis to 1 the value of 1 2 times salary at date of grant, subject to the discretion of the Committee to revise the level of grant, up or down, to reflect Group and or individual performance and other relevant circumstances.
The Executive Share Option Scheme has a limit on the value of subscription options granted to an individual in any one year of 2 times salary.
The earnings condition applicable to options granted to the executive Directors between May 2002 and December 2003 was that the earnings per share of the Company and its subsidiaries excluding interests in LAHC and the Nascent Group increased over a 3 year performance period fixed by the Remuneration Committee at the time of the grant but which may be extended at the discretion of the Committee to 4 or 5 consecutive years by 5% per annum more than the rate of inflation as measured by RPI over the same period, with earnings being calculated by reference to consolidated profit after tax on the embedded value basis, adjusted for consistency throughout the period.
REMUNERATION REPORT continued 34 At its meeting in January 2004, the Committee reviewed the continued suitability of the performance conditions applying to existing executive options.
The performance condition used for previous grants of executive options was as stated above based on growth in earnings per share, with earnings calculated by reference to consolidated profit after tax on the embedded value basis.
However, following recent changes to accounting practices, the Company now reports on the achieved profit basis and the Companys results have been restated to remove investment smoothing.
A consequence of this is that the Companys achieved profits in any year are very sensitive to any rise or fall of investment markets around the world, a factor which is not within the control of the Directors.
Thus, the performance condition attached to executive options could be achieved or not achieved as the case may be by a rise or fall in stock markets rather than the underlying performance of the business.
As a result of the above, the Committee resolved that the earnings condition applicable to existing executive options held by all staff, including the executive Directors, should be amended so that the hurdle to be achieved which remains unchanged at RPI plus 5% per annum is calculated by reference to the consolidated operating profit before tax of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The Committee considers that the revised condition is equally demanding for executive Directors as before, but better reflects the underlying performance of the business.
Performance will be assessed by reference to the Companys financial results due to the condition being related to growth in earnings.
At a further meeting of the Committee in February 2004, the Committee reviewed its policy on the grant of options to the executive Directors, with the help of Monks Partnership.
It was decided to continue at the present time with the use of share options rather than the alternative of a performance share plan.
Accordingly, the Committee resolved to grant all the executive Directors 1 excluding Mark Lund an option to the value of 1 2 times salary following the announcement of the Companys results in February 2004, such options to be granted at market value on date of grant.
In respect of Mark Lund, the Committee resolved to grant him an option over 750,000 shares following the Companys results announcement, which was the level of option grant agreed by the Committee during the negotiations leading up to the appointment of Mark Lund in June 2003.
The size of the grant was partly to compensate Mark Lund for the loss of options over 2% of the equity in his previous company as a result of his recruitment by St. Jamess Place.
The Committee also considered the earnings condition for the executive options to be granted in 2004.
Following recent institutional shareholder guidelines the Committee decided not to extend the performance period known as retesting in relation to future grants of executive options.
The Committee also decided to adopt a sliding scale earnings condition for future executive options, in line with institutional shareholder guidelines.
Accordingly, the earnings condition applicable to options granted to the executive Directors in 2004 states that the earnings per share of the Company must have increased over a 3 year performance period fixed by the Remuneration Committee at the time of the grant by at least 3% per annum more than the rate of inflation over the same period, with earnings being calculated by reference to consolidated operating profit before tax, adjusted for REMUNERATION REPORT continued 35 consistency throughout the period.
If earnings per share growth of 3% per annum over inflation is achieved during the performance period, 33.33% of the option vests, with 100% of the option vesting to the executive Director for earnings per share growth of 5% per annum over inflation, with a straight line applying in relation to the vesting of options for earnings per share growth of between 3-5% during the performance period.
The market price of the shares on 1 11 August 2003 was 1.17 2. ii The exercise price corresponds with the market price as defined in the Scheme rules on the date on which the options were granted.
At 31 December 1 2003 the mid market price for SJPC shares was 1.58.
The range of prices between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2003 was between 1.61 2 and 75p.
iii Anthony Loehnis options were granted to him while he was an executive Director of the Company.
iv Martin Moule resigned as a Director of the Company on 4 August 2003 and as an employee of the Group on 31 August 2003.
All outstanding share options and deferred entitlements were cancelled on 31 August 2003.
All-Employee Share Option Schemes All UK employees of the Group, including the executive Directors, are eligible to enter into a Save As You Earn SAYE contract, under which they are able to save up to 250 per month, and at the end of the 3 or 5 year savings period acquire shares in the Company at a price not less than 80 per cent of the market price at the date of the invitation to participate.
REMUNERATION REPORT continued 36 Details of the options held by the Directors in 2003 under the scheme and the equivalent predecessor scheme are as follows: SAYE Share Option Schemes options held in 2003 Options held at Granted Exercised Options held at Exercise Date from Director 1 January 2003 in year in year 31 December 2003 price which exercisable Expiry date David Bellamy 16,121 1.07 1 Sept 2002 1 Mar 2003 15,913 1.04 1 Nov 2007 30 Apr 2008 22,812 22,812 0.72 1 May 2008 31 Oct 2008 Ian Gascoigne 9,134 1.04 1 Nov 2005 30 April 2006 13,125 13,125 0.72 1 May 2006 31 Oct 2006 Martin Moule 1,041 1.86 1 Dec 2002 1 Jun 2003 7,307 1.04 1 Nov 2005 30 Apr 2006 13,125 0.72 1 May 2006 31 Oct 2006 Mike Wilson 16,121 1.07 1 Sept 2002 1 Mar 2003 15,913 1.04 1 Nov 2007 30 Apr 2008 22,812 22,812 0.72 1 May 2008 31 Oct 2008 Notes: i On 28 February 2003, options originally granted to David Bellamy and Mike Wilson under the above Scheme on 11 August 1997 to acquire 16,121 ordinary shares of 15p each in SJPC with an exercise price of 1.07, lapsed in accordance with the Schemes rules.
ii On 28 March 2003, David Bellamy and Mike Wilson cancelled options granted under the above Scheme on 11 September 2002 to acquire 15,913 ordinary shares of 15p each in SJPC with an exercise price of 1.04. iii On 28 March 2003, Ian Gascoigne cancelled an option granted under the above scheme on 11 September 2002 to acquire 9,134 ordinary shares of 15p each in SJPC with an exercise price of 1.04. iv Martin Moule resigned as a Director of the Company on 4 August 2003 and as an employee of the Group on 31 August 2003.
Shareholders approved the establishment of an Inland Revenue approved Share Incentive Plan SIP formerly known as an All-Employee Share Ownership Plan at the AGM in 2000.
"All employees, including the executive Directors, can participate in the SIP, which entitles them to a grant of ""free shares"" up to a maximum value of 3,000, subject to the attainment by their relevant business unit of pre-set performance targets."
No Director became entitled to a grant of shares under the SIP rules in 2003.
Pensions and Death in Service Benefits Until 30 June 2002, the provision of pension benefits for the executive Directors had generally been made through employer contributions of 15% of base salary to the money purchase section of the Groups occupational pension scheme.
In January 2002, following a review, the Committee decided to increase the employer contribution for Directors who had served at least 10 years with the Group to 17.5% of base salary.
Accordingly, employer contributions of 17.5% of base salary were made to the money purchase section of the Groups occupational pension scheme for David Bellamy, Ian Gascoigne and Mike Wilson from 1 July 2002.
Martin Moule was entitled to pension benefits of 15% of base salary up to his date of resignation.
REMUNERATION REPORT continued 37 Sir Mark Weinberg received a salary supplement equal to 12.5% of his base salary in lieu of pension contributions until 30 June 2002, increasing to 17.5% thereafter.
To the extent that pension contributions were restricted by the earnings cap, such shortfalls were paid by way of taxable salary.
The costs of the pension and death in service arrangements for the executive Directors during the year ended 31 December 2003 are shown on page 39.
Service Agreements It is the Committees policy that service agreements should generally terminate on the executives 60th birthday and should not contain notice periods in excess of one year.
The terms and conditions of the Directors service agreements are reviewed regularly and all service agreements contain an express obligation on the executive to mitigate his loss in the event the agreement is terminated.
In addition, the Company reserves the right to pay an amount representing the value of salary and benefits in lieu of any outstanding period of notice.
When considering the size of any proposed termination payment, the Committee would take into account a number of factors including the health, length of service, age and the performance of the relevant executive, including the duty to mitigate his own loss, with a broad aim to avoid rewarding poor performance while dealing fairly with cases where the departure is due to other reasons, for example illness.
Details of the service agreements of the executive Directors are set out below: Sir Mark Weinbergs service agreement dated 15 May 2002 can be terminated by, inter alia, either party giving the other not less than twelve months written notice.
