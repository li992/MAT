All appointees are subject to regular re-appointment by shareholders with the exception of the chairman.
Contracts are terminable without notice in accordance with the articles of association.
Non-executive directors remuneration The remuneration for non-executive directors is set by the full board on the recommendation of the executive directors.
Remuneration comprises an annual fee.
Non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in any of the companys bonus or share option schemes.
Remuneration policy It is the companys policy to provide for each of its executive directors a remuneration package which is adequate to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the appropriate calibre, whilst at the same time not paying more than is necessary for this purpose.
Executive directors remuneration The following comprised the principal elements of executive directors remuneration for the period under review: base salary benefits, including pension, company car and fuel, healthcare and private telephone costs annual short term performance related bonus long term incentive plan LTIP share options At present the arrangements for executive directors are as follows:- the short term bonus awarded annually by the remuneration committee and relates to group and other than for the chief executive, finance director and group commercial director business group profit achievement supplemented by a discretionary element.
The maximum bonus payable is 40% of salary LTIP, under which each year shares may be awarded to executive directors equal in value to 30% of basic salary.
The shares are held in trust and released after three years pro rata to achievement of the performance target.
The performance criterion is the Total Shareholder Return TSR of the Industry Group which comprises the members of the FTSE 250 but excluding Investment Trusts.
Relative movements in TSR are shown in the graph below.
Each time executive directors are awarded shares under the LTIP they are entitled to invest up to 5% of basic salary to purchase additional shares in the company: provided these shares are held in the trust for at least three years, they will be matched on a 1:1 basis with further shares 1423 VT accounts art 03 06 9 6 03 2:07 pm Page 20 20 VT Group Annual Report 2003 Remuneration report Year ended 31 March 2003 Restructuring of remuneration for future years In order to better reflect the stated remuneration policy and to provide a greater amount of variable compensation depending upon performance, in autumn 2002 the remuneration committee took comprehensive advice from The Remuneration Practice and Monks Partnership and as a result approved revised compensation packages for executive directors.
These included all or some of the following elements on an individual basis: base salary benefits including pension, company car and fuel, healthcare and private telephone costs short term bonus awarded annually on the achievement of group profit and cash targets as set each year by the remuneration committee.
Such achievement will result in the payment of a bonus equal to 30% of base salary: substantially exceeding the target could result in a bonus of up to 50% whilst under achievement will produce a substantially diminished amount.
Payment of any bonus will require growth compared with the financial period ended 31 March 2003 LTIP, the revised rules of which are to be submitted to the Annual General Meeting.
If approved, there will be an annual allocation of shares at the discretion of the remuneration committee but these shares will vest in whole or in part only if the TSR of the company equals or exceeds the median of its comparator group.
Further details are contained in the Chairmans letter accompanying this report and the matter appears as Item 9 in the Notice convening the Annual General Meeting executive share options Share option plans The company operates two share option plans a UK Inland Revenue approved plan and an unapproved plan under which directors and other executives are eligible to participate at the discretion of the remuneration committee.
Options are granted at market value, determined immediately before the grant.
Annual awards will not normally exceed one times base salary.
Options under the companys schemes can normally be exercised only on the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the remuneration committee and linked to the underlying performance of the company.
The performance condition currently applying is real growth in earnings per share excluding goodwill amortisation and exceptional items of at least 2% per annum over three consecutive years.
