Report on directors remuneration Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
The Committee recognises that a new Combined Code on Corporate Governance was published in July 2003.
Although the new Combined Code does not apply to the report for this financial year ended 31 December 2003, the Committee has reviewed its policies and procedures to assess the extent of compliance with the new Combined Code and this report, in part, reflects that review.
The Committee will report fully on compliance with the new Combined Code in the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ending 31 December 2004.
A resolution will be put to shareholders at the Companys Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2004 inviting them to consider and approve this report.
The auditors are required to report to the Companys members on that part of this remuneration report which is subject to audit and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
This report is therefore presented in two sections: unaudited information and audited information.
Unaudited information The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is made up solely of non-executive directors with no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in the matters to be decided.
The non-executive directors serving on the Remuneration Committee, throughout the financial year, were Sir Nigel Mobbs Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, Mr Tim Melville-Ross and Mr Mark Nicholls.
On being appointed to the Board on 4 July 2003 as a non-executive director, Mrs Lesley MacDonagh became a member of the Remuneration Committee.
Sir Nigel Mobbs takes no part in any discussions or decisions pertaining to his own remuneration or terms of employment.
Meetings of the Remuneration Committee are held as and when appropriate and at least annually.
During 2003, the Remuneration Committee met on three occasions and each meeting was attended by all the members, then current, of the Remuneration Committee.
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee, from time to time, calls upon Mr Malcolm Harris Chief Executive to assist in discussions and deliberations of the Remuneration Committee on remuneration matters not pertaining to the remuneration or terms and conditions of his own employment.
The Remuneration Committee has, on occasion, appointed external advisers including Ernst & Young, in February 2003, to advise on director remuneration.
Ernst & Young does not provide any other services to the Group.
Towers Perrin act as Trustee for the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan.
The Group Company Secretary, Mr Martin Palmer, acts as Secretary to the Remuneration Committee.
Duties of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the following duties: a Determine on behalf of the Board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of the Chairman, the Chief Executive, the executive directors and, as appropriate, other designated senior executives.
b Ensure that executive directors and senior management are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Company.
c Determine targets for any performance related pay schemes and ask the Board to seek shareholder approval for any long term incentive arrangements.
d Consider and determine the terms, scope, implementation and performance criteria of all share based remuneration schemes.
e Ensure that contractual terms on termination and any payments made avoid rewarding poor performance and approve any severance payments.
f Determine the total individual remuneration package of the Chairman, Chief Executive, each executive director and other designated senior executives, including, where appropriate, bonuses, incentive payments and share options.
Bovis Homes Group PLC Page 53 Report on directors remuneration continued g Determine the policy for and scope of service agreements for executive directors and pensions arrangements, termination payments and compensation commitments.
h Consider and determine the terms, scope, implementation and performance conditions of the annual bonus scheme and approve annual bonuses.
i In determining remuneration packages and arrangements, give due regard to the requirements and recommendations of the Combined Code as well as the UK Listings Authoritys Listings Rules and associated guidance.
j Review competitor companies but ensure that automatic increases are not implemented.
k Oversee any major changes in employee benefit structures throughout the Company.
l Ensure that the provisions regarding disclosure of remuneration, including pensions, as set out in the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, are fulfilled and produce an annual report of the Committees remuneration policy to be included in the Companys Annual Report and Accounts.
During late 2003 the terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee were reviewed and amended to take account of the new Combined Code.
These terms of reference are available on the Groups website www.
uk and on request to the Group Company Secretary.
Remuneration policy The Remuneration Committee determines the Company's policy for the remuneration of executive directors, having regard to the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 and the Combined Code and its provisions on directors' remuneration Schedules A and B appended to the UKLA Listing Rules.
The Remuneration Committee settles and implements the remuneration policy for executive directors and designated senior management.
The Remuneration Committee determines the need for independent professional advice where appropriate and has regard to information on compensation and salary levels in companies in the housebuilding sector and in other companies of comparable size, for executives with similar skills, qualifications and experience.
The objectives of the remuneration policy are to: ensure that the individual rewards and incentives fairly relate to the performance of the individual, the Company and the interests of shareholders: maintain a remuneration package which enables the Company to attract, retain, and motivate executives of the appropriate calibre and experience to further the success of the Company and maximise long term shareholder value: and take into account pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group.
Remuneration package The remuneration package consists of basic salary, performance bonus, health insurance, membership of the Bovis Homes Regulated Independent Car Scheme for Employees BRICS, pension, participation in the Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme, the Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan, and the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan.
The Remuneration Committee aims to balance appropriately those elements of a directors remuneration which are subject to explicit performance conditions, accepting that all remuneration is linked with ongoing appraisal of individual performance.
By virtue of the various elements of directors remuneration subject to performance conditions, a significant part is variable and is not guaranteed.
For remuneration paid during 2003 the fixed and variable element of the remuneration package for each director was as follows: M R Harris D J Ritchie S H Brazier Salary fixed Performance bonus variable 24% 28% 31% Gains on options LTIP variable 33% Note: Mr Malcolm Harris was the only executive director with an award under the 69% 72% Long Term incentive Plan vesting during 2003.
43% He was also the only executive director who chose to exercise share options during 2003.
Page 54 Bovis Homes Group PLC www.
uk Report on directors remuneration continued Salary Executive director salaries are reviewed annually on 1 July taking into account the total remuneration package at the time of the review.
External directorships Executive directors may, if so authorised by the Board, accept appointments as non-executive directors of suitable companies and organisations outside the Group.
Earnings arising from such external directorships are payable directly to the Company.
Performance bonus Following consultation with external advisers to the Remuneration Committee, Ernst & Young, the level of performance bonus which executive directors are able to earn was reviewed in July 2003.
Up until this date the bonus entitlements were capped at a maximum of 50% of basic salary 60% for the Chief Executive.
On 4 July 2003, based on the information arising from the Ernst & Young review of executive director benefits, the Remuneration Committee resolved that the bonus entitlements be increased and capped at a maximum of 100% of basic salary for each executive director.
It was considered that in doing so the performance bonuses aligned more with the performance bonus entitlements of other companies in the housebuilding sector as well as other publicly listed companies of a similar size to the Company.
The bonuses payable to executive directors have been determined by the Remuneration Committee by reference to challenging performance criteria including exceeding the previous years profit before taxation by a specified percentage and the achievement of other strategic targets.
They include entitlement to benefit under the new Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan amounting, for 2003, to a total of 9,000 2002: 9,255.
The bonuses of the executive directors are paid from a bonus pool which is generated from increases in profits over the previous year.
All employees share in this bonus pool.
The Group profits before taxation and bonus are required to grow year on year by 2% above the increase in the Retail Price Index RPI before any bonus becomes payable.
Thereafter, for every 1% increase in profits before taxation and bonus one half of the increase is available to be paid as bonus to all employees, subject to individual bonus caps.
This applies until the increase in profits before taxation and bonus reaches 12% over the increase in RPI at which point the bonus pool is capped.
Additional performance criteria have been established by the Remuneration Committee determining when bonuses equal to 100% of basic salary may be considered for payment.
These include: achievement of an increase in Group profits before taxation and bonus of 12% over and above the increase in RPI: achievement of the Groups budgeted pre tax profit for the year: achievement of Return on Average Capital Employed in excess of 20% for the year.
Pension All the executive directors are senior executive members of the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme.
This is a defined benefit scheme with contributions from both employer and employee, and approved by the Inland Revenue.
Pensionable earnings are basic pay.
As a result of joining the Group after the implementation of the 1989 earnings cap rules, Mr David Ritchie and Mr Stephen Brazier are subject to the statutory earnings cap.
Mr Malcolm Harris is not subject to the earnings cap.
Normal retirement age for senior executive members under the scheme is 60, and the accrual rate is 1 45th of final pensionable earnings for each year of service as a senior executive.
Share schemes The Company employs a standard set of performance conditions for all executive directors in respect of the Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme and the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan.
These performance conditions are described under specific headings in this report.
Granting of share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The performance conditions are designed to challenge and motivate executive directors in the direction of improved profitability and enhanced shareholder return.
The conditions are designed to require strong collective and individual performance from the executive directors before options and awards vest, whilst at the same time offering a credible opportunity for success.
Bovis Homes Group PLC Page 55 Report on directors remuneration continued For share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan to vest an independent view provided by the Companys auditors, as independent experts, is required certifying achievement of the relevant performance conditions.
This independent view is evidenced by the completion of formal certificates signed by the auditors.
The performance conditions attaching to share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan are selected intentionally to be derived from readily available information which is straightforward and transparent.
This ensures that the auditors can make objective assessments of achievement against the performance conditions.
The Remuneration Committee considers that the Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme is no longer consistent with current market practice.
Therefore, if shareholders approve an amendment to the rules of the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan, no future grants will be made under the Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme.
Subject to shareholder approval, the Remuneration Committee intends to increase the maximum number of shares which may be awarded in any financial year under the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan from 75% of a participants basic salary to 100%.
Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme The Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme was established in 1997.
It is an Inland Revenue approved scheme and grants options on an approved basis within Inland Revenue limits and on an unapproved basis outside Inland Revenue limits.
The scheme is operated by the Remuneration Committee and participants are selected at the sole discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
On the grant of an option, the Board shall determine the performance conditions which must be satisfied as a condition of exercise.
The performance condition operated to date is that share options held under the Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme can be exercised if the auditors have certified that the cumulative increase in annualised earnings per share exceeds the percentage increase in RPI by at least 4% per annum 2% per annum for share options granted before 2001 over three consecutive years.
The exercise price of a share option is determined by the Board at the date of grant and will not be less than the higher of the market value and nominal value of an Ordinary Share in the Company at the date of grant.
Each year, executive directors can be granted share options up to a maximum value equal to one years basic salary at the date of grant.
Assuming the performance condition is satisfied, share options may, under normal circumstances, be exercised between the third and tenth anniversary from the date of grant.
Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan A Long Term Incentive Plan for executive directors and senior executives was approved by shareholders at the 2000 Annual General Meeting and established on 10 May 2000.
Under the rules of the scheme at the date of this report a participant may receive in respect of any year a maximum award of shares with a market value, when the award was made, not exceeding 75% of basic salary.
Each award is made subject to the achievement of certain performance conditions and awards may only be exercised at the end of three years.
There is no cost to the participants in the scheme to exercise the awards.
The Remuneration Committee has recommended to the Board that the rules in respect of the Long Term Incentive Plan be amended to increase the maximum award from 75% to 100% of basic salary.
This change has been recommended on the basis that no further grants of share options will be made to the executive directors and senior management.
The Board has included an ordinary resolution in the Notice of meeting in respect of this change in the rules to be voted upon at the Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2004.
The extent to which the awards may be exercised is determined by two measures of performance: total shareholder return TSR and earnings per share EPS growth, each measured over a three year performance period and each relating to half of the shares awarded.
The TSR measure requires the comparison of the growth in the Companys TSR over a three year period to that of a group of comparator companies in the housebuilding industry specified by the Remuneration Committee at the start of the performance period.
TSR is the aggregate of share price growth and dividends paid during the three year period assuming that such dividends are reinvested in ordinary shares.
The Companys ranking amongst the comparator companies will determine the percentage of the shares under the award which will vest, as follows: Page 56 Bovis Homes Group PLC www.
uk Report on directors remuneration continued TSR ranking % of total award which can be realised 1st position 50% of the shares in the award 2nd position 45% of the shares in the award 3rd position 37.5% of the shares in the award 4th position 30% of the shares in the award 5th position 20% of the shares in the award 6th position 15% of the shares in the award The group of comparator companies is as follows: Comparator companies Barratt Developments PLC Bellway p. l. c. The Berkeley Group plc Crest Nicholson PLC Persimmon plc Redrow Group plc Westbury plc Wilson Bowden plc Wilson Connolly Plc George Wimpey PLC Following the acquisition of Wilson Connolly Plc by Taylor Woodrow plc, the comparator group applying to any Long Term Incentive Plan awards in the future will include Taylor Woodrow plc in place of Wilson Connolly Plc.
The EPS growth measure is based on the extent to which the Companys average annual EPS growth over the three year performance period falls between minimum and maximum EPS growth targets set by the Remuneration Committee as follows: EPS growth % of total award which can be realised Maximum EPS growth 50% of the shares in the award Minimum EPS growth 20% of the shares in the award For the current outstanding awards, the minimum and maximum EPS growth targets are 4% and 10% above RPI respectively.
Where EPS growth falls between the minimum and maximum EPS growth targets, the number of shares which can be realised will be determined on a straight line sliding scale.
Where EPS growth falls below 4% above RPI, none of the shares in the award judged by reference to EPS growth can be realised.
The shares required to satisfy the awards have been purchased by the Bovis Homes Group Employee Trust.
The grant price of the awards is set as the market value of the shares at the date the shares are purchased by the Trustee.
The cost of these shares is amortised through the profit and loss account over the three year performance period.
The market value of the shares attributable to each director will be included in remuneration in the year in which the awards are exercised.
An award may only be exercised within six months of the realisation date, the realisation date being the date of notification from the Trustee of the Bovis Homes Group Employee Trust that the award is realisable in whole or in part.
Changes to the remuneration package Prior to any payment of performance bonus or award under the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan during 2004 the Remuneration Committee has entered into a process of consultation with the Companys major shareholders.
This process of consultation has involved enquiring of these shareholders their view of the increase in maximum award under the Bovis Homes Goup Long Term Incentive Plan in place of an annual entitlement to share options under the Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme.
Further, confirmation has been sought that performance bonus entitlements capped at a maximum of 100% of basic salary are acceptable given comparable bonus schemes in similar companies.
The Remuneration Committee has been pleased with the general support received from those shareholders consulted.
The Remuneration Committee has included in the Notice of meeting for the 2004 Annual General Meeting an ordinary resolution in respect of the change in entitlement to awards under the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan.
The Remuneration Committee, having approved the grant of share options in March 2003, has deemed it appropriate to not consider any further grants of share options to executive directors until shareholders have an opportunity to vote on the ordinary resolution mentioned above.
Bovis Homes Group PLC Page 57 Report on directors remuneration continued Performance graph As required by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, the following table includes a performance graph comparing, over the last five financial years, the total shareholder return of an ordinary share held in Bovis Homes Group PLC against the total shareholder return of the FTSE Construction and Building Materials index.
This comparable index is appropriate given that the Remuneration Committee has considered an appropriate comparator group of companies for benchmarking performance.
This comparator group is currently made up of ten UK listed housebuilders, all of which are included in the FTSE Construction and Building Materials index.
The ordinary shares of Bovis Homes Group PLC are included within the FTSE Building Materials and Construction Index.
As such, the FTSE Construction and Building Materials Index is considered by the Remuneration Committee to be a representative comparator for total shareholder return performance.

Other changes in the number of ordinary shares held arose on 7 April 2003 with the allocation of free shares under the Share Incentive Plan.
There were no changes in the holdings of ordinary shares of any of the directors between 31 December 2003 and 5 March 2004, other than the normal monthly investment in partnership shares through the Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan.
The directors interests in share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan are detailed on pages 62 and 63.
There were no changes in the above holdings of share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan between 31 December 2003 and 5 March 2004.
Share ownership guidelines There exist guidelines for executive directors in respect of share ownership of Bovis Homes shares.
The Board expects executive directors benefiting from the exercise of Long Term Incentive Plan awards or exercise of executive share options to retain at least 50% of the net value derived from the exercise, after settling all costs and income tax due, as shares.
This guideline is expected to be applied until such time as the executive director holds shares with a market value equal to current basic annual salary.
