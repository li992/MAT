Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is chaired by A J Scardino and also comprises P D Lewis, W R Slee and C Bell.
The committee is responsible for all aspects of remuneration, for the Executive Directors and the Directors of the principal operating subsidiary.
Remuneration policy The Companys policy is to remunerate the Groups Executive Directors and management fairly in such a manner as to facilitate the recruitment, retention and motivation of suitably qualified personnel.
The measurement of their performance and the determination of the annual remuneration package of the Executive Directors are undertaken by the Remuneration Committee who utilise the services of an external professional adviser to assist them in this area.
The main elements of the remuneration package are basic salary, benefits, performance related bonus, pension contributions and share option incentives.
During the year ended 31 January 2002, the Remuneration Committee sought external advice from BDO Stoy Hayward, acting as independent advisers, as to the main elements of the remuneration package which they considered appropriate for the three Executive Directors, based on a comparative group of companies.
The Remuneration Committee accepted the recommendations of BDO Stoy Hayward which were adopted.
Since 31 January 2003, the Remuneration Committee has sought external advice from Deloitte & Touche, acting as independent advisers, as to all areas of the remuneration package which they considered appropriate for M Long and L J Morgan, based on a comparative group of companies.
Recommendations in respect of basic salary have been implemented with effect from 1 February 2003, the Remuneration Committee is in the process of considering all other recommendations.
The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is determined by the Board.
No Director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
Each element of remuneration payable to Executive Directors is discussed in more detail below.
Basic salary and benefits Basic salaries for all Executive Directors are reviewed annually by the Committee.
Each of the Executive Directors is entitled under their service agreement to an annual increase not less than the increase in the RPI over the preceding year.
In addition to the basic salary, each Executive Director is entitled to the following main benefits: 25 days holiday per annum: a fully expensed company car or cash equivalent: critical illness cover and permanent health insurance: and health cover for themselves, their spouse and minor children.
Performance related bonus The bonus scheme for the year ended 31 January 2003 entitled the Executive Directors to a bonus of up to 40% of their basic salary based upon the performance of the Group.
This ensures that there is a significant element of at risk pay, which is only payable when good results are achieved.
No payments are due in respect of the year ended 31 January 2003.
THE GAME GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2002 - 2003 23 Directors Remuneration Report Directors pension policy M Long and L J Morgan receive company contributions to their defined contribution pension schemes at the following rates: M Long 15% of basic salary L J Morgan 10% of basic salary Share option schemes The committee believes that share ownership by Executive Directors strengthens the link between their personal interests and those of shareholders.
It is therefore Company policy that awards are made, in both current and future years, to Executive Directors and senior management in accordance with the Rules of The Game Group 1998 Executive Share Option Scheme the 1998 Scheme, which permit the award of options up to a maximum of 200% of salary in any calendar year.
Following amendments to the 1998 Scheme which were approved by shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 3 July 2002, the following performance targets apply: i Options granted to an individual in any calendar year in excess of 100% of salary are subject to the requirement that the increase in Earnings Per Share must exceed the increase in RPI by an average of 5% per year: and ii Performance targets will be measured over a period of three years from the end of the financial year preceding the date of grant.
If it is not satisfied, the period will be extended to four years and then five years, but if it is not met at the end of the five year period, the option will lapse.
Options granted to an individual in any calendar year up to 100% of salary continue to be subject to the requirement that the increase in Earnings Per Share must exceed the increase in RPI by an average of 3% per year before the options may be exercised.
These performance conditions were considered to be appropriate as, while imposing a demanding requirement on the participants, they would, if achieved, ensure that shareholders also receive attractive returns over the exercise period.
The Remuneration Committee has also imposed stringent shareholding requirements as a condition attaching to options granted to Executive Directors on or after 15 November 2001.
The current requirement is for Executive Directors to hold shares worth between 33.3% and 50% of salary by the third anniversary of grant.
If this condition is not satisfied, the options will lapse.
On exercise, Executive Directors must retain shares worth at least 50% of the post-tax option gain to the extent that their holdings are worth less than 100% of salary at that time.
Service contracts M Long and L J Morgan are employed under service agreements dated 28 October 1999 and 24 September 2001 respectively which are subject to twelve months notice of termination on either side.
Amounts payable on early termination do not exceed one years aggregate remuneration including benefits.
