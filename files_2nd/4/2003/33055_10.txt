The financial targets are derived from the Companys planning processes so providing alignment between critical annual business targets and reward.
The targets are approved by the Remuneration Committee.
Long-term incentives ICIs long-term incentives focus Executive Directors on sustainable longer-term business performance and strengthen the alignment with shareholders.
Long-term incentives are provided through a Performance Growth Plan PGP and an Executive Share Option Plan.
Together, these plans are designed to deliver competitive rewards, relative to the relevant national market, for improved financial performance, share price appreciation and superior shareholder returns.
Retirement and other benefits The nature and scale of benefits are positioned around the median of the relevant national market.
The major element is the retirement benefit.
Except where defined benefit plans already exist for current Executive Directors, retirement benefits are provided on a defined contribution basis, so that the costs to ICI will be stable and predictable.
Where possible, plans provide flexibility and choice to increase employee commitment, and enable executives to make their own contributions in addition to those made by ICI.
In this way, ICI encourages and supports its Executive Directors to play an active role in planning for their own retirement needs.
It is ICIs policy, where this is in line with local practice, to fund for its retirement benefit liabilities.

3 On appointment as Chief Executive Dr J D G McAdam received a supplementary award for 2003 in accordance with the increase in his salary on appointment.
4 Mr W H Powells awards are in the form of ADRs, but for the purpose of this table have been disclosed in terms of Ordinary Share equivalents.
5 Prior to being appointed Directors, Mr W H Powell and Mr T A Scott participated in cash based long-term incentive plans operated by the Group.
The performance period relating to these awards ended on 31 December 2002.
Mr Powell received no payment in respect of his units and Mr Scott received 9,773 in respect of his service as a Director during the performance period.
6 No variations to awards were made during 2003.

The award, based on the TSR condition, to Dr McAdam also lapsed.
42 ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2003 Directors interests in share options audited Individual annual option grants to Executive Directors during 2003 were in a range of 125% to 250% of salary, reflecting market practice UK or US, as appropriate.
Grants were made subject to a performance condition that over a three-year period in the life of the option the growth in ICIs earnings per share excluding amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items must be equal to, or greater than, the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index plus 3% per annum.
In the light of the Companys current business outlook and the quantum of the grants involved, the Remuneration Committee considered this to be an appropriately challenging condition for option grants made in 2003.
These were the last grants to be made under the current scheme.
The Performance Condition that will apply to the new option plan, subject to shareholder approval, is set out on page 39.
No gains were realised on the exercise of share options during 2003 or 2002.
No performance conditions are attached to options granted under this scheme as it is an allemployee share option scheme.
1 No variations were made to Directors options or the terms and conditions of any Directors options during the year 2003 or the period ended 9 February 2004.
2 No amount was paid for the award of any options.
3 Grants made under the share option scheme have been made subject to an earnings per share performance condition outlined in the first paragraph on page 43.
The grant to Mr W H Powell in 1997 is an exception as it was made before he was appointed a Director and is not subject to a performance condition, in accordance with ICIs practice in the USA at that time.
Options granted in 2001 failed to meet their performance condition on their first test.
The options granted in 2000 which have yet to meet their performance condition, again failed on re-testing.
The performance conditions relating to these options will be retested in one years time.
4 The earliest date from which an option is exercisable is subject to any outstanding performance condition being met.
5 In accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, the annual grant of share options made on 29 April 1999 to certain Executive Directors and certain individuals involved with the then proposed disposal of businesses to Huntsman ICI Holdings LLC was delayed.
As a result of this delay, those participants were granted fewer options at a higher exercise price than would have been the case had the grants been made to them at the same time as they were made to all other participants at an exercise price of 4.33 adjusted for the Rights Issue.
The Remuneration Committee decided that those individuals so affected should receive the same gross gain at the time they exercise their options as if the grant had not been delayed.
6 Following his appointment as Chief Executive Dr J D G McAdam received a one-off option grant of two times salary in addition to his annual grant.
7 Mr W H Powells options are awarded in the form of Stock Appreciation Rights, denominated in ADRs, but for the purpose of this table have been disclosed in terms of Ordinary Share option equivalents at the price of the ICI shares at the date of grant.
Any gain on exercise of these awards is delivered in the form of ADRs.
8 In accordance with their departure terms, options granted in 2003 to Dr B R ONeill and Mr P J Drechsler were lapsed.
As set out on page 48, Dr ONeill and Mr Drechsler retained certain other options that were granted under the ICI Senior Staff Share Option Scheme.
These options have been retained for period of up to two years and remain subject to any performance conditions prevailing at the date of termination of employment of these Directors.
Option grants under the UK all-employee Sharesave Scheme lapsed.
9 The market price of the shares at 31 December 2003 was 1.99 and the range during 2003 was 0.90 to 2.375.
The Register of Directors Interests which is open to inspection by shareholders contains full details of Directors shareholdings and options to subscribe for shares.
10 The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for share option grants.
11 During the period 1 January 2004 to 9 February 2004 there were no changes in the interests of Directors in options.

2 The accrued annual pension at the end of the year or date of termination of employment, payable at normal retirement age or date of retirement.
3 The changes in transfer values which are net of contributions by Directors over the year reflect any changes in pensionable pay and the service of each Director.
They also take into account changes in the actuarial assumptions, particularly those related to equity and bond returns.
4 Dr J D G McAdam and Mr T A Scott participate in the ICI Specialty Chemicals Pension Fund.
Pensionable salary under this plan includes annual bonus, subject to a maximum of 20% of base salary for Dr McAdam and 15% of base salary for Mr Scott.
The pensionable element of bonus is particular to these two Executive Directors and reflects their terms of employment and continuous pensionable service prior to their transfer from Unilever to ICI in 1997, on the acquisition of certain specialty chemicals businesses.
This pensionable bonus element entitlement has been frozen since the time of transfer and has not been increased in line with increases in ICIs bonus levels.
5 The increase in transfer value for Dr J D G McAdam reflects the increase in salary on his promotion to Chief Executive and the effect of this on his 29 years accrued pensionable service.
This increase is in accordance with the rules of the ICI Specialty Chemicals Pension Fund.
6 Mr D C M Hamill participates in the ICI UK Retirement Plan, a defined contribution plan, in respect of base salary up to the Inland Revenue earnings cap currently 99,000 for 2003 4.
He also receives a retirement benefits allowance, payable in cash and subject to income tax, in respect of base salary above this cap.
This allowance is reported in the Directors emoluments table on page 41 and for the period from his appointment as a Director on 8 December totalled 5,073.
7 Mr W H Powell participates in the National Starch and Chemical Company Pension Plan for Salaried Employees and the Supplementary Retirement and Savings Plan of National Starch and Chemical Company.
Under these Plans, pension is based on average pay, including annual bonus, during the previous five years, during which time Mr Powell was promoted to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of National Starch and Chemical Company.
He also participates in two defined contribution plans, for which the employers contributions are set out above.
Mr Powells figures reflect not only the change in value of benefits but also changes in exchange rates used for the translationto sterling.
8 Dr B R ONeill, who resigned on 8 April 2003, participated in the ICI Pension Fund in respect of base salary up to the Inland Revenue earnings cap currently 99,000 for 2003 4.
He also belonged to a funded unapproved retirement benefits scheme, in respect of base salary above this cap, for which the contributions are subject to income tax and are set out above.
Data relates to the date of Dr ONeills termination of employment, or the part-year ending on that date, as appropriate.
9 Mr P J Drechsler, who resigned on 24 March 2003, participated in the ICI Pension Fund.
Data relates to the date of Mr Drechslers termination of employment, or the part-year ending on that date, as appropriate.
10 No Director received an enhancement to his contractual pension benefit during the year with the exception of variations in accordance with Dr B R ONeills and Mr P J Drechslers termination agreements as set out on page 48.
11 The Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority are different from the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and require the following disclosures for defined benefit plans which are calculated on an alternative basis to those disclosed in the table above.
