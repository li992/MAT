21 Directors Remuneration Report DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT This report details the remuneration paid to the Companys Directors including the Chairman, Lord Rothschild, and the Chief Operating Officer, Duncan Budge, for the year ended 31 March 2003.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The remuneration packages of individual executive Directors are determined by the Remuneration Committee which comprises Charles Bailey as Chairman and Baron Lambert, both of whom are considered by the Board to be independent, non-executive Directors.
Lord Rothschild and Duncan Budge liaise closely with the Committee, although they do not take part in any discussions relating to decisions on their own terms and conditions of employment.
The Committee appointed the Remuneration Benchmarking team of  LLP to provide information to it on the remuneration packages of senior executives in comparable companies.
Determination of the remuneration of the non-executive Directors, within the limits imposed by the Articles of Association, is the responsibility of the Board as a whole.
The Remuneration Committee is also responsible for the operation of the long-term incentive plan for executive Directors.
Remuneration Policy The Company complied in the year under review with the provisions relating to Remuneration Committees incorporated in the Combined Code.
The Remuneration Committee aims to set executive remuneration at an appropriate level to attract, retain and motivate Directors of requisite calibre.
Any arrangements made to provide longer term incentives will aim to encourage and reward performance and to benefit shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee aims to compare remuneration packages of similar financial institutions to the Company and models its decisions on the median position of those institutions.
In setting policy and making decisions, the Remuneration Committee gives full consideration to the provisions on the design of performance-related remuneration set out in Schedule A of the Combined Code.

No payments were made to Directors under the terms of the long-term incentive plan.
Basic Salary, Benefits and Bonus Basic salaries for the executive Directors are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee and the last review was at 31 March 2003, following the receipt of information from the Remuneration Benchmarking team of  LLP.
For the current year, to 31 March 2004, Lord Rothschilds salary has increased from 318,270 per annum to 340,000 per annum and Duncan Budges salary has increased from 207,700 per annum to 250,000 per annum.
Although there is no formal bonus scheme, the executive Directors may participate, from time to time, in bonus payments at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
A bonus of 15,578 was payable to Duncan Budge and a bonus of 23,870 was payable to Lord Rothschild in respect of the year under review.
This bonus was at the same proportionate rate as was paid to other members of staff.
Long-term Incentive Plan Long-term incentive arrangements were approved by shareholders on 10 July 1996, as they constituted related party transactions under Stock Exchange rules.
Under their respective participation in the Share Appreciation Rights plan as at 31 March 1999, Lord Rothschild and Duncan Budge were both entitled, at a time of their choice between the third and tenth anniversary of the grant and in respect of any subsequent grants to a bonus.
This would be calculated by reference to a notional number of the Companys shares in each case 587,371 at 340.5p.
The amount of the bonus will represent the increase, since the date of grant, in the Companys share price multiplied by the notional number of shares.
This is, however, conditional on any increase in the share price, plus dividends paid, exceeding the increase in the Retail Price Index plus 3% per annum for any three year period between the date of grant and the tenth anniversary thereof.
RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Directors Remuneration Report 23 The Remuneration Committee decided that further participations in the Share Appreciation Rights plan should be granted to both Lord Rothschild and Duncan Budge on 22 March 2000 and 26 March 2003.
The notional number of shares involved was 228,833 at 437p and 262,467 at 381p respectively in each case.
As at 31 March 2003 the amount accrued under all three participations was 364,170 payable in equal parts to Lord Rothschild and Duncan Budge.
This compared with an accrued amount of 986,784 as at 31 March 2002 and followed a decrease in the middle-market price of RITCP shares during the period from 424.5p to 371.5p.
Should either participant leave their employment involuntarily at any time, the bonus accrued to the relevant date will be payable, subject to there being no grounds for nonpayment arising out of negligence or other misconduct.
Performance Graph In accordance with the new regulations under the Companies Act 1985, it is now necessary to include a performance graph which measures the Companys total shareholder return calculated by reference to the Companys share price, including dividend reinvestment against that of a broad equity market index.
For this purpose the Committee considers that the Morgan Stanley Capital International Total Return Index in Sterling, the FTSE All-Share Total Return Index and the Investment Trust Net Assets Total Return Index are the most suitable indices for comparative purposes.
The graph below therefore compares the Companys total shareholder return to that of these three indices over the last 5 years.

Lord Rothschild and Duncan Budge are members of the RITCP Pension and Life Assurance Scheme, the RITCP Scheme.
Within the RITCP Scheme, money purchase arrangements have been set up for Lord Rothschild, to which the Company has contributed throughout the year under review at the rate of 20% of basic salary amounting to 63,654 in the year ended 31 March 2003 31 March 2002: 61,800.
Contributions are based on basic salary only.
Duncan Budge is a defined benefit member of the RITCP Scheme for which the contribution rate was 34% of basic salary until 30 June 2002, when the rate was increased to 35%.
No pension provision is made for the non-executive Directors.
Executive Directors Pensions Duncan Budge is the only executive Director who is a member of the defined benefit section of the Companys pension scheme.
The table below gives details of the movements in the potential benefits and transfer values during the year.
000 Accrued benefit at 31 March 2002 73,901 Change in accrued benefit due to inflation 1,256 Change in accrued benefit due to other factors 5,551 Accrued benefit at 31 March 2003 80,708 Transfer value at 31 March 2002 786,067 Increase in transfer value 11,878 Transfer value at 31 March 2003 797,945 Transfer value at 31 March 2003 in respect of increase in accrued benefit excluding inflation 11,878 The accrued, but deferred, pension entitlement is calculated on the basis that the Director left service on 31 March 2003.
The transfer value is a liability of the pension scheme rather than an amount due to be paid to the executive Director or a liability of the Company.
Non-executive Directors The remuneration of the non-executive Directors is determined by the Board as a whole, in accordance with the provisions of the Articles of Association.
Non-executive Directors do not take part in discussions on their own remuneration.
The basic annual fee is 15,000, which the Remuneration Committee believes to be in line with current market practice.
However, this figure is increased in certain cases when the involvement of the non-executive Director in the Companys affairs warrants such increase and more especially when they are members of a committee.
Jean Pigozzi and Michael Sofaer have each waived their right to receive 15,000 in respect of the years ended 31 March 2002 and 31 March 2003.
The term of appointment for a non-executive Director is three years, terminating on the date on which the non-executive Director is required to retire by rotation at the Annual General Meeting, at which time the appointment will be reviewed by the Board.
RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Directors Remuneration Report 25 Directors Service Contracts It is the Remuneration Committees policy not to grant service contracts with notice periods in excess of one year.
The terms and conditions of the Directors service contracts are detailed below and are reviewed as required.
Lord Rothschild and Duncan Budge both have service agreements with J. Rothschild Capital Management Limited.
Lord Rothschilds service agreement is dated 29 April 1996, but was initially with an associated company and originally dated 20 October 1993.
The agreement can be terminated, inter alia, by either party giving the other not less than twelve months written notice.
It provides for benefits in kind in line with normal company practice, including pension provision, private health insurance and a company car.
The agreement determined on Lord Rothschilds 65th birthday and is currently on a rolling one year basis.
The agreement does not specify compensation payable in the event of early termination.
Duncan Budges service agreement is dated 29 August 1996, but was originally with an associated company and dated 6 August 1985.
The agreement can be terminated, inter alia, by either party giving the other not less than twelve months written notice and will automatically terminate on his 60th birthday.
It provides for benefits in kind in line with normal company practice, including pension provision, life assurance, permanent health insurance, private health insurance and a company car.
When considering the size of any proposed termination payment, the Committee would take into account a number of factors including the health, length of service, age and the performance of the relevant executive, including the duty to mitigate his own loss, with a broad aim to avoid rewarding poor performance while dealing fairly with cases where the departure is due to other reasons, such as illness.
Termination Payments and Payments to Third Parties No payments were made to a Director of the Company for termination of employment nor were any payments made to third parties for Directors services during the year.
