b Defined benefit plans: The defined benefit plans comprise a combination of the Standard Chartered Pension Fund, an approved non-contributory scheme, and an unapproved unfunded retirement benefit scheme.
The unapproved unfunded retirement benefit scheme provides that part of the benefit which cannot be provided through the approved plan.
In other respects the terms of this scheme are designed to mirror the provisions of the Standard Chartered Pension Fund.
For example, both have a normal retirement age of 60 and a spouses pension of 60 per cent of the members pension including any amount exchanged for a cash lump sum at retirement on death after retirement.
On the death in service of a director, pension benefits are available to a spouse and dependant children and a lump sum is payable.
Members of the Standard Chartered Pension Fund may retire early but on a reduced pension equivalent in value to the alternative deferred pension.
Guaranteed pension increases subject to the Guaranteed Pension Increase Allowance rule are given in respect of pension for service up to 5 April 1997 and five per cent per annum or the increase in the RPI if lower for service from 6 April 1997.
The increase in accrued pension during the year is the difference between the accrued pension at the end of 2002 increased by an allowance for inflation of 2.5 per cent 2002: 2.6 per cent and the accrued pension at the end of 2003.
The total accrued pension at year end includes benefits arising from transfer payments received in respect of service with previous employers.
The table below shows the increase in accrued pensions during 2003 without any allowance for inflation, and the increase in the transfer value of the total accrued pensions between the end of 2002 and the end of 2003 for members of the defined benefit plans.
