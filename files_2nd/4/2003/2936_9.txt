Remuneration Report This report has been prepared in accordance with the Combined Code.
For the information of shareholders, so far as possible the Company, in this report and the Corporate Governance Report also reports against the relevant provisions of the revised Combined Code which will come into effect for reporting years beginning on or after 1 November 2003.
The Board is responsible for determining policy for remuneration of the Directors of Carillion plc and key members of the senior management team.
The Remuneration Committee comprises Roger Dickens, Jean-Paul Parayre and Andrew Parrish Chairman, and is responsible for formulating policy and recommending to the Board the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
Sir Neville Simms stood down from the Committee during the year.
The Board determines the fees of the Non-Executive Directors based on independent external advice.
The Remuneration Committee is assisted in remuneration decisions by Susan Morton, Group HR Director and by John McDonough, Group Chief Executive.
Additionally, the Remuneration Committee uses The Monks Partnership a business owned by  LLP to provide salary survey and benchmarking information.
The Monks Partnership, which was appointed in 2001, has no other connections with the Company.
Remuneration policy It is the policy of the Company to ensure that remuneration and other benefits attract, motivate and retain Executive Directors and senior managers of the required calibre to achieve the Boards objectives, including that of achieving growth in shareholder value.
Remuneration and other benefits are determined with regard to competitive market practice and, where considered appropriate, are supported by external independent surveys.
The main elements of remuneration of the Executive Directors are basic salary and pension benefits, together with annual performance bonuses linked to the Groups financial and share price performance to ensure that the interests of the Executive Directors are aligned to those of the shareholders.
The Company intends to continue this approach to the structure of remuneration for the foreseeable future subject to any changes in legislation with regard to pension provision.
The Groups remuneration policy is also based upon Carillions strategic objectives, which specifically include achieving high standards in respect of sustainability, which encompasses Carillions health and safety, environmental and social performance.
Service contracts The Chief Executives service contract is terminable by one years notice from the Company.
The other Executive Directors service contracts are terminable in normal circumstances by two years notice from the Company.
The Combined Code sets as a principle that notice periods in Directors contracts of service should be set at one year or less, or reduce to one year or less after an initial period.
The Groups position to date has been that the two-year contracts which remain in place were entered into in good faith at a time when contracts of such a period had been acceptable and the Board does not consider it appropriate to negotiate shorter periods.
In any event it has been the practice of the Group to require mitigation in the event of termination.
It is likely that any new appointments will be made on the terms of one years notice, or on a longer period reducing within a defined interim period to one year.
Upon termination of their employment, Executive Directors of the Company have no additional entitlement to compensation for loss of their office as Directors.
The service contracts contain provision for early termination.
Notice Name Commencement period Term John McDonough 1 January 2001 12 months rolling Chris Girling 13 September 1999 24 months rolling Roger Robinson 29 July 1999 24 months rolling Non-Executive Directors are not employed under contracts of service, but are generally appointed for fixed terms of three years renewable for further terms of one to three years if both parties agree.
Each of the Non-Executive Directors appointments is presently in such renewed terms.
As Chairman and in recognition of the associated responsibilities, Sir Neville Simms has a contract for services which commenced on 1 February 2001 for a period of two years and which now continues unless and until terminated by either party giving one years notice.
26 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Basic salary and other benefits The basic salaries and other benefits of the Executive Directors are set by the Remuneration Committee and are determined taking into account individual performance and information provided by independent sources on the rate of salary for similar posts in comparable companies.
The aim is to reward Directors fairly and competitively.
Other benefits typically include a company car, private healthcare and salary supplements or contributions to a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme FURBS in place of approved pension provision for salary over the annual earnings cap.
Annual performance bonus and deferred bonus plan Annual bonuses are reviewed each year by the Remuneration Committee, which sets performance targets geared to profit, key financial indicators and individual performance objectives.
The Executive Directors have the potential to earn annual bonuses up to a maximum of 50% of their basic salary for outstanding performance.
The bonus arrangement for 2003 set a financial performance target based on earnings per share and individual, detailed and confidential personal performance objectives that support the strategic objectives of the Company.
The maximum bonus opportunity of 50% comprises an annual cash payment limited to 30% of salary with a deferred bonus of shares of the Company with a value of up to 20% of salary vesting after one year.
The number of shares allocated is determined by the price prevailing at the date the bonus is confirmed and the amount by which the bonus earned exceeds 30% of basic salary at the end of the bonus year in question.
The shares are released on the condition that the recipient makes funds available to the Company at the point of transfer to allow the Company to meet its tax and National Insurance obligations on the value of the shares transferred.
Pension benefits The Group makes contributions to an Inland Revenue approved defined benefit scheme and, where applicable and where the individual has so elected, to FURBS on behalf of the Executive Directors.
Alternatively, a payment equal to the contribution the Group would have made to the funded unapproved arrangement is paid to the Executive Director as a salary supplement.
Contributions to the funded unapproved arrangements are reported as a benefit in kind on an annual basis.
Salary supplements are taxed at source.
Directors remuneration The remuneration of the Directors of Carillion plc for the year ended 31 December 2003 is set out in the table below.

27 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Remuneration Report continued Executive pensions Until April 2003, it was the Companys policy to offer membership of the Carillion B Pension Scheme to Executive Directors and other senior employees.
This scheme was operational from 1 October 1999.
The scheme is a funded, Inland Revenue approved, defined benefit scheme to which members contribute 7% of pensionable earnings.
The main features are: pension payable at the normal retirement age of 60 save in cases of ill health or early retirement pension accrual rate for Executive Directors of 1 30th of final pensionable salary for each year of service targeting a pension at normal retirement age of two thirds of final pensionable salary subject to twenty years service after which employee contributions cease increases to pensions in payment in excess of the State Guaranteed Minimum Pension in line with price indexation up to 5% per annum life assurance of four times pensionable salary pensions payable in the event of ill health, and on death in service or after retirement, spouses and or dependents pension at two thirds of members pension.
Maximum pension benefits of two thirds of pensionable salary are offset by any pension benefits accruing from earlier pension arrangements.
The Carillion B Pension Scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 1 April 2003.
Pension provision for senior managers and Executives is now through their existing Carillion scheme for current employees or the Carillion Pension Plan for new employees and existing employees who opted for membership.
The Carillion Pension Plan is a defined contribution pension arrangement that provides members with pensions at retirement based on the accumulated value of their notional pension account within the plan.
The current Executive Directors are subject to the Inland Revenue earnings cap and their pensionable salary is limited accordingly.
They are provided with additional benefits by way of individual FURBS or a salary supplement equal to the contribution the Group would have made to a FURBS and with unapproved life cover of four times salary over the earnings cap.
In all cases, any contributions made to these arrangements in respect of the year are disclosed separately above.
As these additional arrangements are limited to the balance of basic salary in excess of the earnings cap, bonus paid to Executive Directors does not count towards pension benefits.
The Company does not contribute to any pension arrangements of Non-Executive Directors.
Directors pensions Pensions accruing during the year to Executive Directors in their capacity as Directors of Carillion plc are set out below.

Share incentive schemes The Company operates four share incentive schemes to motivate employees and to encourage them to invest in the future success of the Group.
The Founders Equity Plan, the Executive Share Option Schemes and the Long Term Incentive Plan all have challenging performance criteria which apply similarly to all participants.
The Board believes that these schemes complement the strategy of achieving growth in shareholder value by directly aligning these incentives of the Executive Directors and senior employees to the interests of the shareholders.
A Sharesave Scheme also operates to give UK employees the opportunity to have a financial stake in the Company.
28 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 The Founders Equity Plan FEP is a one-off scheme which was established as an incentive for those employees capable of making a critical contribution to increasing shareholder value.
The Executive Directors and certain senior managers were invited to join the FEP and invest a percentage of their basic salary in purchasing ordinary shares in Carillion plc.
These shares, referred to as the Investment Shares, were purchased at an average market price of 137.74 pence per share.
The Investment Shares are owned and controlled by the individual, who is free to choose whether to stay in the FEP or sell the shares at any time during the performance period.
Where members of the FEP dispose of an element of their Investment Shares, the options they have been granted will be proportionately reduced.
For every Investment Share purchased, up to a maximum of four free shares can be awarded, subject to Carillions share price performance.
As the performance condition was not attained in the initial four year period, in accordance with the rules, the performance period is now the five years commencing 31 August 1999 and the performance condition has increased proportionately.
The benchmark share price against which performance will be measured is 138 pence, which was the mid-market price at close of business on 31 August 1999.
At 31 August 2004, Carillions average share price over the previous six weeks must have been at least 437.5 pence for the options to be exercisable in full.
If the share price does not reach 221.5 pence, the options will not be exercisable.
If the share price increases in between these two prices, options will become exercisable on a pro-rata basis.
A nominal fee of 1 is payable on the exercise of options.
The performance condition which must be achieved before any free shares are allocated is challenging, but provides a real incentive to Directors and senior managers who can deliver increasing value for shareholders.
At 31 December 2003, Executive Directors and senior managers held a total of 1,390,653 Investment Shares and options over 5,562,615 shares.
Those options not exercised by the tenth anniversary of their grant will lapse.
Executive Share Option Schemes Share options have been granted to the Executive Directors and certain senior managers under two Executive Share Option Schemes.
The options were granted at an exercise price equal to the market value of the Companys shares at the date of grant.
Options under the Inland Revenue Approved Executive Share Option Scheme 1999 which carries certain tax advantages for UK employees and the Executive Share Option Scheme 1999 are exercisable normally between three and ten years after the date of grant, subject to the achievement of the performance condition.
For options granted between October 1999 and October 2002, the performance condition requires that the earnings per share of Carillion over a rolling three year period must increase by a percentage that is not less than the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index over the same period, expressed as a percentage, plus four percentage points per annum.
This performance condition was selected in order to provide an incentive which aligns the interests of executives with those of shareholders in growing the Companys earnings per share.
However, as this performance condition no longer complied with best practice, at the Companys AGM on 14 May 2003, shareholders were requested to approve, and did approve, that future options granted under both schemes become exercisable in accordance with the following table: Average compound annual earnings per share growth before exceptional items in excess of RPI over the three year period following grant Percentage of option that becomes exercisable Less than 4% 0% 4% 30% 4% 10% 30% 100% straight-line basis 10% or more 100% To the extent that the performance condition is not met in full at the end of the three year period following grant, there will be the opportunity for no more than one re-test of performance from a fixed base at the end of the following year.
The first grants of options using this new performance condition were made on 1 July 2003.
The aggregate value of options granted to an employee under the Executive Share Option Schemes cannot normally exceed their basic salary in any year without the prior approval of the Remuneration Committee.
At 31 December 2003, options were outstanding over 3,242,367 shares 2002: 2,068,486 shares under both schemes at exercise prices ranging from 125.2 pence to 210.7 pence.
29 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Remuneration Report continued Long Term Incentive Plan Conditional awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan are made to the Executive Directors and key members of senior management, in recognition of the contribution that these individuals can make to the Groups success.
There is no subscription price for the shares, the award of which is conditional on the Companys performance during a three-year period in delivering Total Shareholder Return TSR against a comparator group of ten companies in the Construction and Building Materials and Support Services sectors.
The awards will vest in full only if Carillion achieves first place.
If the Companys ranking is sixth, 30% of the awards will vest.
If ranking is below sixth, none of the awards will vest.
Conditional awards using this performance condition were made in the years 2000 to 2002.
However, as the Remuneration Committee considered that with a comparator group of ten companies, the removal of one company through take-over or otherwise would have a proportionately greater impact on the extent of the potential vesting of awards than would be the case if the comparator group was larger, shareholders at the 2003 AGM approved that future awards granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan would be subject to Carillions TSR performance against an expanded group of 12 companies from the Construction and Building Materials and Support Services sectors, over the three years following grant.
30% of an award will vest at the median, with awards vesting in full for performance in the top 10% of the comparator group with straight line vesting between these points.
The companies comprising the comparator group for Long Term Incentive Plan conditional awards made in January 2001 are Amec plc, WS Atkins plc, Balfour Beatty plc, Interserve plc, Jarvis plc, Kier Group plc, Alfred McAlpine plc, Mowlem plc and Taylor Woodrow plc.
Amey plc was in the comparator group but was removed as it delisted from the London Stock Exchange in June 2003.
The same comparator group is also used for the conditional awards made in 2003 with the addition of Morgan Sindall plc, John Laing plc and Serco plc.
The first awards with this performance condition were made on 1 July 2003.
The performance conditions were chosen in order to align the interests of Directors and senior managers with those of shareholders in growing total shareholder return against comparator companies operating in similar sectors.
It is intended that conditional awards under the Plan will be made annually.
At 31 December 2003, conditional awards were outstanding over a total of 2,715,234 shares.
Conditional awards made to Executive Directors under these long-term incentive plans are set out in the table of share incentives below.
The awards represent the maximum number of shares that could be awarded to Executive Directors under the performance periods commencing on 1 January 2001 and 1 July 2003.
The monetary value of the conditional awards attributed to each Director was based on their annual basic salary at the date of award and the number of shares was calculated using the share prices of 120.3 pence and 162.1 pence, the average share prices over the six weeks immediately before the commencement of the respective performance periods.

The Sharesave Scheme The Company has established a Sharesave Scheme which provides a savings and investment opportunity for employees in the UK.
The options may normally be exercised on completion of a three or five year savings contract, at a price equivalent to not less than 80% of the market value of the shares at the time of grant.
Options were granted in November 1999 over 6,140,194 shares and in October 2002 over 3,995,803 shares.
The three-year options granted in November 1999 became exercisable on 1 January 2003 for a period of six months.
Options over a total of 1,400,766 shares were exercised during the year.
At 31 December 2003, options over 4,839,716 ordinary shares of 50p each were outstanding under this scheme 2002: 7,302,280 ordinary shares of 50p each, exercisable on various dates up to June 2006 at exercise prices of either 109.1 pence or 126.6 pence.

The option over 254,532 shares at an option price of 210.7p granted to John McDonough in March 2002 under the Executive Share Option Scheme 1999 was made later in the year than had been specified at the time of his appointment which resulted in an increased option price of 67.3p.
Therefore, in order to ensure that he will be in no worse nor better a position as a result of the delay in the grant, a maximum cash adjustment of 67.3p per share less tax will be made when and if the option is exercised.
There have been no changes to the interests of Executive Directors in share incentives and options in the period 1 January to 10 March 2004.
The performance conditions for the options shown in the table are as described under the summaries of the relevant schemes in this report and have been chosen for the reasons described in those paragraphs.
