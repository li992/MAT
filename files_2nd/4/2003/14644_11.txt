2 In respect of Andrew Given, at 9 October 2003, being the date of his appointment.
3 Directors beneficial holdings do not form part of the remuneration provided by the Company.
4 All remaining performance units granted under the LTSPP lapsed without value on 31 December 2003.
5 All three of the Companys executive directors, with other employees of the Group, are potential beneciaries of certain Ordinary shares held in the Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT.
The two UK executive directors, with other employees of the Group, are also potential beneciaries of the Spirent Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST.
As potential beneciaries of the ESOT and the QUEST, the respective directors are deemed by the Companies Act 1985 to be interested in some of the Ordinary shares held by those Trusts.
At 31 December 2003, the deemed beneficial interests in the ESOT and the QUEST were 281,626 Ordinary shares and 3,508,136 Ordinary shares, respectively 31 December 2002 9,064,985 and 3,508,136, respectively.
The change in the deemed interests in the ESOT was caused by the reallocation of shares which had lapsed under other share plans.
These shares have now been reallocated to satisfy the exercise of SSOP options granted on 11 December 2003, a grant in which no executive director participated.
Further details on the Companys share plans are provided in note 32 to the Accounts.
The deemed interests of the executive directors in respect of the shares held in the ESOT and the QUEST are not included in the table above.
6 The non-beneficial interests of Messrs Brookes and Hutchinson represent their respective 100,000 and 46,250 deferred cash bonus awards made under the terms of the annual incentive bonus plan for 2000.
The bonuses were used to purchase shares in the market on 28 February 2001 and are being held in the ESOT for a period of three years from that date.
In normal circumstances, the directors do not obtain a beneficial interest in the shares until the expiry of that period at which time, subject to still being in the Companys employment, the beneficial share interests will be released to them.
There are no other pre-release performance conditions to be satisfied.
7 The non-beneficial interest of My Chung over 39,620 shares exists in a similar manner to that described in note 6 above except that his interest arises from a deferred cash bonus of $175,000 being 50 per cent of his annual base salary made on a discretionary basis on 9 May 2001 in recognition of his promotion to the Board.
The bonus was used to purchase the shares in the market on that date and will be released beneficially to him from the ESOT on the third anniversary, subject to him still being in the Companys employment at that time.
8 Gran Ennerfelt has a beneficial interest in the Company through his connected shareholding in Lexa BV, a wholly-owned subsidiary company of Axel Johnson AB of which he is also President and Chief Executive, which is the registered holder of the above mentioned shares.
9 Since the year end: the number of rights to acquire Ordinary shares for My Chung increased by 13,392 on 1 January 2004 through the grant of purchase rights to him under the US ESPP, an all employee share plan.
This is a provisional number only based on the Companys share price at the date of grant as the actual number of shares in which participants are interested under the ESPP cannot be determined until maturity of the 12 months savings contract: the beneficial interest of My Chung increased by 17,328 to 48,705 Ordinary shares on 1 January 2004 through the exercise of matured purchase rights under the ESPP.
The market price of an Ordinary share on the date of exercise was 58.25 pence being the closing market price on 31 December 2003, the London Stock Exchange having been closed for trading on 1 January 2004.
For further information on the ESPP, see note 32 to the Accounts: and Frederick DAlessio was appointed to the Board as a non-executive director on 26 January 2004.
Between the date of his appointment and 25 February 2004 the date on which the Accounts have been signed, Mr DAlessio did not have a notiable interest in the Ordinary share capital of theCompany.
2 The final exercise price and number of purchase rights under the ESPP, an all employee share plan, cannot be determined until maturity ie 12 months following the date of grant.
The 6,122 purchase rights calculation was based on the market price of an Ordinary share less a 15 per cent discount at the date of grant and the rate of exchange between the US dollar and sterling on the date of grant.
In accordance with the rules of the ESPP, these purchase rights were exercised automatically as part of a maturity on 1 January 2003.
The actual number of shares acquired issued in the form of 5,600 ADRs was 22,400 Ordinary shares.
The closing middle market price of an Ordinary share on the date of exercise was 16.75 pence being the closing market price on 31 December 2002, the London Stock Exchange having been closed for trading on 1 January 2003.
28 Spirent plc Annual Report 2003 Report on Directors Remuneration continued 3 As mentioned in note 2 above, the final exercise price and number of purchase rights under the ESPP cannot be determined until maturity.
In accordance with the rules of the ESPP, My Chungs purchase rights were exercised automatically as part of a maturity on 1 January 2004 over 17,328 Ordinary shares in respect to his 2003 ESPP account.
The small difference between the rights outstanding at the year end and the amount purchased was caused by exchange rate uctuations between US dollars and sterling.
The middle market price of an Ordinary share on 2 January 2003 the London Stock Exchange having been closed for trading on 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2003 was 17.5 pence and 58.25 pence, respectively, and during that period ranged between a high of 72.75 pence and a low of 10 pence.
Save as disclosed, there have been no changes between the year end and 25 February 2004 the date on which the Accounts have been signed in the directors beneficial or non-beneficial interests in the Ordinary share or loan capital of the Company or any subsidiary.
Shareholder Advisory Resolution in Respect of the Report on Directors Remuneration In accordance with the Regulations, an ordinary resolution to approve this Remuneration Report will be proposed at the forthcoming 2004 Annual General Meeting.
