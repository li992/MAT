growing input, profits and margins across most areas of its operations, and to ongoing improvement in the performance of our Clear Liquid Division.
While our Valves & Controls Divisions actions to restructure its global sales and marketing organisation and continued pursuit of Lean business practices delivered impressive operational improvements, the one-off costs to close an under-utilised French valve operation and the costs of turning around the UK business resulted in lower profits and margins when compared to 2002.
Engineering Services Division Our Services businesses realised a 23% increase in turnover at 188.9m against 153.4m achieved in 2002.
Operating profit of 20.6m was up 34.3% 2002: 15.3m and operating margin improved to 10.9% against 10.0% in 2002.

Our Joint Venture services business in Abu Dhabi maintained year on year turnover at 4.7m, while improving operational performance and delivering good gains in operating margins.
We anticipate a continued positive performance in 2004.
