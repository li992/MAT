Barclays PLC Annual Report 2003 25 Corporate Governance Barclays Report on Remuneration Non-executive Directors The Board determines the fees of non-executive Directors.
The Boards policy is that fees should reect individual responsibilities and membership of Board Committees.
Barclays encourages its non-executive Directors to build up a holding in the Companys shares.
20,000 of their basic Directors fee is used to buy shares in the Company for each non-executive Director.
These shares, together with reinvested dividends, are retained on behalf of the non-executive Directors until they retire from the Board.
They are included in the table of Directors interests in ordinary shares of Barclays PLC on page 34.
Non-executive Directors do not receive awards in share schemes for employees.
"For each non-executive Director, the effective date of their letter of appointment, notice period and the Groups liability in the event of early termination are shown in the table below: Group Effective liability in date of the event letter of Notice of early appointment period termination TDG Arculus 1st Feb 1997 6 months 6 months fees Sir Richard Broadbent 1st Sep 2003 """" HM Cropper 1st Jun 1998 """" Professor Dame Sandra Dawson 1st Mar 2003 """" Sir Brian Jenkins 25th Oct 2000 """" Sir Nigel Rudd 1st Feb 1996 """" SG Russell 25th Oct 2000 """" Dr Jrgen Zech 30th Jul 2002 """" Each appointment is for an initial six-year term, renewable for one term of three years thereafter."
Details of non-executive Directors standing for re-election at the 2004 AGM are set out on page 17.
The performance of each non-executive Director is reviewed annually by the Chairman, and at the end of the initial term.
Forward Looking Statement The Committee will keep the existing remuneration arrangements, as detailed in this Report, under review during 2004 and ensure that Barclays reward programmes remain competitive and provide appropriate incentive for performance.
As usual, there will be individual reviews of base salary, annual bonus including ESAS and ISOP awards.
As we informed shareholders in 2000, Barclays will review the ISOP after five years to consider whether it still meets the Groups business needs.

Awards under ESAS are granted in the form of provisional allocations over Barclays PLC ordinary shares, which do not give rise to any entitlement to these shares.
Normally, the trustees will permit the executive to call for the shares from the end of the third year from grant of an award by granting a right to acquire shares a nil cost option exercisable for two years.
As this nil cost option is part of the structure of an ESAS award described above, which is a deferred share award scheme, it would not be appropriate to attach a performance condition to the exercise of options.
If the right is not exercised, the trustees may at the end of the fifth year release all of the shares, including bonus shares equal to 30% of the basic award.
If the right is exercised, an executive may lose the opportunity of receiving one-third of the bonus shares.
The number of shares shown in the table includes the bonus shares.
b The trustees may release additional shares to participants which represent accumulated net dividends in respect of shares under award.
During 2003, the trustees released the following accumulated dividend shares 1,456 to Chris Lendrum and 14,121 to John Varley.
These are not awarded as part of the original award and consequently are not included in the Released column.
c The shares under option shown in this column are already included in the numbers shown at 1st January 2003 and relate to provisional allocations made in 1999 and 2000 except that the gures do not include accumulated dividend shares under option as follows: 4,779 shares for Matthew Barrett, 2,636 shares for Chris Lendrum and 4,426 shares for John Varley.
Under ESAS, a participant pays 1 to exercise an option, irrespective of the number of shares involved.
No options were either exercised or lapsed during the year.
d The awards in respect of 2003 were made in February 2004.
The shares awarded represent shares purchased by the trustees after 16th February 2004 at 4.91 in respect of a recommendation by the Company for an award, including a maximum potential 30% bonus shares, of 831,395 to Matthew Barrett and 184,092 to John Varley.
b For details of the performance targets which must be satisfied for options to become exercisable and the extent to which options will become exercisable see pages 24 and 25. c As there were no options exercised during the year, the table does not show the market price on the exercise date.
d The 2001 grant is due to vest on 12th March 2004.
The number of shares due to vest represents the number over which an option may be exercised after the third anniversary from grant, as determined by the Committee in respect of the performance conditions attached to the options originally set at the time of the grant of the option.
The shares under option that are not due to vest will lapse.
The result of the economic profit performance against the target has resulted in half the Target Award vesting.
The result of the relative TSR performance target against the comparator group of companies placed Barclays in 4th position for the 2001 to 2003 performance period with a vesting multiplier of one times the Target Award.

c John Stewart was previously awarded an option over Woolwich plc shares.
This option was rolled over into an option over Barclays PLC shares in accordance with the scheme of arrangement for the acquisition of Woolwich plc.

No further awards will be made under these schemes.
Under the ESOS, options granted at market value to executives were exercisable only if the growth in earnings per share of the Company over a three-year period was, at least, equal to the percentage increase in the UK Retail Prices Index plus 6%, over the same period.
The performance target for the 1999 ESOS grant was met.
Under the ESOP, options originally granted over Woolwich plc shares at market value were exercised in 2001 or exchanged, in accordance with the proposals made under the Offer to acquire the Woolwich, for options over Barclays PLC shares.
Under the rules of ESOP, the performance conditions attached to the exercise of options were disapplied on acquisition of Woolwich plc by Barclays.
