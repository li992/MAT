Directors Remuneration Report for the financial year ended 1 February 2003 The following is a report by the Remuneration Committee which has been approved by the Board for submission to shareholders.
Composition and Terms of Reference The Remuneration Committee consists of the independent Non-Executive Directors who are Andrew Beeson Chairman, Prue Leith OBE and Roger Jones.
Its composition and terms of reference are in line with the Combined Code.
The Company complies fully with Section B of the Combined Code provisions on Directors remuneration and in respect of the Remuneration Report content.
The Committees aim is to ensure that the Executive Directors are rewarded for their contribution to the Group and are motivated to enhance the return to shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible, on behalf of the Board, for setting the remuneration policy for Executive Directors.
In addition, they have regard to pay and conditions for other employees in the Group especially the arrangements for Directors of subsidiaries who are not Directors of the Company.
The Committee is advised internally by the Director of Group Human Resources Joan Howard and the Head of Group Reward Jonathan Davies.
External advice was provided during the year by Towers Perrin in relation to salary benchmarking and the overall levels of remuneration packages in comparative companies.
Towers Perrin was appointed by the Head of Group Reward on behalf of the Remuneration Committee and did not provide any other services to the Company or any other Group company or their individual Directors during the year.
In addition to data provided by Towers Perrin, the Committee also took into account information from other remuneration surveys.
Remuneration Policy The Committee continues to maintain a policy consistent with Group Reward Principles applied for all employees throughout the Group and in line with the Companys business objectives which: attracts, retains and motivates high calibre Directors: is appropriate to the Company, taking into account information from independent sources and from within the retail sector as well as other companies of a comparable size: aligns the interests of Directors and shareholders by linking share and cash incentives to performance: complies with best practice and comprises a mix of xed and variable pay with longer-term incentives.
When comparing remuneration packages with those in other companies, particular regard is taken of companies in the FTSE 250 and other retailers.
The reward principles applied throughout the Group provide for basic salaries to be set at the median for a range of comparative companies with reward for performance aimed at delivering an overall package that is competitive.
For the two Executive Directors the variable, performance related remuneration share options and Woolworths Group Incentive Plan represents 40 per cent of the total package for on target performance.
Components of Remuneration Basic Salary Basic salary for each Director is reviewed annually in the context of market conditions affecting executive remuneration, affordability and the level of increases awarded to staff throughout the Group.
Basic salary levels are generally set at not more than the median for a range of comparative companies.
Benets In addition to salaries and the items described below, the Company provides a range of competitive benets including pension, a fully-expensed car or non-pensionable cash allowance and private medical insurance.
Service Contract The policy of the Committee is that notice periods should be set at not more than 12 months.
No Executive Director has a service contract with a notice period longer than 12 months.
Bonus For Executive Directors and directors of subsidiaries, the Woolworths Group Incentive Plan WIP applies see page 21.
Gerald Corbett, the Chairman, is not entitled to participate in the WIP.
Share Options Executive Share Option Schemes The Company operates the Woolworths Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme the Executive Scheme and the Woolworths Group plc 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme the 2002 Executive Scheme for Executive Directors and senior managers.
The rules of the Executive Scheme mirror those operating under the equivalent Kingsher Scheme prior to demerger.
The Company introduced, following shareholder approval, the 2002 Executive Scheme in August 2002.
Options were granted in April 2002 and July 2002 under the Executive Scheme.
Options were granted under the 2002 Executive Scheme in September 2002.
Half-yearly grants were generally set at 35 per cent of salary for Senior Executives, 42.5 per cent of salary for Directors of subsidiary companies and at 50 per cent of salary for the two Executive Directors of the Company.
The Chief Executive was granted an option in April 2002 at three times salary as part of the arrangements made when he joined the Company.
These share options are considered an important factor in providing long-term incentives to senior employees in the Group.
20 Woolworths Group plc Directors Remuneration Report continued for the financial year ended 1 February 2003 Share Options Executive Share Option Schemes continued For options granted in September 2001 under the rules of the Executive Scheme, a performance target of growth in fully diluted adjusted earnings per share EPS as shown in the profit and loss account of six per cent plus RPI over any three-year period up to the tenth anniversary of the date of grant was set.
The options can only be exercised, between the third and tenth anniversaries of grant if this target is met.
This target was set in the Kingsher Executive Share Option Scheme and adopted by the Company at demerger.
Participants who leave employment due to ill health, redundancy or retirement retain their options and the performance target does not have to be met.
This target applies to an option granted to Christopher Rogers see page 23.
For options granted from April 2002 onwards under the Executive Scheme and the 2002 Executive Scheme, new performance targets agreed at the 2002 Annual General Meeting apply.
Under these grants EPS must increase by six per cent per annum commencing with the Companys financial year immediately prior to the date of grant plus RPI over a three-year period in order for the option to be exercised in full.
If this is not achieved, growth in EPS of five per cent per annum plus RPI over the same period is required in order for up to 50 per cent of the option to be exercised.
If either of these targets is not met after the first three-year period there will be a retest one year later over a four-year period, from the same base, and the same proportion of the option will be available for exercise.
If neither of the targets has been achieved after four years the option will lapse.
In the event of a change of control of the Company the performance conditions will not be automatically waived.
A minimum target of an increase in EPS of two per cent per annum plus RPI will normally have to be met.
The option will normally be exercisable only in proportion to the number of months that have elapsed from grant to the date of early exercise against a total of 36 months.
Options are used to align the interests of Directors and Senior Executives with those of shareholders and to enable them to share in the success of the Group.
The granting of options on a regular basis ensures any reward is spread over a number of years, is allied to the growth in share value over the long-term, and avoids substantial fortuitous one-off gains.
A one-off grant of options was made to a further 319 employees in the Group in September 2002.
Each of these employees was granted an option over 10,000 shares under terms identical to the 2002 Executive Scheme.
All options are approved for tax purposes and shares were bought to cover these options in the market and are held in the Woolworths Group Employee Share Ownership Trust.
The Committee intends to continue to make option grants every six months and to apply the same performance targets to options granted in 2003 as applied to options granted in 2002.
This means that EPS must increase by six per cent per annum plus RPI for the option to be fully exercisable after three years with 50 per cent of the option becoming exercisable if the increase in EPS is five per cent per annum plus RPI.
There will, again, be only one retest after four years on the same basis as described above.
The Committee believes that using EPS as the performance measure is consistent with the Companys strategy to grow profits at this stage in its development.
The targets of six per cent and five per cent are considered challenging and EPS is a measure used by the majority of companies of similar size and provides a simple calculation which is clear to all interested parties.
The targets apply to options granted in April 2002 and September 2002 to Trevor Bish-Jones and Christopher Rogers see page 23.
A limit of five per cent of the total issued share capital on the number of new shares that can be issued to satisfy options granted under the Executive Schemes applies over a ten-year period.
SavingsRelated Share Options A savings-related share option scheme ShareSave is open to all eligible employees in the UK.
The second grant of options under ShareSave was made in May 2002 and it is intended that options will be granted annually under this arrangement provided the scheme continues to provide a cost effective method of enabling employees to share in the success of the Group.
The Committee is aware of the proposed changes to the accounting treatment of employee share options and will review the operation of the Executive Schemes and ShareSave when the new accounting standards are nalised.
Incentives and bonuses Woolworths Group Incentive Plan The Woolworths Group Incentive Plan WIP provides an integrated approach to variable pay through combining annual bonuses with long-term incentives.
Participation is for Directors and Senior Executives, who will then not be eligible to participate in any other annual bonus plan for the same period as that in which they participate in the WIP.
For the year ended 1 February 2003 the award for Executive Directors of the Company was based on Group profit, whereas for Directors of subsidiaries the award was based on both Group and subsidiary company financial performance.
Awards for on target performance achievement of budgeted profits are 25 per cent of basic salary.
If the relevant profit target is not met, no award will be made for that portion of the award.
If profits exceed the relevant targets then a greater percentage of bonus will be paid up to a ceiling of 100 per cent of basic salary.
Penalties apply if stock and cash targets are not met.
For the year ended 1 February 2003 the majority of participants were entitled to declared bonuses of between 10 per cent and 21.5 per cent of basic salary.
The declared bonus may be deferred for three years, at the completion of which it is matched by up to 25 per cent in shares which are purchased in the market at the time of electing to defer.
The individual can request at any time to take part or all of the annual bonus immediately, but then forfeits the matching shares in proportion to the amount of bonus paid early.
As the matching share element is relatively small no further performance conditions are considered appropriate.
If the individual leaves employment with the Group for any reason during the three year deferment the matched shares will be forfeited.
The Company intends to make some amendments to the targets for the WIP for the year ending 31 January 2004.
The declared bonus will still be calculated by reference to profit targets for the Group and subsidiary companies with the initial bonus level being 25 per cent of basic salary.
Penalties will also apply if stock and cash targets are not met.
In line with best practice guidelines, and consistent with the Woolworths Group Reward Principles, personal performance will also be used to determine part of the bonus.
Matching share awards at 25 per cent of the declared bonus will continue to be available, subject to a three-year deferral.
