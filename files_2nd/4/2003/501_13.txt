The Directors also confirm that the Company intends to comply with the revised Code published in July 2003 with effect from 1 January 2004.
Details of each individual Directors remuneration for 2003 are set out on page 37.
Information on Directors share and share option interests may be found on pages 39 and 40.
Remuneration Committee the Committee : Composition, Responsibilities and Operation The names of the members of the Committee who served during the year ended 31 December 2003 are as follows: Mr N H Northridge Chairman Mr A C Salvesen Mr R V McGlone appointed 22 January 2003 Mr P G Rogerson stood down from the Committee on 22 January 2003 Mr P G Rogerson previously chaired the Committee: on standing down he was replaced as Chairman by Mr N H Northridge.
The Committee is entirely composed of independent Non-executive Directors, except Mr P G Rogerson who was a member between 1 January 2003 and 22 January 2003.
They have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day operational responsibility within the Group.
The Committees principal function is to determine the policy on remuneration for the most senior executives and to approve the specific remuneration of the Executive Directors and the Secretary, including their service contracts.
After 31 December 2003 the Committee will also take responsibility for making a recommendation to the Board in respect of the remuneration of the Chairman.
The Committees remit therefore includes, but is not restricted to, basic salary, benefits in kind, performance related awards, share options and share awards, long-term incentive schemes, pension rights and any compensation or termination payments.
In exercising its responsibilities the Committee has access to professional advice, both inside and outside the Company, and consults with the Chairman and Chief Executive.
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
The Committee has appointed Towers Perrin to provide remuneration consultancy with respect to basic salary, bonus plans and executive long-term incentive plans.
There are a number of external advisors appointed by the Company who advise on remuneration matters for the wider workforce and also provide advice to the Committee from time to time.
Principal advisors in the year were: New Bridge Street Consultants provides advice on the existing Savings-related and Executive share option schemes and on the implementation of share plans.
Mercer Human Resource Consulting provides advice on retirement benefits in the UK and overseas and administers the UK defined benefit pension scheme.
Watson Wyatt LLP provides advice on retirement benefits in the UK.
Proposed Long-term Incentive Arrangements Executives in the Company currently participate in an executive share option scheme as well as the Sharesave arrangement.
The Remuneration Committee has become concerned that the current option arrangements are no longer as efficient as other forms of long-term incentive.
The Company is therefore seeking shareholder approval at the 2004 Annual General Meeting for the introduction of a Performance Share Plan and a Co-investment Plan which would cover about 100 executives in the business worldwide and operate as follows: 32 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Performance Share Plan Under this plan, executives will be granted a conditional award of shares, some, all or none of which will vest three years later, depending upon the Companys performance over the deferral period.
The measurement of performance will commence in the year in which the award is made and awards will be subject to the executive remaining in service at the end of the period.
Two performance measures are proposed: 75% of plan awards will be measured against Earnings Per Share EPS and 25% against Return on Capital Employed ROCE.
The first proposed performance measure is real i. e. excluding inflation compound growth in aggregate EPS over a three-year period.
The definition of EPS will be the fully diluted EPS published in the Annual Report, although it is intended that the Committee will have the discretion to make adjustments to ensure the measure is consistent from year to year and represents a fair measure.
The Committee has selected this measure because it believes that it is well aligned with shareholder interests as well as being readily understood by executives.
Having considered the businesss future plans and prospects, the Committee believes that an appropriate range for real compound annual growth in EPS over the next few years is 3%-8%.
There would be no award for aggregate EPS growth of 3% per annum or less.
The maximum award would be made if aggregate EPS is equivalent to real compound annual growth of 8% or more.
For performance between these levels, awards would be made on a straight line, pro-rata, basis.
The second proposed performance measure is average ROCE over a three-year period.
The Committee has selected this measure because it believes that an adequate level of ROCE is essential for the maintenance of Shareholder value and this measure is already in use throughout the business.
The Committee will review the appropriate ROCE performance range for each annual grant of awards to be made under the plan, taking account of the businesss future plans and prospects.
Having considered these factors in respect of awards to be made in 2004, the Committee believes that an appropriate range for the three-year performance period 2004-2006 is 13.7%-15.7% per annum.
There would be no award for average ROCE of 13.7% or less.
The maximum award would be made if average ROCE is 15.7% or more.
The Committees intention is that the maximum award would be for shares with a value equal to one years salary at date of grant and that, in practice, only Executive Directors would receive awards at this level.
Whilst the rules of the plan permit a maximum award of shares up to a value equal to two years salary, the Committees intention is that in most circumstances the maximum award would be a value equal to one years salary, and that, in practice, the number of people receiving awards at this level would be very restricted.
Co-investment Plan Under this plan executives will be allowed to invest up to a maximum of 20% of their base salary in Aggreko shares.
The offer will be made to them each year shortly after bonuses are declared.
This means that executives can use their net bonus to acquire shares at market price, but there is no direct link to the bonus paid.
Provided that the executive continues to hold these shares for three years the Company will make a matching award.
There will be an automatic match of three shares for every four the executive holds i. e. a 75% match.
Higher levels of matching award will be dependent upon performance up to a maximum total matching award of six shares for every four the executive holds, i. e. a 150% match, if the maximum level of performance is achieved.
The performance measures and performance targets proposed under this Co-investment Plan are exactly the same measures as those which will apply under the Performance Share Plan, i. e. real compound growth in aggregate EPS in a range from 3% to 8% per annum on a straight line, pro-rata, basis and average ROCE of between 13.7% and 15.7% per annum.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 33 Remuneration Report continued Remuneration Policy The Committee has adopted the following policy for the remuneration of Executive Directors throughout 2003.
It is intended that this policy will apply in 2004 and future years.
Annual Salaries Salaries are determined by a combination of the individuals contribution to the business and the market rate for the job.
The Company typically pays the market median, for standard performance in the job, and pays up to the market upper quartile for upper quartile performance.
On occasions it may be necessary to pay above the market median to attract people of the right calibre to meet the needs of the business.
The appropriate market rate is the rate in the market place from which the individual is most likely to be recruited.
The Company operates in a number of market places throughout the world where remuneration practice and levels differ.
This can result in pay and benefit differentials between the Executive Directors.
In arriving at an appropriate market rate, reference is made to a number of well-established salary surveys covering similar jobs of the same size in a large sample of over 400 companies in the manufacturing and service sectors in the UK.
The same consistent approach is taken for expatriate and overseas salaries where reference is made to the appropriate surveys for the geographical location.
The Companys pay systems are designed to allow progression that reflects an individuals contribution to the business and to control overall cost.
Pay and benefit structures are designed to be cost effective to achieve the right level of attraction and retention at the best value.
The Company is always mindful of the need for good corporate governance in respect of pay and benefits for all its employees including Directors.
Performance related elements of Remuneration A significant proportion of Executive Directors remuneration is performance related through annual bonus and share options as further explained below.
Annual Cash Bonuses The Company pays competitive bonuses that can place the total cash earnings near the upper quartile for the market place in high performance years.
The factors to be measured for bonus purposes and the corresponding levels of bonus are pre-determined at the start of the performance period.
Bonuses are paid as close to the end of the performance period as practicable so that they reflect current performance.
All Executive Directors participate in a scheme which allows them to earn bonuses on a graduated scale if a targeted level of Earnings per Share is exceeded.
In addition, during 2003, up to 25% of the overall bonus is related to the achievement of personal goals.
The performance criteria are designed to enhance shareholder value and the Committee approves all financial targets and personal goals: no bonus will be paid if targets and goals are not achieved.
A maximum bonus of 50% of basic salary is available to all Executive Directors, except in North America where there is a maximum bonus of 75% of basic salary.
The Group Chief Executive will also have a maximum bonus of 75% of basic salary in 2004.
The Committee does, however, also have discretion to reward outstanding individual achievement.
Share Option Schemes The Company believes that employee share schemes generally encourage the matching of interests between employees and shareholders.
The Aggreko Savings-related Share Option Scheme Sharesave is normally offered annually to all employees who have at least six months service.
Senior executives are currently able to participate in an Executive Share Option Scheme at the discretion of the Committee.
Subject to shareholder approval, it is the Committees intention that, with effect from 2004, executives should participate in alternative long-term incentive arrangements, as explained above under Proposed Long-term Incentive Arrangements.
If the proposed long-term incentives are implemented, it is anticipated that further grants under the existing Executive Share Option Schemes will only be made in exceptional circumstances where the new proposed plan is not appropriate.
Annual grants of Executive Share Options have been made in 2001 and 2002, with new participants not normally receiving options until they have been employed for at least twelve months.
No annual grant of Executive Share Options was made in 2003 and only a limited number of new participants received options.
34 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 The allocation of Executive Share Options has been based on multiples of remuneration dependent upon the 1 seniority and job size of the individuals appointment, with the maximum multiple of 1 3 times remuneration in any one year being available to Executive Directors.
UK participants in the Executive Share Option Scheme receive part of their entitlement under a scheme that has received approval under the Taxes Act conferring certain tax relief on participants.
The Treasury limit for outstanding options under the approved scheme is currently 30,000 for each participant, with the balance of the participants entitlement being held under an unapproved scheme.
All executive options that have been granted are subject to performance conditions based on both total shareholder return TSR and growth in Earnings Per Share EPS.
TSR is calculated by reference to the increase in the Companys share price plus dividends paid.
EPS is Basic Earnings Per Share as disclosed in the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account.
At the time when the individual wishes to exercise the option which can only normally occur after three years have elapsed since grant, the growth in the Companys TSR is compared to that of the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding investment trusts over a specified period.
If the Companys TSR matches or exceeds that index, and the Companys EPS growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 3 per cent per annum, over three consecutive years, the option is capable of exercise.
Retesting of performance conditions is limited to six monthly intervals between 3 and 5 years after the date of grant.
The Committee has adopted a policy that encourages Executive Directors to use options and share incentive plans to acquire and retain a material number of shares in the Company with the objective of further aligning their long-term interests with those of other shareholders.
Phantom Share Option Scheme for Mr F A B Shepherd Mr Shepherd was eligible for an award under the Phantom Option Scheme on 25 September 2002.
This award was approved by the Committee in order to continue to incentivise Mr Shepherd at a time when he was no longer eligible to participate in Aggrekos Approved and Non-Approved Executive Share Option Schemes.
The award is granted over a notional number of shares.
On exercise of the award, Mr Shepherd will receive a cash sum subject to tax equal to the amount by which the market value of these shares at exercise exceeds their market value on grant 128 pence per share.
The aggregate market value of the shares to which Mr Shepherds award notionally relates at the date of grant was 280,000.
The intention was that, where possible, the terms and conditions described under Share Option Schemes should also apply to Mr Shepherds award under the Phantom Option Scheme.
Other Benefits Other benefits, including pensions, are based on current market practice and take into account long-term trends in provision.
Further details on pension provision are set out on pages 38 and 39.
Service Contracts and Notice Periods All of the Executive Directors have service agreements that require one years notice from the individual and one years notice from the Company.
Mr F A B Shepherd has a service contract that expires at a normal retirement age of 65 while other directors have a normal retirement age of 60.
On early termination, Executive Directors are entitled to Basic Salary and benefits for the notice period at the rate current at the date of termination.
External Appointments The Company has allowed Mr R C Soames to continue to serve as a Non-executive Director of Baggeridge Brick PLC.
He is also permitted to retain his earnings from that position and these earnings amounted to 10,000 for the period ended 31 December 2003.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 35 Remuneration Report continued Remuneration of Chairman and Non-executive Directors Remuneration policy and levels for the Non-executive Directors are determined by the Board, within the limits set out in the Articles of Association.
From 1 January 2004, remuneration policy and levels for the Chairman will be recommended to the Board by the Remuneration Committee.
Remuneration comprises an annual fee for acting as a Chairman or Non-executive Director of the Company.
When setting these fees, reference is made to information provided by a number of remuneration surveys, the extent of the duties performed and the size of the Company.
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors are not eligible for bonuses, retirement benefits or to participate in any share scheme operated by the Company.

The other points plotted are the values at the intervening financial year-ends.
The FTSE Mid 250 was selected as a comparator as this index is used as one of the performance measures for the Executive Share Option Schemes.
A general index is considered more appropriate than sector and peer group comparators given the unique nature of the Companys business.
