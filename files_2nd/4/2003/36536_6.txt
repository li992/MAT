Remuneration Report The directors submit their report on remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2003.
"This report has been approved and adopted by the Board and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of s234B of the Companies Act 1985 as amended by The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 ""the Regulations"" together ""the Act"" and the Listing Rules."
The information contained in paragraphs 3, 5 and 6 below is subject to audit in accordance with the Regulations.
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE THE COMMITTEE The Board has appointed a Remuneration Committee which meets no less than twice a year, to consider, for recommendation to the Board, company policy on the remuneration of executive directors and to approve the composition and level of remuneration of executive directors and certain senior executives.
The Board has accepted, without amendment, the Committees recommendations relating to remuneration policy.
The Committee currently comprises R J O Barton Chairman, J C Clare and G F Pimlott.
REMUNERATION POLICY In determining an appropriate remuneration policy for recommendation to the Board, the Committees objective is to ensure that the Company continues to be able to attract, retain and motivate experienced individuals, capable of making a major contribution to Hammersons success.
Remuneration for executive directors and senior executives takes account of performance through an annual performance related bonus scheme and, for long term performance, by the award of shares under the Deferred Share Plan.
To assist the Committee in determining remuneration policy, the Committee has received advice from Hay Group who have been appointed by the Committee and who provide no other services to the Company.
In addition, although they are not members of the Committee, information and advice has been provided and recommendations have been made by R R Spinney, R J G Richards other than in respect of his own position and by the groups director of Human Resources, E A Houlihan.
In implementing the policy, following its approval by the Board, the Committee takes into account remuneration packages available within other comparable companies, the Companys overall performance, achievement of corporate objectives, individual performance and published views of investors and their representatives.
REMUNERATION OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND SENIOR EXECUTIVES The remuneration packages for senior staff, including executive directors, consist of the following elements and are structured to relate reward to corporate and individual performance.
Details of all payments to executive directors, which are disclosed in paragraph 5 on pages 16 and 17 show the relative values of basic and performance related elements of remuneration.
i Basic Salary and Benefits Basic salaries for executive directors and other senior executives are reviewed by the Committee, normally annually or otherwise on promotion, having regard to responsibility, competitive market practice, company and individual performance and independently compiled salary survey information.
Benefits include the use of a company car or the provision of a car allowance, medical insurance and life assurance cover.
Details of directors emoluments are given in paragraph 5 on pages 16 and 17. ii Annual Performance Related Bonus Scheme Full time staff throughout the Company, including executive directors, participate in a performance related bonus scheme.
Payments under the scheme are based on the achievement of profit, net asset value and operational targets, which are set such that they are both relevant to the specific circumstances of the Company and designed to enhance performance.
Such payments, which are not pensionable, are agreed by the Remuneration Committee and take account of individual performance, seniority and responsibilities.
The amount payable to executive directors in any one year could be up to 85% of their basic salary, with part of the payment receivable in shares in the Company.
iii Pensions The UK resident executive directors are members of the Companys non-contributory pension scheme, details of which are set out in note 5 on pages 28 to 30.. 13 Remuneration Report 3.
"REMUNERATION OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND SENIOR EXECUTIVES continued iv Deferred Share Plan Executive directors and selected senior executives may be awarded shares under the Hammerson plc Deferred Share Plan ""the Plan""."
The Plan was established to align the rewards received by participants to the Companys financial performance and provide them with the opportunity to build a holding of shares in the Company.
The Committee approves awards under the Plan by way of nil cost options.
The performance period commences on the first dealing day of the year in which options are granted and the earliest date on which such shares can vest is on completion of the results for the year ending three consecutive years after that date.
Under the terms of the Plan, the actual number of shares to be awarded to participants has been determined by reference to the average annual return on equity achieved over a three year performance period on a straightline basis between 7.5% and 20%.
Since establishment in 2000, it has become clear that these returns are not realistic targets.
After a thorough debate on a more appropriate and permanent target and after consulting with external consultants the Hay Group, the Remuneration Committee proposes to move the target to one based on total shareholder return, in line with those recommended by the Association of British Insurers.
Accordingly, it is now proposed that the performance target should be based on the comparative performance of the Company against a peer group of the eight largest quoted UK property companies, including Hammerson.
There will be no vesting of shares unless the Companys performance is in the top half of the comparator group and there will be a progressive vesting schedule according to the Companys ranking within the top half of the comparator group.
Two shareholders resolutions will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The first will give the Remuneration Committee the flexibility to alter the scheme so that performance targets other than the current annual return on equity may be adopted, and therefore allow for the proposed total shareholder return test to be adopted.
The second resolution will authorise the Remuneration Committee to alter the performance target in the awards made on 26 September 2003 from the current annual return on equity test to the new total shareholder return test.
It is expected that most executives granted awards in September 2003 will agree to the substitution of the new total shareholder return performance target.
It is not intended to change the annual value of awards under the LTIP, which are set to a maximum of 100% of salary.
The Plan is administered by a Trustee which has acquired 700,000 shares, financed by drawing down 3,191,381 of interest free loan facilities of 3,300,000 from the Company, to satisfy the issue of shares to participants.
During the year, 57,586 shares were transferred to participants and the Trustee now holds 642,414 shares.
Under the terms of the Trust, the Trustee is obliged to waive dividends on this holding of shares, except for a nominal amount.
The first grant under the Plan was made on 15 June 2000 and at 31 December 2003 the maximum number of shares which could be awarded to executive directors under all grants made under the Plan to date was as follows: Maximum number of shares Date of grant 16 March 2001 3 April 2002 26 September 2003 - R J G Richards 57,604 55,618 55,822 J A Bywater 33,996 32,818 33,288 P W B Cole 33,996 32,818 33,288 G Devaux 37,773 36,272 36,702 S R Melliss 42,495 42,318 42,677 - The average annual return on equity achieved during the three year performance period relating to the grant made on 16 March 2001 was 7.3%, resulting in no shares vesting.
Accordingly the options granted on 16 March 2001 have lapsed.
Following the introduction of the Plan, participants are no longer eligible for grants of options under the Companys share option schemes which are described below.. 14 Remuneration Report 3.
REMUNERATION OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND SENIOR EXECUTIVES continued v Share Options continued Employees, including executive directors prior to the introduction of the Deferred Share Plan, have been granted share options under the Hammerson plc 1995 Approved and Unapproved Share Option Schemes.
No payment is made by participants in consideration for the grant of options.
The Unapproved Scheme was established to allow the grant of options where the cumulative value of subsisting options as at the date of their grant is in excess of 30,000.
The Committee approves grants, which are phased, of share options under the schemes.
Both schemes are subject to performance targets and restrictions which the Board considers to be a realistic test of management performance and which are designed with a view to securing the long term growth of the Company.
Options can be exercised only if the rate of increase in the Companys earnings per share over any three year period is at least 6% in excess of the rate of increase in the Retail Price Index during that period.
This is considered a realistic test of management performance and was devised with a view to securing the long term growth of the Company.
No variations have been made to the rules of the Scheme since it was implemented.
REMUNERATION OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND SENIOR EXECUTIVES continued v Share Options continued The directors interests in options over ordinary shares of the Company under the Companys savings related share option scheme are as follows: 1 January 31 December Exercise Expiry 2003 Granted Exercised Lapsed 2003 price year R J G Richards 5,360 5,360 342.8p 2006 J A Bywater 3,250 3,250 298.0p 2003 P W B Cole 4,922 4,922 342.8p 2004 S R Melliss 4,079 4,079 422.8p 2003 The middle market quotation of the Companys ordinary shares, as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List, was 647.25p on 31 December 2003 and the range during the year was 416.5p to 664p.
SERVICE AGREEMENTS R J G Richards, J A Bywater, P W B Cole and S R Melliss have service agreements which may be terminated by the Company on 12 months notice.
These agreements were entered into on 28 February 2002.
If a contract is terminated at short notice, any resulting compensation would not be subject to mitigation.
G Devauxs appointment is governed by a deed of appointment under which there is a notice period of four weeks.
He is based in Paris and, in accordance with French employment legislation, has a service agreement as an employee and director with a French subsidiary of the Company with a notice period of three months, but under which any payment made in the event of termination at short notice is subject to a minimum of 12 months and a maximum of 21 months.
The Chairman and the non-executive directors do not have service contracts with the Company.
Their appointments are governed by letters of appointment which are available for inspection on request.
The Chairmans appointment, which is subject to 12 months notice, was initially for the period ending 30 September 2003, but following review by the executive directors and the non-executive directors has been extended to 30 September 2005.
The appointments of the non-executive directors are reviewed by the Chairman and the executive directors every three years and, accordingly, will next be reviewed as follows: G F Pimlott 31 December 2005 D A Edmonds 7 May 2006 J R Hirst 28 February 2007 J Nelson 30 April 2007 R J O Barton 30 June 2007 J C Clare 31 December 2007 The appointments of each of R J O Barton and J C Clare have been so reviewed, notwithstanding that their term has not yet elapsed, and their appointments extended for a further three years on expiry of the current term.
Notwithstanding the intention that the appointments of non-executive directors are for the terms of three years, such appointments are at all times subject to the right for either party to terminate the appointment on not less than three months notice.
G F Pimlott, having been a director for more than ten years, retires at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and offers himself for re-election.
D A Edmonds, J R Hirst and J Nelson, having been appointed since the previous Annual General Meeting, also offer themselves for re-election.
REMUNERATION OF DIRECTORS The Chairman of the Board, R R Spinney, is a non-executive director and his fee, and those of the other non-executive directors, are determined by the Board, having regard to the contribution required from and the responsibility taken by nonexecutive directors and current market practice including the level of fees paid to non-executive directors of comparable companies.
Non-executive directors receive a basic fee plus an additional sum in respect of committee membership.
To reflect their additional responsibilities, further fees are payable to non-executive directors who chair committees and to the Deputy Chairman.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for performance related bonuses or grants of options and their fees are not pensionable.
G F Pimlotts fees are payable to a company of which he is a director.. 16 Remuneration Report 5.

The value of benefits in kind includes the use of a company car or provision of a car allowance, medical insurance and life assurance cover as referred to in paragraph 3 i on page 13.
During the year ended 31 December 2003 no payments were made to directors for expenses other than those incurred wholly and directly in the course of their employment or appointment.
PENSIONS The UK resident executive directors all participate in the Companys pension scheme, more fully described in note 5 to the financial statements on pages 28 to 30, which provides pension and other benefits.
Pension entitlements, which are based on basic salary, are subject to restrictions imposed by the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
R J G Richards and P W B Cole commenced pensionable service with the Company prior to the introduction of these restrictions and are not, therefore, subject to them.
In the case of J A Bywater and S R Melliss, pension arrangements to contractual retirement age of 60 are provided under the scheme.
In addition, in the case of J A Bywater, provision is made by way of an unfunded commitment to ensure a pension of 1 30th of final salary for each year of pensionable service and in the case of S R Melliss, provision in respect of pensionable salary above the restriction is paid to a money purchase arrangement.
G Devaux also participates in the unfunded pension scheme to obtain the same overall level of pension provision as other executive directors.
No pension arrangements are made by the Company for nonexecutive directors.
The following tables set out information on directors defined benefit pension entitlements, including funded and unfunded arrangements: Increase in accrued Total Increase in benefit accrued accrued during the Years benefit at benefit year, Age at service at 31 December during the excluding 31 December 31 December 2003 year inflation 2003 2003 000 000 000 R J G Richards 47 22 143 8 5 J A Bywater 56 6 37 7 6 P W B Cole 44 14 64 6 4 G Devaux 55 17 66 8 6 S R Melliss 51 12 39 4 3.
PENSIONS continued For each director, the total accrued benefit at 31 December 2003 represents the annual pension that is expected to be payable on eventual retirement, given the length of service and salary of each director at 31 December 2003.
The increase in accrued benefit earned during the year represents the increase in this expected pension, including the effect of inflation, when compared with the position at 31 December 2002.
The increase in accrued pension excluding the effect of inflation over the year is also shown.
