36  Report In accordance with The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations, shareholder approval of this directors remuneration report will be sought at the forthcoming annual general meeting.
The report has been approved by the board.
The remuneration committee, which met on three occasions during the year, determines the remuneration, benets and terms and conditions of service of the executive directors and makes recommendations to the board with regard to the companys policy on executive directors remuneration.
It also considers the remuneration of certain senior managers.
The membership of the committee consists of Mike Smith chairman, Jeff Edington, Peter Hooley and Marcus Beresford appointed 1 March 2004, each of whom is an independent non-executive director.
The relationship between the board and the committee is governed by formal terms of reference.
Under these terms, the committee is authorised, among other things, to obtain external legal or other professional advice at the companys expense as required.
Remuneration policy The companys policy is to recruit, motivate and retain executive directors of high calibre by rewarding them with competitive salary and benefit packages, increasingly linked to measured performance.
More specically, the current strategy is to position base salaries at the median of the market and to provide an opportunity to earn a total cash payment i. e. base salary and annual incentive at the upper quartile for high performance.
Remuneration is also linked to performance through participation in share incentive schemes which ensures that directors interests are closely aligned with shareholders interests.
In considering remuneration matters, the committee has received advice from New Bridge Street Consultants and reports from Inbucon.
New Bridge Street Consultants were appointed by the committee.
None of the foregoing provided other services to the company during the year.
The committee also consulted with Gordon Page and Allan Cook and they attended one or more of the committees meetings on matters which did not directly affect them.
No director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.
The board, through the committee, will continue to consult with principal shareholders when it is considering structural changes to its policy on executive directors remuneration.
The main elements of directors remuneration are described in the paragraphs that follow.
Remuneration information and details of directors interests in Cobham ordinary shares are set out in tables 1 to 5 on pages 40 to 44.
Basic salary Basic salaries are reviewed annually, usually in November, to take effect from 1 January of the following year.
The committee takes into account internal and external advice and data from a range of companies, such as the total reward survey produced annually by New Bridge Street Consultants, as well as personal performance and business responsibilities.
Annual performance-related bonus The company operates an annual cash bonus scheme for its executive directors.
Bonuses are awarded by the committee having regard to the performance of the group, the individual and, in the case of executive directors with specic subsidiary company responsibilities, the performance of the relevant subsidiaries.
Bonuses in respect of the year under review were capped at 60% of basic salary except for Gordon Page whose bonus was capped at 100% of basic salary in view of his ineligibility, as a result of proximity to retirement, to receive an award during the year under the Cobham Long Term Incentive Plan.
Gordon Page will not be eligible for a bonus in respect of 2004 as he is now a non-executive director.
Giles Irwins bonus was pro-rated for the period to his retirement from the board.
The policy in respect of the payment of bonuses for 2004 is the same as for 2003.
In the cases of Gordon Page, Allan Cook and Warren Tucker the constituent elements of their bonus plans are earnings per share in excess of ination, cash generation against budget and proven achievement of personal objectives for each individual.
Up to 75% of the maximum achievable bonus is determined by the companys financial performance with the balance being attributable to the achievement of personal objectives.
In the cases of Geoff Cooper, Andy Stevens and Alex Hannam the constituent elements of their bonus plans are earnings per share in excess of ination as for other directors, net profit against budget for the group of subsidiary companies for which they are operationally responsible, cash generation against budget and proven achievement of personal objectives for each individual.
Up to 75% of the maximum achievable bonus is determined by the financial performances of the company or the relevant subsidiary groups, as appropriate, with the balance being attributable to the achievement of personal objectives.
Personal objectives for the other executive directors are set by Gordon Page and Allan Cook and agreed with the committee.
Those for Allan Cook are set by Gordon Page and agreed with the committee.
COBHAM PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 37 Performance graph The graph set out below is required by the Regulations and illustrates the performance of the company and a broad equity market index over the five year period commencing on 31 December 1998.
The FTSE 350 Index, of which the company has been a constituent throughout the period in question, is considered the most appropriate form of broad equity market index against which the companys performance should be measured having regard to the size of company included and the fact that it includes most of the companies which form the comparator group for the purposes of the Cobham Long Term Incentive Plan.
Performance is measured by Total Shareholder Return share price growth plus dividends paid.
Total shareholder return Source: Datastream This graph looks at the value, by the end of 2003, of 100 invested in Cobham plc on 31 December 1998 compared with that of 100 invested in the FTSE 350 Index.
The other points plotted are the values at the intervening financial year ends.
Pensions Executive directors may join the Cobham Executives Pension Plan the Plan at the invitation of the company.
The Plan is established under trust, contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme and approved by the Inland Revenue under the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
All the executive directors, with the exception of Geoff Cooper, who has a personal money-purchase pension scheme, are members of the Plan.
The Plan provides benets for executive directors on final pay principles against a normal pension age of 60 with retirement before that age being subject to actuarial reduction.
Pensionable earnings are taken as the members basic annual salary at each April, restricted where applicable to the earnings cap.
The rate at which members are required to contribute to the Plan is 7% of pensionable earnings.
Annual bonus payments are not taken into account when calculating pensionable earnings.
Retirement pension accrues at 1 30th of pensionable earnings for each year of service in the Plan with, where applicable, a further 1 60th of pensionable earnings for each year of pensionable service within the main Cobham pension plan.
At retirement, members may commute a portion of their pension for a cash sum.
All pensions in payment relating to post April 1997 rights are increased in line with the retail price index, subject to a minimum of 3% per annum and a maximum of 5% per annum, with the balance of pension being increased at 3% per annum.
On death in service, a lump sum of four times pensionable earnings is payable together with a spouses pension of two thirds of the members prospective pension.
On death after retirement, a spouses pension is paid at the same rate as applied to the members pre commutation pension.
Similar spouses pensions are payable on the death of a deferred pensioner prior to retirement.
38  Report continued Pensions continued The company establishes funded, unapproved retirement benefit schemes by which additional retirement provision is made on money purchase principles for each member whose entitlement under the Plan is restricted by the earnings cap.
Payments are made to these schemes on the basis of actuarial advice.
Currently, schemes have been established for Gordon Page, Allan Cook and Alex Hannam.
A scheme is also being established for Andy Stevens.
Details of company contributions made in the year are set out in table 2 b on page 42.
The policy in respect of newly appointed directors is that contributions should normally be 2% of annual basic salary per month.
Long Term Incentive Plan The Cobham Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP was operated again during the year under review.
Under the LTIP which has been approved by shareholders Cobham ordinary shares may be conditionally awarded to participants.
However, they will normally only be entitled to these shares in full at the end of a three-year period known as the restricted period if, and to the extent that, certain company performance conditions are achieved.
Awards under the LTIP were made during the year to Allan Cook, Robin Clark, Geoff Cooper, Alex Hannam, Warren Tucker and Andy Stevens.
The value of the awards made was limited to 100% of basic salary two thirds of basic salary in the case of Warren Tucker.
The performance measure applicable to these awards is total shareholder return subject to a minimum level of absolute growth in earnings per share of an average of at least 3% 2% in respect of awards made prior to 2000 per annum above the rate of ination.
It is intended that awards will be made under the LTIP in 2004 on the same basis as in 2003 except that the level of awards made to participants will be reduced where they also participate in the new executive share option scheme described below.
With regard to total shareholder return, each participant will be entitled to 100% of his awards if the companys return over the performance period results in it being ranked in the top quartile of a comparator group comprising companies included in the FTSE engineering sector index in respect of awards made prior to 2000 and in the FTSE All Share aerospace and defence sector and the engineering and machinery sector in respect of awards made after 1999.
If the companys performance is at the median, 30% of the awarded shares will vest 40% in respect of awards made prior to 2000.
Between these two levels, the award will vest on a straight-line scale.
Participants will lose their awards if the companys performance is below the median.
Earnings per share and total shareholder return are considered by the committee to be the most fair and appropriate measures of the companys performance relative to the performance achieved by other comparable companies and of the companys underlying performance.
In assessing whether performance conditions have been met, the committee relies upon performance status and verication reports prepared by Inbucon.
Full details of all allocations under the LTIP are set out in table 5 on page 44.
LTIP performance The following table shows the actual performance of LTIP awards to date.
Year 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 Comparator Group number of companies 57 52 46 41 30 32 34 Ranking 9761 16 Quartile 11113 Percentage of award vesting 100% 100% 100% 100% Nil Normal date for transfer of shares April 2002 March 2003 March 2004 March 2003 March 2004 March 2005 2006 March, May, December 2006 The rules of the LTIP were amended at the companys 2000 annual general meeting in various ways including the removal of a requirement for the awarded shares to be held in trust for a period of up to two years after the expiry of the restricted period and the removal of the ability for participants to receive shares on a matching basis pro rata to investments made by them in Cobham shares.
COBHAM PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 39 Other share schemes The company made final grants of share options under the Cobham Executive Share Option Scheme 1994 in 2003.
The scheme will, subject to shareholder approval at the forthcoming annual general meeting, be replaced by a new scheme which is described in the circular which is being sent to shareholders with this annual report.
Executive directors will be eligible to participate in this new scheme.
The maximum value of shares a participant may receive pursuant to options granted in any financial year under the new scheme may not exceed once times basic salary, and the exercise of options granted will be conditional upon the companys earnings per share growth exceeding ination by a specified margin over a three-year period.
There will be no provision for retesting this performance condition if it is not met after three years.
Earnings per share growth is considered by the committee to be the most appropriate measure of the companys underlying financial performance and it is proposed that the following targets will apply to options granted in 2004: Average growth in EPS in excess of Value of shares under option which ination over three years may be exercised Less than 3% per annum Nil 3% per annum 50% of salary 5% per annum or more 100% of salary 3%-5% per annum 50%-100% of salary pro rata, on a straight line basis Certain executive directors are also participants in the Cobham Savings Related Share Option Scheme an all-employee share scheme approved by the Inland Revenue.
Under the scheme, participants save a xed monthly sum for three or five years and may use the sum generated by their savings contracts to exercise options which are granted at a 20% discount to market price.
Depending upon the option period chosen, exercise can normally take place after three, five or seven years.
This scheme has been approved by shareholders and does not contain performance conditions, since the Inland Revenue requires that they must be offered to all eligible employees on the same basis without such conditions.
Subject to shareholder approval, the scheme will be replaced at the forthcoming annual general meeting.
Further information is contained in the circular which is being sent to shareholders with this report.
Service contracts The boards policy on setting notice periods for new directors is that these should not normally exceed one year.
It recognises, however, that it may be necessary in the case of new executive appointments to offer a longer initial notice period which would subsequently reduce to one year after the expiry of that period.
There are no explicit provisions in directors service contracts for early termination compensation commitments.
The committee accepts and endorses the principle of mitigation of damages on early termination of a service contract.
The service contract of Gordon Page dated 15 October 1991 expired on his 60th birthday in November 2003 and he is now non-executive chairman and does not have a service contract.
Giles Irwins service contract dated 15 May 1987 expired on his 60th birthday in July 2003.
Robin Clark was employed under a service contract, dated 6 May 1993, containing a notice period of two years until he left the company as a result of a reorganisation of the groups structure on 15 August 2003.
The service contracts of Allan Cook dated 13 June 2001, Geoff Cooper dated 1 June 1989 and Alex Hannam dated 13 February 2003 are terminable on one years notice by either party.
Warren Tucker and Andy Stevens are employed under service contracts both of which are dated as of 1 January 2004 containing notice periods of two years by the company which reduce to one year after twelve months service.
It was necessary to agree to initial two-year notice periods in order to recruit both directors.
These contracts are terminable by six months notice to the company.
Subject to earlier termination in accordance with their terms, the service contracts of Allan Cook, Warren Tucker, Alex Hannam and Andy Stevens will expire on their 60th birthdays.
The service contract of Geoff Cooper does not contain an expiry date.
Personal shareholding The committees approach with regard to personal shareholding is to encourage executive directors to acquire and hold, over time, Cobham ordinary shares to the value of at least one years salary.
40  Report continued Non-executive directors The non-executive directors do not have service contracts.
Mike Smith, Jeff Edington, Peter Hooley and Marcus Beresford have been appointed pursuant to letters dated 14 March 1996, 12 August 1996, 10 May 2002 and 29 January 2004 respectively.

As Messrs Page and Irwin reached normal retirement age during the year their accrued pensions did not receive an inationary increase before retirement.
2 The transfer basis was amended during the year following guidance issued by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries and this has had the effect of increasing the additional transfer values to a greater extent than if the original basis had applied throughout the year.
3 These values, other than in respect of the position at 31 December 2002, are higher than would otherwise be the case because of understatements of accrued pension entitlements in prior years resulting from assumptions in respect of final pensionable salary and final remuneration.
Had the transfer value of accrued pension at 31 December 2002 been calculated using assumptions consistent with the calculation in respect of the position at 31 December 2003, the sum of 1,649,324 would have been 1,999,714.
Consequently, 681,743 would have reduced to 256,426 and 1,035,673 would have reduced to 685,283.
The accrued pension shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the financial year.
The transfer values represent the present value of future payments from the pension plan rather than remuneration currently due to the individual and cannot be meaningfully aggregated with annual remuneration.
Members of the pension plan have the option of paying additional voluntary contributions.
Neither the contributions nor the resulting benets are included in the above.
Under Inland Revenue regulations, members retirement benefits may be reduced on account of retained benefits from previous employments.
Ination during 2003 has been taken to be 1.7% being the statutory increase to deferred pensions from 2002 to 2003.
Transfer values payable are calculated in accordance with Section 4 Minimum Cash Equivalent of Guidance Note 11 issued by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.

Interests at 18 March 2004, being a date not more than one month prior to the date of the notice convening the annual general meeting, were the same as at 31 December 2003 save that the interests of Gordon Page had increased by 1,727 ordinary shares upon the exercise of options under the Cobham Savings Related Share Option Scheme on 9 February.
In addition, the number of ordinary shares held within the QUEST had reduced to two as at 18 March 2004.

At the date of vesting it was 1000p.
The market price of the 2000 shares at the date of the award was 805p.
At the date of vesting it was 1065p.
The awards are subject to the performance conditions specified on page 38.
Top quartile performance was achieved in respect of the 1998 and 2000 awards with the result that 100% of the awards vested.

In determining the extent to which shares should vest, the remuneration committee took into account the performance of the group to the date of leaving and or the unexpired award periods.
The market prices of these shares at the dates of award were 905p, 1157.5p, 1125p and 1082.5p respectively.
On the dates of vesting the market price of the 1999 shares and of the remaining shares was 1170p and 1185p respectively.
4 Lapsed shares comprise a proportion of the shares awarded in 2001, 2002 and 2003.
The remuneration committee considered that a proportion only of such shares should vest following Robin Clarks departure.
5 The expiry date is the last date by which qualifying conditions in respect of any outstanding interests under the LTIP have to be fullled.
This date may either be the expiry of any relevant holding period or where applicable of any restricted period.
6 Monetary values are calculated by multiplying the numbers of shares by their market prices as at the award dates.
