com 13 Remuneration report Strategy The success of Marks & Spencer is dependant upon the skill and experience of motivated employees throughout all levels of the business.
It is part of our strategy to have a range of alternative rewards to attract, motivate and retain high calibre individuals to drive the performance of the business and secure new paths for growth.
The Board considers the principles of good governance when deciding remuneration strategy.
The type and level of remuneration and benets we offer are key to supporting this strategy and maintaining our market position as an employer of choice.
Remuneration Committee The Committee comprises Dame Stella Rimington Chairman, Brian Baldock and Jack Keenan all of whom are independent, non-executive directors.
Tony Ball was also a member of the Committee until he retired from the Board in September 2002.
The Committee recommends to the Board a reward framework to enable the Company to attract and retain its executive directors and senior management, giving due regard to the financial and commercial health of the Company.
The Committees approach reects the Companys overall philosophy that all employees should be appropriately and competitively rewarded, in particular for delivering superior performance which contributes to improved business results.
The Committee keeps itself fully informed of all relevant developments and best practice in the eld of remuneration and seeks advice where appropriate from external advisors.
New Bridge Street Consultants have provided material advice to the Committee on directors remuneration in the past year.
They also provide advice to the Company in respect of share schemes.
The Company Chairman, Chief Executive, Company Secretary and Head of Senior Remuneration also materially assisted the Committee in its deliberations, except in relation to their own remuneration.
Remuneration policy Total remuneration for executive directors comprises xed pay, variable pay and benets.
Fixed pay and benets are set at around median levels when compared with retailers and FTSE 100 companies of similar size.
Variable pay provides the opportunity to earn greater amounts for superior performance.
The performance-related element forms a significant proportion of the total potential package.
There are two components to variable pay: annual bonus and two long-term incentives in the form of share options and participation in the Executive Share Matching Plan.
Approximate expected relative value of future annual remuneration package for full-time executive directors Fixed Performance related Salary On-target annual bonus Long-term incentives 50% 20% 30% The value placed on long-term incentives is an estimate of the expected value of option grants and matching shares awarded under the Executive Share Matching Plan based upon the Black-Scholes methodology.
In addition to salary and performance pay, executive directors receive benets in kind as detailed in the emoluments table on page 16.
The analysis excludes potential benets from the pension scheme.
Following the Chairmans change of status from full-time to part-time during the year, his remuneration package consists of salary, annual bonus and benets.
He no longer participates in any share incentive schemes.
The remuneration for the non-executive directors is determined by the Chairman and executive directors and is designed both to recognise the responsibilities of non-executive directors and to attract individuals with the necessary skills and experience to contribute to the future growth of the Company.
The non-executives are paid a basic fee with an additional fee payable to the chair of the Remuneration Committee.
Their fees are neither performance related nor pensionable.
They do not participate in any of the Companys Share Schemes nor the Annual Bonus Scheme.
The next review of fees is due in 2003.
Salaries and benets Salaries and benets for executive directors are reviewed annually.
Salaries are benchmarked against equivalent market salaries for large retailers and for other FTSE 100 companies with a similar turnover and market capitalisation and are currently set around the median point of the comparator groups.
The salaries are set by the Committee after consideration of the Companys performance, market conditions, the level of increase awarded to employees throughout the business and the need to reward individual performance.
Consistent with his part-time status, the Chairmans salary is pro-rated accordingly.
Current salaries for executive directors are set out in the Directors emoluments table on page 16.
Annual Bonus Scheme The Annual Bonus Scheme is designed to reinforce the relationship between individual and corporate performance and reward.
The targets are determined annually by the Committee and incorporate a mixture of financial measures and personal business targets.
The achievement of targets for all executive directors is assessed by the Committee, with the help and advice of the Company Chairman.
The current bonus for executive directors starts at 40% of salary for on-target performance rising to a maximum of 100% for exceeding targets.
14 Marks and Spencer Group p. l. c. Remuneration report Long-term Incentive Schemes a Executive Share Option Scheme Executive Share Option Schemes, now open to approximately 400 senior management, have operated for over 20 years.
Under the current Scheme, annual awards of up to 150% of basic salary may be offered based on performance and potential and, for exceptional performance and potential, grants of up to 250% of basic salary may be awarded.
Recruitment grants can be made up to 400% of salary.
The performance targets for the current Scheme are adjusted earnings per share growth, as disclosed in the financial statements, measured from the most recent financial year ending prior to grant of at least: ination plus an average of 3% per annum for 50% of each grant: and ination plus an average of 4% per annum for the other 50% of each grant.
Performance targets are assessed over an initial three year period from the date of grant.
If not met over the initial period, the targets can be retested on two further occasions over the four and five year periods from the date of grant.
The performance conditions were chosen because they require significant improvement in the Companys underlying financial performance for options to become exercisable.
Since the 1996 Finance Act, grants of Inland Revenue Approved options have been limited to 30,000.
Grants in excess of this limit will be unapproved options, which confer no tax advantage on the participants.
b Executive Share Matching Plan An Executive Share Matching Plan for senior management was approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2002 and was introduced for the first time in July 2002.
The Plan currently operates for approximately 25 selected members of senior management.
Participants will be required other than in 2002 when participation was optional to invest one-third, in shares in the Company, of any annual bonus earned.
Any part of the balance of any bonus may be invested voluntarily.
In years where there is no bonus payable there is no investment opportunity.
The pre-tax value of the invested bonus will be matched by an award of shares, with the extent of the match determined by performance conditions.
The current performance conditions are: 1 50% of the invested bonus receives a matching award based on the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR compared to the constituents of the FTSE 100 at the start of the performance period: and the other 50% of the invested bonus receives a matching award based on the Companys TSR compared to a comparator group of UK retailers at the start of the period: Big Food Group House of Fraser New Look Tesco Boots Kingsher Next WH Smith Debenhams Matalan Safeway Woolworths Dixons MFI Sainsbury GUS William Morrison Somereld Companies which have dropped out of either group by the end of the period would be included in the calculation if they have been there for 50% or more of the period.
If they have been there less than 50% they would be excluded from the calculation.
2 At the end of the three year performance period, the Companys TSR performance is ranked against the two comparator groups and the following matching ratios applied: Ratio of Matching Award to relevant TSR Performance Ranking in Group portion of Invested Bonus Top Decile 2.5:1 Between Median and Top Decile Pro rata between 1:1 and 2.5:1 Median 1:1 3 Below Median Zero 1 TSR the return to shareholders comprising the increase or decrease in the share price plus the value of dividends received assuming that they are reinvested.
2 The performance period for the plan will consist of three consecutive financial years.
However, in the first year of the plan the three year performance period started on the day after the results were announced 22 May 2002.
3 Any element of bonus that is compulsorily invested in the Plan receives a minimum matching ratio of 0.25:1 irrespective of performance.
These performance conditions have been chosen because they are felt most closely to align the interests of senior management with the interests of shareholders, by rewarding management for achieving superior relative total shareholder return performance compared to direct competitors and the FTSE 100 as a whole.
com 15 c All-Employee Share Schemes Executive directors can also participate in the share schemes open to all employees of the Company, currently the Share Incentive Plan and the SAYE scheme.
Employees have maintained their strong commitment to share ownership in recent years, and currently 42,000 employees hold approximately 26 million shares in their own right and 30,000 employees hold options on 71 million shares under the SAYE scheme.
Details of grants and awards made to executive directors under all schemes are given in section 5 of this report.
Shareholding policy A requirement was introduced in 2002 that the executive directors within five years of 1 June 2002 or within five years of appointment whichever is the later should hold shares whose market value at that time is equivalent to or greater than their then current gross annual base salary.
Service contracts All members of senior management have service contracts which can be terminated by the Company with 12 months notice.
Exceptions may exist where new recruits have been granted longer notice periods for the initial period of their employment.
The Company retains the right to terminate the contract of any director summarily in accordance with the terms of their service agreement, on payment of a sum equivalent to the contractual notice entitlement of 12 months salary and benets and payment in respect of future bonus entitlement for that period based on a proportion of the on target bonus.
However, entitlement to participate in future options under the Companys share schemes ceases on summary termination.
The executive directors have rolling service contracts which can be terminated by the Company giving 12 months notice and by the director giving six months notice, with the exception of Vittorio Radice who was initially appointed with a service contract entitling him to two years notice, reducing proportionately during the first year of employment to 12 months notice following the first anniversary of his appointment.

External appointments The Company recognises that executive directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies and that such appointments can broaden their knowledge and experience, to the benefit of the Company.
Fees are normally retained by the individual director.
16 Marks and Spencer Group p. l. c. Remuneration report Performance graph This graph illustrates the performance of the Company against the FTSE 100 over the past five years.
The FTSE 100 has been chosen as it is a recognised broad equity market index of which the Company has been a member throughout the period.
Performance, as required by the legislation, is measured by Total Shareholder Return share price growth plus dividends paid.

2 Alan McWalter retired from the Board on 10 July 2002.
His termination payment includes one years salary of 300,000 and 151,000 for loss of benets which includes bonus, car benets, pension supplement and loss of pensionable service.
The annual bonus scheme this year has been awarded at a range of 87% to 98% of base salary dependent on the delivery of personal business targets and the financial measure of profit before tax.
The bonus gure in the emoluments table is inclusive of the amounts compulsorily and voluntarily invested in shares for the purposes of the Share Matching Plan.
Luc Vandevelde does not participate in this plan.
The benets shown in the emoluments table include the provision of cars, fuel and travel for executive directors.
Pension supplements are paid to Luc Vandevelde, of 16% of salary and Vittorio Radice, of 25% of salary as they do not participate in the Marks & Spencer Pension Scheme.
A 10% supplement, in respect of the difference between the pensions earnings cap and their base salary see section 3 is paid to Roger Holmes, Justin King, Laurel Powers-Freeling and was paid to Alan McWalter.
In addition, under the terms of Luc Vandeveldes service contract, the Company provides accommodation whilst he is in London on which he is assessed for tax.
Accommodation is also provided for Laurel Powers-Freeling in Chester, to accommodate her working pattern two days in London, three days in Chester the location of our Financial Services operation.
A taxable benefit arises from this which is met by the Company.
Luc Vandevelde, Roger Holmes and Alison Reed received a cash sum in lieu of the dividends waived on shares which vested under the Restricted Share Plan.
com 17 2 Recruitment of executive directors During the year Vittorio Radice was recruited and appointed to the Board as an executive director on 3 March 2003 on the following terms: salary of 425,000: guaranteed bonus of 290,000 as compensation for loss of bonus from his previous employer included within bonus in the emoluments table : shares to the value of 665,000 in compensation for the loss of outstanding Long Term Incentive Plans with his previous employer.
These shares will be released in three tranches, subject to continuing employment, in July of 2003, 2004 and 2005 included within benets in the emoluments table : supplement of 25% of total salary and a payment of 200,000 in compensation for the loss of pension benets from his previous employer included within benets in the emoluments table : and award of shares under the 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme with a market value at the date of employment of four times base salary see Long Term Incentive Schemes.
3 Directors pension information The Marks & Spencer Pension Scheme The executive directors, management and employees except for staff employed by Marks & Spencer Outlet Ltd all participate in the Companys Dened benefit Pension Scheme provided their date of permanent appointment was prior to 1 April 2002.
The Scheme is non-contributory and the subject of an Independent Trust.
The normal retirement age under the Pension Scheme for senior management is 60 to harmonise with the Company contractual retirement age.
For all other employees the normal retirement age is 65 previously 60 but for those employees who joined the Scheme prior to 1 January 1996 their accrued rights were not affected by this change.
The Pension Scheme enables members to achieve the maximum pension of two-thirds of their salary in the 12 months ending at normal retirement date after 30 years service.
For employees including senior management who joined the Scheme prior to 1 January 1996 no actuarial reduction is applied to pensions payable from the age of 58.
Employees who joined the Scheme on or after 1 January 1996 are subject to an actuarial reduction in their pension if payment starts prior to their normal retirement date.
In the case of earnings over 100,000 p. a. the pensionable salary is usually based on an average of the earnings over the last three years to retirement.
Pension commutation to enable participants to receive a lump sum on retirement is permitted within Inland Revenue limits.
For death before retirement, a capital sum equal to four times salary is payable, together with a spouses pension of twothirds of the members prospective pension at the age of 65 60 for senior management.
For death in retirement, a spouses pension is paid equal to two-thirds of the members current pension.
In the event of death after leaving service but prior to commencement of pension, a spouses pension of two-thirds of the accrued preserved pension is payable.
In all circumstances, childrens allowances are also payable, usually up to the age of 16.
Substantial protection is also offered in the event of serious ill health.
Post-retirement increases for pension earned from 6 April 1997 are awarded on a statutory basis.
Pension earned prior to 6 April 1997 is guaranteed to increase by the rise in ination, up to a maximum of 3% per annum.
Increases beyond this gure will continue to be reviewed on a discretionary basis.
The Marks & Spencer Pension Scheme was closed to new members with effect from 31 March 2002.
For employees joining the Company on or after 1 April 2002, a new contributory Retirement Plan is available after one years service, see page 18 for details.
Pension benets The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 require disclosure of dened benefit pension arrangements on a different basis to that specified in the Listing Rules.
Details of pension benets earned by the executive directors during the year ended 29 March 2003 are shown below on both bases: Transfer value Additional of additional pension pension in Transfer Transfer Increase Accrued Additional earned in excess of Accrued value of value of in transfer entitlement pension the year in ination net entitlement pension at pension at value net at 30 March earned in excess of of directors at 29 March Age at 30 March 29 March of directors 2002 the year ination contribution 2003 29 March 2002 2003 contribution 5 5 000 000 000 000 000 2003 000 000 000 Required under Listing Rules New under Directors Remuneration as in prior years Report Regulations 1,2 Roger Holmes 433 17 7 43 30 40 10 1,2 Justin King 332 11 6 41 27 40 13 David Norgrove 86 18 16 213 104 55 1,191 1,348 157 1 Laurel Powers-Freeling 122 17 3 45 7 22 15 Alison Reed 75 66 65 462 141 46 708 1,005 297 1,2, 3 Alan McWalter 544 72 9 49 54 119 65 1 Roger Holmes, Alan McWalter, Justin King and Laurel Powers-Freeling are subject to the pension earnings cap 97,200 at 29 March 2003 which is reviewed annually by the Government.
As a result, they also receive a pension-related salary supplement see section 1.
2 The pensions for Roger Holmes, Alan McWalter and Justin King are based on a uniform accrual of two-thirds of the pension earnings cap less the pension which they have accrued from membership of previous employers pension schemes.
18 Marks and Spencer Group p. l. c. Remuneration report 3 Pension gures for Alan McWalter reect his service to 31 July 2002 when he ceased to be an employee.
4 The pension entitlements and transfer values shown exclude any additional pension purchased by Additional Voluntary Contributions.
5 Ination has been assumed to be equivalent to the actual rate of price ination which was 1.7% for the year to 30 September 2002.
This measurement date accords with the Listing Rules.
The accrued entitlement represents the deferred pension to which directors would have been entitled had they left the Company at the end of March 2002 and 2003 respectively.
Under the Listing Rules, the additional pension earned is the increase during the year net of ination, and the transfer value relating to that increase is shown under the column headed transfer value of additional pension.
Under the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations the additional pension earned relates to the difference between the accumulated pension at the end of March 2002 and 2003.
Also disclosed under the new regulations is the transfer value of the accrued entitlement at the end of March 2002 and 2003.
The increase in transfer value is the difference between these values and is therefore dependent on the change in stock market conditions over the course of the year.
The transfer value represents an obligation of the pension fund which could be paid to another pension scheme for the benefit of the director.
It is not a sum paid or due to the director.
Luc Vandevelde and Vittorio Radice do not participate in the Company Pension Scheme.
The Marks & Spencer Retirement Plan Employees joining the Company on or after 1 April 2002 are, on completion of one years service, invited to join the new, contributory Retirement Plan.
The Plan is a dened contribution arrangement, where employees may choose to contribute between 3% and 6% of their salary, and the Company will contribute between 6% and 12%.
The employee is free to choose, from a range of investment vehicles, where the total contribution will be invested.
During the one year waiting period before joining the Plan, the employees will be covered for death in service by a capital payment of twice salary, increasing to four times salary from the date of joining the Plan, subject to the statutory earnings cap.
4 Payments to former directors Details of payments made under the Early Retirement Plan and other payments made to former directors during the year are: Paid in Paid in 2003 2002 000 000 1 Early retirement pensions payable until James Beneld 22 April 2009 71 70 Lord Stone of Blackheath 7 September 2002 47 93 Derek Hayes 19 November 2008 66 65 Chris Littmoden 28 September 2003 89 88 Keith Oates 3 July 2002 59 174 Unfunded pensions 2 Clinton Silver 89 88 Other 3 Robert Colvill 19 177 Chris Littmoden 87 Sir David Sieff 13 1 Under the Early Retirement Plan the Remuneration Committee could, at its discretion, offer an unfunded Early Retirement Pension, separate from the Company pension, which was payable from the date of retirement to age 60.
With effect from 31 March 2000, the Early Retirement Plan was withdrawn but payments continue for awards made before this date.
2 The pension scheme entitlement for Clinton Silver is supplemented by an additional, unfunded pension paid by the Company.
3 Robert Colvill continued to receive a fee as non-executive chairman of Marks & Spencer Financial Services until 31 August 2002.
5 Directors interests in long-term incentive schemes Share Option Schemes The Company has operated Executive Option Schemes for over 20 years following shareholder approval for the first scheme in 1977.
The Remuneration Committee has imposed performance criteria for the exercise of all options granted since 1996 and the performance targets for outstanding options are described below: 2000 and 2002 Schemes For options granted in 200103, the performance target is: earnings per share growth over three years of at least ination plus an average of 3% per annum for 50% of each grant, measured from a xed base of 14.5p or the EPS gure for the year ending prior to grant if higher: and earnings per share growth over three years of ination plus an average of 4% per annum for the other 50% of each grant, measured from a xed base of 16.5p or the EPS gure for the year ending prior to grant if higher.
Luc Vandevelde, Roger Holmes, Justin King, David Norgrove, Laurel Powers-Freeling, Vittorio Radice, Alison Reed and Alan McWalter hold options under these schemes.
com 19 5 Directors interests in long-term incentive schemes continued 1997 Scheme The first grants under this scheme were in June 1998 and no options have been granted since June 2000.
Options are subject to the following performance targets on exercise: Tier 1 Options: earnings per share growth over three years of at least ination plus an average of 3% per annum: and Tier 2 Options: earnings per share growth over five years which would place the Company in the upper quartile of the FTSE 100 companies.
Luc Vandevelde, David Norgrove, Alison Reed and Alan McWalter hold options under this scheme.
1984 and 1987 Schemes The last grants under these schemes were awarded in June 1997.
The performance targets for the exercise of options granted in 1996 and 1997 require earnings per share growth of at least ination plus an average of 2% per annum.
Participants who hold options under the 1984 and 1987 Schemes will continue to be bound by their Maximum Option Value MOV of four times earnings, and may only exercise options up to this value, after which any outstanding options lapse.
Following the introduction of the 2000 Scheme the Remuneration Committee decided that MOV will no longer increase with earnings.
David Norgrove and Alison Reed hold options under this scheme.
At the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, directors can take their options for all schemes into retirement.
Options held under the 1984 and 1987 Schemes continue to be bound by MOV and can be exercised subject to the option period.
For options held under the 1997, and current Schemes, options lapse if they are not exercised within 12 months of retirement.
Additionally, a Save As You Earn SAYE Option Scheme was approved by shareholders in 1981 and renewed by shareholders in 1987 and 1997.
The Scheme is open to all employees, including executive directors, who have completed one years service and who open an approved savings contract.
Inland Revenue rules limit the maximum amount which can be saved to 250 per month.
When the savings contract is started options are granted to acquire the number of shares that the total savings will buy when the savings contract matures: options cannot normally be exercised until a minimum of three years has elapsed.
The options detailed in the table below may not be exercisable for any one of the following reasons: i the options have not been held for three years and therefore cannot be exercised under scheme rules: or ii the options have not met the appropriate performance criteria.
2 David Norgrove was the only director who exercised options during the year.
3 Alan McWalter retired as a director 10 July 2002.
Options are carried into retirement under the terms of the various schemes see above.
4 Exercisable A option price is above market value on 29 March 2003, options have vested.
5 Exercisable B option price is below market value on 29 March 2003, options have vested.
6 Not exercisable A option price is above market value on 29 March 2003, options have not vested.
7 Not exercisable B option price is below market value on 29 March 2003, options have not vested.
8 The market price of the shares at the end of the financial year was 289.25p: the highest and lowest share price during the financial year were 423.0p and 262.5p respectively.

After one year of the 200205 performance period, Marks & Spencers TSR is ranked 27th in the FTSE 100 Comparator Group and 4th in the Retailers Comparator Group.
A match of 1:1.99 79% of the maximum potential shares would be receivable if these positions were to be maintained for the full three-year performance period.
These calculations have been independently made by New Bridge Street Consultants using data from Datastream an independent data services provider.
Arcadia will not be included within the Retailer Comparator Group at the end of the three-year period as they will not have existed for more than 50% of the time.
Sections 1, 3, 4 and the table in section 5 of this report have been audited.
