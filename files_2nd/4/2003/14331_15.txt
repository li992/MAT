38 39 remuneration report Introduction The following sections of the Remuneration Committee Report are subject to audit:- Directors Remuneration, Pensions, Conditional Holdings, Options over shares in the Company and the SkyePharma PLC Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
The remaining sections are not subject to audit.
At the Annual General Meeting of the Company on 23rd June 2004, an advisory resolution approving this Report is to be proposed as an Ordinary Resolution.
In addition, shareholders will have the opportunity of voting on the proposed Remuneration Committee policy for 2004, set out in the accompanying circular.
Scope & Authority The Remuneration Committee sets the remuneration policy applying to the Executive Directors and key executives and determines the levels of salaries, bonus payments, share options, pension contributions and other benefits in kind.
The members of the Remuneration Committee are independent Non-executive Directors of the Company: Sir Michael Beavis Chairman, Dr D R Ebsworth, Mr R S Harris and Dr K R Mansford.
The Remuneration Committee has no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross directorships and no day to day involvement in running the business.
The Remuneration Committee has formal written terms of reference which are available for inspection by shareholders on request.
The Remuneration Committee seeks advice from Halliwell Consulting, an independent executive remuneration and share schemes consultancy.
Halliwell Consulting provides the Company with advice in relation to remuneration and share schemes and provides no other services.
The Remuneration Committee confirmed their appointment during the year under review.
When the Remuneration Committee is considering matters concerning key executives below Board level advice is sought from Mr M Ashton Chief Executive Officer and Mr D Nicholson Finance Director.
During the year the Remuneration Committee in conjunction with Halliwell Consulting conducted a full review of the Companys current remuneration policies.
The results of this review and the proposed changes to this policy are contained in a separate Circular.
The Company has complied with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
The Board has reviewed the Companys compliance with the new Combined Code on Directors remuneration as part of the full review conducted during the year.
It is the opinion of the Board that the Company complied with the spirit of all remuneration related aspects of the Code during the year.
However the Company was technically in breach of the Code with regard to the SkyePharma PLC Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
This provides for Company expensed matching shares at the end of three years and the provision of these matching shares is not subject to the satisfaction of additional performance conditions.
The addition of performance conditions is one of the proposed changes to the Companys remuneration policy set out in the Circular.
Part 2 of the Regulations Unaudited Information Remuneration Policy for 2003 It should be noted that the policy and figures contained in this report relate to 2003.
The proposed policy for 2004 is contained in the separate Notice of Annual General Meeting and Proposed New Remuneration Policy the Circular.
The Remuneration Committees policy for 2003 was to set the main elements of the remuneration package at the following quartiles in comparison to the Companys comparator group: Base Salary Annual Bonus Potential Share Incentives Between Median Upper Quartile Upper Quartile Lower Quartile The international nature of some of the companies constituting the comparator group means that the Company cannot provide the level of share incentives within current UK corporate governance best practice offered by these companies to their executives.
In order to remain attractive to the type of executive talent required to grow the Company, the Remuneration Committee determined to set the base salary between the median and the start of the upper quartile.
However, in 2003 the Remuneration Committee took into consideration the median on median rise in the comparator group to ensure that over a period of time the level of base salary does not rise towards the upper quartile.
In order to ensure that there was a significant performance element to the package, the Remuneration Committee implemented a challenging bonus arrangement for 2003 providing significant reward for exceptional performance coupled with competitive performance option grants during the year in terms of the UK market.
SkyePharma annual report 2003 If option grants to executives of the comparator companies and the Company are valued using the BlackScholes methodology and the cash value of these options added to base salary and bonus to give a total cash value for the package, the Company is positioned between the lower quartile and the median.
In order to ensure that the Companys remuneration policy is appropriate for its current stage of development and from the perspective of best practice and the views of its shareholders, the Remuneration Committee actively reviews the policy on an annual basis.
The factors affecting shareholders which are taken into account include:- dilution caused by issuing shares under the Companys share plans: the charge to the Companys profit and loss account for share incentives: corporate governance best practice: and the alignment of the interests of the Executive Directors with those of shareholders.
The full details of the proposed changes to the Companys remuneration policy and the rationale are contained in the separate Circular.
In summary the main proposed changes for 2004 are:- the movement away from using share options to incentivise, motivate and retain Executive Directors and Senior Executives to whole share awards using the LTIP element of the SkyePharma PLC Deferred Share Bonus Plan approved by shareholders in 2001: the attachment of performance conditions to the matching element of the deferred bonus part of the SkyePharma PLC Deferred Share Bonus Plan: changes to the performance conditions of the annual bonus although the maximum potential bonus will remain at 100% of salary : and the introduction of shareholding requirements for Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee believes that these changes will reinforce the pay for performance culture within the organisation while further aligning the interests of the Executive Directors with those of shareholders.
For the year to 31 December 2003, Analysis of performance vs non-performance element of remuneration package this chart demonstrates Ian Gowrie-Smith the amount of annual compensation 46% 6% 48% which is performance related.
The Remuneration Committee, with input from the Executive Directors, continually reviews the comparator group for its appropriateness to the current stage of the Companys development and market factors generally.
There are some minor proposed changes to the comparator group for 2004 as a result of corporate activity.
Further details are contained in the Circular.
Base Salary Policy: Median to Start of the Upper Quartile The policy of the Remuneration Committee for 2003 was to set base salaries for the Executive Directors between the median and the start of the upper quartile compared to the companies constituting the comparator group.
SkyePharma annual report 2003 40 41 remuneration report continued The basic salary of each Executive Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Factors taken into account by the Remuneration Committee when determining base salary are:- the median rise in the level of base salary for a similar position within the comparator group: the individual Executive Directors performance: the experience and responsibilities of the respective Executive Directors: and the pay and conditions throughout the Company.
Salaries are reviewed on an annual basis.
Performance Bonus Policy: Upper Quartile Bonus Potential It was the Remuneration Committees policy for 2003 to set the performance bonus potential at the upper quartile compared to the companies constituting the comparator group.
Performance bonuses are paid, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, in recognition of the Directors contribution to the success of the Company and the achievement of specified objectives.
In 2003 the primary performance targets were:- profitability: divisional financial targets: achievement of pre-determined operational milestones primarily related to the signing of new deals: and the average share appreciation performance of five selected companies compared to the Company Nektar Therapeutics, Aradigm, Alkermes, Emisphere and CIMA.
The annual bonus for approximately 25 senior executives is provided through the SkyePharma PLC Deferred Share Bonus Plan, which was approved by shareholders at the 2001 Annual General Meeting.
The Plan is designed to align the interests of participants with those of shareholders by encouraging executives to build up and maintain shareholdings which are meaningful in the context of their remuneration.
The Plan currently requires a minimum deferral of 50% of each annual net bonus in the form of Company shares Executive Shares.
The Company currently provides one Matching Share for each Executive Share acquired calculated on the gross bonus deferral.
The Matching Shares will be released after three years provided that the executive remains in employment and the corresponding Executive Shares have not been sold.
The release of Matching Shares is not subject to additional performance criteria because the Remuneration Committee believes that the performance conditions which have to be satisfied for the payment of any bonus are sufficiently challenging to justify the total bonus payment and additional Matching Shares.
However, in line with current best practice, and the wishes of the majority of the Companys shareholders the Company is proposing to apply from 2004 performance conditions which have to be satisfied before Matching Shares will be provided see the Circular for full details.
In accordance with the terms of the bonus schedules for 2003, the Chief Executive Officer and Finance Director would have been entitled to receive a bonus of 30% and 40% of salary respectively.
The Remuneration Committee has determined that in the current circumstances of the Company the bonuses should be reduced to 15% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 20% for the Finance Director.
The executives of the Company have voluntarily decided to receive all 2003 bonus payments in shares Executive Shares to demonstrate their ongoing commitment to, and confidence in, the Company.
In consideration for this voluntary deferral the Remuneration Committee has determined that the 2003 Executive Shares should be matched on a one for one basis under the SkyePharma PLC Deferred Share Bonus Plan provided that the executive remains in employment and the corresponding Executive Shares have not been sold.
The bonuses for the Executive Directors for 2003 were: Ian Gowrie-Smith Michael Ashton Donald Nicholson Element Executive Chairman Chief Executive Officer Finance Director Actual Bonus Nil 59,400 44,000 %age of Salary Nil 15% 20% Actual Value of Matching Shares Nil 59,400 44,000 %age of Salary Nil 15% 20% Total Actual Value of Bonus & Matching Share Award Nil 118,800 88,000 %age of Salary Nil 30% 40% Upper Quartile Bonus %age of Salary comparator group 105% 105% 100% SkyePharma annual report 2003 Currently executives who remain in employment with the Company have retained all their Executive Shares.

The proposed performance requirements and maximum bonus potential for 2004 are set out in detail in the Circular.
Share Incentives Policy: Lower Quartile compared to the Comparator Group Median to UQ against UK Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Companies The policy of the Remuneration Committee for 2003 was to provide lower quartile share incentive grants compared to the companies constituting the comparator group.
The following table sets out the current level of dilution against the ABI limits for all plans and discretionary plans as at 31 December 2003:- Maximum Current Dilution 10% dilution in ten years for all share schemes 8.3% 5% dilution in ten years for all executive share schemes 3.6% Option Schemes Executive Directors and senior executives currently participate in the SkyePharma PLC 1999 Share Option Scheme.
Ian Gowrie-Smith Michael Ashton Donald Nicholson Element Executive Chairman Chief Executive Officer Finance Director Actual Option Grant %age of Salary 200% 200% 200% Actual Value of the Option on the Date of Grant using Black-Scholes and based on current TSR performance of the Company 465,535 409,671 227,595 Lower Quartile Option Grant comparator group 234% 234% 201% The Remuneration Committee set the level of option grants to the Executive Directors of the Company at the lower quartile compared to the comparator group.
This level is competitive within the UK market and is acceptable to UK institutions but is relatively low in comparison to the US components of the comparator group.
SkyePharma annual report 2003 42 43 remuneration report continued 1 The performance condition on option grants to senior executives is that vesting is dependent upon total shareholder return performance against the comparator group.
No options will vest for below median performance.
50% of options will vest for median comparative performance with 100% of options vesting for upper quartile comparative performance straight line vesting between the two points.
The Remuneration Committee believes that comparative total shareholder return is the most appropriate measure to ensure that shareholders and Executive Directors interests are aligned.
It is the opinion of the Remuneration Committee that the adoption of a comparative total shareholder return measure encourages senior executives to improve the Companys profitability and earnings per share and, on a comparative basis, to deliver at least median share price performance against the comparator group.
The Remuneration Committee satisfies itself that the recorded total shareholder return is a genuine reflection of the underlying financial performance of the Company.
All options granted to executives during 2003 have been made on this basis and vest after three years on a scale between 0% and 100% depending on the Companys performance relative to the performance of the comparator group.
To assess whether or not the performance condition has been met, the Remuneration Committee measures the companys total shareholder return over a fixed 3 year period from date of grant to prospective date of vesting in comparison to that of the comparator group.
These calculations will be independently 2 tested and audited by the Companys advisors, Halliwell Consulting.
If the stringent performance requirements are not met at the end of the performance period, all options will lapse.
Total Shareholder Return performance graph This graph shows the TSR performance of the company in Total shareholder return from 31st December1998 500 comparison to the FTSE Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology Index and the comparator group over the past 5 years.
400 300 % 200 SkyePharma 100 Comparator Group Index 0 FTSE Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology Sector -100 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 The Remuneration Committee consider the FTSE Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology Index a relevant index for total shareholder return comparison disclosure required under the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 as the index members represent the broad range of UK quoted pharmaceutical companies.
As detailed earlier in the report the Company considers its TSR performance for option grants in comparison to that of a comparator group.
Share Purchase Plan The Companys intention is to encourage share ownership at all levels of the business, thereby aligning all employees interests with those of the shareholders.
Accordingly, the Company introduced the SkyePharma International Share Purchase Plan the Plan which was launched in February 2002.
All employees including all the Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Plan under the arrangements introduced in their respective countries.
The Plan complements the Option Schemes as it is more focused on employee retention.
Under the Plan, employees are given the opportunity of purchasing Company shares up to a maximum of 1,500 per year or local currency equivalent.
The Company will then match each share purchased with an award of Matching Shares.
The maximum ratio of Matching Shares to employee purchased shares is two to one although the current ratio adopted by the Company is one matching share for each share purchased.
The Matching Shares are subject to a three year holding period.
Normally, the Matching Shares will only be released at the end of this holding period if the corresponding employee purchased shares have not been sold and the employee is still in employment at that time.
The release of Matching Shares is not subject to additional performance criteria in line with UK Inland Revenue rules and normal UK practice.
As at December 31st 2003, 145 30% employees have elected to participate in the Plan and have purchased 267,440 shares.
The Company has also provisionally awarded 267,440 Matching Shares.
1 Total Shareholder Return TSR is a measure showing the return on investing in one share of the Company over the three year performance period capital growth and reinvested dividends.
It is normally used comparatively with the company achieving the best return ranked number 1.
2 The calculation of total shareholder return shall be in accordance with the principles set out in The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
SkyePharma annual report 2003 Pension Policy: Lower Quartile to Median The policy of the Remuneration Committee for 2003 was to set the Company pension contribution at the lower quartile to median compared to the companies constituting the comparator group.
The Company makes contributions into individual personal pension schemes for Executive Directors at a defined percentage of salary, excluding bonus and other forms of remuneration.
The Executive Directors do not participate in any Company sponsored pension plans and are expected to make their own pension arrangements.
The Company contributions for 2003 in respect of Executive Directors are:- Ian Gowrie-Smith Michael Ashton Donald Nicholson Element Executive Chairman Chief Executive Officer Finance Director Actual Contribution 56,250 49,500 27,500 Percentage of Salary 12.5% 12.5% 12.5% Directors Service Contracts All Executive Directors contracts are for a fixed period of one year from date of appointment, and will continue thereafter unless terminated by at least 12 months written notice.
This arrangement is in line with best corporate practice for listed companies.
In the event of the termination of an executives contract, salary and benefits will be payable during the notice period.
However, all Executive Directors will be expected to mitigate their loss in accordance with general legal principles in the event of their cessation of employment.
The Remuneration Committee is considering introducing phasing of payments of notice on cessation in line with the combined ABI and NAPF guidelines, subject to existing contractual constraints.
The Remuneration Committee will ensure that there have been no unjustified payments for failure on an Executive Directors termination of employment.
There are no special provisions in the contracts of employment extending notice periods on a change of control.
