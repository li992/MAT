Remuneration report Remuneration Committee membership and terms of reference The Remuneration Committee the Committee is comprised exclusively of Independent Non-executive Directors and its members are: The Rt Hon.
Lord Baker of Dorking CH Chairman, W F Blount and The Baroness Noakes DBE.
The role of the Committee is to consider and make recommendations on the framework of executive remuneration the policy for approval by the Board.
In accordance with the policy agreed, the Committee will consider, recommend as appropriate and approve the conditions of service of the Chairman, the Executive Directors and the Company Secretary, including the duration of any service agreements, and the emoluments and other benets payable under such agreements, including pension entitlements and participation in incentive arrangements.
It also recommends and monitors the level and structure of remuneration for senior management and oversees the Companys and Old Hansons long term incentive plans and option schemes.
During the year under review, other than from its independent adviser, the Committee also sought the assistance of the Chairman, the Chief Executive and the Company Secretary on matters relating to remuneration.
There were four meetings held by the Committee during the year and all members attended each meeting.
No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest, other than as a shareholder, in the matters to be decided or for the day-to-day management of the business.
The Chairman, Chief Executive and the Company Secretary were present at meetings of the Committee but the Chief Executive and the Company Secretary were excluded when the Chief Executives performance and remuneration were being discussed.
Committee members receive fees as Non-executive Directors including a fee for acting as a Committee member, but do not receive any pension entitlements nor any short and long-term performance related incentives.
The fees payable to Independent Non-executive Directors are determined by the Board as a whole within the limits set by the articles of association.
The Independent Non-executive Directors do not participate in or vote on any discussion relating to their own remuneration.
The Committee appointed Mercer Human Resource Consulting Mercer to act on behalf of the Committee in providing independent market information and remuneration advice on an ongoing basis.
Mercer also provides actuarial and consulting services to the Company.
Remuneration policy Hanson operates in competitive and international markets.
To continue to compete successfully it is essential that the Company attracts, develops, retains and motivates talented high-calibre Executive Directors in the best interests of shareholders.
To ensure that its remuneration rates are competitive, whilst not being excessive, the Committee keeps remuneration under regular review in light of emerging best practice.
The remuneration policy is designed to provide packages, which take account of individual performance: i in the knowledge of what comparable, in terms of size and complexity, UK and international companies are paying: ii in the context of packages offered throughout Hanson: and iii to include short and long-term performance related elements, potentially a significant portion of total rewards, to motivate the highest performance and to align the interests of the Executive Directors and shareholders.
Share incentives are considered to be an important part of the incentive policy for Executive Directors.
While there is no specic shareholding requirement for Executive Directors, shares arising from share based incentive plans are expected to be retained.
Basic salary In setting the basic salary for each Executive Director, the Committee reviews relevant market data and considers the Directors experience, performance and responsibilities.
Basic salaries are generally reviewed on an annual basis or following a significant change in responsibilities.
The reporting structure having been further simplied in 2003, no direct successor for S N Vivians former role as Chief Executive of Hanson Building Materials Europe has been appointed, thus reducing the number of Executive Directors from four to three, which results in a lower level of overall Executive Director remuneration.
Annual bonus scheme The annual bonus scheme for the Executive Directors and other senior executives is aligned with changes in shareholder value through the economic value added methodology.
The main principle of economic value added is to recognise that over time a company should generate returns in excess of its operating costs and the cost of capital the return that lenders and shareholders expect of the Company each year.
The annual bonus scheme is calibrated by reference to target levels of bonus.
Each year the participant receives one-third of an accumulated bonus bank, which is updated for the years performance compared to target.
The bonus bank has two main functions: rstly it ensures that individuals do not make short-term decisions such as deferring essential expenditure from one year to the next and receive a bonus for doing so.
Secondly, the bonus bank can help as a retention tool.
The Committee conducted a full review of the annual bonus scheme arrangements for the Executive Directors during 2003 and endorsed the existing arrangements.
For 2003, the target level of bonus for A J Murray was 62.5% of basic salary, for J C Nicholls 50% of basic salary and for G Dranseld 37.5% of basic salary.
The groups overall economic value added performance determined the bonus bank addition for the Executive Directors in 2003 and will also determine the bonus bank addition or deduction for them in 2004.
The bonuses paid in respect of the year to December 31, 2003 to the Executive Directors are set out in the table of Directors remuneration on page 43.
Performance targets under the annual bonus scheme, based on improvements in economic value added, are set by the Committee, after taking advice from Mercer.
Bonuses payable to Executive Directors are not pensionable.
Remuneration report 39 Remuneration report continued Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Executive Directors and certain senior executives and managers from the Companys worldwide operations participate in the LTIP.
Under this plan, participants are conditionally awarded shares in the Company at nil cost with the proportion of those shares which may vest subject to the achievement of performance targets over a performance period set by the Committee.
In 2003 a conditional award of shares was made to A J Murray of 150% of basic salary and to the other Executive Directors of 100% of basic salary.
The conditional awards made in 2003 are subject to performance criteria and the Committee determined that 50% of the conditional award should be subject to the attainment of an economic value added target and 50% to a total shareholder return TSR target.
TSR is the aggregate of share price growth and dividends paid on the assumption that such dividends are reinvested in Hanson shares during the performance period.
The Remuneration Committee selected these performance measurements as it believed they correlate clearly with the creation of shareholder value.
For the conditional award made in 2003, the economic value added target requires an improvement in economic value added over a period of three years based on the results for the year to December 31, 2002.
For this measurement, a linear vesting schedule applies in order that only a small proportion of the award will vest at the minimum performance level with the maximum award vesting only on the achievement of substantial performance improvement.
A similar economic value added target is in place for the awards made in 2001 and 2002.
On attaining the minimum economic value added improvements of 10.6m for the 2001 award, 8.8m for the 2002 award and 13.4m for the 2003 award, 25% of the respective awards, subject to the economic value added measurement criteria, will vest.
100% of the awards subject to this measurement will vest on the attainment of economic value added improvements of 28.4m, 23.4m and 35.6m for the 2001, 2002 and 2003 awards, respectively.
For the TSR measurement in 2003 and similarly for the awards made in 2001 and 2002, the conditional awards made will vest only if Hanson achieves a TSR over the three-year performance period, from the date of the award in March 2003, which is greater than the TSR achieved by at least 50% of the members of a comparator group of international building materials companies at the date of the award the comparator group.
If so 30% of the award will vest.
All of the award will vest if the Company achieves a TSR over the performance period which is greater than that achieved by 80% of the comparator group over the same period.
Between these two points the award will vest in the proportion of 2.33% of the award for each 1% improvement in the Companys ranking.
In 2001, the comparator group consisted of 22 companies, including Hanson.
These included 10 UK building materials companies in the FTSE350 Index Aggregate Industries, BPB, Hanson, Hepworth, Novar, Pilkington, RMC, Travis Perkins, Ultraframe and Wolseley, six European building materials companies in the Euro Top 300 Index CRH, Dyckerhoff, Heidelberger, Holcim, Lafarge and Wienerberger, four US businesses Florida Rock, Martin Marietta, Texas Industries and Vulcan and two Australian building materials companies Boral and CSR.
In 2002 and 2003, Hepworth was removed from the comparator group following takeover.
Additionally, following the demerger of Rinker Group Limited from CSR in March 2003, the performance measurement of the comparator group for the 2001, 2002 and 2003 awards has been modied to incorporate Rinker using the methodology of re-investing a notional holding of CSR shares in Rinker from April 1, 2003 onwards.
There is no retesting of performance under either the economic value added measurement or the TSR measurement.
The table below shows the conditional interests in Hanson shares of Executive Directors relating to awards made under the LTIP in 2001, 2002 and 2003.
For the conditional award made in 2000 for Executive Directors, 100% of the award was subject to a TSR performance measurement criteria for the three-year performance period.
Hansons TSR performance criteria ranked below 50% of the members of the comparator group for the 2000 award and, therefore, none of the shares subject to this award vested.
He retained an entitlement to a proportion based on the period of employment of the conditional shares awarded to him under the LTIP.
The awards outstanding at the date of leaving remained subject to the performance conditions as outlined above.
2 The relevant market price at the time of the conditional award in 2003 was 290.4p per share.
3 During the period January 1, 2004 to February 19, 2004 there was no change in the interests of Executive Directors in the LTIP.
From and including awards made in 2000 under the LTIP, the performance measurement has been the same for all participants.
However, the awards for the operating company participants in prior years were based on cash returns on cash invested, with vesting determined by a proportion one-third of an accumulated bonus bank.
Following the vesting of the 1999 award in 2002, due to the performance of Hanson Building Materials America over the period 1997 to 2000, excess amounts remained in the accumulated bonus banks of some participants, including A J Murray.
The excess in his bonus bank amounted to $709,234, appreciated by any increase in the share price above 349.8p, being the relevant price at the time of the 2000 LTIP award.
Based on a share price of 406.5p on September 22, 2003, the third anniversary of the 2000 LTIP award, A J Murray received a cash payment of $824,196.
Conditional awards under the LTIP will usually be made annually.
In 2004 it is proposed that the conditional award to A J Murray will not exceed 150% of basic salary and for the other Executive Directors will not exceed 100% of basic salary.
Awards vesting under the LTIP are not pensionable.
40 Remuneration report Remuneration report continued Share Option Plan Executive Directors and a selected number of senior executives from the Companys worldwide operations participate in the Share Option Plan.
Under this Plan, participants are granted options over a number of Hanson shares but the proportion of those shares under option which may be exercised is subject to the achievement of performance targets over a three-year performance period set by the Remuneration Committee.
To the extent an option or part of an option becomes capable of being exercised at the end of the three-year performance period it will ordinarily remain exercisable at any time up to 10 years from the date of grant.
The economic value added and TSR performance targets for the conditional options granted to Executive Directors in the years ending December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003 were the same as for the awards made in 2001, 2002 and 2003 under the LTIP, as detailed above, with no retesting.
The conditional options granted to Executive Directors under the Share Option Plan are shown below: Weighted Balance at Granted Lapsed Exercised Balance at average Jan 1, 2003 during year during year during year Dec 31, 2003 exercise price pence A J Murray 232,438 232,438 290.4 G Dranseld see note 1 below 126,242 126,242 467.4 G Dranseld 103,306 103,306 290.4 J C Nicholls see note 1 below 130,574 130,574 467.2 J C Nicholls 127,410 127,410 290.4 S N Vivian see notes 1 and 2 below 124,182 14,898 109,284 467.8 S N Vivian 110,192 61,184 49,008 290.4 Notes 1 In respect of options with exercise prices greater than the market price at December 31, 2003 of 410.25p per ordinary share.
2 S N Vivian left Hanson on June 30, 2003.
He retained an entitlement to a proportion based on the period of employment of the conditional options granted to him under the Share Option Plan.
The grants outstanding at the date of leaving remained subject to performance criteria as outlined above.
To the extent the options become capable of being exercised, these must be exercised within one year of such time or they will lapse.
The balance shown as outstanding at December 31, 2003 is that as at date of leaving.
3 During the period January 1, 2004 to February 19, 2004 there were no changes in the interests of Executive Directors in options under the Share Option Plan.
Under the Black-Scholes option valuation model, on the basis of the Companys three-year share price performance, the value of an option over an ordinary share at the date of grant was equal to approximately 35% of the shares current market value.
On this basis, with no discount to the Black-Scholes value because of the application of performance conditions on exercise, the conditional options granted during 2001, 2002 and 2003 at 100% of basic salary had a Black-Scholes value, at the date of grant, of about 35% of basic salary in each case.
The market price at December 31, 2003 was 410.25p per ordinary share, which compares to the exercise prices of the conditional options granted in 2001, 2002 and 2003 at prices of 473.3p, 461.75p and 290.4p per share respectively.
Grants of conditional options under the Share Option Plan are considered annually in conjunction with the awards to be made under the LTIP.
In 2004 it is proposed that the conditional option grant to A J Murray will not exceed 125% of basic salary and for the other Executive Directors will not exceed 100% of basic salary.
Any gains made under the Share Option Plan are not pensionable.
Executive Share Option Schemes Options to subscribe for Hanson ordinary shares granted to Directors under the Executive Share Option Schemes are shown below.
No performance conditions apply to the right to exercise the options granted and no further grants will be made under these schemes, the last grant having been made to Directors and other participants in December 1995.

3 S N Vivian left Hanson on June 30, 2003.
The outstanding options, which had exercise prices ranging from 412.3p to 482.6p, must be exercised within one year of his leaving or the expiry date of the option, if earlier or they will lapse.
4 Other than as highlighted in note 2 above, during the period January 1, 2004 to February 19, 2004 there were no changes in the interests of Directors in options under the Executive Share Option Schemes.
Any gains made under the Executive Share Option Schemes are not pensionable.
Remuneration report 41 Remuneration report continued Sharesave Scheme Many Hanson employees in the UK have built up an equity interest in the groups business through the UK Inland Revenue approved savings related Sharesave Scheme.
Options may be granted at a discount of up to 20% to the market price at the date of grant.
The term of options granted could be from three to seven years and any option is conditional on a commitment by the participant to make regular savings from pay.
The savings are held by an independent Sharesave provider to buy shares at the end of the option period.
The exercise of options under the Sharesave Scheme can be satisfied by the issue of new shares or the transfer of existing shares.
At December 31, 2003, there were approximately 2,700 participants in the Sharesave Scheme.
The options granted to Executive Directors under the Sharesave Scheme are shown in the table below: Balance Granted Market price Balance Weighted Range of at Jan1, during Lapsed Exercised Exercise at date of at Dec 31, average exercise 2003 year during year during year price exercise 2003 exercise price dates pence pence pence A J Murray 2,971 2,971 318.00 12 05-05 06 G Dranseld 5,702 2,603 265.00 406.375 3,099 318.00 12 07-05 08 J C Nicholls 2,263 2,263 428.00 12 04-05 05 S N Vivian see note 1 below 5,165 4,458 707 318.00 07 03-12 03 Notes 1 In accordance with the rules of the Sharesave Scheme, on leaving Hanson on June 30, 2003, S N Vivian retained an option over 707 shares outlined in the table above.
The option was capable of being exercised for a period of six months following his leaving Hanson.
The balance of his option lapsed on the date he left Hanson.
2 No options were granted under the Sharesave Scheme during the year.
3 During the period January 1, 2004 to February 19, 2004 there were no changes in the interests of Executive Directors in the Sharesave Scheme.
Any gains made under the Sharesave Scheme are not pensionable.
The total gains made by Directors on options exercised or surrendered for cash under the Executive Share Option Schemes, Share Option Plans and the Sharesave Scheme during the year were 3,680 95,936.
The range of the market quotations for Hanson ordinary shares, as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Ofcial List, during the period January 1 to December 31, 2003 was 256.75p to 436.75p.
Performance review The following graph shows the TSR performance of the Company and that of the FTSE Construction & Building Materials Index over the five-year period to December 31, 2003.

Termination payment is limited to the Chairmans annual salary and benets.
The Executive Directors are all employed on rolling service contracts, entered into on March 1, 1999 as subsequently amended, which are terminable at any time by Hanson on giving 52 weeks notice or by the Director giving six months notice.
Termination payments are limited to the Directors normal compensation, including basic salary, annual incentives and benets, for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
Pensionable service will also accrue for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
In the event that Hanson terminates the service contracts the unexpired portion of the notice period will count towards the calculation of entitlements under the Companys LTIP and Share Option Plan: these awards would remain subject to their performance conditions, however.
Apart from the Chairman, no Non-executive Directors have service contracts with Hanson.
Each is appointed at the will of the Company and the Non-executive Director concerned under the terms of an appointment letter.
External appointments The Company acknowledges that its Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-executive Directors of other leading companies and that such non-executive duties can broaden experience and knowledge to the benefit of Hanson.
Executive Directors are limited to one such non-executive position and the policy is that fees may be retained.
Currently no such non-executive positions are held by any of the Executive Directors.
42 Remuneration report Remuneration report continued Pensions The Chairman and the Executive Directors are members of dened benefit plans the pension plans which, in accordance with Inland Revenue limits, provide them with a maximum pension of two-thirds of basic salary on retirement.
The pension plans are contributory, until such time as the Director has completed the maximum pensionable service allowed under the pension plan, to the extent of 5% of pensionable salary which does not include bonuses.
The Executive Directors have a normal retirement age of 60, with the right to receive early retirement pensions to be paid from age 55 in certain circumstances.
The following table gives details for each Executive Director of: the increase in the accrued pension attributable to service since December 31, 2002. the increase in the accrued pension net of ination attributable to service since December 31, 2002. the annual accrued pension payable from normal retirement age, calculated as if he had left service at December 31, 2003. the transfer value of the increase of the accrued pension net of ination and the Directors contributions calculated in accordance with actuarial guidance note GN11.

It is Hansons current policy to provide executives with appropriate benets outside the pension plan in relation to that part of their salary which exceeds the cap.
The contributions made during the year were subject to income tax as a benefit in kind and the Director concerned J C Nicholls was liable to settle the tax liability himself.
3 G Dranseld completed the maximum pensionable service allowed under the pension plan and did not accrue any further pension over the year.
