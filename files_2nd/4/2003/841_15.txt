Directors Remuneration and Related Matters The auditors are required to report on the following information on pages 50 to 52 of the directors remuneration report.
Individual aspects of remuneration were as follows: 2003 2002 iv Salary fee Bonus Benefits in kind Total Total 000 000 000 000 000 i Executive: Sir Peter Mason 628 356 37 1,021 719 J D Early 250 111 17 378 305 D Robson to 31 July 2003 184 75 9 268 391 G E Payne to 31 March 2003 62 5 67 302 J A Monville 298 237 7 542 30 P S Janson to 21 August 2002 696 ii S J Siddall 352 139 22 513 387 iii C A Riva from 1 August 2003 217 164 45 426 Non-executive: S Gillibrand 145 22 167 165 J M Green-Armytage 46 46 35 E P Airey 52 52 50 J A Dallas 43 43 43 M O Hesse 78 78 81 J-P Jacamon from 27 November 2002 38 38 3 Total board 2,393 1,082 164 3,639 3,207 Notes i Sir Peter Masons salary includes a taxable supplement in relation to earnings above the earnings cap for pension purposes of 88,000 2002: 81,000. ii Mr Siddalls salary includes a taxable supplement in relation to earnings above the earnings cap for pension purposes of 42,000 2002: 36,000. iii Mr Rivas salary includes a taxable supplement in relation to earnings above the earnings cap for pension purposes of 29,000 2002: nil.
Mr Rivas bonus includes a guaranteed amount of 84,000 US$150,000 paid in accordance with his employment agreement.
iv The value of benefits in kind received during the year relates principally to the provision of a company car or car allowance, travelling expenses, life assurance and private medical expenses insurance.
Unemployment insurance is also made available to Mr Monville in accordance with French practice and certain relocation expenses have been reimbursed to Mr Riva.
None of these benefits are pensionable.
ii Mr G E Paynes savings related option over 3,942 shares at 230p lapsed upon his retirement on 31 March 2003. iii The terms and conditions of the Option Schemes have not been varied during the year.
All awards were at nil cost.
iv Certain of the options were capable of being exercised on 31 December 2003 as all performance conditions had been met.
If the options had been exercised on that date the approximate gain before appropriate taxes for each of the current directors would have been: Sir Peter Mason, 1,490,000: Mr Early, 58,000 and Mr Siddall, 44,500.
Had the remainder of the options been capable of being exercised and vested in full on 31 December 2003, the approximate latent gain before appropriate taxes for each of the current directors would have been: Sir Peter Mason, 90,000: Mr Early, 44,000 and Mr Siddall, 49,500.
These hypothetical figures assume that all performance conditions will be fully met, which may not in practice transpire.
The Performance Share Plan 2002 the PSP was approved by shareholders in 2002.
The PSP replaced the Long-Term Incentive Plan the Plan which was introduced in 1998.
The design of the PSP took account of the provisions of Schedule A to the Combined Code.
ii For the awards made in April 2000, AMEC met the earnings per share growth requirement but failed to meet the total shareholder return requirement and, therefore, the awards lapsed in April 2003. iii The terms and conditions of the PSP and the Plan have not been varied during the year.
iv The closing price of the shares at 31 December 2003 was 260.00 pence 2002: 143.25 pence.
v The range of the closing prices for the shares during the year was 143.25 pence to 289.00 pence.
vi The register of directors interests, which is open to inspection at the companys registered office, contains full details of directors shareholdings, share options and awards under the PSP and the Plan.
vii Had the above restricted shares been vested in full on 31 December 2003, the approximate latent value before appropriate taxes for each of the current directors would have been: Sir Peter Mason, 961,500: Mr Early, 459,000: Mr Siddall, 493,000: Mr Monville, 349,000 and Mr Riva, 436,000.

ii Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with version 1.5 of guidance note GN11 issued by the actuarial profession.
iii The value of net increase b represents the incremental value to the director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption service terminated at the year-end.
It is based on the accrued pension increase a after deducting the directors contribution.
The change in the transfer value is shown as a negative amount for Mr D Robson and for Mr G E Payne.
This reflects the fact that, over the course of the year, the value of the pension payable has in fact reduced.
In each case, the member could have taken an unreduced pension on early retirement at 1 January 2003.
A pension payable for an individual at any particular age is more valuable than that payable for the same individual assuming it starts one year later.
iv The change in the transfer value c includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the company and directors, such as stockmarket movements.
It is calculated after deducting the directors contribution.
v Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
Mr J A Monville is a member of the SPIE top-up pension scheme for senior executives.
Although the scheme, arranged through an insurance company, is a defined benefit scheme it is not possible to disclose his pension benefits in the above format.
A pension is payable by SPIE only in the event of Mr Monville reaching his normal retirement age of 65 or, following the attainment of age 60, by agreement with AMEC.
No pension is due or payable in other circumstances and Mr Monville currently has no accrued right to a pension payment.
His pension at the normal retirement age, or as agreed by AMEC, would be based on the average of his last three years base salary and bonus, up to a maximum of 20 per cent of this figure.
As at 31 December 2003, this would equate to 94,000 1134,000 per annum.
It is not possible to attribute a value to the accrued funds as these are not separately identified by the insurance company.
