WB RA f ckd 2003 40 52 26 2 04 12:12 pm Page 45 Directors remuneration report Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance the Code relating to Executive Directors remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to consider and approve the report will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Companys members on the auditable part of the Directors remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for unaudited and audited information.
Unaudited information Remuneration Committee Composition and advisors Three independent Non-Executive Directors, Mr D E Brill, Mr P J Byrom and Dr A D Portno, comprise the Boards Remuneration Committee.
Dr A D Portno is the senior Non-Executive Director and Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
There have been no changes in the composition or chairmanship of the Remuneration Committee during the year.
The Remuneration Committee operates within agreed terms of reference, setting out its role and the authority delegated by the Board.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the overall remuneration policy in relation to pay, incentives and benefits of the Executive Directors and the Chairman of the Company and for ensuring the appropriate implementation of that policy.
In addition, the Committee makes recommendations on and monitors the remuneration of the Directors of the principal subsidiary companies and monitors the remuneration policy of the first level of management below these Boards.
The Remuneration Committee meets regularly and also periodically instructs external consultants to review the Executive Directors remuneration and the structure of the Companys share incentive schemes.
This review includes a comparison of the Directors remuneration with the remuneration of Directors in other companies of a similar size within the sector.
These reviews are undertaken every three years and the next review will take place in 2004.
The last review, undertaken in September 2001 by Monks Partnership, concluded that the remuneration of the Directors was at an appropriately competitive level and consistent with the Companys overall remuneration policy.
Since the last review, the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the overall remuneration policy remains appropriate.
The following persons provided advice or services that materially assisted the Remuneration Committee in its consideration of Directors remuneration matters during the year: Internal support was provided to the Remuneration Committee by the Group Finance Director, Mr G M Brown, who acts as the Committees Secretary: The Group Human Resources Director, Mr G A Headley, has provided information to the Remuneration Committee on relative pay both within the Wilson Bowden Group and in other organisations, particularly with regard to those sectors in which the Group operates: Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, the Companys main legal advisers, have been appointed by the Remuneration Committee to advise on compliance with the Regulations and the Code: and Towers Perrin have been retained by the Remuneration Committee to provide advice on specific matters in relation to Executive Directors remuneration.
Compliance The Company has complied with the Codes provisions relating to Directors remuneration throughout the year.
Remuneration policy General The Companys remuneration policy is designed to provide competitive packages to attract, retain and motivate highly talented and able executives consistent with the nature, scale and complexity of the Groups operations.
It is necessary to provide reward schemes that are fully competitive and offer sufficient incentive to secure and retain the services of knowledgeable individuals who have demonstrated a high level of ability and commitment, along with a high level of future potential.
To ensure the successful growth and development of the Group and maximise shareholder value, the highest levels of reward are targeted against the delivery of outstanding personal and corporate performance both in the short and long-term.
No Director is involved in deciding his own remuneration.
45 Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Directors remuneration report WB RA f ckd 2003 40 52 26 2 04 12:12 pm Page 46 Directors remuneration report continued This report sets out the Companys remuneration policy for 2004 and, so far as practicable, for subsequent years.
The inclusion in the report of remuneration policy in respect of years after 2004 is required by the Regulations.
The Remuneration Committee is able to state its remuneration policy for 2004 with reasonable certainty, and this policy will continue unless changed by the Remuneration Committee in subsequent years.
The Remuneration Committee considers that a successful remuneration policy needs to be sufficiently flexible to take account of future changes in the Companys business environment and in remuneration practice.
Any changes to policy for years after 2004 will be described in future Directors remuneration reports, which will continue to be subject to shareholder approval.
The remuneration of the Executive Directors comprises four main elements: Basic annual salary and benefits in kind: Annual performance related bonus, which cannot exceed a specified percentage of salary: Share incentive plans: and Pension arrangements.
It is Company policy that a significant proportion of the remuneration of the Executive Directors should be performance related.
Basic salary and benefits Salaries are normally reviewed annually, on 1st October, or when responsibilities change.
In deciding the appropriate levels, the Remuneration Committee takes into account the external advice it has received and the level of reward provided to comparable executives elsewhere in the sector, as well as the overall pay structure within the Wilson Bowden Group.
In relation to benefits, each Executive Director is provided with an appropriate fully expensed motor car and health care benefits.
In addition to their responsibilities to the Group, Mr N H Richardson is a Director of Derby Cityscape Limited, a Government sponsored urban regeneration company, and Mr N J Townsend is Chairman of Leicester Shire Economic Partnership and a Director of Leicester Regeneration Company Limited.
No fees or other remuneration is received in respect of these external directorships.

The percentage of salary payable as bonus in 2004, is dependent upon the achievement of the performance criteria set out in the table above.
For first 5% of profit before tax in excess of budget, additional bonus amounting to 1% of salary for every 1% by which profit before tax exceeds budget is payable.
For the next 5% by which profit before tax exceeds budget further bonus equivalent to 2% of salary for every 1% of additional profit is earned.
Maximum bonus is only earned on the delivery of all personal objectives and if profit before tax exceeds budget by 10%.
Demanding budgets and targets are established by the Board and reviewed at the end of each year to determine the degree of successful achievement.
The Board has selected these performance measures because they are directly related to the delivery of the Companys strategy and business plan and to achievement of personal and corporate objectives.
Personal business objectives are agreed between the Group Chairman and Chief Executive and each of the Executive Directors at the beginning of each year.
The level of achievement and delivery is measured at the end of the year and confirmed by the Remuneration Committee.
WB RA f ckd 2003 40 52 26 2 04 12:12 pm Page 47 Share incentive schemes Mr N H Richardson, Mr I Robertson, Mr M J Stansfield, Mr N J Townsend and Mr G M Brown all participate in the share incentive schemes listed below.
The performance conditions attached to these incentive plans, the reasons for selecting them and the methods of measuring whether they have been met and why those methods have been chosen are set out below: The Wilson Bowden plc Senior Executive Share Option Scheme WBSESOS Shareholders originally approved the WBSESOS at the 2000 Annual General Meeting.
It was amended at the 2002 Annual General Meeting.
Options are granted under the WBSESOS to each of the Companys Executive Directors, except Mr D W Wilson, and senior management who contribute directly to the successful strategic direction and operational management of the Group.
The performance condition relative to the exercise of options granted prior to 17th April 2002, is that the growth in earnings per share shown in the audited consolidated accounts of the Group for any consecutive period of three years, starting with the financial year commencing immediately before the date of grant must exceed the increase in the Retail Price Index all items over the same period by 3% per annum.
The performance condition relative to the exercise of options granted after 17th April 2002, is that the growth in earnings per share in the audited consolidated accounts of the Group for any consecutive periods of three, four or five years, starting with the financial year commencing immediately before the date of grant: i. must exceed the increase in the Retail Price Index all items over the same period by 3% per annum in respect of awards in any one year, the value of which does not exceed the basic annual salary of the executive: and ii.
must exceed the increase in the Retail Price Index all items over the same period by 5% per annum in respect of awards in any one year, the value of which exceeds one times basic annual salary of the executive.
The value of options granted under the WBSESOS is limited to a maximum of four times annual salary.
The reasons for selecting earnings per share as a measure of performance are that it directly reflects operational performance and is also a significant factor in determining the markets view of the Companys value.
The real growth targets of 3% and 5% respectively referred to above are considered to be appropriate levels of achievement based on current market practice and advice from the external consultants who assisted in the design of the WBSESOS.
The Remuneration Committee determines whether performance criteria have been satisfied based on calculations performed internally and may request the Companys auditors to report on whether the calculations, and any adjustments required under scheme rules, have been performed correctly.
The Wilson Bowden plc Performance Share Plan PSP Shareholders approved the PSP at the 2002 Annual General Meeting.
Awards under the PSP are made to each of the Companys Executive Directors, except Mr D W Wilson, and a small number of other senior executives who contribute directly to the successful performance of the Group.
The value of shares subject to awards under the plan may not exceed 100% of annual salary.

Upon becoming entitled to receive shares following the third anniversary of the start date: 60% of shares vest to the executive immediately: 11.5% on the fourth anniversary: 12.5% on the fifth anniversary: and 16% on the sixth anniversary.
The reasons for selecting earnings per share as the measure of performance are set out above under the WBSESOS and apply similarly to the PSP.
The Wilson Bowden plc Bonus Share Matching Plan BSMS Shareholders originally approved the BSMS at the 1999 Annual General Meeting.
Under the BSMS, participating directors are required to surrender a proportion of their annual performance related bonus, which is invested in ordinary shares in the Company in quarterly tranches over a three year period.
At the end of the three year period the shares are released to the participants, together with a number of matching shares provided corporate performance targets have been met.
47 Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Directors remuneration report WB RA f ckd 2003 40 52 26 2 04 12:12 pm Page 48 Directors remuneration report continued On the third anniversary of the award, participants are entitled to receive matching shares equal to the number of shares acquired with their surrendered bonus, if at the end of that period the Companys Total Shareholder Return compared with that for the Comparator Group of companies is at or above the median.
The Comparator Group of companies comprises: Barratt Developments PLC Bellway Plc Berkeley Group plc Bovis Homes Group PLC Countryside Properties PLC Crest Nicholson PLC Persimmon PLC Redrow plc Westbury plc George Wimpey Plc If awards under the BSMS are retained until the fifth anniversary, participants who have retained some or all of their shares, become entitled to a retention award equivalent to 5% of the number of shares retained at the fifth anniversary.
This performance test was chosen as Total Shareholder Return aligns management performance with shareholders interests.
The Remuneration Committee determines whether performance criteria have been satisfied based on reports from HSBC Corporate Finance, the Companys corporate broker, and may request the Companys auditors to report on whether the calculations, and any adjustments required under scheme rules, have been correctly performed.
The Remuneration Committee determined in 2001 that no new awards would be made under the BSMS.
Wilson Bowden Executive Share Option Scheme WBESOS Options were granted under the WBESOS between March 1987 and March 1994.
No options were outstanding under the WBESOS at 31st December 2003 and the scheme is now closed.
There was no requirement for performance criteria when the WBESOS was established and this scheme has been replaced by the WBSESOS.
Wilson Bowden plc 2003 Savings Related Share Option Scheme WBSRSOS The WBSRSOS was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 30th April 2003.
Under the WBSRSOS, participants are required to make monthly contributions to an approved savings authority under a contractual savings scheme for a period of three or five years.
On entering into the savings contract participants are granted an option to acquire 10p ordinary shares in the Company at a discount, of no more than 20%, to the middle market price of the Companys shares, immediately prior to the date of grant.
The exercise of options under the WBSRSOS is not subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition as the WBSRSOS is Inland Revenue approved and open to all eligible employees.
On 11th June 2003, the Company granted options to employees under the WBSRSOS over 300,570 ordinary shares at a price of 811 pence per share, equivalent to a discount of 10% to middle market price.

Pensions All the Executive Directors, except Mr D W Wilson, are members of the Wilson Bowden plc Directors Pension Scheme, a defined contribution scheme.
Annual performance related bonuses as described on page 46 form an integral part of the Companys remuneration policy and each year one half of bonuses paid to Executive Directors are subject to contributions by the Company to the money purchase pension arrangements maintained for the Directors.
The Company has established a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme the FURBS to provide, at the Companys discretion, additional Directors pension benefits equivalent to the effect of the restriction on their pension contributions caused by the limitation of the Inland Revenue earnings cap.
These methods of reward are in accordance with competitive market practice within the housebuilding and property development sectors and demonstrate the purpose of the remuneration policy to retain the services of high quality directors and motivate them to greater success in a highly competitive market.
WB RA f ckd 2003 40 52 26 2 04 12:12 pm Page 49 Executive Directors service contracts The Companys policy on the Executive Directors service agreements is that Executive Directors service, and the Companys period of notice thereunder, will not exceed a period of one year.
