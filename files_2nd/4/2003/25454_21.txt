Annual Report 2003 185 directors remuneration report Statement from the Chairman of the Board Remuneration Committee The remuneration report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee referred to in this section as the Committee and has been approved by the Board of Directors.
The board believes that a properly constituted and effective Remuneration Committee is key to improving the linkage between directors pay and performance, with the ultimate aim of enhancing the groups competitiveness.
The primary purpose of the Committee is to determine the groups policy on the remuneration of executive directors and the specific remuneration packages for each executive director.
The Committee is made up exclusively of non-executive directors, and executive directors are not involved in determining their own remuneration packages.
This report describes the groups current remuneration policy and details the directors remuneration for the 2003 financial year.
The report is intended to comply with the provisions of the London Combined Code, the UK Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, the UK Financial Services Authority Listing Rules, the South African King II Code of Corporate Practice and Conduct and the JSE Securities Exchange South Africa JSE Listing Rules.
In addition, the board recognises that the proposals made in the Higgs Review on non-executive directors may be incorporated into the revised London Combined Code and, where relevant, changes may be made to comply with the possible new code provisions once they have been finalised.
Furthermore, the auditors are of the opinion that the auditable part of this report on pages 195 to 203. has been properly prepared, in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
John Abell Chairman, Board Remuneration Committee 186 Annual Report 2003 Composition and role of the Committee In terms of the implementation of Investecs Dual Listed Companies DLC structure, the committees of the board were reconstituted.
The current members of the reconstituted Remuneration Committee are John Abell Chairman, George Alford, Sir Chips Keswick and Peter Thomas.
The Committee members are independent nonexecutive directors and are free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
The Committees principal responsibilities and objectives are to: Make recommendations to the board, within agreed terms of reference, on the groups framework of executive remuneration, and to determine on their behalf specific remuneration packages for executive directors.
Ensure that executive directors are appropriately and fairly remunerated and incentivised for their contribution to the groups performance, taking into account both qualitative and quantitative factors.
Review comparable companies remuneration practices.
This is to ensure that competitive reward strategies and programmes are in place, which will attract and retain qualified and experienced management and executives necessary to meet the groups objectives and safeguard shareholder interests.
Administer and establish performance targets for Investecs employee share schemes.
Ensure that the comments, recommendations and rules within South Africa and the UK pertaining to directors remuneration are given due regard, in determining the packages and arrangements of executive directors.
The Committee is authorised by the board to seek any information it requires from any employee of the group in order to perform its duties.
The Committee meets at least three times a year and, since July 2002, has met on four occasions.
All members attended the meetings.
The Company Secretary of Investec plc, Richard Vardy, acted as Secretary to the Committee.
Advisers to the Committee Where appropriate, the Committee has access to independent executive remuneration consultants.
The selection of the advisers is at the discretion of the Committee Chairman, and the group bears any expenses relating to appointment of external consultants.
During the financial year, the Committee engaged the services of Sibson Consulting, which provided comparative remuneration data and recommendations on various components of executive remuneration packages.
Sibson Consulting has also advised the group on other human resource issues such as employee rewards and long-term incentivisation.
Annual Report 2003 187 Group Human Resources also provides advice to the Committee.
The Human Resources division is a specialist function within the group and provides supporting information and documentation relating to matters that are presented to the Committee.
This includes comparative data and motivations for proposed salary, bonus and share awards.
The Head of the groups Human Resources division, Patsy McCue, is not a board director and is not appointed by the Committee.
While the Chief Executive Officer has the right to address any meeting of the Committee, he plays no role in the determination of his remuneration package or any other executive directors remuneration package.
Policy on executive directors remuneration The groups philosophy is to employ the highest calibre individuals, who are characterised by integrity, intellect and innovation.
Investec strives to inspire entrepreneurship within all areas of the group by providing a working environment that stimulates extraordinary performance, so that executive directors may be positive contributors to the group, its clients and their communities.
Investec rewards executive directors as individuals for the value they add through payment of an industry competitive annual package, a variable performance reward and ownership in the form of share incentive scheme participation.
Overall rewards, however, are considered secondary in importance to Investecs core values of work content greater scope of responsibility, variety of work and high level of challenge and work affiliation entrepreneurial feel to company and unique culture in the attraction, retention and motivation of employees.
Investec has a strong entrepreneurial, merit and values-based culture, characterised by a high degree of passion, energy and stamina.
The ability to live and perpetuate the stated values, culture and philosophies of the group in the pursuit of excellence is considered paramount in determining overall reward levels.
These values clearly apply in the case of the executive directors.
Both the type of people the organisation attracts, and the culture and environment within which they work, remain crucial elements in determining the success and long-term progress of Investec.
The key principles of Investecs overall remuneration policy for executive directors, which was applied during the financial year, are as follows: Reward programmes are designed and administered to align directors interests with those of the groups stakeholders.
Reward programmes are clear and transparent, in order to retain individual interest in, and identification with, the shortand long-term success of Investec.
A significant proportion of rewards, including both annual and long-term incentive components, are explicitly linked to the performance of the business and the individual business units.
Investec recognises the performance of the business and the individual.
As indicated above, however, both qualitative and quantitative issues form an integral part in the determination of reward levels.
Reward levels are targeted to be commercially competitive.
The most relevant competitive reference points for reward levels are based on the scope of responsibility and individual contribution made.
Appropriate benchmark, industry and comparable organisations remuneration practices are reviewed regularly.
188 Annual Report 2003 - For executive directors, the FTSE UK Speciality and Other Finance firms provide the most appropriate benchmark.
- In order to avoid disproportionate packages across areas of the group and between executives, adjustments are made at any extremes to ensure broad internal group consistencies.
Adjustments may also be made to the competitive positioning of pay components for individuals in cases where a higher level of investment is needed in order to build or grow either a business unit or the groups capability in a geography.
The Committee determines the overall remuneration package for the executive directors.
The reward strategy is open to internal as well as external scrutiny and challenge, and reward programmes are communicated to executive directors.
At the time of writing this report, the Committees intentions were to apply the same philosophies and principles in the determination of the executive directors reward packages for the 2004 financial year and subsequent financial years.
These philosophies and principles however, are subject to appropriate review.
Policy on non-executive directors remuneration The policy on the remuneration packages for non-executive directors is agreed and determined by the board as a whole.
During the financial year, the Committee conducted a peer group review in order to determine the appropriate level for non-executive directors packages.
At the time of implementing the DLC structure, it was agreed that non-executive directors with the exception of the Chairman will be paid a basic retainer of 30 000 for their services as directors.
Following the peer group review, however, this amount has been increased to 35 000 for the 2004 financial year.
Additional fees are payable for chairing or being a member of certain audit or remuneration and nomination committees and subsidiary boards due to additional responsibilities.
Fees are also payable for attendance at other sub-committee meetings.
During the 2003 financial year, the Chairman was paid a total package of 186 311 for his services as a director.
Based on the information gathered during the peer group review, the Committee has agreed that from the 2004 financial year, the Chairman will receive an overall fee of 250 000 for his services as a director.
Service contracts and terms of employment The executive directors of the group have indefinite contracts of employment, terminable by either party giving six months written notice to the other.
Each executive director is entitled to receive a basic salary and is also eligible for an annual bonus, the amount of which will be determined at the discretion of the Committee.
Furthermore, the executive directors may elect to sacrifice a portion of their annual salary to receive company benefits such as a travel allowance and medical aid.
The full costs of these benefits will be deducted from their annual salary.
The contracts of employment do not contain provisions for compensation payable on early termination.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts and letters of appointment confirm the terms and conditions of their service.
Unless the non-executive directors resign earlier or are removed from their positions, they will be appointed as directors until the close of the groups annual general meeting Annual Report 2003 189 AGM in 2005 subject to re-election as directors at that AGM and in terms of the provisions of the Articles of Association.
Dates of appointment to the board The boards of Investec plc and Investec Limited are separate and subject to separate legal obligations to each respective company and comprise the same persons who are authorised, as boards, to manage Investec as if it were a unified economic enterprise.
The directors of Investec plc, and the dates on which they were appointed to the board are set out in the table below: Name Date of appointment Notice period Executive directors S. Koseff Chief Executive Officer 26 June 2002 6 months B. Kantor Managing Director 26 June 2002 6 months G. R. Burger Group Risk and Finance Director 3 July 2002 6 months A. Tapnack 1 July 2002 6 months Non-executive directors H. S. Herman Chairman 26 June 2002 J. Abell 19 March 2002 S. E. Abrahams 26 June 2002 G. Alford 26 June 2002 D. E. Jowell 26 June 2002 I. R. Kantor 26 June 2002 Sir C. Keswick 26 June 2002 P. Malungani 26 June 2002 P. R. S. Thomas 26 June 2002 The directors of Investec Limited, and the dates on which they were appointed to the board are set out in the table below: Name Date of appointment Notice period Executive directors S. Koseff Chief Executive Officer 6 October 1986 6 months B. Kantor Managing Director 8 June 1987 6 months G. R. Burger Group Risk and Finance Director 3 July 2002 6 months A.

Thomas 29 June 1981 190 Annual Report 2003 Note: The board of Investec Group Limited now Investec Limited was reconstituted in terms of the implementation of the groups DLC structure.
In terms of providing information on the date that directors have been appointed to the Investec Limited board, it would be misleading, in the case of those directors that had been members of the Investec Group Limited board to indicate that they have only been directors since the date of implementing the groups DLC structure.
As a result, for those directors concerned, their dates of appointment reflect the date that they were first appointed to the Investec Group Limited board.
Furthermore, it was announced on 20 June 2003 that Mr. Geoffrey M. T. Howe, previously a Managing Partner of solicitors Clifford Chance LLP and Managing Director of Robert Fleming Holdings Limited and Miss Haruko Fukuda OBE, previously Chief Executive of the World Gold Council, will be appointed as independent non-executive directors to the boards of Investec Limited and Investec plc with effect from 21 July 2003.
Biographical details of the directors of the board These details can be found on pages 209 to 211 of the Annual Report.
Policies on the components of remuneration and employment The reward package for executive directors comprises: Base salary and benefits.
The Committee reviews the elements of the reward package relative to appropriate benchmarks and other comparable organisations, the value of individuals in perpetuating the values, culture and the possible replacement cost of such individuals.
The elements of the reward package, as listed above, are discussed below and the component parts for each director are detailed in tables accompanying this report.
Base salary and benefits Salaries are reviewed annually and reflect the relative skills and experience of, and contribution made by, the individual.
Base pay levels are linked to the relevant competitive market at median levels.
Benefits provide long-term financial value based on continuous employment and are targeted at competitive levels.
These are delivered through flexible and tailored packages.
Benefits include pension schemes: life, disability and personal accident insurance: medical cover: and other benefits, as dictated by competitive local market practices.
Annual bonus Annual bonuses are linked to business performance, based on target business unit performance goals.
Individual annual incentive levels are allocated, based on individual performance, as determined by the Committee.
Furthermore, as discussed previously, qualitative issues are integral in the determination of annual bonuses.
Annual Report 2003 191 The total cash element of compensation base salary plus annual bonus is targeted at competitive levels for meeting target performance goals.
Long-term share incentive plans The group has a number of share incentive plans that are designed to link the interests of the directors and employees with shareholders and long-term organisational interests through performance and riskbased equity grants.
The share plan vehicles in operation, and in which the directors are eligible to participate, are outlined below.
Further details on the directors shareholdings are provided in tables accompanying this report.
Investec plc share option plan 2002 approved and unapproved Allocations under this scheme are granted to all new full-time employees and, on a discretionary basis, certain other employees, including directors and executives, in the group in all jurisdictions, excluding South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Mauritius.
Under this scheme options are granted, over Investec plc shares, at the prevailing market value and each tranche of the options may only be exercised if the Committee is satisfied that the relevant performance conditions have been met.
These conditions require growth in headline earnings per share over the relevant option period to equal or exceed the UK Retail Price Index RPI, plus 3% compounded annually over the same period.
In choosing the performance targets for this plan, the Committee considered the merits of earnings per share EPS based targets as against alternative possibilities, such as comparative performance or comparative growth in return on average shareholders funds ROE against a basket of other companies.
The Committee determined that EPS was the most appropriate criterion, as the groups mix of businesses and geographical profile made it difficult to establish one suitable basket of comparative businesses, and growth in ROE would be difficult to benchmark against other companies as there is no industry-specific standard on the way in which this return should be calculated, as a result of the treatment of certain balance sheet items such as goodwill.
The Committee believes that EPS-based targets are appropriate as they measure the underlying growth of the group.
The Committee intends to continue to apply this during 2004, but keeps the whole matter of the suitability of target-linked sharebased remuneration under periodic review.
Grants up to the value of 30,000 are made to UK employees on the approved plan.
Options exceeding 30,000 and grants in jurisdictions other than the UK are made on the unapproved plan.
Under the approved plan options vest in tranches of 20%, 30% and 50% at the third, sixth and ninth anniversary of the grant respectively.
Any portion of the tranches that is not, or cannot, be exercised lapses on expiry of 90 days after each anniversary.
The options in terms of the unapproved plan become exercisable in tranches of 25% each on the second, third, fourth and fifth anniversary of the grant respectively.
They similarly lapse 90 days after each anniversary if the options are not, or cannot, be exercised.
Investec plc share appreciation option plan 2002 Under this scheme options are granted which, when exercised, pay out a cash amount based on the increase in the Investec Limited share price.
This scheme is used to achieve the same objectives as the unapproved plan in circumstances in which the regulatory authorities of the previous plan, or of the 192 Annual Report 2003 country in which the intended participant is resident, or the individual or corporate taxation consequences of such participation, make participation in the previous scheme impossible or inadvisable.
It is thus a scheme which, by duplicating the provisions of the previous scheme, enables the group to place a proposed participant in the same position by way of cash settlement or otherwise, as he would have been had he participated in the unapproved plan.
Investec Group Limited UK share option plan Prior to listing on the LSE on 29 July 2002, the group operated this plan in terms of which options over the then listed Investec Group Limited shares were granted to employees, directors and executives in all jurisdictions, excluding South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Mauritius.
The options were exercisable in tranches of 25% each on the second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant.
Performance conditions were not attached, as at the time this was not deemed appropriate, and the options did not lapse until the 10th anniversary of the grant.
Participants have ongoing rights in terms of the plan, on which the most recent grant was made on 20 June 2002.
No further options will be granted under this plan.
Investec Limited security purchase and option scheme trust 2002 Allocations under the option scheme of this trust are granted to all new full-time employees and, on a discretionary basis, certain other employees, including directors and executives, in the group in South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Mauritius.
Since listing on the LSE on 29 July 2002, only one grant has been made in terms of the option scheme.
This grant was made on 20 December 2002.
As with the UK scheme above, options are granted at the prevailing market value and each tranche may only be exercised if the Committee is satisfied that the performance conditions have been met.
These conditions require growth in headline earnings per share over the relevant performance period to equal or exceed the UK RPI, plus 3% compounded annually over the same period.
The reasons for adopting and EPS-based target, is the same as those outlined above.
Subject to this performance condition being met, options become exercisable in tranches of 25% each on the second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant and will lapse 90 days after each such anniversary if the options are not, or cannot, be exercised.
Prior to listing on the LSE, an offer of shares in terms of the purchase scheme was made, for which participants have a liability to the trust for the purchase consideration of the shares.
They bear the risk for any potential loss in the market value of the underlying shares but are entitled to any rise in such market value after the offer becomes exercisable.
As with the option scheme, the purchase offers become exercisable in tranches of 25% each on the second, third, fourth and fifth anniversary of the effective date of acceptance of the offer, but none of the tranches lapses until the 10th anniversary of the acceptance of the offer.
At this anniversary date, the entire offer lapses.
Performance conditions were not applied to these shares as at the time this was not deemed appropriate.
Investec Limited security purchase and option scheme trust.
Investec Limited security purchase and option scheme trust Prior to listing on the LSE on 29 July 2002, the group operated the scheme in terms of which options were granted to, and offers of shares under the purchase scheme were accepted by, employees, directors and executives in South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Mauritius.
Annual Report 2003 193 The options and purchase allocations were exercisable in tranches of 25% each on the second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant.
Performance conditions were not attached as at the time this was not deemed appropriate, and neither the options nor the purchase scheme allocations lapse until the 10th anniversary of the grant or effective date of the offer respectively.
The participants in the purchase scheme bear the risk for any potential loss in the market value of the underlying shares, but are entitled to any rise in such market value after the offer becomes exercisable.
No further options or offers of purchase allocations will be made under this plan.
Leveraged equity plans A small group of senior and executive management, including certain Investec Limited Investec plc directors, who have or can have a significant impact on the business, have been granted participation in leveraged equity plans known as Fintique II and Fintique III.
In terms of these plans, participants acquired units that entitled them to the risks and, on maturity of the plans in 2004 and 2008, future benefits of ownership of the underlying Investec shares.
Recent downward movements in Investecs share price, coupled with the leveraged structure of the plans, have had a major negative effect on the value of these participations.
Participants in the schemes bear the risk of a potential liability on maturity of the schemes.
In view of the nature of the participation there are no further performance conditions applicable to these plans.
Performance graph Investec is an international specialist banking group that provides a diverse range of financial products and services to a niche client base in two principal markets, the UK and South Africa, as well as in certain other geographies, including Australia and Israel.
The group is not considered to be a purely commercial bank and focuses on the following four core areas of activity: Private Client Activities, Treasury and Specialised Finance, Investment Banking and Asset Management.
The group has implemented a DLC structure in terms of which it has primary listings both in Johannesburg and London further information on the DLC structure is provided on pages 4 to 6.
The listing on the LSE took place on 29 July 2002, although the group has been listed in South Africa since 1986.
The market price of the groups shares on the JSE was R76.50 at 31 March 2003, ranging from a low of R76.50 to a high of R174.40 during the financial year.
Furthermore, the market price of the groups shares on the LSE was 6.15 at 31 March 2003, ranging from a low of 6.07 to a high of 9.60 from July 2002 to the end of the financial year.
Investec has found it difficult to find an appropriate group of companies to benchmark itself against because of its specialist range of activities.
A number of companies within the FTSE Speciality and Other Finance Index conduct similar activities to Investec, although they do not necessarily have the same geographical profile, nevertheless the group believes that this is the most appropriate index against which to measure its performance on the LSE.
Selection of an appropriate index against which to measure the groups performance on the JSE is more difficult.
None of the companies within the financial sector could be considered direct comparisons as they are generally commercial banks, asset 194 Annual Report 2003 management or insurance companies.
The group, however, still considers the JSE Financial 15 Index a more appropriate benchmark than the JSE Top 40 Index.
The graphs below show the cumulative shareholder return for a holding of the groups shares in blue, firstly in Sterling on the LSE, compared to the average total shareholder return of other members of the FTSE Speciality and Other Finance Index and secondly in Rands on the JSE compared to other members of the JSE Financial 15 Index.
The information for Investec plc is only available from the end of July last year, when it was listed on the LSE.
The graph that indicates Investec plcs performance relative to the FTSE Speciality and Other Finance Index is included in terms of the requirements of the UK Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
However, since there is no five-year history of Investec plcs share price performance, the graph on Investec Limiteds performance on the JSE has been included in order to provide stakeholders with a more complete picture.

This is largely as a result of the weak global equity markets, which have negatively impacted the performance of investment banks relative to other commercial banks and financial institutions.
As a result, there may not be comparative information for some of the directors.
2 As discussed elsewhere in this report, the non-executive directors remuneration comprises a basic retainer and other directors fees.
S. E. Abrahams, D. E. Jowell and P. R. S. Thomas received fees for attendance on other board sub-committees of 35 582, 99 010 and 34 035 respectively.
The basic retainer and other directors fees paid have been apportioned according to the period served as directors during the financial year.
2 Following the peer group review undertaken during the course of the year, the Remuneration Committee considered it appropriate to adjust the salaries of the executive directors where necessary to reflect the base pay levels of the relevant competitive market at median levels.
3 A breakdown of the components of the reward packages for the executive directors in the 2002 financial year is as follows: Salaries, directors fees Total and other Annual Other remuneration 4 5 remuneration bonus benefits expense Name Executive directors S.

The past year has been an extremely challenging one for the group, and generally for all investment banks and the investment management industry world-wide.
Notwithstanding, the group made significant strategic advances, the most important of which are as follows: The implementation of the groups DLC structure - a process that lasted approximately four years.
The group successfully adjusted its cost base to compensate for the decline in revenues and streamlined and rationalised many of its operations, particularly in the US and UK.
The group continued to restructure and rationalise the life assurance activities acquired from Fedsure Holdings Limited, including implementation of two further transactions.
The group is satisfied that the Fedsure acquisition has now been completed.
The Australian business was successfully turned around from successive years of losses and showed a pre-tax profit of 6.0 million.
A significant step was made in the groups empowerment strategy in South Africa.
The executive directors played an integral role in the achievement of these initiatives.
Furthermore, from a qualitative point of view, the directors continue to play an important role in entrenching the culture, values and philosophies of the group.
Annual Report 2003 197 Notes continued : 5 The Chairman and the executive directors receive other benefits which may include pension schemes: life, disability and personal accident insurance: and medical cover, on similar terms to other senior executives.
6 In line with recommended market practice, it was decided not to pay the Chairman an annual incentive payment during the 2003 financial year.
The Chairmans annual fee was accordingly adjusted, although his overall package is substantially less than the previous year.
As indicated in this report, the Committee has agreed that the Chairman will receive an overall fee of 250 000 during the 2004 financial year for his services as director.
7 Resigned with effect from 26 June 2002.
In terms of the implementation of the DLC structure, the board and board committees of Investec Group Limited now Investec Limited were reconstituted.
Retirement benefits None of the executive directors belong to a defined benefit pension scheme and all are members of one of the groups defined contribution schemes.
The total contribution to these schemes, payable by the company, included in the total salary of the director or included in benefits paid as highlighted in the table above, is as follows: Name Executive directors S.
