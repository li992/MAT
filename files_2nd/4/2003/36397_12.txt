Directors Remuneration Report Remuneration Committee and Advisors The Remuneration Committee comprises three independent non-executive directors, David Godwin Chairman, John Edgcumbe and Howard Perlin and has responsibility for determining the remuneration, contract terms and other benefits of the executive directors of the Company from time to time and reviews the remuneration levels of all senior executives including non-board members.
In February 2002, the Remuneration Committee appointed Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow formerly Bacon & Woodrow, a leading firm of executive remuneration consultants, to provide it with a comparative analysis of executive incentive plans of peer group companies and to advise on the establishment of a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP for the Company.
Nabarro Nathanson has assisted the Committee on procedural matters relating to the LTIP and contractual matters relating to the executive directors.
Nabarro Nathanson is not appointed by the Remuneration Committee.
Toby Courtauld, the Chief Executive, provides advice in relation to the setting of awards under the LTIP for other senior executives.
More information on the LTIP is provided in the section Long-Term Incentive Plan below.
Remuneration Policy The Remuneration Committee establishes policy on the remuneration of executive directors from time to time.
In determining the policy for 2003 it has considered and is likely to continue to consider for subsequent financial years a number of factors, including: the importance of attracting, retaining and motivating executives of appropriate calibre and experience: and the size and long-term nature of the Groups business.
The remuneration policy for executive directors has been designed to address the interests of both directors and shareholders: a potentially significant proportion of remuneration is based on performance and is dependant upon the achievement of demanding targets.
Remuneration currently comprises: basic salary and benefits, performance-related bonuses, LTIP and pension.
The Companys policy on termination payments is to consider the circumstances on a case-bycase basis, taking into account the relevant contractual terms, the circumstances of the termination and any applicable duty to mitigate.
It is the Committees policy not to reward for poor performance.
Basic Salary and Benefits Basic salaries and the level and nature of benefits provided are reviewed by the Committee annually or on promotion, and are assessed having regard to Company and individual performance and salary levels in comparable organisations, particularly within the listed property sector.
Basic salary is the only element of executive directors remuneration which attracts pension contributions.
Benefits principally comprise life insurance, private health care, car and travel concessions and membership subscriptions.
The taxable value of these benefits is included in the table on page 45.
Bonus Plan Each year the Committee considers the appropriateness of short-term and long-term incentive plans in assessing the overall remuneration of executive directors.
The Company operates an annual performance-related bonus plan for executive directors the Bonus Plan based on total shareholder return received by a holder of the Companys shares compared with that of a comparator group of five major property companies, which for 2003 comprised Benchmark Group PLC, The British Land Company PLC, Derwent Valley Holdings PLC, Land Securities PLC and Shaftesbury PLC.
Total shareholder return for the purpose of the bonus plan is calculated by reference to the increase in the value of the Companys shares between 1 April in any year and 31 March in the following year, and all dividends paid in that period: this bonus is paid in cash.
Following advice from Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow, from 2003, the maximum award will be based as a percentage of salary with 100% being awarded for first place, 80% for second place and 40% for third place.
Bonus payments are not pensionable.
Provided he has not given in his notice or indicated his intention to leave or the Company has not terminated his employment summarily in accordance with the terms of his contract, Toby Courtauld is entitled to a loyalty bonus payable in cash of 250,000 on 31 March 2004 and 350,000 on 31 March 2005.
Directors Remuneration Report Annual Report 2003 41 Long-Term Incentive Plan Following shareholder approval at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 11 December 2002, the Company introduced the LTIP for executive directors and senior executives.
In designing the LTIP, the Remuneration Committee followed the provisions in Schedule A of the Combined Code.
The number of shares made the subject of awards under the LTIP is subject to an annual limit of 125% of a participants basic salary.
In the case of executive directors, as notified in the circular to shareholders proposing the establishment of the LTIP, it is the current intention of the Remuneration Committee to make an award annually of 125% of the relevant executive directors basic salary.
Each year, contingent awards of shares are made which vest after three years provided performance conditions are met.
The conditions are based on: i total shareholder return measured using share price and the reinvestment of dividends over that period relative to a bespoke comparator group of 20 companies including the Company selected from the FTSE Real Estate Index, and ii growth in the Groups net asset value per share exceeding the rate of inflation over the same period by at least an average of two percentage points per annum.
Net asset value per share is calculated as the fully diluted net asset value of the Great Portland Estates group as published in the Companys Annual Report adjusted to exclude the effect of deferred tax relating to capital allowances exceeding depreciation and adjusted, as necessary, to include the effect of marking debt to market and to include the effect of contingent corporation tax on chargeable gains, and adjusted by the Committee as necessary to ensure a consistent basis of calculation following any changes in accounting standards and adjusted to take account of certain variations in share capital.
They were selected by the Remuneration Committee on the advice of the Companys remuneration consultants and following discussion with the Association of British Insurers and institutional investors.
In order to ensure that the assessment of performance is independent, Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow and Ernst & Young will report to the Remuneration Committee as to whether the performance criteria have been met.
Pensions A contribution calculated as a proportion of basic salary is made to the director for his personal pension arrangements or direct to his personal pension plan.
Paul Gittens, who was an executive director until 17 July 2002, is a member of the Group Pension Plan.
Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors The fees of the non-executive directors are reviewed periodically by the executive directors, who make recommendations to the Board.
The total of non-executive directors fees is limited by the Articles of Association.
Remuneration of the non-executive directors comprises a basic fee, together with a fee for serving on each Board Committee.
In view of the increasing responsibilities of non-executive directors, and following a review by the executive directors in September 2002, it is proposed that the limit for non-executive directors fees within the Articles of Association be increased to 400,000 in aggregate to enable an increase in the non-executive directors basic fees excluding the Chairman and a crossover period between the appointment of new, and retirement of current, non-executive directors.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for the bonus or LTIP, nor are contributions made to any pension arrangements.
Total Shareholder Return The following graph shows the total shareholder returns for the Company for each of the last five financial years compared to the FTSE All-Share Real Estate Index.
The Company is a constituent of the FTSE All-Share Real Estate Index, and the Committee considers this to be the most appropriate broad market equity index for illustrating the Companys performance.

Pension Entitlements audited Toby Courtauld, Robert Noel and John Whiteley have personal pension arrangements to which the Company contributes.
Pension benefits earned by Paul Gittens who is a member of the Group Pension Plan are set out below: Accrued Increase in Transfer Accrued Transfer TransferMovement in pension period value of pension value at value at transfer value at 31 March excluding increase in at 17 July 31 March 31 March during 2002 inflation period 2002 2002 2003 the year 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Paul Gittens 94 1 10 95 977 1,344 367 The accrued pension entitlements shown are those which would be paid annually on normal retirement date.
The increase in the transfer value during the year is predominately due to a change in basis of calculating transfer values following changes in professional actuarial guidance.
Had this basis been applied to the transfer value at 31 March 2002, the transfer value would have been 1.326 million with a resulting increase in the year of 18,000.
The transfer value disclosed above does not represent an amount payable to Paul Gittens but the potential liability to the plan, and has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The disclosure of the two different transfer value figures in the table relating to the increase in the year is to ensure compliance with both the Companies Act 1985 and Listing Rules disclosure requirements.
