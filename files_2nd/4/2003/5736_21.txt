TSR is defined as share price growth plus reinvested dividends.
The FTSE 350 was selected as the most appropriate broad equity market index.
Exel is a constituent member and the Committee believes that this broader index is the most appropriate benchmark for performance over a five-year period.
The FTSE 350 is also the index used for the purposes of Exels Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, determining Exels TSR performance for the purposes of the vesting of share awards under the LTIP.
However, the time frame for measurement of the graph is five years whereas Exel measures TSR over three years for the purposes of its LTIP.
In addition, the underlying mechanics to calculate the graph are different.
The graph demonstrates that Exel outperformed the FTSE 350 by 21% over five years.

There are other applicable levels and limits that further restrict the amount of employer and employee contributions to a qualified plan.
Mr Edwards benefits are accordingly provided through a qualified plan and also a non-qualified plan, to which contributions are paid in excess of the limits.
Mr Edwards benefits in the combined plans provide for an overall matched employer contribution of up to 5% of remuneration per annum.
In addition, Mr Edwards is eligible for an annual profit sharing contribution which is paid into his qualified plan account.
On 1 April 2003, the Company introduced new defined contribution pension arrangements for new employees in the UK businesses.
There is no change to the existing arrangements, defined benefit and or defined contribution, for those employed on or before 31 March 2003.

David Riddle is the only remaining executive who holds options granted under the ESOS 1984.
In contrast to ESOS 1994, the vesting of these options is not subject to any performance criteria.
The performance conditions attached to the grants of options under ESOS 2001 are described in section 5.4 a on pages 31 to 32, which has been audited.

The number of shares ultimately transferred to each Director depends on certain performance conditions being met.
The Remuneration Committee previously resolved that 85% of each of the awards made on 3 May 1996, 6 August 1997, 16 March 1998 and 5 May 1998 should vest after three years and be available for release to participants one year later.
The relevant performance conditions for the awards made on 15 March 1999 and 3 May 2000 were not satisfied and therefore the awards lapsed on 15 March 2002 and 3 May 2003 respectively.
At the year end, none of the executive Directors held awards which were available for release.
The only outstanding awards are those granted in 2003 plus reinvested dividends.
