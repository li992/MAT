S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2003 D IRECTORS R EMUNERATION R EPORT Policy on directors remuneration This report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee of St Ives plc the committee and approved by the board.
The report complies with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
Information relating to remuneration of the directors on page 20, directors pension entitlements on page 21 and directors share options on pages 23 and 24 has been audited.
The board is responsible for setting the Companys policy on directors remuneration in respect of the 2002 2003 financial year and future years and the role of the committee, inter alia, is to apply the boards policy and decide on the remuneration of each executive director.
No director is involved in determining his or her own remuneration.
The primary objectives of the Companys policy on executive directors remuneration are rstly, that it should be structured so as to attract and retain executives of a high calibre with the skills and experience necessary to develop the Company successfully and, secondly, to reward them in a way which encourages the creation of value for the shareholders.
The setting of appropriate targets for executive directors, which have to be achieved for them to earn a performance-related bonus, and the determination of their remuneration package is undertaken annually by the committee.
Targets may be adjusted, where appropriate, to take account of any change in the issued share capital of the Company.
It is currently the boards policy that a bonus shall not exceed 75 per cent of the executives basic pay for the year in question.
Bonus payments to directors do not qualify for pension benets.
The committee periodically considers available remuneration and benets data relevant to UK public companies and others in the same business sector as the Company.
The Companys policy on setting non-executive directors remuneration is to offer a salary sufficient to attract and retain individuals of appropriate calibre such that they are able to apply an independent view based on their experience and skills.
Non-executive directors are not entitled to participate in the Groups share option schemes, nor in any long term incentive plan.
It is the Companys policy that executive directors should serve under rolling service contracts of twelve months duration or less and that there should be no special provisions for compensation in the event of termination.
Payment in lieu of any unworked notice on termination of service is a matter of negotiation between the parties.
The policy on non-executive directors letters of appointment are that they shall be for an initial three-year term, thereafter subject to notice at any time and retirement by rotation at Annual General Meetings of shareholders.
Details of the executive directors service contracts and non-executive directors letters of appointment are shown on page 22.
During the year the committee drew on advice and assistance from New Bridge Street Consultants, the Chairman and the Company Secretary in connection with the grants of awards to the executive directors and certain other members of senior management under the St Ives plc Executive Share Option Scheme 2001 Scheme and the St Ives plc Equity Partnership Plan EPP.
The executive directors remuneration consists of five components: a Basic salary which reects the executives experience, responsibility and market value.
b Performance-related bonus based on objectives set by the committee relative to the performance of the Group, operating unit or individual as appropriate, as an incentive to the executive directors to achieve relevant and demanding targets.
No executive director received a bonus in respect of 2002 2003.
The committee decides annually on what objectives should be set for the executive directors for the forthcoming financial year.
For 2003 2004 the committee has set an incentive for the executive directors to achieve a targeted profit before taxation, goodwill amortisation and exceptional items.
In addition the committee has previously set a further bonus element which may be payable in October 2005 in the event that, in any financial year ending on or before August 2005, the Groups profit before taxation, goodwill 18 S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2003 amortisation and exceptional items exceeds a specic target.
The bonuses which may be earned by Wayne Angstrom and Patrick Martell are also partly dependent on the US division and the Book division, respectively, meeting or exceeding their profit before interest targets for 2003 2004. c Pension and other benets Brian Edwards, Patrick Martell and Raymond Morley each participate in the Groups principal pension scheme, a dened benets scheme, which has a normal retirement age of 65.
Miles Emley joined the Company after the imposition of the Inland Revenue earnings cap introduced by the Finance Act 1989.
In his case, the Company contributes to a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benets Scheme, a Self Invested Personal Pension and life assurance cover, for the purpose of providing pension and death in service benets for Miles Emley and his dependants comparable to those of colleagues to whom the earnings cap does not apply.
Wayne Angstrom participates in a Section 401 k Plan set up in the USA for the benefit of employees of St Ives Inc.
There are no unfunded pension promises or similar arrangements for directors.
Executive directors receive benets in kind, including the provision of a car, fuel and medical insurance.
During the year Raymond Morley received additional salary of 13,056 which is ignored when calculating pensionable salary and bonus entitlement in lieu of the provision of a car and fuel benets.
d Share options Executive directors and certain members of senior management have been granted share options under the Groups discretionary share option schemes.
These share options were not granted at a discount and, therefore, over time will reward management when shareholders are rewarded, but not otherwise, as is proper.
As a result of the adoption of the 2001 Scheme no further options will be granted under any of its predecessor schemes, which are in a state of run-off.
The Companys policy is to grant options to executive directors at the discretion of the committee up to an annual maximum of 150 per cent of basic salary 400 per cent in exceptional circumstances.
It is also the Companys policy normally to phase the granting of share options, rather than to award them in a single large block to any individual.
The committee decides on an appropriate performance condition which has to be satisfied before options can normally be exercised.
Details of options granted to directors under the Groups discretionary share option schemes are given in the table of directors share options on page 23.
Options granted in October 2002 under the 2001 Scheme can only be exercised if, after a period of between three and five years, commencing from the year ended 2 August 2002 the base year, some or all of the following are satisfied: 25 per cent of an option may be exercised in the event that the Companys Earnings Per Share EPS growth has exceeded the UKs Retail Prices Index RPI, plus at least 3 per cent per annum compound since the base year: RPI plus at least 4 per cent over the same period must be achieved to exercise the next 25 per cent of the grant: RPI plus at least 5 per cent for the third 25 per cent and RPI plus 6 per cent for the final 25 per cent of the grant to be exercisable.
To the extent that the foregoing performance condition is not satisfied by the fifth anniversary of grant, the options lapse.
Options granted to the executive directors and outstanding under the 1995 Scheme and the 1992 Scheme cannot be exercised unless a performance condition is satisfied, which is an increase in EPS on average of not less than 2 per cent per annum above RPI over a period of at least three years.
Outstanding options granted under the 1985 Scheme are exercisable without restriction.
Options can only be exercised between the third and seventh anniversary of grant in the case of the 1995 Scheme, and between the third and tenth anniversary of grant in the case of the Groups other discretionary schemes.
Executive directors may participate in the Companys Savings-Related Share Option Schemes Sharesave schemes.
19 S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2003 D IRECTORS R EMUNERATION R EPORT continued Policy on directors remuneration continued e Long term incentive plan During the year executive directors and certain members of senior management were invited to participate in the EPP.
Under the rules of the EPP the participants, having purchased St Ives plc shares on the open market and deposited them with an Employees benefit Trust, potentially qualify for an award of free matching shares, in the ratio of between 0.5:1 if three years EPS growth from the base year is RPI plus 1 per cent per annum, compound and 3:1 if EPS growth from the base year is RPI plus 8 per cent per annum, compound the level of match being determined on a straight-line basis if the Companys EPS growth over the three-year period falls between the two points.
There will be no re-testing of performance following the end of the three-year period.
Full details of the components of the executive directors remuneration referred to above, including options granted, exercised and outstanding under the Groups share option schemes, are set out in the tables below and on pages 21 to 24.

In the case of Miles Emley this sum includes a salary payment of 19,473 2002 17,117 in addition to basic pay which, after tax, offsets the income tax and national insurance contributions payable by the director on the Companys contributions to a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benets Scheme.
2 The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Professional Guidance Note GN11.
3 The increase in the accrued pension during the year shown above excludes any increase arising from the statutory revaluation in deferment up to normal retirement age.
The inclusion of the statutory revaluation in deferment up to normal retirement age would have the effect of increasing the accrued pension during the year to 9,699 per annum for Brian Edwards and 6,472 per annum for Raymond Morley.
4 The accumulated total accrued pension entitlements shown are annual amounts at retirement calculated on service completed to the relevant year end.
This was 19 years, including 4 years service purchased from transfers in to the principal pension scheme, in the case of Brian Edwards and 19 years, including 2 years service purchased from a transfer in to the principal pension scheme, for Raymond Morley.
5 Member contributions were payable in the year by the directors under the Groups pension schemes.
Additional voluntary contributions paid and any benefit arising are not included in the above tables.
6 Brian Edwards accumulated total accrued pension at 1 August 2003 includes 654 per annum in respect of an individual transfer-in made during the year.
This accrued pension relating to the transfer-in has been excluded from the increase in the accrued pension during the year.
The transferin of 1,982 has been treated as an employee contribution and therefore deducted from the increase in the transfer value over the year.
7 The principal reason for the increase in transfer values is that the transfer value at 2 August 2002 is calculated on the Minimum Funding Requirement basis, which was the appropriate basis for calculating cash equivalent transfer values at that time.
The cash equivalent transfer value at 1 August 2003 has been calculated on a new basis adopted and applied by the Trustee of the principal scheme during the year for scheme members generally.
This change in basis and the change in market conditions accounted for 291,700 of the difference in the case of Brian Edwards and 142,300 in the case of Raymond Morley.
