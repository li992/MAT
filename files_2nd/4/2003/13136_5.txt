The top two graphs adjusted EPS at constant exchange rates during the three compare the Reed Elsevier PLC performance with the 30 REED ELSEVIER ANNUAL REPORTS & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2003 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT performance achieved by the FTSE 100, of which Reed Elsevier PLC is a member, and the Reed Elsevier NV performance with the performance achieved by the Amsterdam Stock Exchange AEX Index, of which Reed Elsevier NV is a member, for the four years 20002003.
This period reflects the implementation of the new strategy, announced in February 2000, by the current management team.
The other two graphs, which have been prepared in accordance with the Regulations, show the performance over the five years 1999-2003 compared to the performances of the FTSE 100 and the AEX.
As Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV are members of the FTSE 100 and AEX respectively, the Committee considers these indices to be appropriate for comparison purposes.
For the four year period since 1 January 2000, the total shareholder return for Reed Elsevier PLC was 24%, significantly outperforming the FTSE 100 which saw a negative return of 26%.
For Reed Elsevier NV, in the same four year period total shareholder return was 2%, also significantly outperforming the AEX Index which had a negative return of 41%.

SERVICE CONTRACTS As a condition of receiving an award under the 2003 LTIS, each executive director will be required to enter into a new service contract.
The new contract will have a notice period of 12 months and will contain strengthened covenants that will apply for 12 months after leaving employment, preventing a director from working with specified competitors, recruiting Reed Elsevier employees and soliciting Reed Elsevier clients.
Each of the executive directors has a service contract, the notice periods of which are described below: G J A van fide Aast was appointed a director in December 2000.
His service contract, which is dated 15 November 2000, is subject to English law and provides for a notice period of twelve months.
M H Armour was appointed a director in July 1996.
His service contract, which is dated 7 October 1996, is subject to English law and since 10 June 2003 his contract has provided for a notice period of twelve months, when Mr Armour agreed to a reduction in his notice period from twenty-four months.
Mr Armour did not receive any compensation in return for agreeing to this change in his notice period.
REED ELSEVIER ANNUAL REPORTS & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2003 31 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT C H L Davis was appointed a director in September 1999.
His service contract, which is dated 19 July 1999, is subject to English law and provides for a notice period of twelve months.
A Prozes was appointed a director in August 2000.
His service contract, which is dated 5 July 2000, is subject to New York law and provides that, in the event of termination without cause by the company, twelve months base salary would be payable.
P Tierney was appointed a director on 8 April 2003.
His service contract, which is dated 19 November 2002, is subject to New York law and provides that, in the event of termination without cause by the company, twelve months' base salary will be payable.
The notice periods in respect of individual directors have been reviewed by the Committee.
The Committee believes that as a general rule for future contracts, the notice period should be twelve months, and that the directors should, subject to practice within the country in which the director is based, be required to mitigate their damages in the event of termination.
The Committee will, however, have regard to local market conditions so as to ensure that the terms offered are appropriate to recruit and retain key executives operating in a global business.
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS Executive directors may, subject to the approval of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, serve as non-executive directors on the boards of up to two non-associated companies of which only one may be to the board of a major company.
The Committee believes that Reed Elsevier can benefit from the broader experience gained by executive directors in such appointments.
Directors may retain remuneration arising from such non-executive directorships.
During the year CHL Davis was appointed a non-executive director of GlaxoSmithKline plc and received a fee of 28,848 during the year from that company in such capacity.
REMUNERATION OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the boards of Reed Elsevier Group plc, Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV, with the aid of external professional advice from Towers Perrin.
Non-executive directors receive an annual fee and are reimbursed expenses incurred in attending meetings.
They do not receive any performance related bonuses, pension provisions, share options or other forms of benefit.
During 2003 the boards initiated a review of the fees paid to the non-executive directors compared against the fees paid to non-executive directors of other leading multinational companies operating in global markets.
With effect from 1 May 2003 the fees paid to the non-executive directors other than the Chairman who serve on the boards of Reed Elsevier Group plc, Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV were reviewed for the first time since 1999 and were increased to 45,000 65,000.
The respective Chairmen of the Remuneration Committee and Audit Committee also receive an additional fee of 7,000 12,000 in respect of those additional duties.
The non-executive directors serve under letters of appointment, and do not have contracts of service.
EMOLUMENTS OF THE DIRECTORS The emoluments of the directors of Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV including any entitlement to fees or emoluments from either Reed Elsevier Group plc or Elsevier Reed Finance BV were as follows: a Aggregate emoluments 000 000 2003 2002 2003 2002 Salaries and fees 3,473 3,022 5,035 4,805 Benefits 93 91 134 145 Annual performance-related bonuses 2,254 1,453 3,269 2,310 Pension contributions 243 267 352 425 Pension to former director 213 231 307 368 Payment to former directors 95 139 Total 6,371 5,064 9,236 8,053 No compensation payments have been made for loss of office or termination in 2002 and 2003.
Details of share options exercised by the directors over shares in Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV during the year are shown on pages 36 and 37.
The aggregate notional pre-tax gain made by the directors on the exercise of share options during the year was 5,201,190 7,541,726 2002: 306,843 487,880.
C H L Davis was the highest paid director in 2003, including gains of 4,960,150 7,192,217 on the exercise of nil cost options awarded on his appointment as Chief Executive Officer in 1999.
Mr Davis invested the entire after tax gain arising from the exercise of his options in Reed Elsevier PLC Reed Elsevier NV shares.
D J Haank served as a director until 18 June 2003 and remained an employee until 31 August 2003.
During the period 18 June to 31 August 2003 he received emoluments of 87,759 127,251, comprising salary 84,839 123,017 and other benefits 2,920 4,234.

All other options granted to Mr Haank lapsed on termination of his employment.
c Pensions The Committee reviews the pension arrangements for the executive directors to ensure that the benefits provided are consistent with those provided by other multinational companies in its principal countries of operation.
Executive directors based in the United Kingdom are provided with pension benefits at a normal retirement age of 60, equivalent to two thirds of base salary in the 12 months prior to retirement, provided they have completed 20 years service with Reed Elsevier or at an accrual rate of 1 30th of pensionable salary per annum if employment is for less than 20 years.
The target pension for C H L Davis at normal retirement age of 60 is 45% of base salary in the 12 months prior to retirement.
In 1989, the Inland Revenue introduced a cap on the amount of pension that can be provided from an approved pension scheme.
M H Armours, G J A van fide Aasts and C H L Daviss pension benefits will be provided from a combination of the Reed Elsevier Pension Scheme and the companys unapproved, unfunded pension arrangements.
The target pension for A Prozes, a US based director, is US$300,000 per annum, which becomes payable on retirement only if he completes a minimum of seven years service.
This pension has no associated contingent benefits for a spouse or dependants, and will be reduced in amount by the value of any other retirement benefits payable by the company or any former employer, other than those attributable to employee contributions.
The target pension for P Tierney, a US based director, after completion of five years pensionable service is US$440,000 per annum, inclusive of any other retirement benefits from any former employer.
In the event of termination of employment before completion of five years pensionable service, the pension payable will be reduced proportionately, subject to a minimum pension of US$220,000 per annum in the event of termination of employment for reasons other than resignation or dismissal for cause.
The pension arrangements for all the directors include life assurance cover whilst in employment, an entitlement to a pension in the event of ill health or disability and, except in the case of A Prozes, a spouses and or dependants pension on death.
