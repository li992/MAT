REPORT ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION 36 Capita In accordance with the Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985, the Directors provide the Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2003.
In accordance with the regulations the report is sub-divided into sections headed information not subject to audit and information subject to audit.
Information not subject to audit The Capita Groups Remuneration Committee is a Committee of the Group Board with terms of reference approved by the Group Board, established to determine the terms of employment and remuneration of the Executive Directors.
The members of the Committee are the three Non-Executive Directors Mr P E B Cawdron Chairman, Mr E Walters and Mr R H Alcock.
The Committee meets twice a year, in addition to other meetings arranged as necessary.
The Committee consults the Executive Chairman about the proposals in relation to the remuneration of the Executive Directors and other senior executives.
Inbucon Consulting is an independent remuneration consulting rm that is appointed as an advisor to the Remuneration Committee in respect of executive remuneration and share schemes.
Inbucon Consulting does not provide any other service to the Group.
No other person or company materially assisted the Committee during the year.
The Company has complied with the provisions of the old Combined Code as relating to Directors remuneration annexed to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Remuneration packages a Overall policy The Committee is of the view that, because of the nature of the Groups business, maintaining its growth and profit record and its developing characteristics justify an overall compensation policy with a strong performance-related element.
Accordingly, a cash and share-based package has been designed to provide Directors with rewards that rest between the median and upper quartile ranges of comparable companies if the Group meets its performance targets.
The overall package is weighted towards share-based rewards, which the Committee strongly believes link the interests of the Directors and shareholders in respect of shareholder value.
The Committee considers that this approach to remuneration is appropriate, particularly due to the strong link between the total executive remuneration and Group performance, and plans to continue with this approach in its future remuneration policy.
The Committee believes that the two performance measures chosen for the share incentive schemes growth in earnings per share EPS and comparative total shareholder return TSR are the two key long term indicators of the financial success of the Company.
They are also measures that are acceptable to the majority of the investors in the Company.
The chart below compares the value of an investment of 100 in Capitas shares with an investment in the FTSE All Share Index and the FTSE 350 Support Services Index over the five years starting on 1 January 1999 assuming that all dividend income is reinvested.
The Committee believes that this comparison provides a clear picture of how well the Company has performed relative to both a wide range of companies in the UK and also a specic group of companies in the same sector.
Comparison of Total Shareholder Returns Capita vs FTSE All Share Index and FTSE 350 Support Services Index Value of investment of 100 on 1 January 1999 Capita Group 300 FTSE All Share Index FTSE 350 Support Services Index 250 200 150 100 50 0 01.01.2000 01.01.2001 01.01.2002 01.01.2003 01.01.2004 01.01.1999 A 100 investment in Capita shares on 1 January 1999 would be worth 136 at 31 December 2003 compared to 95 for an investment in the FTSE All Share Index and 65 for an investment in the FTSE 350 Support Services Index.
b Basic salary and benets The Committee regularly commissions independent reviews of the salaries and benets of the Executive Directors.
The policy of the Committee is to provide salaries and benets that are below those provided to comparable roles so as to be able to provide higher performance related elements.
The policy of low base salaries and benets allows the Executive Directors to provide a lead in terms of keeping xed remuneration costs low within the Group as a whole.
In addition, it is reective of the Groups remuneration policy.
As the Group has been successful, it has been able to prove the benets of a highly geared reward structure which delivers a very competitive total remuneration package.
c Bonus scheme The basis for payments under the bonus scheme is determined at the start of the year and payments are triggered at a predetermined Group profit before tax that is adjusted upward in the event of an acquisition.
The view of the Committee is that these performance conditions are relevant, challenging and designed to enhance the business.
As a result of the Groups exceptional performance, annual bonuses have been paid out at the maximum 60% of salary.
This helps to lift the competitiveness of total remuneration towards the upper quartile of the market.
37 Capita Report on Directors remuneration d Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The Group adopted The Capita Group Plc Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP at the AGM of the Group on 16 April 1998.
No further awards will be made under the LTIP.
Awards have been structured either as Restricted Share Awards or Indexed Performance Share Appreciation Rights IPSARs.
Restricted Share Awards The awards made under this part of the plan vested in full on 4 May 2001, the performance criteria having been met in full.
One of the awards is still in trust and therefore details of the award are set out in section c information subject to audit.
Restricted Share Awards were designed to deliver shares to participants three years after the date of award depending on the Companys TSR, relative to the comparator group listed below over the three-year performance period.
Shares could only be released if the Company was ranked at or above the median in this comparator group with 5% of awards released at the 49th percentile, 50% of Awards released at the 40th percentile and 100% of Awards released at the 25th percentile or above.
If the Companys TSR ranking had been below the median at the end of the performance period, the Restricted Share Awards would have lapsed.
In addition, no shares would have been released if the growth in the Companys EPS had not exceeded the growth in the RPI over the three-year performance period.
Share Appreciation Rights IPSARs Only one award of Share Appreciation Rights was made to participants under the LTIP and only Executive Directors were allowed to participate.
Share Appreciation Rights are designed like share options except that the exercise price to be paid by the participants increased pro rata to the FTSE All Share Index, a feature that ensured that participants only gained if the share price outperformed such index.
The awards vested in full on 5 May 2003.
Share Appreciation Rights are exercisable five years after the award was granted provided that the Companys TSR ranking was at least at the upper quartile level of a comparator group, selected from the Support Services Sector.
If the Companys TSR was at the upper quartile level, 40% of the IPSARs would vest.
For 100% vesting, the Companys TSR had to be at the 10th percentile or better within the comparator group.
If the Companys TSR ranking had been below the upper quartile, the Share Appreciation Rights would have lapsed.
The comparator group at the date of award is listed below.
Admiral Davis Service Group Select Appt.
Holdings AEA Technology Hays Sema Group Aggreko JBA Holdings Serco Group BTG Logica Spring Group Capita Misys Williams CMG Rentokil Initial Danka Business Systems Sage Group The asterisked companies have been taken over, merged or demerged since the original award date.
Adjustments have been made to the TSR gures for these companies following the capital event to make their data fully comparable.
In addition, no Share Appreciation Rights would have been exercisable unless growth in the Companys earnings per share exceeded the growth in RPI over the five-year period.
The market value of a Capita ordinary share at the date of grant on 5 May 1998 was 1.69 and the FTSE All Share Index stood at 2817.
As at 4 May 2003, the FTSE All Share Index stood at 1905, therefore the price at which the shares can be acquired is the award price of 1.69.
The market value of a Capita ordinary share at 5 May 2003 was 2.46.
Details of the outstanding awards to Directors and of exercises by Mr G M Hurst and Mr P M Doyle during the year are shown in section c information subject to audit.
e Long Term Indexed Share Appreciation Scheme LTISAS The Group adopted The Capita Group Plc Long Term Indexed Share Appreciation Scheme LTISAS at an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Group on 12 November 2002.
The LTISAS is designed to replace the IPSARs described above which reached the end of their performance period on 4 May 2003.
Executive Directors are provided with two equal tranches of 600,000 options over five years.
The exercise price of the options increases in line with the FTSE All Share Index from the beginning to the end of the performance period, a feature that ensures that participants only gain if the share price outperforms such index.
In calculating the share price, the final option price cannot be below the market value of a share when the options were granted.
In addition the options will only be exercisable if, over the performance period, the growth in the Companys EPS exceeds certain targets as follows.
25% of the options shall vest if growth in the Companys EPS exceeds RPI growth by 8% per annum, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting if growth in the Companys EPS exceeds growth in the RPI by 12% per annum.
The first tranche of 600,000 options was granted on 25 November 2002 and has a five-year performance period.
The second tranche will be granted in November 2004 and will have a three-year performance period using the same criteria as the first tranche.
Thus both tranches will have performance periods which will end in November 2007.
The grant price for the first tranche of options was 2.16.
This was calculated based on the average of the closing share price over the month prior to the date of grant.
At the date of grant on 25 November 2002, the FTSE All Share Index stood at 1980.
At 31 December 2003 the market price of a Capita ordinary share was 2.43 and the FTSE All Share Index stood at 2207.
No further long-term incentive awards will be made to the Executive Directors over the five-year period to November 2007.
