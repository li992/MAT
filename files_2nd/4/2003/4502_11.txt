Remuneration Report The following is a report from the Remuneration Committee which has been approved and adopted by the Board and prepared in accordance with the requirements introduced by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Membership and Responsibilities The Remuneration Committee consists exclusively of independent non-executive Directors.
The members are: Nicholas Brookes Chairman, Sir Brandon Gough, Keith Hodgkinson, Michael Jeffries and Philip Nolan.
Their biographical details appear on page 27.
Ian Much, Chief Executive, Graham Maundrell, Group Director of Human Resources and Peter Hawker, Group Director of Compensation and Benefits are requested to attend meetings on an ad-hoc basis to provide assistance and advice to the Committee.
The Secretary of the Committee is Louise Fluker, General Counsel and Company Secretary, who provides professional assistance to the Committee on governance issues.
The Committee is authorised to and uses independent consultants to provide advice on remuneration levels amongst comparator companies, design of bonus incentive schemes and share option schemes and performance monitoring.
Watson Wyatt LLP has provided advice on remuneration levels whilst New Bridge Street Consultants has advised on the achievement of performance targets in share option schemes.
The Chief Executive is consulted on the remuneration of his direct reports and other senior executives and will seek to ensure a consistent approach across the Group.
No executive Director or employee is present when his or her remuneration is being discussed.
The Committee is required by its terms of reference to determine Company policy for executive remuneration for approval by the Board.
The remuneration policy is kept under regular review to ensure that it remains aligned with the Companys strategy and changes taking place in the market.
Remuneration for Non-Executive Directors The Board determines the fees paid to the Chairman and other non-executive Directors taking into account market norms, comparisons with companies of equivalent size and the duties required of non-executive Directors.
The Board was advised by Watson Wyatt LLP during 2002 2003.
Details of fees to the Chairman and other non-executive Directors are set out on page 39.
The Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees each receive an additional fee of 5,000 for this responsibility.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible for pension scheme membership and do not participate in any of the Groups bonus or share option schemes.
Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors and Senior Executives fide La Rues remuneration policy is designed to support the Company in achieving its key business strategies by enabling it to attract and retain employees who have the necessary skills and commitment and to motivate such employees by providing outstanding reward opportunities linked to the achievement of outstanding results.
The reward package for executive Directors and senior executives comprises: nbasic salary, set at competitive levels relative to the external market and individual contribution: nan annual incentive award, providing substantial total earnings opportunity, to reward achievement of short-term results and specific personal objectives: na long-term incentive for senior management comprising discretionary executive share option awards, with stretching performance targets: nshare ownership guidelines to promote retention and longer term ownership by senior executives with a share matching plan: npension and other benefits in line with competitive practice.
The performance related elements of remuneration form a significant proportion of the total remuneration package.
In particular, the combined potential earnings from the annual and long-term incentives outweigh the other elements.
The Company intends to continue this approach to the structure of remuneration for the foreseeable future subject to any changes in legislation.
The Committee approves: nall elements of the Companys executive Directors and senior executives remuneration, including base salaries, benefits, pensions, incentive measures and targets: nall contracts with executive Directors and any compensation arrangements arising from the early termination of these contracts: nall grants of shares and options under the Companys share schemes, any changes to existing schemes and the introduction of any new schemes: nthe design of bonus schemes for divisions of the Company.
The Committee regularly benchmarks key jobs and obtains detailed information from external and internal sources about current practices in a selected comparator group of companies in order to achieve its policy.
The objective is to ensure that total remuneration packages are fair and competitive and provide simplicity and transparency.
The Committee also seeks to ensure that the interests of the executives are aligned with those of the shareholders.
fide La Rue Annual Report 2003 37 Remuneration Report continued The Board adopted the Committees recommendations without substantial amendment during the last year.
A resolution will be put to shareholders to approve the Remuneration Report at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Salaries for Executive Directors and Senior Executives Details of each individual executive Directors remuneration are set out on page 39.
Basic salaries reflect the responsibilities, market value and sustained performance level of executive Directors and senior executives.
Salaries are based on the rate for similar posts in companies of a comparable size and complexity, although individual salaries may be above or below this level, reflecting performance and seniority in the position, whilst sensitive to employees pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group.
Basic salaries are normally reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee.
Annual Incentive Award Performance-related elements of remuneration form a significant proportion of total remuneration packages.
Executive Directors and senior executives are eligible to receive an annual incentive award which is paid as a percentage of basic salary and is based on achieving targets for the year set by the Remuneration Committee.
For the financial year 2002 2003 the maximum incentive award achievable was 80 per cent of basic salary for Ian Much and up to 60 per cent of basic salary for his direct reports.
The Committee considers each year what are appropriate performance measures to align the reward strategy with the business strategy and these will vary according to division in the case of divisional schemes or executive in the case of executive Directors and senior executives.
Typical measures will include headline earnings per share, operating cashflow and operating profit together with specific personal objectives set for each individual.
The incentive plan is structured so that there is no payment unless a minimum performance threshold has been achieved and that the maximum payout will only be made if stretching and challenging targets are met.
The Committee has used a combination of these measures for the past four years and for the annual bonus scheme of 2003 2004.
Once the design of the bonus scheme has been approved by the Committee it is then introduced throughout the business to eligible employees where participation is calculated by a percentage of their annual salary determined by their seniority.
Executive Directors and certain key executives may, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, apply up to 50 per cent of their pre-tax annual incentive award to acquire qualifying shares under the matching shares scheme.
Service Contracts Non-executive Directors have letters of appointment specifying fixed terms of office of three years, renewable for a further three years subject to satisfactory performance.
They do not have service contracts.
The Board may invite non-executive Directors to serve an additional third three-year term after a detailed review.
The executive Directors have service contracts with a 12-month notice period and provision for compensation on termination not exceeding 12 months remuneration.
If Ian Muchs service contract is terminated by reason of a change of control other than for the purpose of amalgamation or reconstruction the Company is liable to pay the higher of a twice basic salary at termination plus compensation equivalent to the average annual compensation under the bonus scheme based on awards made in respect of the two final years preceding the date of termination or b 30 months basic salary.
The compensation payable will now be reduced proportionately following Ian Muchs 58th birthday.
If Stephen Kings employment is terminated by reason of a change of control other than for the purpose of amalgamation or reconstruction within 24 months from the date of commencement of his employment, and termination occurs within three months of the date on which the change of control takes effect, the Company is liable to pay annual gross salary at the rate current on the date of termination multiplied by 1.25.
Such sum will be reduced by 1 12th in respect of each month pro rata in the case of part month of any notice of termination given by the Company.
Paul Hollingworth was not eligible for compensation upon his resignation from the Company on 30 June 2002.
The Remuneration Committee considers the appropriateness of the principle of mitigation of damages on early termination of a service contract.
Benefits Executive Directors and senior employees are eligible for a range of taxable benefits which include the provision of a company car, or a cash alternative, and payment of its operating expenses, including fuel, membership of private medical and permanent health insurance schemes, life assurance and reimbursement of the annual subscription to an appropriate professional body.
Details of the emoluments of the executive Directors during the year can be found on page 39.

Pension All executive Directors and senior executives in the UK may join the senior section of the fide La Rue Pension Scheme.
The Scheme has an employee contribution rate of five per cent of basic salary for all salary levels.
Where required by Inland Revenue rules, basic salary is capped 97,200 for 2002 03.
Members are provided with a pension of up to two thirds of pensionable salary on retirement.
The actual level of pension depends upon the number of years service with the Group.
The normal retirement age is 62 except for Ian Much whose normal retirement age is 60 although accrued pensions may be drawn in full from age 60.
The Scheme also provides a lump sum death in service benefit and pensions for dependants of members on their death.
Executive Directors and certain senior executives for whom a personal pension arrangement is more appropriate, as an alternative to joining the Company scheme, can receive a Company contribution subject to Inland Revenue rules.
In addition they may receive a payment into a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme FURBS.
Details of each executive Directors pension arrangements are as follows: Ian Much is eligible for a target pension of 20 per cent of basic salary payable from age 60.
This is provided through a combination of a FURBS and membership of the senior section of the fide La Rue Pension Scheme.
He is required to make a contribution of five per cent of basic capped salary to his pension arrangement and is covered for a lump sum on death in service based on four times basic salary, with a widows pension of 40 per cent of basic salary in the event of death in service.
The Companys external actuary assesses the Companys contributions to the Scheme.
Stephen King is eligible for a target pension from all sources of two thirds of basic salary at the age of 62.
Part of this benefit arises from previous employment.
His target pension is provided through a combination of a FURBS and membership of the senior section of the fide La Rue Pension Scheme.
He is required to make a contribution of five per cent of basic capped salary to his pension arrangement and is covered for a lump sum on death in service based on four times basic salary, with a widows pension of 60 per cent of basic salary in the event of death in service.

Share Schemes At the Annual General Meeting in 2002, shareholders approved establishing a new executive share option plan to replace the Share Price Improvement Plan and Executive Share Option Scheme: modifying the Phantom Share Option Scheme: renewing the Savingsrelated Share Option Scheme, and introducing a Matching Shares Scheme and a new US Employee Share Purchase Plan.
Shareholders also authorised the Directors to establish a Share Incentive Plan.
The Remuneration Committee believes that its policy for executives is currently best represented by the use of share option grants.
The Committee determines all awards to executives and Directors under the executive plans.
Awards are discretionary and subject to the limits approved by the Board whilst reflecting good corporate governance practice and institutional guidelines.
The performance conditions attached to share options apply to all executive Directors.
Details of all current schemes are described below.
Sharesave Scheme All UK employees of the Company may join its Inland Revenue approved SAYE Scheme.
Options are granted over fide La Rue plc shares, at the prevailing market price at the time of grant with a discretionary discount to the market price, to employees who agree to save between 5 and 250 per month over a period of three or five years.
A grant was made in January 2003 at a price of 244.50 pence which was a 10 per cent discount, and 32 per cent of eligible employees participated.
US Employee Share Purchase Plan The Company introduced a US Employee Share Purchase Plan under section 423 of the US Internal Revenue Code in January 2003.
This provides a competitive incentive for US employees to invest up to 10 per cent of basic salary each year in the Company, subject to the statutory limit currently US$25,000 worth of shares.
The purchase price is 85 per cent of the lower market value of a fide La Rue share at the beginning 235 pence or end of the Offering Period on 31 December 2003.
20 per cent of eligible employees participated.
Executive Share Option Plan The new Executive Share Option Plan was established in July 2002 and provides for the grant of options at a price equal to the average market value of a fide La Rue plc ordinary share over the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of grant with a performance condition based on the achievement of an earnings per share growth target.
Options were granted to senior executives in August 2002 at an option price of 319.17 pence, subsequent to achieving the performance condition over three years of three per cent per annum earnings per share growth over the rate of increase in the retail prices index.
If this condition is not met at the end of the performance period, retesting of the performance target will be allowed twice, on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date.
The Remuneration Committee considered using a performance measure based on a comparison of the Companys Total Shareholder Return with those of other companies, but given the difficulty in finding a suitable group of comparator companies, the current market conditions and at the current stage of the Groups development, the Committees view was that a performance measure based on growth in earnings per share was more appropriate.
40 fide La Rue Annual Report 2003 The Option Plan is in two parts.
Part A is approved by the Inland Revenue and so confers tax relief on UK resident employees on any gains arising on exercise.
Part B is unapproved to enable the grant of options to an individual where the cumulative value of the employees subsisting options at the date of grant exceeds 30,000.
Options are granted for nil payment and may normally only be granted within 42 days of any announcement of results.
The Remuneration Committee also has the power to approve the grant of options at other times in exceptional circumstances such as the need to attract a Director or senior executive to join the Company.
A Phantom Share Option Scheme is operated under similar rules to provide an equivalent cash incentive to senior executives in jurisdictions where the tax or securities laws make it impracticable to operate a share option scheme.
The Remuneration Committee will regularly review the performance target and may increase but not relax it to ensure the performance target remains a challenging and stretching test of performance.
Matching Shares Scheme One of the principles of remuneration policy is that certain key executives should be encouraged to acquire and retain a personal shareholding in the Company.
The Company has now introduced a policy requiring such executives to build up a holding of shares in the Company equivalent to one times salary over a period of five years.
In order to encourage key executives to build up their personal shareholding, qualifying shares newly acquired by key executives will, if lodged with a nominee or trustee for a two-year period and subject to a performance target, qualify for an additional free or matching share for every two qualifying shares lodged.
The performance target which must be satisfied is an increase in the growth of the Companys earnings per share over the latest two financial years which is at least three per cent per annum on average greater than the rate of increase in the retail prices index.
The Remuneration Committee will keep the performance target under review and may increase but not relax it from time to time as it considers appropriate.
The first acquisition of qualifying shares will not be earlier than June 2003 when any bonuses for the year ended 29 March 2003 become payable.
Ian Much is ineligible to participate.
Executive Share Option Scheme The Company operates an Executive Share Option Scheme with an Inland Revenue approved section and an unapproved section.
Options granted under the Scheme since July 1996 can only be exercised if performance targets are met.
The performance condition that has been applied to the 1997 grant and to all subsequent grants of options up to and including 2001 is that options can only be exercised if the total return of a share over a consecutive three year period exceeds the total return of the median ranked company in the FTSE Mid-250 Index over the same period.
Options granted in 1996 are normally exercisable only if the total return of a share over a rolling three-year period exceeds the average total return of the FTSE All Share Index.
A Phantom Share Option Scheme has been operated and the performance targets for grants prior to 2002 match those of the Executive Share Option Scheme.
Share Price Improvement Plan The Company established the Share Price Improvement Plan in July 1999.
The objective of the Plan has been to achieve improvement in the Companys value by aligning shareholders interests with those of senior key employees.
Currently 24 employees have received options under the Plan.
The performance targets are challenging and measure the Companys progress over a number of specified periods.
Options are exercisable on a sliding scale related to the Companys share price improvement over the performance period.
The first grant of options failed to meet the minimum target price of 322.95 pence on the third anniversary in 2002 and consequently all those options lapsed.
No options under the second and final grants of the Plan become exercisable unless the share price achieves a minimum target price of 392.22 and 557.06 pence respectively.
In addition, even if the minimum target price has been achieved, options may only be exercised if the Companys percentage increase in share price has equalled or exceeded the percentage increase in the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment companies over the same performance period.
If the share price performance permits options to be exercised, they must be exercised within twelve months of vesting and optionholders must retain a proportion of shares for a minimum period of three years.
There will be no further grants of options under the Plan.

During 2002 2003 no executive Director exercised any share options although options granted in September 1998 and November 1999 have vested as the performance targets under the Executive Share Option Scheme were met.
Shareholder Return The performance chart opposite shows the value by 29 March 2003 of 100 invested in the Company on 31 March 1998 compared with the value of 100 invested in the FTSE Mid 250 Index.
The Remuneration Committee considers this to be the most appropriate basis for comparison as the Company has been a constituent of the 250 Index throughout the period.
