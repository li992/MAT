Because of the changes in Abbeys business, we will review what performance tests are appropriate for the awards in 2005 and Basic Salary later years.

They look at the pay of other people in similar jobs in the so that, when it is added to the value of the annual bonus, it means groups just described.

may be varied in future years to keep the overall value of the incentives at this level.
Annual Bonus At the moment we think its right to put the emphasis on delivering the annual business plan.
So for 2004 the maximum payment under the annual bonus scheme will be 120% of basic salary for the Chief Executive and 100% for the other executive directors.
We may consider making payments above these limits in exceptional circumstances.
One third of any bonus paid will be used to purchase shares which we wont release to the director until the end of three years.
We wont be running the Share Matching Scheme any longer.
We dont have any intention at present to increase these levels, but we will do so if it becomes necessary because the market changes.

Service Contracts When they were appointed, Priscilla Vacassin, Angus Porter and Tony Wyatt were granted contracts that entitle them initially to 24 months notice of termination of their employment.
The notice required reduces by one month for each month of service to 12 months notice after 12 months service.
The Personnel and Remuneration Committee decided that it was appropriate to offer this extra notice period, on a short-term basis, to attract suitable candidates.
At the end of 2003 Priscilla Vacassin was entitled to 17 months notice, Angus Porter to 18 months notice and Tony Wyatt to 20 months notice.
All of the other directors have a contractual notice period of 12 months.
All of the notice periods will have reduced to 12 months by the end of August 2004.
The Company may pay an executive director instead of allowing them to work their notice period.
The directors have to give the Company six months notice of termination of their employment.
Mark Pain and Yasmin Jetha have contracts that entitle them to receive an additional payment if they are made redundant.
The payment is 3.25 weeks pay for each year of service.

1 The increase in accrued pension during 2003 represents the increase in the annual pension which each Director would be entitled to receive from normal retirement age less the statutory inationary increase of 1.7%, where relevant, if he she had left service voluntarily at 31 December 2003 or at his actual retirement date if earlier.
2 The transfer value of the increase in accrued pension represents the current capital sum which would be required, using demographic and financial assumptions, to produce an equivalent increase in accrued pension and ancillary benets, excluding the statutory inationary increase, and after deducting members contributions including Additional Voluntary Contributions.
Although the transfer value represents a liability to the pension fund, it is not a sum paid or due to be paid to the individual director and cannot therefore meaningfully be added to the annual remuneration.
3 The accrued pension at 31 December 2003 represents the annual pension which each Director would be entitled to receive from normal retirement age if he she had left service voluntarily at 31 December 2003 or at his her actual retirement date if earlier.
Abbey Annual Report and Accounts 2003 101 Report of the Directors Remuneration Report continued 4 In most cases the gure for the increase in accrued pension during 2003 which appears in Directors share interests the table does not equal the difference between the total accrued pension at 31 December 2003 and the total accrued pension at 31 December 2002.
The difference arises where the The beneficial interests of directors and their immediate families in the increase in accrued pension is stated after deducting the statutory inationary increase ordinary shares of 10 pence each in the Company are shown below: which would have been applied to the deferred pension entitlement had the director left at the start of the year.
This deduction had been made where directors have been in service for the whole year, and is made in order to present a gure showing that element of the Number of shares increase which results from an extra full year of service and from changes in remuneration.

Ordinary shares 2003 appointment 6 As a result of his early retirement, the 2003 increase in the transfer value of accrued pension for M J Millington is 1,380,340.
This arises partly from the pensions payments L R Allen 5,740 4,509 above, partly from normal contributions during the year, with the remainder of the increase L Arnold 209,856 108,870 due to the transfer value calculated at 31 December having been calculated in the usual way using actuarial assumptions including normal retirement age.
If early retirement in Lord Burns 18,063 5,684 2003 had been assumed in calculating the transfer value at 31 December 2002, the transfer value at that date would have been signicantly higher.

The following table sets forth the aggregate shareholdings, at 31 December 2003, of the directors and executive ofcers of Abbey National plc as a group.

2 Executive share options granted since 1996 become exercisable if the average growth in earnings per ordinary share exceeds the average increase in the retail price index by 2%.
Executive share options granted since 1997 become exercisable if the growth in earnings per ordinary share over a three year period exceeds the average increase in ination by an average of at least 2% per annum, and the Companys total shareholder return at least matches the median performing company in a group of specified financial institutions.
For the options granted in 2003 there were two performance targets that operate separately.
50% of the options granted depend on Abbeys total shareholder return performance compared with other companies in the FTSE 100.
All of these options can be exercised if the companys total shareholder return performance is ranked in the top quarter in relation to the other companies.
Half of the options can be exercised if the Companys total shareholder return performance is ranked at the middle of the group and in proportion between these two points.
Half of the options granted depend on the growth of the Companys total shareholder return compared with a group of UK Financial Services Companies.
For 2003 the companies were Alliance and Leicester, Aviva, Barclays plc, Bradford & Bingley plc, Friends Provident, HBOS plc, HSBC plc, Legal & General plc, Lloyds TSB Group plc, Northern Rock plc, Old Mutual, Prudential plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc.
All of these options can be exercised if the Companys total shareholder return performance is ranked in the top quarter in relation to the other companies.
Half of the options can be exercised if the Companys total shareholder return performance is ranked in the median of the group and in proportion in between these two points.
Performance is measured initially over three years.
If the conditions have not been met in full after three years, performance is re-tested over four and five years.
Any options that have not met the performance test after five years run out and cannot be exercised.
3 The options refer to those granted under the Companys Executive Share Option, Employee Share Option and Sharesave schemes, as set out in Note 55 to the financial statements.
4 Options shown under the headings Number of options: granted, exercised or lapsed cancelled refer to options granted, exercised or cancelled during the year.

104 Abbey Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Report of the Directors Remuneration Report continued Share matching scheme Details of the Companys ordinary shares over which the directors have conditional rights under the share matching scheme are as follows: Conditional Conditional rights to rights to Shares Conditional matching matching shares Conditional awarded rights shares at at 1 January rights granted during lapsed 31 December Conditional rights 2003 during 2003 2003 during 2003 2003 L Arnold 26,592 26,592 Y Jetha 11,735 9,418 21,153 M A Pain 18,054 6,509 24,563 29,789 42,519 72,308 Executive directors can take part in a Share Matching Scheme.
Under the Scheme, directors can invest some or all of their bonus in the Companys shares the purchased shares.
After three years, as long as the director is still employed and hasnt sold the shares theyve bought, they will get a matching award the matching shares with a value at the start of the three years equal to the value of the pre-tax bonus invested in the purchased shares.
For 2003 half of the matching award is based on the Companys total shareholder returns compared with the FTSE 100 companies and half is based on total shareholder return compared with the group of 13 UK financial services companies used for the Executive Share Option Scheme see above.
Performance against each of these groups will be assessed separately.
The matching shares will be available in full only if the Companys Total Shareholder Returns is at the upper quartile of the group: half of the award will be available if the Companys Total Shareholder Returns is at the median of the group and in proportion between these two points.
The performance target applies over a xed three-year period.
This scheme is to be discontinued as part of the changes in remuneration policy.
Long Term Incentive Plan Details of the Companys ordinary shares over which the directors have conditional rights under the Long Term Incentive Plan are as follows: Conditional Value Conditional rights held Shares of shares Conditional rights held under LTIP Conditional awarded awarded rights under LTIP at at 1 January rights granted during during 2003 lapsed 31 December Conditional rights 2003 during 2003 2003 during 2003 2003 4 D G Jones 8,196 8,196 M J Millington 18,617 2,196 11,364 16,421 M A Pain 22,481 22,481 Y Jetha 15,456 15,456 64,750 2,196 11,364 16,421 46,133 Shares held Shares held These shares are in trust at Shares Shares in trust at receivable in: 1 January awarded transferred 31 December Shares held in trust 2003 during 2003 during 2003 2003 2004 2005 M J Millington 4,326 2,196 6,522 M A Pain 4,867 4,867 4,867 9,193 2,196 6,522 4,867 4,867 1 Shares sufficient to satisfy the conditional rights granted under the long term incentive plan during the year were bought in the market and are held by the Abbey Employee Trust the Trust, which is administered by an independent professional trustee.
The cost of these conditional rights, net of write back of amortisation of lapsed rights, is being credited charged to the profit and loss account over the three year performance period to which they relate.
In 2003, 1,086,472 2002: 573,617 was credited charged to the profit and loss account.
2 Shares are awarded to directors upon the relevant performance criteria being met.
Directors receive 50% of the shares awarded to them three years from the date the conditional rights are granted and the remainder five years from the same date.
The shares awarded form part of directors emoluments in the year in which they are received and are disclosed at the value of the shares on the date of receipt by the directors.
3 The aggregate maximum value of the conditional rights and shares held in trust shown above, based on the maximum number of shares that are receivable by the directors if Abbey is ranked in the top quartile of both the relevant comparator groups, and on the market price of the Companys ordinary shares at 31 December 2003, the last day of trading in 2003, 531p 2002: 518p, would have been 270,810 2002: 383,025.
As stated above, all conditional rights are subject to performance criteria.
The directors do not receive any of the shares if Abbey is ranked below the median of both the relevant comparator groups.
Shares held in trust are not subject to any further performance criteria.
4 The entitlement of D G Jones over the conditional rights held at 31 December 2003 are subject to the relevant performance criteria being met.
Such entitlement to the conditional rights has been determined pro-rata to the period of service completed within the three year performance period to which those rights relate.
5 By virtue of their being potential beneciaries of the Trust, each executive director is deemed, for the purpose of the Companies Act 1985, to have an interest in the shares held in the Trust.
At 31 December 2003, the Trust held 1,580,736 ordinary shares 2002: 1,559,738 ordinary shares for the above-named directors.
