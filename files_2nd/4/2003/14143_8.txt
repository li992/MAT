Remuneration policy The principal objectives of the Remuneration Committee, which is chaired by Mr R B Pointon and comprises the Non-executive Directors, are to attract, retain and motivate high quality senior management with a competitive package of incentives and awards linked to performance and the interests of shareholders.
The Committee seeks to ensure that the Executive Directors are fairly rewarded taking into account all elements of their remuneration package in the light of the Groups performance.
The Committee has appointed Deloitte & Touche to provide independent market information and advice relating to executive remuneration and benefits.
This remuneration report will be put to shareholders for their approval as a separate ordinary resolution at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Basic salary The basic salary element is determined after evaluating the Executive Directors responsibilities and is based on the complexity, knowhow, decision-making involved and the overall impact on the business.
Account is taken of relevant external data that provides information to assist in the deliberations.
Basic salary is generally reviewed on an annual basis or following a significant change in responsibilities.
No increase was awarded to the Executive Directors on 1 April 2003.
Annual cash bonuses Annual cash bonuses are payable at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee as a percentage of basic salary dependent on corporate performance compared to target.
For the year to 31 March 2003, the Executive Directors potential cash bonus ranged from zero for a below target performance, 50% for achieving target, to a maximum bonus of 100%.
Cash bonuses are not pensionable.
No bonuses were earned for the year ended 31 March 2003.
Long term incentive plan Under the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 25 July 2002, senior employees may be granted an award annually, the vesting of which is subject to the attainment of two pre-determined performance conditions measured over a three year period.
Awards are in the form of a number of shares, the maximum value in any financial year cannot be more than 100% of basic salary as at the date of grant and calculated on the Companys share price at that time.
The first performance condition is based on Total Shareholder Return TSR, where the Companys TSR achieved during the three year performance period is measured against the TSR achieved by those companies that constituted the FTSE Support Services Sector immediately before the date of grant of an award.
An award will only vest in full if the Companys TSR results in it being ranked in the upper quartile of the companies in the comparator group where the company with the highest TSR is ranked first.
If the TSR of the Company results in a median position in the comparator group then 25% of the award will vest.
Vesting above the median position is on a sliding scale, with 3% of the award vesting for each percentile increase in the Companys rank above the median position up to the maximum award.
If the Companys TSR for the performance period results in a position below the median then the award will lapse.
The second performance condition is based on Earnings Per Share and for an award to vest, the average growth in the Companys Earnings Per Share, before taking into account goodwill and extraordinary or exceptional items, for the three year performance period, must exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index over the same period by at least nine percentage points.
No amendment may be made to the performance conditions which would be to the material advantage of participants without the prior approval of shareholders in general meeting.
The Shanks Group plc Employee Share Trust has been established for the purpose of granting awards under the LTIP and to hold the Companys shares either purchased in the market or new shares subscribed for, with funds provided by the Company or its subsidiaries.
As at 31 March 2003 the Employee Share Trust did not hold any of the Companys shares.
After approval of the LTIP by shareholders on 25 July 2002, conditional awards were granted under the LTIP plan on 5 August 2002.
The closing mid-market price of the ordinary shares of the Company on 5 August 2002 was 134.5p.
The conditional beneficial interests of the Directors in the ordinary 10p shares of the Company under the LTIP were as follows: Balance at Awarded Vested Lapsed Balance at 31 March during during during 31 March 2002 year year year 2003 M C E Averill 171,000 171,000 D J Downes 135,000 135,000 J R Meredith 91,000 91,000 Mr J R Merediths LTIP award lapsed on 1 April 2003 following his resignation as a Director.
2003 Share option schemes The Committee believes that share ownership by employees encourages the matching of long term interests between employees and shareholders.
All UK employees including Executive Directors, subject to certain service conditions, may participate in an Inland Revenue approved Sharesave scheme.
Senior executives are also able to participate in an Executive Share Option Scheme at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
With effect from 26 July 2001 unapproved executive share options may be granted annually up to a market value of one and a third times basic salary in the preceding period of twelve months.
Under the terms of the Savings Related Share Option Scheme for employees, options may be granted during the ten year period to August 2005 to acquire up to 10% of the issued equity share capital of the Company, including options granted under the Executive Share Option Schemes.
Options are granted at the higher of the nominal value and an amount determined by the Remuneration Committee being not less than 80% of the market value.
At 31 March 2003 options outstanding amounted to 2.5m ordinary shares see note 22 in the financial statements.
Under the terms of the Executive Share Option Schemes, options may be granted during the ten year period to August 2005 to acquire up to 5% of the issued equity share capital of the Company.
The exercise of options granted under the 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme, which is the only current scheme, is subject to a performance condition, achievement of which is a pre-requisite for exercise of options.
The condition is tested once only after a period of three years and if it is not achieved the relevant options will lapse.
Options granted after 26 July 2001 will only be exercisable if the Groups earnings per share, before taking into account exceptional and extraordinary items and goodwill amortisation for the three year measurement period, have increased by at least nine percentage points over the increase in the Retail Price Index for the same period.
The Remuneration Committee applied a different performance condition for options granted under the 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme prior to 26 July 2001.
These options may not be exercised unless the growth in the Groups earnings per share over the period of any three consecutive years after the date of grant equals or exceeds the increase in the Retail Price Index over the same period plus six percentage points.
Options are granted at the higher of the nominal value or the market value.
At 31 March 2003 options outstanding amounted to 6.3m ordinary shares see note 22 to the financial statements.
Performance review The following graph shows the Total Shareholder Return performance of the Company and that of the FTSE Support Services Sector Index over the five year period to 31 March 2003.
This index has been selected as it is a broad equity index of which Shanks Group plc is a constituent company.
Shanks Group plc Total Shareholder Return versus FTSE Support Services Sector Index 140 130 120 110 100 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 Shanks Group plc FTSE Support Services Sector Index Pensions Executive Directors are eligible for membership of the Shanks Group Pension Scheme, which is a funded, defined benefit scheme approved by the Inland Revenue.
Under the terms of this scheme the Executive Directors have: i at retirement, and subject to length of service, a pension of up to two thirds of basic salary subject to Inland Revenue limits: ii an employee contribution of 5% of basic salary: iii a lump sum death in service benefit of four times basic salary: and iv a spouses pension on death.
Mr D J Downes is subject to the Inland Revenue cap on approved pension benefits and is provided with comparable unapproved benefits for basic salary in excess of the cap via a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme FURBS.

ii The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service at the end of the year.
iii The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The calculation is based on the assumption that pensions will be paid from the earliest retirement age possible without the application of actuarial reduction factors i. e. 57 for Mr M C E Averill, 60 for Mr D J Downes and 62 for Mr J R Meredith.
iv The increase in transfer value has been calculated taking into account market conditions and the Directors ages as at 31 March 2003 and at 31 March 2002.
Directors emoluments The following table shows a breakdown of the emoluments of the individual Directors, excluding pension contributions to the defined benefit scheme and potential gains on exercise of share options, for the period of time during which they were Directors of the Group.
For the period following appointment on 30 May 2001.
Mr G H Waddell retired on 25 April 2002.
Mr J R Meredith resigned on 1 April 2003. i Other emoluments includes such items as a company car or car allowance, medical insurance, payments relating to FURBS and life assurance.
ii Mr M C E Averill and Mr D J Downes purchased their respective company car from the Company with effect from 1 April 2002 at market value and received a cash allowance instead of a company expensed car.
iii The Non-executive Directors do not participate in the annual bonus plan and do not receive any pension contributions from the Group.
iv Mr R C Biffa was also a shareholder and director of Radstrong Limited.
The fees in respect of Mr Biffas services as a Director of the Group were paid to this company.
v Mr J R Meredith left the Company on 1 April 2003.
He had a rolling service contract entered into on 2 July 2001 which required six months notice from Mr Meredith and one years notice from the Company.
Previously Mr Meredith had a service contract which required one years notice from Mr Meredith and two years notice from the Company.
Under the terms of his service contract the Company was obliged to compensate him for loss of office.
The termination payment in respect of this compensation for loss of office amounted to 183,000 and, in addition, Mr Merediths pension entitlement was enhanced by one years service at a cost of 30,000.
The figures for Mr Meredith in the Directors pension benefits table above include this enhancement.
Mr Meredith purchased his company car from the Company at market value.
Under the rules of the LTIP and the Executive Share Option Scheme both his LTIP awards and outstanding share options lapsed immediately after he left the Company.
2003 Directors service contracts and notice periods Mr M C E Averill and Mr D J Downes have rolling service contracts dated 29 September 1994 confirming previous arrangments, which require one years notice from the Director and two years notice from the Company.
Termination payments are limited to the Directors contractual remuneration including basic salary, any bonus earned and benefits for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
Any entitlement to LTIP awards or exercise of share options upon termination is governed by the rules of the relevant scheme.
Pensionable service will also accrue for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
In the event of early termination, the Remuneration Committee will consider carefully what compensation should be paid taking into account the circumstances of the particular case.
The Remuneration Committee does not believe that it would be reasonable to reduce the notice period already contained in the service contracts of Mr M C E Averill and Mr D J Downes.
However, the Committee has agreed that the notice period offered to new Executive Directors will be one year.
The Committee recognises that a two year notice period is not in accordance with the relevant provision of the Combined Code.
The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts.
External appointments The Remuneration Committee acknowledges that executive directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other quoted companies which have no business relationship with the Group and that these duties can broaden their experience and knowledge to the benefit of the Company.
Executive directors are limited to hold one such position and the policy is that fees may be retained by the director.
Mr M C E Averill was appointed to one such non-executive position in May 2003.
Directors interests in ordinary shares and share options The Directors interests, all beneficial, in the ordinary 10p shares of the Company, including shares over which options have been granted under the terms of the Groups share option schemes other than the LTIP, on 31 March 2003 and 31 March 2002 were as follows: Ordinary Shares Executive E and Savings Related S Share Options Date of Option Normal Exercise Dates 2003 2002 2003 2002 grant price p From To I M Clubb 30,000 10,000 M C E Averill 74,651 54,340 40,000 E 13.7.
