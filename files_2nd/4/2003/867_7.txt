Directors remuneration report This report sets out the policy and disclosures in relation to Directors remuneration.
At the Annual General Meeting of the company to be held on 5 May 2004, this Directors remuneration report will be submitted to shareholders for their approval.
This Report has been produced in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations.
The Report of the auditors on the financial statements covers the disclosures contained in this report that are specified for audit by the Regulations.
The following sections of the Directors remuneration report are auditable: Pensions, Directors detailed emoluments, Directors interests, Interests in share options, Restricted Shares, interests in awards under the long term incentive plan.
Composition and Terms of Reference of Remuneration Committee The Terms of Reference of the Remuneration Committee the Committee can be obtained on request to the Company Secretary at the Company's registered office.
The Committee is responsible for determining the remuneration and the terms and conditions of service of the Executive Directors.
The Committee also approves or determines the Companys policies for executive remuneration and their associated costs in particular in relation to members of the Executive Committee.
During the year, seven independent Non-Executive Directors were members of the Committee: Mr R D Lapthorne, Dr J S Patterson, Mr J Fr Odfjell, Mr D H Brydon, Mr J F Rejeange, Professor E Thorsby and Prof M Uhlen.
Up to his retirement from the Board, at the Annual General Meeting on 7 May 2003, the Committee was chaired by Mr R D Lapthorne.
Dr J S Patterson has been Chairman of the Committee since 7 May 2003.
The Chief Executive and the Group Human Resources Director also attend the meetings of the Committee, except when their own remuneration is being considered.
In 2003, the Board accepted all the recommendations of the Committee without amendment.
Non-Executive Directors The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is reviewed by the Chief Executive who makes recommendations to the Board.
The Board determines the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors within the limits set out in the Articles of Association.
The responsibilities of the role and the level of fees paid in UK organisations of a similar size and complexity to Amersham are considered in setting remuneration policy for Non-Executive Directors.
Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment.
They are normally appointed for an initial period of three years.
During that period, either party can give the other three months notice following which there would be no compensation.
Mr D H Brydon entered into a new letter of appointment dated 10 October 2003 which has a fixed duration of 12 months.
If Mr Brydon is required to resign before the expiry of the twelve month period, he is entitled to receive compensation of an amount equivalent to the fees and benefits he would have been entitled to receive had his appointment not been terminated before the expiry of the twelve month period.
After 10 August 2004 the Company shall be entitled, at its option, to extend his contract for a further period of up to 12 months.
Remuneration policy for Executive Directors In determining the remuneration policy for Executive Directors, the Committee has considered a number of factors including: - the importance of attracting, retaining and motivating management of the appropriate calibre to further the success of the business: - the linking of reward to both individual and business performance: and - ensuring that the interests of the Directors are aligned with those of the shareholders.
19 To this end, the Committee seeks to pay Executive Directors base salaries at a median level and incentives in the form of bonuses and long-term option arrangements at an upper quartile level when compared to compensation levels and packages in other companies of comparable size and complexity, and also in companies in the same business sector.
The total package is aimed to lie between the median and upper quartile.
For 2004, the Committee aims to target 50% of total package in the form of fixed remuneration base salary and benefits and 50% performance-related remuneration target annual bonus and Black Scholes value of annual share option awards.
In making this assessment, the Committee has assumed a level of share option awards similar to that in 2003.
However, given the impending takeover by GE, the Committee does not intend to make any awards in 2004.
In 2003, the ratio was 50% fixed and 50% performance-related remuneration.
In 2003, the Committee considered a valuation of all elements of Executive Directors remuneration to ensure that it was aware of the total remuneration within the company and its selected comparators.
This valuation approach included the use of the Black-Scholes option valuation technique for assessing the value of long term incentives.
The same approach will be used in 2004 based on hypothetical awards from the company similar to those granted in 2003.
In establishing this policy, the Committee has appointed independent consultants, New Bridge Street Consultants, who provide advice on remuneration and share plans both for Executive Directors and the wider executive population.
The Committee has also appointed Watson Wyatt who provide advice on pensions both for Executive Directors and advice to the company as a whole.
Neither New Bridge Street Consultants nor Watson Wyatt provide any other services to the Company.
In addition, the Committee is advised on reward strategy by Mr. Malcolm Saffin, Vice President of Compensation and Benefits for Amersham.
The Committee has also received advice from the Chief Executive and the Group Human Resources Director, but not in relation to their own remuneration.
The Committee believes that the policy adopted in its remuneration of Executive Directors and senior managers has contributed to the sustained financial success and long term growth of the company.
This policy has enabled the company both to attract and keep a high calibre management team - essential for a well run and growing business.
The strong shareholder returns achieved by the company are a testament to this policy, which reflects best market practice.
This policy will continue to be reviewed in the light of changes in market practice and legislation, which impact upon the company.
The current elements of the remuneration packages can be summarised as follows: Base salary and benefits Base salaries for Executive Directors are reviewed by the Committee, normally annually, having regard to competitive market practice and individual performance for the financial year.
The general benefits provided to the Executive Directors are a fully-expensed car, pension, life, disability and health insurance and where appropriate relocation expenses.
Annual performance-related bonus The annual performance-related bonus is dependent upon a number of factors.
The level of bonus is payable on a sliding scale between 0% and 150% of the base salary.
Bonus payments totalling 2,586,590 2002 - 1,135,930 have been achieved, based on the financial performance measures attained for 2003, namely sales and operating profit, cash flow, growth in earnings per share and performance against a number of personal objectives for each Executive Director.
From 2003, the Committee intended that two-thirds of the bonus is paid in cash and one-third in the form of restricted shares, which would vest 50% on the second anniversary of the bonus payment date and 50% on the third anniversary of the bonus payment date.
However, due to the proposed acquisition of Amersham by GE, the bonus for 2003 will be paid entirely in cash.
20 Share option schemes Tax approved and unapproved Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS are available to Executive Directors and senior managers.
Options granted to Executive Directors prior to 2001 under the terms of the 1993 Executive Share Option Scheme are subject to the attainment of growth in the groups earnings per share of at least 6% more than the increase in the Retail Prices Index over any three consecutive financial years prior to the exercise of the option.
Options granted to Executive Directors from 2001 under the terms of the 2001 Executive Share Option Scheme are not normally exercisable until the third anniversary of the date of grant and to the extent that the performance conditions specified prior to the grant of the option have been satisfied.
For options granted to Executive Directors in 2003 which are detailed in the Interest in share options table on page 27, 50% of each option grant will vest if the companys normalised earnings per share growth as determined by the Committee matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 3% per annum.
The entire option grant will vest if the companys normalised earnings per share growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 5% per annum.
There is proportionate vesting between 3% and 5%.
Performance is always measured from the end of the financial year prior to the grant of the option.
25% of the options may vest after one year with a further 25% after two years and a further 50% after three years.
To the extent that these targets are not achieved by those times, the performance period will be extended, one financial year at a time.
To the extent that the performance conditions have not been met by the fifth anniversary of the grant, the option lapses.
Option grants made to Dr A Carr in 2001 and 2002 are not subject to performance conditions as he was not an Executive Director at the date of grant.
On change of control of Amersham, the Committee has discretion to determine the extent to which any conditions should be deemed to be met.
After considering the implications of the proposed acquisition by GE, the Committee approved the vesting at completion of all options for Executive Directors under ESOS 2001.
If the proposed acquisition of Amersham by GE proceeds, then no Amersham share option awards are planned in 2004.
Although performance conditions are not a common feature of option plans operated by our international competitors, we recognise that as a company with our primary listing in the UK, it is appropriate that options granted to our Executive Directors are subject to performance conditions.
The performance conditions we have chosen mean that options will only vest when there has been a correspondingly good return for our shareholders.
More demanding performance conditions would mean that the Black-Scholes valuation of share options awarded would be lower and therefore in order to maintain the same Black-Scholes value of award, higher option grants would need to be given.
The beneficial interests of the Executive Directors in share options are shown on page 27.

Amersham plc FTSE 100 Index Pensions Sir William Castell is entitled to a total target pension upon retirement at age 60 of 60% of the average of his last three years' basic salary.
The pension payable by the company will be this target pension, less pension benefits earned in previous employments.
This pension will also include the pension which could be notionally secured by Sir William Castell from past salary supplements relating to his Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme FURBS..
The whole of the total target pension is being funded, through a combination of approved and unapproved arrangements.
Details of the accrual of his pension are provided below.
Mr G W Battersby, Mr G F B Kerr and Mr P Loescher accrue pension benefits through a combination of approved defined benefit arrangements, unapproved defined contribution arrangements and salary supplements.
Details are shown below of the defined benefit accrual.
"The contribution to the FURBS and salary supplement elements are identified in the column headed ""pension contributions"" in the table on page 25."
Dr A Carr accrues a defined benefit pension through both UK and US pension arrangements.

This notice period was reduced in 2002 from two years and new service contracts were entered into as follows: Director Employing company Date of contract W M Castell Amersham plc 1 March 2002 G W Battersby Amersham plc 1 March 2002 A Carr Amersham Biosciences UK Limited 16 December 2002 G F B Kerr Amersham plc 1 March 2002 P Loescher Amersham plc 1 December 2002 The Committee believes that in order to attract Executive Directors of the right calibre and to compete for talent with our competitors, it is necessary to offer service contracts with notice periods of one year, which explicitly set out the provisions relating to termination of the contract.
Under the terms of the Executive Directors service contracts, on termination of employment by the company, except in the case of dismissal for cause, the company shall make a payment to the Executive Director equal to 95% of: a the Executives basic salary for the period of notice, b the cost of provision of pension and benefits for the notice period and c the bonus applicable for the notice period, based on the actual bonus paid in the previous three years.
Such payment shall be reduced proportionately in the event that the Executive works part of his period of notice.
When the company has given notice of termination, such payment shall be made within three months of the date of notice.
Any payment shall be entirely discretionary when the Executive has given notice of termination.
In the event that the employment is terminated for any other reason, such payment shall be made forthwith.
There are no special provisions in the event of a change of control of the company except for Mr Battersby.
In the event of a change of control of the company, which leads to Mr Battersby leaving the company within a period of 12 months following such change of control, the pension element of the Agreed Payment detailed above may be enhanced by up to five years contributions.
Variations following the proposed acquisition by General Electric and GE Investments Inc In connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by General Electric and General Electric Investments Inc, the service contract of each Executive Director, with the exception of Sir William Castell, was varied on 10 October 2003.
As a result of such variation, and with effect from the time when the acquisition completes, the notice period which the relevant employing company or the director is required to give to the other to terminate the directors employment is reduced to three months.
In addition, the varied service contracts provide that if the Acquisition is completed, each Executive Director, except Sir William Castell, is entitled to a special payment which is to be paid in two equal instalments, 6 and 12 months after the acquisition is completed.
The amount of the payment is to be calculated in accordance with the existing termination provisions of a directors contract of service which allows for a termination payment equal to 95 per cent of the aggregate of a directors base annual salary, the average of the bonuses paid to him in the preceding three years, and amounts attributable to the loss of pension and other benefits.
In addition, under the varied service contracts each Executive Director is entitled to receive a retention bonus equal to 75 per cent of his base annual salary at the date of completion of the acquisition which will be paid 9 months after the acquisition is completed or, if relevant, 9 months after any public announcement that the acquisition will not proceed.
24 Neither the retention bonus nor any instalment of the special payment will be paid to a director if he resigns or his employment is terminated by reason of gross misconduct before the due date for payment.
Details of the payments are summarised below: Director Retention Bonus Special Payment G W Battersby 219,750 626,427 A Carr 267,083 767,276 G F B Kerr 247,500 825,289 P Loescher 426,750 1,454,146 Notes In addition Mr Battersby will be paid 668,040 on completion in respect of the pension entitlement under his contract.
These amounts will be based on $US.

Sir William Castell Conditional upon the acquisition Sir William Castell will cease employment with the company and become employed by the General Electric Company under a new service contract.
No compensation will be paid in respect of the cancellation of Sir William Castells contract with Amersham.
The Committee agreed that in accordance with the review of Sir William Castells pension arrangements, scheduled to take place in the first quarter of 2004, Sir William Castells FURB, should be fully funded for past service and that the funding should be based on yields from indexlinked gilts, as recommended by the companys actuary.
