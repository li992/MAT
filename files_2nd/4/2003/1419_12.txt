Annual Report and Accounts 2003 39 Remuneration report continued Long-term incentives Until 2003, the only long-term incentive received by executive directors was share options as described below.
Proposals have now been made for the introduction of a new performance share plan for executive directors and other key executives.
Agreement is being sought from shareholders at the 2003 annual general meeting and details of the proposals will be found on pages 82 and 83 in a note to the resolutions proposed at the annual general meeting.
Share options There are two Associated British Foods Share Option Schemes under which Inland Revenue approved and unapproved options may be granted.
Under their service contracts, Peter Jackson and John Bason were both entitled to receive an annual allocation of share options for each of five years and three years respectively, commencing December 1999.
The committee has agreed that although share options may continue to be granted on a selective basis, share option awards will now not form part of the normal ongoing remuneration package for executives.
Other benefits In line with comparable executive packages, executive directors are also entitled to the provision of a fully expensed company car, private medical insurance, life assurance, home and mobile telephone costs and the reimbursement of reasonable business expenses.
The taxable value of these benefits is included in the table of directors remuneration below.

Directors pensions The aim of the Remuneration committee is that retirement benefits should be in line with good practice of major companies in Continental Europe and the United Kingdom.
In accordance with this policy, executive directors are covered by final salary defined benefit arrangements and can retire at their normal retirement age with retirement benefits broadly equivalent to two thirds of final pensionable salary.
The company pension schemes are Inland Revenue approved.
For Peter Jackson final pensionable salary includes basic salary and company bonus.
This contractual arrangement was put in place in 1999.
Directors pension disclosure for year ended 13 September 2003 The table below shows the defined benefit pension entitlements from the company pension schemes, and unfunded unapproved arrangements where appropriate, of executive directors of Associated British Foods plc during the year ending 13 September 2003.
Pension entitlements and corresponding transfer values increased as follows during the year: Increase Total Directors Value of Value of Value of Total Increase in accrued accrued contributions net increase accrued accrued change in in accrued pension net pension at during in accrual pension at pension at value during pension of inflation 13.9.
George Weston remains in the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme but his active membership of the scheme has been suspended since the start of his employment in George Weston Foods on 31 March 2003.
He remains covered for life assurance purposes.
He also maintains his directorship.
Harry Bailey was in receipt of pension throughout the year: his directorship ceased with effect from 5 December 2002.
There was no increase to his accrued pension over the period since his pension benefits were entirely accrued before the start of the period.
2 The pension values E, F and G are transfer values calculated in accordance with version 8.1 of guidance note GN11 issued by the actuarial profession.
Annual Report and Accounts 2003 41 Remuneration report continued 3 The value of net increase in pension E represents the incremental value to the director of his pension benefits during the year, resulting from additional service and increases in salary, and in the case of Peter Jackson, the recognition of year two of a three year annual bonus plan.
It is based on the increase in accrued pension net of inflation B after deducting the directors contribution during the year D. 4 The change in the transfer value H includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the company and directors, such as stock market movements.
The directors contributions during the year D are excluded from this value.
5 John Bason accrues pension in the Associated British Foods Pension Scheme up to the earnings cap.
In order to provide a pension on his earnings above this level, the company has established an unfunded unapproved retirement benefits scheme.
George Weston was subject to a similar arrangement until 31 March 2003.
6 Additional voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
7 Pension benefits include a 50% spouses pension except in the case of Peter Jackson where there is a two thirds spouses pension payable on death before or after retirement, and pensions are guaranteed to increase in payment in line with RPI limited each year to 5%.
Additional discretionary increases to pensions in payment have been granted in the past.
Directors share options At 13 September 2003 the market value of the companys ordinary shares over which employee options are issued was 535p.
During the previous twelve months the price ranged from 468p to 612p.
As at 13 September 2003, the following directors had outstanding options to acquire ordinary shares of Associated British Foods plc.
During the period no options were exercised.
03 Exercise from which Expiry Number Granted Number price exercisable date Peter J Jackson 100,000 100,000 561.50p 28.4.

With the exception of the grant in 2000-1, these allocations have been fulfilled under the rules of the Associated British Foods plc 1994 Share Option Scheme 42 Associated British Foods plc which was in existence when the contractual arrangements were put in place.
The rules of the 1994 scheme require options to be held for five years before they become exercisable, but options granted are not subject to any performance conditions.
Following shareholder approval of the Associated British Foods 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme in December 2000, share option grants made under this new share option scheme are subject to performance criteria based on the achievement of specific levels of business performance over a three year period.
Three year stretching financial targets, based on increased profit and return on total investment, were set for all businesses in September 2000 and the 2000-1 executive directors contractual share option allocations were fulfilled using this new 2000 Share Option Scheme.
The company performance targets set for Peter Jackson and John Bason in respect of the options granted in January 2001 have now been met, and all these options will be exercisable from 17 January 2004.
Subsequent grants of options to Peter Jackson and John Bason have been made under the 1994 Share Option Scheme as no new three year targets have been set.
George Weston was also granted options under the Associated British Foods 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme in January 2001.
The business performance targets set in September 2000 for Allied Bakeries have not been met and consequently only 50% of these options will be exercisable from 17 January 2004.

Directors service contracts It is the committees policy that all executive directors have rolling service contracts with twelve month notice periods.
The Articles of Association of Associated British Foods plc require that all directors retire from office at every third annual general meeting.
The details of the directors contracts of service are set out below: Effective Notice Notice date of period period Date of current from from appointment contract company director Martin G Adamson 11.10.99 11.12.02 6 months 6 months Peter J Jackson 1.8.
00 12 months 12 months Professor Sir Roland Smith Retired 13.9.
03 N a N a N a Lord MacGregor 9.12.94 16.11.99 6 months 6 months Michael R Alexander 16.1.
03 6 months 6 months Harold W Bailey Retired 5.12.02 N a N a N a The board has not considered it appropriate to enter into a formal letter of appointment with WG Galen Weston in view of his relationship with the ultimate holding company of Associated British Foods plc, Wittington Investments Limited.
He receives no fees for performing his role as a non-executive director and Associated British Foods plc does not reimburse him for any expenses incurred by him in that role.
The committee believes that twelve months notice periods for executive directors are in line with market practice.
The Remuneration committees policy is that all cases of termination should be dealt with fairly whilst taking a robust line in minimising any compensation.
The executive directors contracts do not include specific provisions concerning termination payments as the committee believes that it is more able to respond appropriately to particular circumstances.
The Remuneration committee has given due consideration to the recommendations contained in the revised Combined Code regarding inclusion of explicit provisions in directors service contracts for compensation commitments in the event of early termination.
The committee will continue to keep its current practice under review.
Directors beneficial interests The directors of the company at the 2002-3 year end had the following beneficial interests, including family interests, in the shares and debentures of the company, its holding company and fellow subsidiary undertakings: 13 September 14 September 2003 2002 Martin G Adamson 15 Associated British Foods plc, ordinary shares of 5 22p 30,000 20,000 George G Weston Wittington Investments Limited, ordinary shares of 50p 5,862 5,862 15 Associated British Foods plc, ordinary shares of 5 22p 3,146,761 3,146,761 Peter J Jackson 15 Associated British Foods plc, ordinary shares of 5 22p 20,000 17,600 John G Bason 15 Associated British Foods plc, ordinary shares of 5 22p 8,500 6,000 WG Galen Weston Wittington Investments Limited, ordinary shares of 50p 37,953 37,953 15 Associated British Foods plc, ordinary shares of 5 22p 5,672,560 5,672,560 Lord MacGregor 15 Associated British Foods plc, ordinary shares of 5 22p 2,045 2,045 10.
