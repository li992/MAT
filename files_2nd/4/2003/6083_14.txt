34 FKI plc Annual report 2003 Remuneration report Information not subject to audit Composition and role of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is responsible for formulating executive remuneration policy and for determining the remuneration of the executive directors and certain senior executives.
Its members are the non-executive directors as follows: Mr C R N Clark Chairman Mr K Orrell-Jones Mr R P Edey Mr M S Hodgkinson Mr J S Rodewig All the above served on the Remuneration Committee throughout the year.
All the non-executive directors are considered by the company to be independent.
Although Mr Rodewig has been a director for ten years, he is considered by the company to be independent and his US experience is of particular value.
Mr Rodewig is due to retire in November 2003.
The Committee is advised internally by the Group Chief Executive, Mr Heiden, who succeeded Mr Beeston on 2 January 2003.
During the year the Committee received information from Towers Perrin, New Bridge Street Consultants and Mercer Human Resource Consulting.
None of these organisations provide any other services to the company.
In accordance with the requirements of the revised Companies Act, an ordinary resolution seeking shareholders approval for the Remuneration report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Remuneration policy The Remuneration Committees objectives are to ensure that the company is able to: attract, retain and motivate high calibre staff: and align the interests of the executive directors and senior executives with those of shareholders by rewarding executive directors and certain senior executives according to the overall performance of the Group.
The company believes strongly in pay for performance.
Variable pay under the annual bonus and long-term incentive schemes can form a higher proportion of total pay than is typical in the UK market.
Incentive opportunities are designed to deliver above median total rewards in the event of superior performance.
Any payments made to executive directors other than basic salary are not pensionable.
The fees paid to non-executive directors and the Chairman are determined by the Board after reviewing fee payments for comparable positions within similar organisations, and are normally reviewed every three years.
The last review was in 2000 so fees would normally be reviewed in 2003.
However, the Chairman and the non-executive directors have unanimously decided not to accept an increase in fees for at least 12 months.
Basic salary and benefits Basic salary is reviewed annually having regard to market practices for similar executive positions in a comparator group of companies in the engineering sector and supported by advice from external independent consultants.
They are generally benchmarked at the lower quartile positioning against the comparator group.
Any increases reflect both individual and business performance.
Executive directors also receive additional taxable benefits, namely the provision of a fully expensed company car or an allowance in lieu thereof, medical insurance and disability insurance.
35 FKI plc Annual report 2003 Remuneration report Performance related bonus scheme The company operates an annual performance related bonus scheme for certain executive directors and senior executives based on the budgeted pre-tax profits of the Group, and also an annual performance related bonus scheme for the remaining executive directors and certain senior executives with operating group responsibilities, based partly on the performance of the respective operating group for which they are responsible, and partly on the budgeted pre-tax profits of the Group as a whole.
Both bonus schemes have the potential to lift total remuneration above the median for the comparator group of companies in the event of superior performance.
A performance related bonus of 25% of salary is payable for achieving 90% of the applicable pre-tax budgets.
The bonus increases on a straight line pro rata basis from 25% to 50% of salary for achieving between 90% and 100% of the budgeted pre-tax profits.
The bonus increases on a straight line pro rata basis from 50% to 100% of salary for achieving between 100% and 110% of the budgeted pre-tax profits.
The Remuneration Committee has the right to exercise its discretion regarding the level of awards in exceptional circumstances.
None of the executive directors serving during the two years ended 31 March 2003 earned a bonus under the performance related bonus scheme.
Non performance related bonus The company agreed, at the time Mr Heiden joined, to compensate him for the 60,000 value of shares issued as part of a bonus scheme of Mr Heidens former employer which were due to vest in March 2003 but were forfeited as a result of his leaving to join FKI.
Long Term Incentives The company operates two forms of share based incentive schemes for executive directors and senior executives.
Participants in the Long Term Incentives are encouraged to retain part of their vested awards, such that they will be expected to accumulate a minimum shareholding in the company of one times basic salary over five years.
Executive Share Option Scheme The company operates an Executive Share Option Scheme, approved by shareholders in 2001, designed to encourage long-term retention of key staff.
Executive directors are eligible to receive options on an annual basis.
In normal circumstances, the maximum level of grant each year to executive directors is limited to options over shares with a value of one times basic salary.
On appointment, Mr Heiden was granted options over shares with a value of twice his annual salary for each of the first two years of his employment.
The Board considered this was appropriate in order to assist in the recruitment of a Chief Executive.
The normal practice is to grant options within a period of six weeks following the announcement of the companys preliminary and interim results.
Options are granted at the mid-market price of FKI plc ordinary shares on the third dealing day before the grant date and normally are required to be held for a minimum of three years before they are capable of exercise.
They expire after ten years.
All executive options granted from July 1996 onwards may only be exercised subject to a performance condition that the Groups growth in earnings per share, as defined below, must exceed the UK retail price index by 9% or more over a three year period, subject to re-testing in subsequent years from a rolling base.
Earnings per share growth is considered to be the most appropriate measure of the companys underlying performance, as it requires that there should be a demanding improvement in the companys performance before scheme participants can benefit from an increase in the share price.
The assessment as to whether performance conditions have been met is calculated by the Secretary to the Remuneration Committee and independently verified by the Remuneration Committee and an external independent firm of Chartered Accountants.
Earnings per share are defined as the companys headline earnings per share, as calculated in accordance with the principles set out in Statement of Investment Practice No.
1 The Definition of IIMR Headline Earnings issued by the Institute of Investment Management and Research.
IIMR Headline earnings are calculated by excluding from the reported FRS 3 results any profit or loss items of a non-trading or capital nature.
A table giving full details of the directors options granted and exercised during the year under review is shown on page 41.
36 FKI plc Annual report 2003 Remuneration report Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The company operates a LTIP which was approved by shareholders in 2001 and under which participants receive annual conditional awards of shares in the company of a value equal to up to 70% of basic salary per annum, which may vest only after the achievement of certain long-term performance conditions.
Participants may receive up to the maximum number of shares, three years after the award, provided the performance conditions are met.
Until then, the shares are held in a trust which is administered by a trustee company.
The level of vesting of awards under the LTIP is determined by the performance of the companys total shareholder return against a comparator group of all companies which on the date of grant are constituent companies of the Engineering and Machinery Index as determined by the FTSE Actuaries Industry Classification Committee, excluding those not listed at the end of a three year performance period.
No awards vest for below median performance and 50% of an award will vest for median performance.
Full vesting occurs only at upper quartile performance, and 75% of an award will vest for performance above the median but below upper quartile.
Accrued dividends on vested awards are paid to the executives pending transfer of the shares into the name of the respective participant.
The performance condition is based upon total shareholder return as this is considered to be the best means of aligning the interests of directors with shareholders by requiring superior total shareholder return performance compared to competitor companies.
The assessment as to whether the performance conditions have been met is independently calculated by Mercer Human Resource Consulting in conjunction with Datastream and is ratified by the Remuneration Committee.
During the year ended 31 March 2003, the performance period relating to the 1999 award expired.
The Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion, in accordance with the rules of the scheme, to include in the final peer group two companies which had been previously omitted, both having been put into receivership during the three year performance period.
The Remuneration Committee considered the change to be fair and reasonable such that, were an adjustment not made, the terms of the scheme would cease to be a fair measure of performance.
As a consequence of this adjustment, 30% of the award became exercisable.
As required under the rules of the Scheme, Ernst & Young LLP confirmed that the adjustment was considered fair and reasonable.
A table giving full details of the Directors LTIP awards that were granted vested and exercised during the year under review is shown on page 42.

37 FKI plc Annual report 2003 Remuneration report Inland Revenue Approved Save-As-You-Earn share option scheme This scheme was approved by shareholders in 1997 and is open to all UK employees who have completed six months service and who enter into an approved savings contract for a term of three or five years.
The maximum amount which can be saved is 250 per month, and the total savings including interest at the end of the term are available to purchase shares at 80% of their market value shortly before the start of the savings contract.
Executive directors may participate in this scheme on the same terms as all other employees.
Service contracts It is the companys policy that all executive directors have one year rolling service contracts with a one year notice period.
However, in order to attract high calibre recruits, the Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion to offer newly recruited executive directors an initial two year notice period which reduces to one year.
Save as listed below, there are no express provisions for compensation payable upon early termination of the executive directors contracts and at the date of termination, other than payments due during the notice period.
In the event of termination of a service contract by the acquiring company after a change of control of the company, there is a provision in the service contracts of Messrs Biles and Jones for a payment of liquidated damages equivalent to two years salary, bonus and contractual benefits including contributions to the executive directors pension arrangements, without deduction for mitigation and or accelerated receipt.
An identical provision exists in the service contract of Mr Gott except that the payment relates to one year instead of two.
In the case of Mr Heiden, in the event of termination of a service contract by the acquiring company after a change of control of the company, there is a provision in his service contract for a payment of liquidated damages equivalent to one years pay and contractual benefits without deduction for mitigation and or accelerated receipt.
If a change of control occurs prior to the expiry of the second anniversary of 2 January 2003, a sum would be payable equivalent to the greater of that payable as above and 90% of the salary, bonus and contractual benefits which would have been paid between the date of termination and the expiry of the third anniversary of 2 January 2003.
The contract dates and notice periods for the executive directors during the year were as follows: Name of director Date of contract Notice period P Heiden 16 December 2002 Initially two years from 2 January 2003, reducing to one year after the first year J A Biles 14 January 1998 One year S D Jones 6 July 1998 One year R L Gott 8 April 2002 One year R G Beeston 21 November 2001 One year Mr Beeston retired as a director on 5 February 2003.

Its main features, in respect of executive directors, are: a A cash benefit on death in service of four times annual rate of the highest average basic salary restricted to the earnings cap where it applies during any three consecutive years within the ten years before the members date of death.
b Pensions payable in the event of ill health.
c Pensions for dependants on a members death generally equal to half the members prospective retirement pension at 60 on death in service, or half the members pension entitlement on death in retirement.
d Member contributions are 5% of basic salary restricted to the earnings cap where it applies.
Mr Biles pays no contributions to the FKI Group Pension Scheme.
There are funded and unfunded unapproved pension arrangements to increase the pension benefits where because of Inland Revenue limitations including those resulting from the earnings cap these cannot be paid in total from the Scheme.
Such arrangements apply to Messrs Biles and Gott.
In lieu of participation in the FKI Group Pension Scheme, Mr Heiden receives contributions into a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme equivalent to 50% of his basic salary.
Details of the directors pension benefits during the year under review are shown on page 40.
External appointments The company believes that there are significant benefits to the individual and the company from executive directors accepting non-executive directorships in other organisations.
Each executive director may accept one non-executive directorship provided that it does not conflict with the companys interests and is approved by the Board.
Fees from an external directorship may be retained by the director concerned.

40 FKI plc Annual report 2003 Remuneration report Directors pension benefits The undernoted directors were members of a defined benefit scheme provided by the Group during the year.
Pension entitlements and corresponding transfer values were as follows: Transfer value of increase Increase Increase decrease decrease in decrease in in accrued Transfer Transfer transfer accrued benefit less Accrued Accrued value of value of value less pension contributions pension at pension at pension at pension at contributions excluding made by 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March made by inflation directors 2003 2002 2003 2002 directors Name of director 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Mr J A Biles 1.6 24.8 8.4 6.6 125.1 91.4 33.7 Mr R L Gott 1.6 1.9 14.9 13.0 128.6 108.9 12.6 Mr S D Jones 10.2 88.9 62.7 51.6 543.4 418.6 113.9 Mr R G Beeston 1.0 18.0 23.4 24.0 435.6 436.3 0.7 1.
The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement, based on service to the end of the year or date of leaving the pension scheme or ceasing to accrue further benefit if earlier.
The increase in accrued pension during the year excludes any increase for inflation.
The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The calculation of each transfer value includes an allowance for the cost of death before retirement benefits.
The change in the amount of the transfer value over the year is impacted by the following elements: a the transfer value of the increase in accrued pension net of inflation : b the transfer value of the increase in accrued pension due to inflation : c the increase in the transfer value of accrued pension at the beginning of the year due to ageing: d the impact of any change in the economic or mortality assumptions underlying the transfer value basis: e the effect of a to d less the directors own contributions over the year.
The change in the amount of the transfer value over the year includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the company and directors, such as stockmarket movements, which are reflected in d above.
Directors have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions.
However, neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the table.
Mr R G Beeston retired on 5 February 2003 and commenced drawing his pension.
His pension from the FKI Group Pension Scheme at the end of the year was 20,056 per annum.
His pension ceased to accrue on 5 April 2001.
The accrued pension at 31 March 2003 shown in the table above does not reflect the lump sum withdrawal of 33,716 made at retirement.
The figures for Mr J A Biles and Mr R L Gott allow for the impact of the earnings cap.
This includes the period of service prior to Mr Gott becoming a director.
During the year, the company decided to increase contributions to a funded unapproved retirement benefits scheme to 30% of Mr Biless basic annual salary in excess of the earnings cap.
The total contributions were 49,451 in the year to 31 March 2003 30,877 to 31 March 2002.
The company has established for Mr Gott an unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme which together with the Inland Revenue capped benefits from Mr Gotts membership of the FKI Group Pension Scheme are designed to provide him with total benefits, at his normal retirement age of 60, equal to fifty per cent of his final pensionable salary.
Mr Gott and Mr Heiden were appointed directors on 8 April 2002 and 2 January 2003, respectively.
Mr Beeston retired from the Board on 5 February 2003.
All executive share options were granted at nil cost to the director concerned.
The market price of an ordinary share on 31 March 2003 was 64p 2002: 192.5p and the range during the year was 57p to 192.5p.
Executive share options granted prior to 1996 are not subject to a performance condition.
All executive share options granted in 1999 and subsequent years are exercisable from the dates stated above, subject to them satisfying the performance condition stated in the policy section.
The closing number of share options held by Mr Beeston as at his retirement date on 5 February 2003.
Messrs Gott and Heiden were appointed directors on 8 April 2002 and 2 January 2003, respectively, and Mr Beeston retired from the Board on 5 February 2003.
The extent to which Mr Beestons awards may be exercisable within 12 months of his retirement date will be assessed in accordance with the scheme rules.
The companys total shareholder return performance for the three year performance period that ended in 20022003 ranked in the second quartile against its comparator group and under the terms of the rules applicable to the 1999 awards, 70% of the awards lapsed.
The price of an ordinary share on the date that the awards were made was 88.5p on 6 January 2003 and 143p on 8 July 2002.
The awards are subject to the performance conditions for LTIP awards, as outlined in the policy section.
The value of the shares that vested during the year is calculated at 99p per share, being the market value on the vestment date on which the shares were first transferable to the directors.
The market value of shares as yet unvested is stated at 64p per share, being the closing midmarket price on 31 March 2003.
As at 31 March 2003, the company was ranked below median in its comparator group for each of the awards granted in 2000 to 2003, inclusive.
If these ranking positions were to be maintained until the end of the respective performance periods, none of the awards would vest.
