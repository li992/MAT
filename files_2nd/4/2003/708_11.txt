Cash award Audited In November 2002, the Remuneration Committee made awards of deferred cash bonuses to certain senior executives including the four Executive Directors.
These awards were made to take the place of grants of options under the Long Term Incentive Scheme which would have been made but in the event could not properly be made because of consolidation activity in the industry.
In making these awards the Remuneration Committee took account of the value created for shareholders.
The structure of the award has been designed to retain those executives who are eligible to receive the awards.
The award was equal to 100% of base salary as at 1 January 2003.
The payment of the award is subject to the executive remaining in employment on the payment dates.
Half of the award was paid on 1 September 2003 and the other half will be paid on 1 September 2004.
