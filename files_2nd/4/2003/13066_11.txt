The CEO is not present Service agreements when the Committee discusses his own remuneration.
For newly appointed Executive Directors, the Committee has agreed Throughout 2003, the Company complied with the provisions of a policy that termination payments, including compensation paid Schedule A of the Combined Code published in June 1998 relating during any notice period, should not exceed 12 months pay.
Service to the design of performance-related remuneration except where contracts should be rolling and terminable on six months notice.
In preparing this report, the Board has followed the Contracts should also provide liquidated damages of six months provisions of Schedule B of the Combined Code.
The contents of base salary, plus an amount equal to one times the average bonus comply with the Directors Remuneration Report this report also paid if any in the two years up to termination.
In agreeing this policy, the Committee decided that any bonus Approved by the Board on 12 March 2004. earned should be included in the termination payment, on the basis that a high proportion of pay is related to Company results and that, in the event of termination for unacceptable business performance, it is unlikely that any bonus will have been paid.
Liquidated damages also provide clarity for shareholders and executives, and are usual among Reckitt Benckisers peer group.
Dr Peter Harf Chairman of the Remuneration Committee In 2003 the existing Executive Directors, agreed to changes to their service agreements to align them with this policy please refer to Table 3 at the end of this report.
Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements, but are subject to re-election by shareholders every three years.

Adrian Bellamys annual fee as Chairman was set at 220,000, and the net proceeds of 40,000 of this fee must be used to acquire shares in the Company which he is obliged to retain until he steps down from the Board.
