Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Directors Remuneration Report This Report is prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985, which applies to the Company for the first time this year.
As the Board of Directors is comprised solely of Non-Executive Directors, it is exempt under the Listing Rules from appointing a Remuneration Committee.
The determination of the Directors fees is a matter dealt with by the whole Board.
It is the Companys policy to determine the level of Directors fees having regard to the level of fees payable to Non-Executive Directors in the industry generally, the role that individual Directors fulfill in respect of Board and Committee responsibilities and the time committed to the Companys affairs.
Following a review in 2002 of Directors fees the basic annual fee paid to the Chairman and each Director were increased in line with the Companys peer group to 22,500 and 15,000 respectively from 1 October 2002.
As a result the current annual aggregate limit on fees payable to the Board of Directors under the Companys Articles of Association of 100,000 needs to be raised.
Consequently, Resolution 10 will be put to Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to propose increasing the threshold for the maximum aggregate annual fees to 150,000.
No element of the Directors remuneration is performance related and no Director past or present has any entitlement to pensions, and the Company has not awarded any share options or long-term performance incentives to any of the Directors.
The Directors interests in contractual arrangements with the Company are as shown on page 25 of the financial statements.
Subject to these exceptions, no other Directors were interested in contracts with the Company during the period or subsequently.
None of the Directors have a service contract with the Company.
The Board requires that Directors shall not remain in office for longer than three years without submitting themselves for re-election.
A resolution to receive and adopt the Directors Remuneration Report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Directors and Officers liability insurance cover is maintained by the Company on behalf of the Directors.
Total Shareholder return The chart shown below illustrates the total Shareholder return for a holding in the Companys shares as compared to the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index adjusted capital return.
