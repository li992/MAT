His 1999 and 2000 cash long-term incentive plans had four-year performance periods ending 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2003 respectively.
The payouts in both cases depended on Jackson National Lifes US GAAP net income in the final year.
For the 1999 award the results led to no payments while the 2000 awards led to a payment from only the phantom share award of 107,639.
Michael McLintock Michael McLintocks 2000 and 2001 cash long-term incentive plan had a three-year performance period and the same performance conditions described in the section on long-term incentive plans on page 40.
For the 2000 award the phantom share price at the beginning of the performance period was 1 and as a result of M&Gs profit growth and fund performance of M&G over the three years, the phantom share price at the end was 1.36.
This resulted in a payment from the phantom share award of 306,000 and a phantom option award of 367,800 units, of which he exercised 183,900 valued at 66,204.
For the 2001 award, the phantom share price at the beginning of the performance period was 1 and as a result of M&Gs profit growth and fund performance of M&G over the three years, the phantom share price at the end was 1.20.
This resulted in a payment from the phantom share award of 270,000.

DIRECTORS PENSIONS AND LIFE ASSURANCE It is the Companys policy to offer executive directors the facility to save for retirement through efficient pension vehicles.
Changes introduced by the UK Government in 1989 restrict the pension provision which can be made under Inland Revenue approved pension schemes for new entrants after 31 May 1989 to benefits on annual basic salary up to a threshold known as the earnings cap.
The earnings cap for the 2003 2004 tax year is 99,000 per annum.
For this reason UK executive directors employed since 1989 are offered a combination of Inland Revenue approved pension schemes and supplementary provision.
The Governments changes to these regulations will take effect from April 2006.
The Company will consider any necessary changes to its policy and the provision of benefits once the details of these changes are confirmed.
