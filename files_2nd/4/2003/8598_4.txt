Remuneration report This report is made by the Board on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee.
The first part of the report provides details of remuneration policy.
The second part provides details of the remuneration, pensions and share interests of the Directors for the year ended 29 March 2003.
The Directors confirm that this report has been drawn up in accordance with the Combined Code and the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations.
Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee meets at least three times a year.
Its responsibilities include setting the remuneration policy for all Executive Directors and determining the remuneration for individual Executive Directors.
It is chaired by Keith ButlerWheelhouse and comprises all of the Non-Executive Directors, namely Sir George Bull, June fide Moller, Jamie Dundas, Lord Levene and Bridget Macaskill.
During the year, the Committee received advice on general remuneration matters from Linklaters and Towers Perrin, who were instructed by the Company, and on specific issues from ABN Amro and UBS Warburg, who were instructed by the Committee.
They also provided various banking, legal and employee benefit services to the Company.
The Committee has appointed Towers Perrin to provide advice direct to the Committee for the new financial year.
The Committee considers the views of the Group Chief Executive and the Group HR Director when reviewing the remuneration of the other Executive Directors, but neither is involved in discussions concerning their own remuneration.
Remuneration policy The Remuneration Committee adopted a remuneration policy in 2002 consistent with the Companys business objectives which: attracts, retains and motivates high calibre Directors: in general terms, sets base salary broadly in line with median market practice, whilst moving total remuneration towards upper quartile market levels for superior performers: creates overall packages in which performance related elements form a significant proportion: reinforces the performance orientated culture by providing enhanced rewards for stretch performance: supports short-term and long-term incentive plans which are targeted at both personal and Company performance: aligns the interests of Directors with those of the shareholders by linking share and cash incentive payments to performance: and is based on information from a range of remuneration sources, which takes into account the retail sector as well as other large companies of a comparable size and complexity.
The policy will continue to apply for the next financial year.
For subsequent years, the Committee will review the policy on a regular basis and recommend changes as and when appropriate.
The main components of Executive Directors remuneration are set out below: i Basic salary Basic salary for each Director is determined taking into account professional advice based on assessments of the Directors performance, experience and responsibilities, and advice on market factors, which provides the best available benchmark for the Directors specific position.
ii Incentive arrangements In addition to basic salary, the Company maintains incentive arrangements which combine an annual bonus plan with long-term incentive share plans.
The Committee believes that these arrangements provide rewards which reflect an appropriate balance between personal and Company performance.
As such, they align the rewards of Directors with the Companys immediate business priorities and the long-term interests of shareholders.
The proportion of each Directors total remuneration that is performance related is significant.
Approximately 70 per cent of the Group Chief Executives total remuneration is linked to performance, assuming target level is achieved under the bonus plan and that the Board agrees to the release of half of the total number of shares available for 2003 04 performance under the Share Award Plan described below.
For the other Executive Directors, the proportion of total remuneration delivered through bonus and under the Performance Share Plan is 40 per cent, assuming target levels are achieved.
Share options also provide a performance rated incentive, but as the exercise prices of all outstanding grants were above the market price of Sainsburys shares at the year end, they are not included within this percentage.
If the share price were to increase, the proportion of performance related remuneration would be higher.
In order to maximise value from the incentive plans, performance measures are designed to ensure that participants are not rewarded for the delivery of the same measures through different elements of the package.
Accordingly, relative total shareholder return is the measure for the Performance Share Plan, which rewards executives for maximising shareholder returns over the medium term, whilst earnings per share growth applies to the Executive Share Option Plan, which ensures that executives are focused on the underlying financial performance of the business as well as on absolute share price growth.
The performance measures for the Share Award Plan focus on the achievement of specific profit targets and key business milestones, and the successful implementation of succession plans.
12 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2003 The incentive arrangements may be summarised as follows: Annual Bonus Plan A cash bonus is awarded subject to a condition based on year on year profit growth and individual targets, which are key to the businesses performance.
The bonus is a percentage of basic salary, with a maximum of 80 per cent for Executive Directors, other than the Group Chief Executive, whose maximum award is 100 per cent of basic salary.
That part of the bonus relating to Company performance will only be paid if the threshold level of year on year profit growth has been achieved and a pro rated bonus will then be paid up to a maximum level of profit growth.
That part of the bonus relating to individual targets can be earned if any year on year profit growth is achieved and the maximum which can be earned for individual targets is 20 per cent of basic salary.
Performance Share Plan This Plan allows shares to be allocated to individuals on a conditional basis, but not released unless the performance criterion is met over the three year performance period.
The number of shares actually released depends upon the Companys performance compared with 12 comparator companies namely Ahold, Boots, Carrefour, Dixons, GUS, Kingfisher, Marks & Spencer, Morrisons, Next, Safeway, Somerfield and Tesco.
In future years Casino and Loblaw will be added to the comparator group.
The Companys relative performance is determined by reference to Total Shareholder Return, being the increase in the value of a share, including reinvested dividends, over a three year period.
If the performance criterion is satisfied, the individual is granted an option to acquire the shares which can be exercised over the following 10 years.
In 2002, the Committee revised the Plan to strengthen the link between rewards and Company performance.
Under the revised structure, no awards will be made unless median performance is achieved at the end of the three year performance period.
At median level, shares to the value of 30 per cent of salary will be released and the award will be pro rated at every position between the median and first position in the comparator group.
The maximum allocation for Directors is a conditional grant of shares equal to 75 per cent of salary.
This performance measure will apply to conditional awards made in 2003.
Sir Peter Davis does not participate in this plan.
Executive Share Option Plan At last years Annual General Meeting, shareholders approved the Executive Share Option Plan 2002.
The maximum annual option award is two times basic salary and the actual grants are agreed by the Committee according to the assessed performance and potential of participants.
The exercise of options is conditional upon a performance target based on the growth in the Companys underlying earnings per share before goodwill and exceptionals EPS relative to inflation over a three year period.
The Committee reviews the performance condition prior to the annual award of options to ensure that it is set at appropriately challenging levels.
For the 2003 04 grant, no options will be exercisable for average annual real growth of less than 3 per cent per annum over the three year performance period, 50 per cent of the option will be exercisable if average real growth of 3 per cent per annum is achieved and, for average real growth of 5 per cent per annum, the option is exercisable in full, with a pro rating between 3 per cent and 5 per cent.
EPS is measured against a fixed starting point over a performance period of three financial years beginning with the year in which the option is granted.
To the extent that the condition is not satisfied in full after three years, it will be retested over four and then over five financial years.
To the extent the condition is not met after five financial years, the option will lapse.
Share Award Plan 2003 On 14 March 2003, the Company announced that, at the request of the Board, Sir Peter Davis had agreed to extend his time with the Group and will assume the role of Chairman on 29 March 2004.
In conjunction with the appointment, the Board believed that it was appropriate to award a package of restricted shares in the Company to Sir Peter in respect of his extended term in office.
The new award will be in the form of conditional awards of restricted shares to be released on 31 July 2005, subject to the achievement of specific profit targets and business milestones set by the Committee and dependent on the successful implementation of succession plans.
Accordingly on 27 March 2003, two conditional awards of one million shares and 500,000 shares were made to Sir Peter under the terms of the restricted Share Award Plan, to be held by the Companys Employee Share Ownership Trust and released to him on 31 July 2005 provided that he remains in employment as Chairman until that date and that the following conditions have been met: a 300,000 shares will be released if: business transformation targets and timescales in respect of the renewal of the supply chain network, the implementation of new IT systems and the programme for introducing new store formats, opening new stores and extending and updating stores have been achieved in the reasonable opinion of the Board in line with the agreed programme for 2003 04: and to the extent the same is within Sir Peters control, he has used his best endeavours to procure that a new Group Chief Executive designate is appointed acceptable to the Nomination Committee by 31 March 2004 or such longer period as the Board decides: and a Non-Executive Deputy Chairman has been appointed acceptable to the Nomination Committee by 31 March 2004: b 700,000 shares will be released if the Companys profits for 2003 04 are at least 90 per cent of the profit level agreed by the Board in the financial, budgeting and corporate planning process.
350,000 shares will be released if at least 70 per cent of the J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2003 13 Remuneration report continued agreed profit level has been achieved, with a pro rata number of shares between 350,000 and 700,000 being released for profit between 70 per cent and 90 per cent of the agreed profit level.
The second award will be released to Sir Peter on 31 July 2005 if the following conditions have been met: a 300,000 shares will be released if: business transformation targets and timescales in respect of the renewal of the supply chain network, the implementation of new IT systems and the programme for introducing new store formats, opening new stores and extending and updating existing stores have been achieved in the reasonable opinion of the Board in line with the agreed programme for 2004 05: and to the extent the same is within Sir Peters control, he has used his best endeavours to procure that the new Group Chief Executive and the Non-Executive Deputy Chairman have been introduced to their new responsibilities and supported appropriately by him by 31 March 2005: b 200,000 shares will be released if the Companys profits for 2004 05 are at least 90 per cent of the profit level agreed by the Board in the financial, budgeting and corporate planning process.
100,000 shares will be released if at least 70 per cent of the agreed profit level has been achieved, with a pro rata number of shares between 100,000 and 200,000 for profit between 70 per cent and 90 per cent of the agreed profit level.
The Board shall other than in circumstances of early vesting be capable of adjusting the number of shares to be released referable to profit and business transformation targets downwards or upwards if, in the reasonable opinion of the Board, the Company has in the relevant financial year materially underperformed or outperformed by comparison with other publicly quoted food retailers.
In relation to leaving the Company or a change in control occurring the following will apply: subject to the following points, where Sir Peter leaves before the release date for the shares, the award will lapse and no shares will be received.
either if Sir Peter leaves before the release date of the shares due to: early retirement agreed by the Board: or dismissal including constructive dismissal by the Company other than for cause : or death or, if there is a change in control, then the awards will vest and the shares will be received on the date of leaving or the date of the change in control as the case may be: the vesting event.
The number of shares received referable to profit will be calculated by reference to the budgeted profit for the period from the commencement of the relevant financial year up to the vesting event.
If the vesting event occurs in the financial year 2003 04 then the award related to profit for 2004 05 shall be 50 per cent of the number of shares to be released in relation to 2003 04.
The business transformation targets shall be deemed satisfied.
iii Other share schemes In order to encourage share ownership, the Company provides two all employee share plans for its UK employees, namely the Savings Related Share Option Scheme and the Share Incentive Plan, which has two parts, the Commitment Shares Plan and the Share Purchase Plan.
Directors may participate in these plans in the same way as all other colleagues.
The final payment under the Employee Profit Sharing Scheme was made in August 2002.

Members of the scheme have the option of paying additional voluntary contributions.
Neither these contributions nor the resulting benefits are shown in the above table.
In the case of Sir Peter Davis, John Adshead, Roger Matthews and Sara Weller, the Company has agreed to make up that portion of the standard pension entitlement which is in excess of Inland Revenue limits.
This obligation is unfunded, although full provision of 2,552,000 has been made in respect of the period ended 29 March 2003 2002: 1,616,000.
Performance Share Plan Under the Plan, shares conditionally allocated to individuals are released to them in the form of options if the performance condition is met at the end of the three year performance period.
No shares will be released if the Companys position at the end of the three year period is below the median: 50 per cent of the shares will be released at median performance: the full award will be released at upper quartile performance, and between median and upper quartile performance pro rata awards will be made.
2The above figures for 2002 show the maximum awards that will be released if the Company achieves first position within the comparator group.
Shares to the value of 30 per cent of salary will be released at median performance.

They also include the beneficial interests in shares which are held in trust under the J Sainsbury Profit Sharing Scheme and the Sainsburys Share Purchase Plan.
3The Executive Directors are potential beneficiaries of the Companys employee benefit trusts, which are used to satisfy awards under the Companys employee share plans, and are therefore treated as interested in the 24.8 million 2002: 25.1 million shares held by the Trustees.
4The Companys Register of Directors Interests contains full details of Directors interests, shareholdings and options over ordinary shares of the Company.
