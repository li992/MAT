Report on directors remuneration This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations, which introduced new statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors remuneration.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Companys members on the audited information within the directors remuneration report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
As a result, the report has been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
This report sets out the Companys policy on directors remuneration for the forthcoming year and, so far as is practicable, for subsequent years.
Unaudited information Membership and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee comprises three independent non-executive directors, Anthony Illsley the Chairman, Colin Day and Nick Hartley.
The committee meets at least twice a year.
During the financial year, the committee has met seven times, in addition to meetings to allot shares under the Companys share option schemes.
The committee has responsibility for making recommendations to the Board on the compensation of senior executives and determining, within agreed terms of reference, the specific remuneration packages for each of the executive directors.
The Board has delegated to the Remuneration Committee responsibility to: Make recommendations to the Board in respect of the remuneration policy for executive directors and the Groups other senior management: Approve any new service agreement entered into between the Group and any executive director: and Make recommendations to the Board on the implementation of the Groups performance bonus scheme, share option schemes and the Management Combination Incentive Plan.
KPMG and Norton Rose have provided professional services to the committee in respect of the easyJet Management Combination Incentive Plan and the share option schemes.
Salary surveys and job evaluation consultancy services have been provided to the Group by the Monks Partnership.
Policy The Groups policy for senior executive remuneration is to reward its executives competitively having regard to the comparative market place in order to ensure that they are properly motivated to perform in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
Service contracts The Company has service contracts with all its executive directors.
It is Company policy that for executive directors such contracts should contain notice periods of not more than six months.
There is no provision for compensation for loss of office other than the notice period of six months.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts but are appointed for a period not exceeding three years.
Their appointment may be terminated without compensation.

The remuneration for executive directors comprises a combination of basic salary, annual bonus, pension contributions and participation in share option and gift schemes.
Basic salary and pension contributions Basic salary is set relative to market rates based on the respective directors experience and the complexity of his her duties.
The Group pays into defined contribution pension schemes for executive directors at 7% of their base salaries.
Full details of the executive directors remuneration is set out on page 42 for their remuneration and page 43 for their share options.
The basic salary and pension contributions are supplemented by various performance-related elements, such as the annual bonus scheme, management combination incentive plan and share option schemes see below.
The Remuneration Committee has concluded that these performance-related elements form a significant proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors.
Annual bonus scheme An annual bonus scheme exists for all executive directors.
Ray Websters bonus is derived from a base bonus of 50% of salary and Chris Waltons bonus is derived from a base bonus of 25% of salary.
The actual bonus earned is calculated with reference to performance measures, namely personal performance and Company performance.
The Company performance element of the annual bonus scheme is reviewed against the following headings: safety record, operational performance, financial performance and other achievements and challenges.
These elements are felt to be challenging, aligned to shareholder interests and appropriate.
Performance against these two measures is assessed and can result in a multiple of up to 200% of basic salary for Ray Webster and 100% of basic salary for Chris Walton.
Management combination incentive plan To incentivise the management teams of both easyJet and Go Fly to ensure the successful integration of the two businesses, a management combination incentive plan was established.
Ray Webster and Chris Walton, along with 37 other members of the senior management team, were invited to participate.
The incentive plan allows for the award of ordinary shares divided into three equal tranches.
The number of shares in each tranche has been calculated by reference to the participants basic annual salary after completion of the purchase of Go Fly divided by the average price of an easyJet share during the 21 days following completion.
easyJet Annual report and accounts 2003 39 Report on directors remuneration continued Each tranche of shares is subject to the performance conditions.
These are based on the requirement to incentivise key management during the especially important period of the integration of easyJet and Go Fly.
The three milestones were identified as challenging in the timescale involved and aligned to shareholder interests.
They are as follows: 1 The single brand milestone, which is triggered if within 12 months of completion of the purchase of Go Fly, the combined business has common inventory held on eRes easyJets booking system, yield managed in an identical way and sold off the same website, together with common check-in services around the combined network: 2 The single AOC milestone, which is triggered if within 18 months of completion the combined business commences operation in the United Kingdom under one AOC: 3 The combination completion milestone, which is triggered if within 24 months of completion all substantial issues arising from the integration of the businesses of easyJet and Go Fly are complete.
The single brand milestone and single AOC milestone were met in January 2003.
Whilst substantial progress has been made in the achievement of the third milestone, managements final report, which is subject to third party verification, has not yet been made available to the Board.
Notwithstanding the above, the Board believes that it is appropriate to recognise the potential payment as part of the maximum reward under the Combination Plan achievable by the directors.
Share options The Group provides for directors to participate in share option schemes, which are also open to other staff members.
The schemes operated have been as follows.
The easyJet plc Key Employee Pre-Flotation Share Option Scheme Except for the 3,710,238 share options issued to Amir Eilon, a non-executive director, which vested wholly upon admission of the Company to the Official List of the UK Listing Authority during 2000, 25% of the share options granted vest or vested at the dates below: Date of admission of the Company: First anniversary of admission: Second anniversary of admission: and Third anniversary of admission.
Directors were not able to dispose of any shares that resulted from the exercise of options within two years from the date of admission to the Official List of the UK Listing Authority, except to the extent of settling their liabilities to personal tax, National Insurance contributions and the exercise price per option exercised.
All of the directors accepted the liability for employers Secondary National Insurance contributions due on the exercise of the first tranche of options.
It is also a condition of those options granted since March 2000 that the option holders accept liability for the employers Secondary National Insurance contributions due on the exercise of the options.
Once vested, the options remain in place should the director leave the Group and may be exercised within a period ending ten years from the date of grant.
The easyJet plc Non-Approved Discretionary Share Option Scheme: Awards were made of options over ordinary shares in easyJet plc in December 2001 and March 2003 to eligible easyJet Group employees, including directors.
The options granted are subject to a three-year vesting period and will be exercisable subject to meeting performance criteria.
The performance criteria are based on a sliding scale of earnings per share as published in easyJets annual report and accounts for the completed year in which the option will vest.
The Remuneration Committee chose these performance criteria because they were felt to be challenging, aligned to shareholder interests and appropriate at the time.
40 easyJet Annual report and accounts 2003 The easyJet plc Approved Discretionary Share Option Scheme: Awards were made of options over ordinary shares in easyJet plc in December 2001 to eligible employees of the Group on terms that meet Inland Revenue requirements for an approved share option scheme.
There are certain circumstances for example injury, ill health, redundancy where options under any of the schemes above can be exercised before the three-year vesting period has been completed and without the performance criteria being met.
We believe that these circumstances are the same as other scheme rules for comparator companies.
In March 2003, options were granted to executive directors and senior executives under the easyJet plc NonApproved Discretionary Share Option Scheme within the scheme limits.
These limits relate to the number of shares under option and the price payable on exercise.
The maximum limit for the grant of options to an executive director in any one year is equal to one times his her annual basic salary.
The grant of options will only become exercisable if the performance criteria, determined at the time of the grant, are achieved.
The Remuneration Committee recommended the relevant performance criteria because they were felt to be challenging and aligned to shareholders interests.
Total shareholder return The following graphs show the Companys performance, measured by total shareholder return compared with the performance of the FTSE 250 index.
The FTSE 250 index has been chosen since it is an index of companies of similar size to easyJet.
