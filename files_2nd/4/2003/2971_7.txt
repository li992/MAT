As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Companys members on the auditable part of the Directors Remuneration Report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information Remuneration Committees composition and scope During the period the Remuneration Committee of the Board the Committee comprised three of the Non-Executive Directors Sir Harry Djanogly, Baroness Noakes and Baroness Wilcox, the Chairman of the Committee.
The Committee is responsible for determining the pay and benefits and contractual arrangements of each Executive Director.
The Chairman and Chief Executive attends meetings of the Committee except when his own remuneration is being considered.
Remuneration policy Executive Directors The Committees policy for the current and subsequent financial years is to provide remuneration packages for the Executive Directors which are appropriate to the size and nature of the business and which will attract and retain high calibre executives.
It is the Committees policy that a substantial proportion of the Executive Directors remuneration should be performance related to encourage and reward superior business performance and that remuneration should be linked to both individual and Company performance.
Accordingly, Executive Directors may earn up to an additional 90% of their basic salaries as a performance bonus and benefit from participation in the Long Term Incentive Plan the LTIP and the Share Option Scheme as set out below.
The individual salary, bonus and benefit levels of the Executive Directors are, and will continue to be, reviewed annually by the Committee.
In particular, the Committee is undertaking a review of the longer-term arrangements for the Executive Directors remuneration, with particular emphasis on selecting an appropriate replacement for the LTIP which expires in 2004.
The Committee has followed the provisions of the Combined Code when designing performance-related remuneration schemes.
It is the Committees policy to employ Executive Directors under contracts with an indefinite term subject to termination by notice given by either party, normally of 12 months.
These employment contracts do not provide for termination payments other than, in the case of early termination by the Company, payment in lieu of notice.
Non-Executive Directors The fees of the Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board.
It is the Boards policy to set these fees according to the recommendations by the Chairman and Chief Executive who makes such recommendations with reference to current fee levels in similar businesses.
It is the Companys policy to appoint Non-Executive Directors for a term of three years or one year if the Non-Executive Director is aged over 70.
The appointment of Non-Executive Directors is subject to re-election in accordance with the Articles of Association and Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts with the Company.
Details of individual Directors remuneration and share options are set out on page 27 of this report.
During the period Shena Winning resigned with effect from 31 October 2002 and Darren Shapland was appointed as an Executive Director on 1 November 2002.
Martin Harris was a Non-Executive Director until 4 November 2002 when he became an Executive Director.
The main components of the remuneration package for Executive Directors are: Basic salary The Companys policy for future years is that basic salaries for Executive Directors should take into account the role and responsibilities, performance and experience of the individual set against salary levels for similar positions with companies of comparable size, profile and business sector.
Annual bonus For 2003 04 Executive Directors are eligible to receive an annual performance bonus up to a maximum of 90% of their annual basic salaries at the time the bonus is awarded.
The amount of bonus is based on the achievement of profit targets specified and agreed at the beginning of the year.
Bonus payments do not form part of the Directors pensionable earnings.
Share option scheme In order to align the interests of certain Executive Directors and senior managers with those of the shareholders, the Company introduced an Executive Share Option Scheme in 1993.
Under this scheme the Committee approved the granting of options as an incentive to achieve long-term success for the Company.
No further grants can be made under the scheme although some options remain outstanding these are shown on page 44.
For each participant in the scheme, the aggregate value of options to subscribe for new shares granted to each individual could not exceed four times annual remuneration in any 10 year period.
The options were granted at the average of the prevailing market share price on the three business days preceding the day before the date of invitation to apply for options.
The options cannot normally be exercised for three years from the date of issue.
There are no performance criteria attaching to the exercise of options under the scheme as this was not standard market practice when the scheme was introduced.
Long-Term Incentive Plan The LTIP was adopted to encourage the senior management team to achieve an excellent return for shareholders.
Under the LTIP members will receive a cash payment if the aggregate profit before tax reported to shareholders, excluding exceptional items and Carpetright plc Directors remuneration report continued Annual report and 26 accounts 2003 adjusted to take account of any significant changes in the Group, is greater than 190 million for the three years ending April 2004.

Performance graph The Company is required by the Regulations to present a five-year graph comparing the Total Shareholder Return the TSR of the Company with a relevant equity market index or group of similar companies.
