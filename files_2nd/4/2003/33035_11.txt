The Committee intends to review contracts in the 2004 financial year taking into account the joint statement of best practice on executive contracts and severance, published in December 2002 by the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds, and other relevant guidelines.
Outside appointments The Committee believes that there are significant benets, to both the company and the individual, from executive directors accepting non-executive directorships of companies outside BT.
The Committee will consider up to two external appointments of which only one may be to the Board of a major company, for which a director may retain the fees.
Non-executive directors contracts of appointment Non-executive directors have contracts of appointment.
They are normally appointed for an initial period of three years.
During that period, either party can give the other at least three months notice.
At the end of the period the appointment may be continued by mutual agreement.
Further details of their appointment arrangements are set out on page 53 in the section dealing with corporate governance issues.
The contracts of appointment of non-executive directors are terminable on notice by the company without compensation.
Non-executive directors remuneration Seven of the directors on the Board are non-executive directors who, in accordance with BTs articles of association, cannot individually vote on their own remuneration.
Therefore, non-executive remuneration is set by the Chairman and the Chief Executive after considering advice on appropriate levels of remuneration plus a general Board discussion.
The basic fee for non-executive directors, which includes membership of one committee, is 30,000 per year.
Additional fees for membership of Board committees range from 3,000 to 5,000 per year.
Sir Anthony Greener, Deputy Chairman and senior non-executive director, who also chairs both the Remuneration Committee and the Audit Committee, is paid an inclusive annual fee of 90,000.
Non-executive directors fees will be reviewed during the 2004 financial year.
To align further the interests of the non-executive directors with those of shareholders, the companys policy is to encourage these directors to purchase, 62 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2003 Report on directors remuneration Directors service agreements and contracts of appointment The dates on which the Chairmans and each current executive directors initial service agreement commenced and the current expiry dates are as follows: Chairman and executive directors Commencement date of initial service agreement Expiry date of current service contract Sir Christopher Bland 1 May 2001 a B Verwaayen 14 January 2002 b P Danon 19 November 2001 d A Green 19 November 2001 d I Livingston 8 April 2002 c Dr P Reynolds 19 November 2001 d a Sir Christopher Bland entered into a new service agreement on 19 November 2001, terminable on 12 months notice by either the company or the director.
