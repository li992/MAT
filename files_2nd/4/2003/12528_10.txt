16 REMUNERATION REPORT Compliance This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
As required, this Remuneration Report is being put to shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting for an advisory vote.
Throughout 2003, the company complied with Schedule A of the Combined Code regarding best practice on the design of performance related remuneration.
The company has given full consideration to the provisions regarding matters to be included in the Remuneration Report set out in Schedule B to the Combined Code.
The remuneration, including pensions and compensation payments, of all executive directors is determined by the Remuneration Committee and ratified by the Board.
The Committee is composed entirely of non-executive directors, Mr J R W Orange, who chairs the Committee and is the companys senior independent director, Messrs R V Emerson, S J Dobbie and I Gray.
None of the executive directors of the company are involved in determining their own remuneration.
The Committee consults with the Chief Executive and takes independent advice from Inbucon Consulting, a leading firm of remuneration consultants, which is appointed as an advisor to the Committee in respect of executive remuneration and share schemes.
Inbucon Administration, a sister company of Inbucon Consulting, administers the companys Executive Equity and Asset Incentive Scheme and the Share Incentive Plan.
The Inbucon group does not provide any other services to the company.
No other person or company materially assisted the Committee during the year.
Remuneration approach The companys remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages which ensure that directors and senior management are fairly and responsibly rewarded for their contributions.
The main components of executive directors remuneration are basic salary, an annual performance related bonus scheme with a deferred element, benefits, longer-term incentives and pension provision.
Remuneration therefore contains a suitable balance of direct performance related remuneration, which links both the short-term financial performance of the group and the long-term shareholder return with the executives total remuneration.
The remuneration package is weighted so that the majority of reward may potentially come from the performance related elements of the package.
The Committee endorses the principle of mitigation of damages on early termination of a service contract.
It is the Committees current intention to continue with the above remuneration approach for 2004 and subsequent years, although it will keep the matter under review.
The Committees current intention with regard to share options is that they will be awarded only in special circumstances.
The Executive Equity and Asset Incentive Scheme, which was introduced with shareholders approval in May 2001, expired at the end of 2003.
The Committee has considered what type of arrangement is appropriate to replace this scheme and is seeking shareholders approval of a similar new arrangement at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The companys Articles of Association provides that the remuneration paid to non-executive directors is to be determined by the Board within the limits set by the shareholders.
Performance chart The chart below shows the companys total shareholder return over the last five financial years compared with the equivalent information in respect of the Oil & Gas Exploration and Production sector, which the Committee considers to be the most relevant equity market index.
Although the company underperformed the index in the first two years, it has been ahead of this peer group over the last three years.

The Committee has previously agreed that the 24 month notice period for Messrs C J A Jamieson and J A van der Welle will not be renegotiated.
However, the contracts for the newly appointed directors, Messrs R A Allan and S C Lockett, are subject to 12 months notice periods and any executive director appointed in the future will be subject to a notice period not exceeding 12 months.
The Committee has considered what compensation commitments, including pension contributions, the executive directors contracts would entail in the event of early termination other than for non-performance.
In certain circumstances, the executive directors may receive compensation upon early termination of a contract.
This could amount to two years remuneration for Messrs C J A Jamieson and J A van der Welle, based on basic salary, bonus, benefits in kind and pension rights during the notice period.
For Messrs R A Allan and S C Lockett, this could amount to one years remuneration based on basic salary, bonus, benefits in kind and pension rights during the notice period.
Mr R T Liddell had a contract of employment with a notice period of termination of 12 months.
Mr Liddells contract was terminated on 31 January 2003 as a result of the restructuring of the company which was announced in September 2002.
As described in last years report, the company agreed a total termination payment with Mr Liddell of 496,320.80.
Of this amount 141,746 related to his pension entitlement, 285,775 related to his twelve month notice period entitlement plus a redundancy payment equal to one months salary for each year of completed service and 50,000 related to his entitlement to a performance related bonus.
Non-executive directors do not have contracts with a fixed duration.
Remuneration structure The remuneration package for the executive directors comprises base salary, benefits, bonus, pension, entitlement to participate in the companys all employee share schemes and long-term executive share schemes.
Base salary Base salary is reviewed each year against other comparable companies in the oil sector and general market data on the basis of companies in similar industries and those of a similar size.
The object is to ensure that the base salary, when taken together with the rest of the package, provides a competitive but performance driven remuneration package.
The base salaries of the executive directors are currently positioned between the median and the upper quartile.
While salary is reviewed by reference to market conditions, the performance of the company and the performance of the individual, the Committee would not regard this element of remuneration as directly performance related.
Premier Oil Annual Report & Accounts 2003 18 REMUNERATION REPORT Annual bonus scheme The annual bonus, which is non pensionable, consists of a payment of up to 50 per cent of salary immediately providing certain performance conditions are met, and a deferred payment of up to 50 per cent of salary for the same performance conditions.
Payment of the deferred part of the bonus is made in shares and deferred for three years.
The deferred element of the bonus is contingent upon the relevant beneficiary remaining in employment for the three years from the date of the award, but is not dependent on any further performance related measures.
The performance measures for 2003 were a combination of operational and financial.
They were based as to 60 per cent on the achievement of key targets in exploration and portfolio management, 30 per cent on the achievement of cash flow targets and 10 per cent on the achievement of health, safety and environmental targets.
The annual bonus scheme for the 2004 financial year has the same structure and maximum award level.
The performance measures for the 2004 bonus scheme are based as to 25 per cent on cash flow, 65 per cent on the achievement of key targets in exploration, portfolio management and strategic development, and 10 per cent on the achievement of health, safety and environmental targets.
Benefits Messrs C J A Jamieson and J A van der Welle receive the benefit of a car fully expensed by the company together with petrol cost, and medical insurance.
Messrs R A Allan and S C Lockett receive the benefit of a car allowance and medical insurance.
Mr Liddell ceased to be a director on 31 January 2003.
3,600 of Mr van der Welles remuneration relates to a salary supplement as part of his pension arrangements.
Messrs Allan and Lockett joined the Board on 9 December 2003.
Mr Alizai was paid US$116,600 2002: US$116,600 for advisory services undertaken for the group outside the UK.
Benefits in kind represent car and fuel benefits and medical insurance.

Mr Liddells award relating to 2002 was paid entirely in cash under the terms of his termination agreement.
The market price of total shares released as at 1 February 2003 was 107,328.
Shares to the value of 157,500 to be purchased for Mr Jamieson: and shares to the value of 100,000 to be purchased for Mr van der Welle.
Mid-market closing price on date of award.
The numbers and prices of shares awarded in 2001, 2002 and 2003 have been adjusted to reflect the 1 for 10 share consolidation on 12 September 2003.
19 Pension schemes audited Messrs S C Lockett and C J A Jamieson are members of the Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan the Scheme.
The Scheme is a funded, Inland Revenue approved final salary scheme which provides a pension of up to two-thirds salary at the normal pension age of 60.
Benefits are actuarially reduced on early retirement before age 60 and pensions in payment increase in line with the lower of inflation or 5 per cent per annum.
The pensionable salary applicable to Mr S C Lockett under the Scheme is restricted to the Inland Revenue earnings cap.
The company has agreed to provide Mr J A van der Welle with a pension substantially as if he were a contributing member of the Scheme and not subject to the Inland Revenue earnings cap: for life insurance purposes Mr J A van der Welle is a member of the Scheme.
The company extended the same provisions to Mr R T Liddell whose service terminated on 31 January 2003.
Mr R A Allan is a member of a money purchase pension arrangement to which the company contributed 1,215 during December 2003: contributions to this arrangement are made in respect of basic annual salary as restricted to the Inland Revenue earnings cap.
Consequent on the appointment of Messrs R A Allan and S C Lockett as directors, the company has agreed to provide them with a pension substantially as if they were contributing members of the Scheme and not subject to the Inland Revenue earnings cap.
The accrued pension entitlements of the directors who were members of the Scheme during 2003 are as follows: a b c d Increase from e Accrued Transfer value in Accrued Transfer value in d to b less Increase in pension as at respect of a as pension as at respect of c as contributions value on basis 31 December at 31 December 31 December at 31 December by director of Listing 2003 2003 2002 2002 during 2003 Requirements 000 pa 000 000 pa 000 000 000 C J A Jamieson 192.3 3,172.9 172.9 2,577.3 577.7 254.3 R T Liddell 9.2 122.8 8.6 98.9 23.0 5.3 S C Lockett 14.6 71.3 11.9 52.4 14.2 7.7 J A van der Welle 17.4 135.3 13.3 93.2 31.1 19.4 Notes: 1.
The amounts of accrued pension under a and c represent the deferred pension entitlements of the director as at the stated dates.
The transfer values under b, d and e have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the guidance note GN11: Retirement Benefit Schemes Transfer Values issued by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries.
The amounts under e represent the increase in value of the directors benefits in terms of the value, on the transfer value basis in force at the end of the year, of the excess of the endyear accrued benefits over the start-year accrued benefits as revalued by price inflation less contributions by the directors.
The values stated in respect of Messrs R T Liddell and J A van der Welle correspond with the target level of their final salary pension provision: in practice, the pension benefits for these directors are established through individual money purchase arrangements.
Mr R T Liddell left service on 31 January 2003 and the accrued pension under a relates to service completed to that date.
Members of the Scheme have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions.
Neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.
The following payments were made to former directors of the company in respect of unfunded pension liabilities: Amount of unfunded Amount of unfunded pension paid during 2003 pension paid during 2002 J A Heath 27,549 26,772 R J Lascelles 25,838 25,109 R C Shaw deceased 19 December 2003 84,777 82,388 Share option schemes audited The company believes that share ownership by executive directors and senior executives strengthens the link between their personal interests and those of shareholders.
The company currently operates three share option schemes.
The Scheme of Arrangement page 27 has affected two of these schemes.
In addition, and because of the effect of the Scheme of Arrangement, the company has adopted two new share option schemes to replace the Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 and the Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1999.
All numbers of shares and option prices in the following text have been adjusted to reflect the 1 for 10 share consolidation which occurred on 12 September 2003.
Premier Oil Annual Report & Accounts 2003 20 REMUNERATION REPORT Executive Share Option Scheme 1985 Share options awarded under this scheme can be exercised at the holders discretion between three and ten years after being awarded.
After ten years the options expire.
No grant of options under this scheme has taken place since 1994.
The Scheme of Arrangement has not affected this scheme because all outstanding options are already exercisable.
Options held under this scheme by Mr C J A Jamieson during the financial year are listed in the table below.
Mid market Acquisition Options price on Options Date of Exercisable price per held at date of held at Director grant dates option 01.01.03 Event exercise 31.12.03 C J A Jamieson 30.03.93 30.03.9630.03.03 2.619 21,000 Lapsed 30.03.03 27.04.94 27.04.9727.04.04 2.85 16,000 Exercised 13.11.03 4.09 18.10.94 18.10.9718.10.04 2.55 15,000 15,000 52,000 15,000 These options have become exercisable without the need to fulfil a performance requirement.
This is because the scheme was introduced and approved by shareholders at a time when performance criteria were not required by shareholders.
Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 Options granted under the 1995 scheme are normally exercisable not less than three years after their date of grant and will lapse unless previously exercised on their tenth anniversary.
Options cannot be exercised until pre-determined performance conditions have been achieved.
For options granted prior to 2000, the performance requirement was that the share price plus the value of dividends paid must, as measured at the end of any consecutive three-year period, have grown at a rate equal to or greater than the Oil Exploration and Production Index over the same period.
Options granted during and after 2000 are dependent upon growth in the companys earnings per share of at least 3 per cent pa compound above the retail price index over a three-year period.
The Committee believes that this is a challenging performance measure that in the long-term should reflect a good shareholder return.
The options could be exercised within six months of the court approving the Scheme of Arrangement or the options could be rolled over into options over shares of the new company.
Where the option holder elected to rollover his options the performance criteria will continue to apply.
The companies in the group consisted of Cairn Energy plc, Dana Petroleum plc, Paladin Resources plc, Premier Oil plc, Soco International plc, Tullow Oil plc and Venture Production plc.
21 Messrs C J A Jamieson, R T Liddell, S C Lockett and J A van der Welle held options under this scheme during the financial year which are listed in the table below.
There have been no changes in share options held by current directors since the year-end.
The market price of the companys shares at 31 December 2003 was 455 pence 31 December 2002: 290 pence and the range during 2003 was 237.5 pence to 457.5 pence, as adjusted by the Scheme of Arrangement.
Premier Oil Annual Report & Accounts 2003 22 REMUNERATION REPORT Executive Share Option Scheme 2003 This scheme replaced the 1995 scheme on completion of the Scheme of Arrangement.
Options granted under the 2003 scheme are normally exercisable not less than three years after their date of grant and will lapse unless previously exercised on their tenth anniversary.
No options were granted to directors in 2003 under this scheme.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1999 Under this scheme, approved by shareholders on 18 May 1999, employees including executive directors with six months or more continuous service are invited, within a period of 42 days of the announcement of the annual and interim results, to join the scheme.
Employees may save between 5 and 250 per month, through payroll deduction for a period of three or five years, after which time they can acquire shares at a discount of up to 20 per cent of the market value set at the time of invitation.

The scheme has two bonus pools, each pool being dependent upon one of the following two performance measures.
The equity bonus pool is created by comparing the market value calculated by reference to the average share price for the six months prior to the start of the period 16 May 2001 with the market value similarly calculated three years later.
The asset bonus pool is based upon the increase in the appraised net asset value of the business over a three-year period, from the start of 2001 to the end of 2003.
In either case there is no bonus pool unless there has been an increase in the relevant performance measure of at least 12 per cent compound per annum over a three-year period.
When a growth of 12 per cent compound per annum has been achieved then a bonus pool is created which is equal to 1 per cent of the increase in that measure.
When the growth is 25 per cent or more compound per annum, then a bonus pool is created which is equal to 2.5 per cent of the increase in that measure.
Between the above two points a proportionate calculation is undertaken.
The Committee believes that the growth in net asset value and the market value of the company are good short and long-term indicators of corporate performance and should reflect rewards only when the shareholders have also received reward.
In addition, vesting under either pool is dependent upon the Committee being satisfied that there has been an improvement in the underlying performance of the company over the three-year period.
The bonus pools are then distributed, with up to 33 per cent to the executive directors, 40 per cent to other executives and the remainder on a discretionary basis.
The individual participation is calculated according to a points system, the points being referred to as participation points.
Each participant has been awarded a number of participation points and these are compared to the aggregate number of participation points awarded for the purposes of calculating the individuals entitlement to part of any bonus pool.
Mr C J A Jamieson was granted 290 participation points and Messrs J A van der Welle and R T Liddell were both awarded 190 participation points in the executive directors pool on 16 July 2001.
Messrs R A Allan and S C Lockett were awarded 1.5 points and 1.1 points respectively, in both executive and discretionary pools.
The benefits under the scheme are paid half in cash and half in shares by dividing the cash value by the share price on the day prior to release of the award.
The cash payment will be released in 2004.
The shares have an additional holding period of six months before they are released.
As part of the termination package agreed with Mr R T Liddell, it was agreed that awards made to him under the scheme vested in their entirety, and outstanding awards vested and will be released without deduction on a pro-rata basis.
Mr Liddell has elected that his awards will vest on the normal vesting date and otherwise in accordance with the rules of this scheme.
Awards under this scheme half in cash and half in shares vested subject to performance up to the date of the Scheme of Arrangement.
Some participants elected to receive their awards at that date.
Mr R A Allan received 245,735 and Mr S C Lockett received 179,314 under the scheme.
These awards vested prior to them becoming directors.
As an alternative, participants were able effectively to roll over their awards under the scheme to reflect the restructuring of the company.
In this case, awards will vest subject to performance at the maturity of the scheme.
Messrs C J A Jamieson and J A van der Welle followed this course of action.
An independent external valuation of the asset pool was undertaken at the date of the Scheme of Arrangement to establish the difference between the base valuation and terminal valuation of the assets and the amount of such payments.
At that date, the total value of the pools was as follows: Total pool size Equity pool @ 2.6724 2,782,651 Asset pool 3,862,076 Total pools 6,644,727 Six month share price average to 14 July 2003.
The remaining awards are due to vest at the end of the second quarter of 2004.
The cash element of the award will be released immediately after vesting, the number of shares to be awarded will be calculated on the same date, but the shares will not be released until six months after the vesting date.
Premier Oil Annual Report & Accounts 2003 24 REMUNERATION REPORT Premier Oil plc Share Incentive Plan audited Under this plan, employees may make contributions to acquire shares in the company Partnership Shares.
In addition to the Partnership Shares, the Board has awarded a number of shares to each employee being an outright award of shares Free Shares, and if an employee agrees to buy Partnership Shares, the company currently matches the number of Partnership Shares bought with an award of shares Matching Shares, on a one for one basis.
In the case of the award of Free Shares and Matching Shares the company has not required performance criteria to be fulfilled, as the purpose of the scheme was to allow all employees to become shareholders in the company.
The company made an award of Free Shares to all company employees in the UK and overseas on 8 February 2002 of 526 shares per employee.
Following the 1 for 10 share consolidation, these have been adjusted to 52 or 53 shares in a manner approved by the Inland Revenue.
These shares will be held in a trust for a period of three years after which each director may leave the shares in trust, hold the shares in his own name, or sell them provided the director is in employment at the end of the three-year period.
Should an employee leave the scheme before the end of the three-year period he will lose the right to the Matching Shares, unless he leaves due to injury, redundancy, transfer of business, retirement, death or sale of the company.
The company invites all UK employees to make contributions to acquire Partnership Shares on a monthly basis.
Messrs R T Liddell and J A van der Welle contributed the maximum monthly amount of 125 to the plan.
Messrs R A Allan and S C Lockett also contribute the maximum 125 per month to the plan, but did not receive an award of shares between their appointment as directors and 31 December 2003 due to purchases being made at the start of each month.
The plan was amended following the Scheme of Arrangement to allow the use of shares in the new company.
