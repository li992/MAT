This annual grant level is competitive in the UK market and is consistent with the emphasis the Company places on share-based The table below sets out the share options that were granted to remuneration for its executives.

The Remuneration Committee considers this to be only where Shires EPS growth has not met the EPS test an appropriate measure given that Shire is a member of described above.
The annual average growth required over the the FTSE 100 and the same comparator group is used for first three years must be achieved over the extended performance remuneration benchmarking purposes.
