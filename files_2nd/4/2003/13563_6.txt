3 The transfer values stated represent liabilities of the Rolls-Royce sponsored pension schemes and not sums paid to the individuals.
The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11 GN11.
GN11 covers individual transfer calculations and the above gures have been calculated using assumptions certied by the Actuaries as being consistent with GN11.
4 The gure in brackets is the transfer value of the increase in pension retirement lump sum during the year ended December 31, 2003 excluding the effect of ination, and net of the members own contributions.
5 The Group operates the Rolls-Royce Supplementary Retirement Scheme SRS.
The purpose of the scheme is to fund pension provision above the pensionable earnings cap which was imposed on approved pension schemes under the 1989 Finance Act.
Membership of the scheme is restricted to executive directors and to a limited number of senior executives.
The members of the scheme include Mr A B Shilston.
He joined the Group after the introduction of the earnings cap and his terms and conditions on joining the Group included a commitment to provide pension and life cover based on total salary, in line with other directors and senior executives.
Employer contributions to this plan during 2003 have been added to the increase in transfer value over 2003 for the approved dened benefit plans, and are therefore included in the gures shown in the right hand column of the first table.
In addition, the employer has paid 37,000 to Mr A B Shilston directly in order to meet the income tax liability that he will incur on these employer contributions to the unapproved plan.
6 Members of the schemes have the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions.
Neither the contributions nor the resulting benets are included in the above table.
7 Benets are translated at US$1.64 1.
8 The lump sum entitlement shown is that which would be paid on immediate retirement based on service to the end of the year.
9 The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice.
10 Mr J M Guyette is a member of two dened benefit plans in the USA, one qualied and one non-qualied.
He accrues a retirement lump sum benefit in both of these plans.
The aggregate value of the retirement lump sums accrued in these two plans, and the transfer values of these benets, are shown in the second table.
In addition, Mr J M Guyette is a member of two 401 K Savings Plans in the USA, one qualied and one non-qualied, to which both he and his employer, Rolls-Royce North America Inc. contribute.
Mr J M Guyette is also a member of an unfunded non-qualied deferred compensation plan in the USA, to which his employer makes notional contributions.
Employer contributions to these three plans during 2003 have been added to the increase in transfer value over 2003 for the dened benefit plans, and are therefore included in the gures shown in the right hand column of the second table.
