Between 20% and 100% of the shares may be released on a sliding scale providing EPS growth exceeded UK RPI growth plus 5% per annum in each and every year of the performance period.
In the event that EPS growth failed to achieve UK RPI growth plus 5% in any one year the relevant award would lapse.
This performance condition was applied to awards granted in 1998 and 1999.
For awards granted in 2000 and 2001, the performance criteria required EPS growth to be a minimum of UK RPI growth plus 12% per annum in each year of the three-year period following the date of grant for the award of matching shares to vest in full.
Between 20% and 100% of the shares may again be released on a sliding scale provided EPS growth exceeded UK RPI growth plus 5% per annum.
The 2002 performance condition was that growth in the groups EPS over the relevant three-year period should exceed the growth in UK RPI over that period by an average of at least 7% per annum for the matching shares to vest in full.
If the average EPS growth during the performance period exceeds the growth in UK RPI by between 3% and 7% per annum, the matching shares will vest on a sliding scale between 20% and 100%.
If the groups average performance is 3% per annum, only 20% of the matching award will vest.
For average growth below 3% per annum, the matching awards will lapse.
The performance condition for the award granted in 1998 was fully satisfied.
The minimum performance conditions for the matching awards granted in 1999, 2000 and 2001 were not satisfied and therefore failed to vest.
