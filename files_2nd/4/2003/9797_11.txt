All shareholdings were unchanged as at 5 March 2004.
During the latter half of 2003, the Board carried out a wide ranging strategic review of options to maximise shareholder value, including consideration of a strategic acquisition, a disposal, alternative commercial and business strategies and a balance sheet restructuring to return value to shareholders.
As part of this process, the Remuneration Committee put in place certain incentivisation arrangements with each of Mr C. T. Burnett and Mr I. D. Burrell being related party transactions for the purposes of The Listing Rules of The UK Listing Authority.
Such arrangements would, in certain circumstances, in the event that the Company was acquired, have entitled Mr C. T. Burnett assuming an acquisition at or above a certain price significantly above the then current share price to a cash payment capped at 1.5 million and have entitled Mr I. D. Burrell to a cash payment of 150,000.
Mr C. T. Burnett, who was then Executive Chairman, did not participate in any of the Companys share option schemes or other long term incentive plans.
The Board subsequently concluded that a return of value was the best option for shareholders and the arrangements with Mr C. T. Burnett and Mr I. D. Burrell were therefore terminated without compensation.
Subject to the above, no Director of the Company has or had a disclosable interest in any contract of significance during or at the end of the year.
"There are no other disclosable transactions by the Group under FRS8, ""Related Party Transactions""."
There have been no other disclosable transactions by the Company and its subsidiaries with Directors of Group companies and with substantial shareholders since the publication of the last Annual Report.
