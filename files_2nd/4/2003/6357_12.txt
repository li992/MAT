Remuneration report This report sets out the companys remuneration policies and provides details of the remuneration of each of the directors.
The report will be put to the Annual General Meeting for approval by the shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee met five times during the period under review.
The members of the committee are Lord Condon Chairman and Jonathan Kitchen.
Sir Neil Macfarlane was a member until his retirement from the board in May 2003.
Advice on executive pay was provided to the committee by Monks Partnership, compensation consultants, who were appointed by the committee.
Advice on share-based incentive schemes was provided to the committee by New Bridge Street Consultants who for a number of years have advised the company on such matters, but who do not have any formal appointment.
Neither Monks Partnership nor New Bridge Street Consultants provided any other services to the company during the period under review.
Nick Buckles, the chief executive, provided guidance to the committee on remuneration packages for senior executives within the group.
Further guidance was received from the group HR department.
The groups remuneration policy is to ensure that individual rewards and incentives are directly aligned with the performance of the group and the interests of its shareholders and that packages are provided which attract, retain and motivate directors and other senior managers to perform at the highest levels.
This policy will be reviewed each year to ensure that it reects changing circumstances.
The various components of the directors remuneration are: a Basic salary and benets The salaries of the executive directors and other senior executives are reviewed at 1 October each year, having regard to responsibility, individual performance and salary and other market information supplied by Monks Partnership.
Benets include the provision of company cars, health insurance and life assurance.
b Performance-related annual bonus scheme The executive directors participate in a performance-related bonus scheme, payments under which are dependent on the attainment of dened profit targets of the group and which were for the year under review and are for the current year subject to a maximum of 50% of base salary.
No bonus payments were made for the year under review.
The target for the current year is based on the achievement of a specified profit before tax target for the group, excluding the effect of any exceptional items, discontinued operations and goodwill amortisation.
If any significant unbudgeted changes take place during the year, for example acquisitions or disposals, the profit target will be adjusted accordingly.
Achievement of the profit target will result in a payment of 25% of salary, increasing on a phased basis up to 50% for an over-target performance up to a specified gure.
A payment between 18.75% and 25% of salary will be made for achieving a profit gure below but within 5% of the target.
The payment of a bonus to an individual director may be reduced by up to 50% if that director achieves less than 80% of a series of specic business objectives agreed at the beginning of the financial year.
Bonus payments do not form part of salary for pension purposes.
c Executive Share Option Scheme The executive directors participate in the Executive Share Option Scheme the original scheme, having received grants of options prior to the scheme being amended the amended scheme following shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting in March 2003.
No grants of options have as yet been made to the executive directors under the amended scheme.
The original scheme, which provides for the selective grant of options to Securicor executives, is in two parts: an Inland Revenue approved part and an unapproved part.
Options were granted up to a maximum aggregate market value at the date of grant of four times the participants annual remuneration.
No options were granted at a discounted price.
The exercise of options is not normally permitted unless and until the groups earnings per share over a rolling three-year period have grown by at least 3% per annum above the growth in the retail prices index RPI.
Under the amended scheme, the market value of options granted to an executive in any one financial year is limited to twice basic salary, save that where an executive also receives an award under the Performance Share Plan in the same financial year the limit is normally reduced to one times salary.
The exercise of options is not normally permitted unless and until the groups earnings per share over a xed three-year period, subject to one retest only after four years, have grown by at least 4% per annum above the growth in the RPI.
At EPS growth of 4% above RPI, the portion of the option grant up to a value of 0.5 times salary may be exercised, increasing on a straight line basis up to one times salary at 7% growth above RPI and up to two times salary at 12% growth.
34 Securicor Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Remuneration report continued d Sharesave Scheme This savings-related scheme, in which the executive directors participate, is open to all United Kingdom, Channel Islands and Isle of Man employees of the group with at least 12 months service.
Eligible employees may save up to 250 per month under a three-year sharesave contract and then apply the savings in the acquisition of new shares in the company.
The option price is set at 80% of the market value at the date of grant.
Under both the Executive Share Option Scheme and the Sharesave Scheme, options are not normally exercisable until the third anniversary of the date of grant.
The limit on the number of ordinary shares which may be issued under both schemes until 30 April 2006 is 8.4% of the issued ordinary share capital of Securicor plc, as approved by shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting of the company on 29 April 2003. e Performance Share Plan The Performance Share Plan was introduced in March 2003.
Under the plan, the executive directors and certain other senior executives receive conditional allocations of the companys shares which are released to them only on the achievement of demanding performance targets.
The maximum annual award of shares under the plan is one times basic salary, save that where executives also participate in the Executive Share Option Scheme in the same financial year, awards will not normally exceed half of basic salary.
The extent to which allocations of shares under the plan vest will be determined by the companys normalised earnings per share growth relative to the RPI over a single three-year period.
There is no provision for retesting.
The following targets apply to awards granted in the year under review: Average annual growth in EPS Proportion of allocation vesting RPI 5% per annum 15% over three years 35% RPI 12% per annum 36% over three years 100% RPI 5-12% per annum Pro rata between 35% and 100% Less than RPI 5% per annum Nil Unless the committee determines that there are exceptional circumstances, the performance conditions will continue to apply pro rata to the time the allocation has been held if an employee leaves the group, or in the event of a change of control or restructuring of the company.
The committee believes that earnings per share growth is the most appropriate performance measure for both the Executive Share Option Scheme and the Performance Share Plan, as it provides a transparent method of assessing the companys performance.
The company calculates whether the performance targets have been achieved by reference to the companys audited accounts which provide an accessible and objective measure of the companys earnings per share.
The committee also believes that continued shareholding by senior executives will strengthen the alignment of their interests with shareholders interests.
Accordingly, executive directors of the company will be expected to retain shares to the value of 30% of the after-tax gains made on the vesting of performance share plan awards and the exercise of share options until they have built up a shareholding equivalent to one times basic salary.
A significant proportion of total remuneration is related to performance, through participation in both short-term and long-term incentive schemes.
The service contracts of the executive directors are dated as follows: Nick Buckles 25 May 2001 Irene Cowden 19 August 2002 Trevor Dighton 30 May 2002 Nigel Grifths 26 September 2000 All are terminable by the company on 12 months notice and by the directors on six months notice.
There are no provisions for compensation payable upon early termination, but the company reserves the right to pay salary in lieu of notice.
It is the groups policy that it should be able to terminate service contracts of all senior executives on no more than 12 months notice and that payments for termination of contract are restricted to the value of salary and other contractual entitlements for the notice period.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts but letters of appointment which provide for xed three-year terms.
All directors are required to stand for re-election by the shareholders at least once every three years.
Securicor Annual Report and Accounts 2003 35 Remuneration report continued The performance graph below shows the total cumulative shareholder return of the company since 1 October 1998, based on a hypothetical shareholding worth 100, compared with the return achieved by the support services sector of the Financial Times All Share Index over the last five years.
As the company is a constituent of the support services sector, the committee believes that this is the appropriate index against which to base a comparison.
Option B Executive Share Option Scheme, normally exercisable between December 2002 and December 2009.
Option C Executive Share Option Scheme, normally exercisable between June 2003 and June 2010.
Option D Sharesave Scheme, normally exercisable between October 2003 and March 2004.
Option E Executive Share Option Scheme, normally exercisable between December 2003 and December 2010.
Option F Executive Share Option Scheme, normally exercisable between December 2004 and December 2011.
Option G Sharesave Scheme, normally exercisable between October 2006 and March 2007.
None of the directors exercised options under these schemes during the year.
The market price of the ordinary shares at 30 September 2002 was 101p and at 30 September 2003 it was 83.5p.
The highest and lowest market prices of an ordinary share during the year to 30 September 2003 were 109p and 69p respectively.
Executive share options may normally only be exercised in accordance with the performance criteria described under c Executive Share Option Scheme on page 34.
