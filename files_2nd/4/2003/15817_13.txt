INTRODUCTION This report to shareholders sets out the membership of the Remuneration Committee and the names of the advisers who provided services to the Committee during the year to 3 January 2004.
The policies that have been followed by the Remuneration Committee during the year in determining the elements of executive remuneration have also been set out, together with the policies and principles to be followed by the Committee over the next two years.
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985, which sets out statutory requirements for the disclosure of Directors remuneration.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors remuneration.
Schedule 7A requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on the auditable part of the Remuneration Committee report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
Since the Report and Accounts for the eight months ended 31 December 2002, the Board has modified the terms of reference for the Remuneration Committee to reflect current best practice.
The principal responsibility of the Committee is to determine the framework or broad policy for the Companys executive remuneration and the remuneration of the Chairman of the Board, for approval by the Board.
The remuneration of non-executive Directors is a matter for the Board itself.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee can be found on the Companys website www.
Details of the emoluments, bonuses, benefits-in-kind, incentive arrangements including share options and other long term incentives, pensions and service contracts applicable to each Director who served during the year are given in this report.
The report will be put to the vote of shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
MEMBERSHIP OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE AND ADVISERS UNAUDITED INFORMATION The Remuneration Committee is made up exclusively of non-executive Directors whom the Board determined to be independent as each was found to be free from any material business or other relationship with the Company either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organisation that has a relationship with the Company.
Accordingly, the Board believes that there are no such relationships that could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
Members of the Committee who served throughout the year were: K J Minton Chairman N N Broadhurst J M J Keenan There were no changes to the membership of the Committee during the year.
The Committee consults with the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer concerning matters of executive remuneration.
The Committee also received advice from external advisers who were appointed by the Company, namely PA Consulting concerning the Companys new Annual Bonus Incentive Plan.
PA Consulting provided no other professional services to the Tomkins Group during the year.
Mercer Human Resource Consulting provided pension advice in respect of Executive Directors and senior executives and provided professional services in the area of pension scheme advice.
STATEMENT OF COMPANYS POLICY ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION UNAUDITED INFORMATION The policies operated by the Company during the year and those to be applied over the next two years, are set out below: Executive remuneration The Companys policy on executive remuneration is that the Remuneration Committee and Board should satisfy itself that executives, including executive Directors, are fairly rewarded for their individual contributions to the Groups performance.
The Remuneration Committee has sought to ensure that executive Directors receive a level of remuneration that is appropriate to their scale of responsibility and performance and which will attract, motivate and retain individuals of the necessary calibre.
The only pensionable element of executive Directors remuneration is basic salary.
This policy applies whether or not an executive Director is a member of the Tomkins Retirement Benefits Plan or has a personal pension arrangement.
Annual remuneration for executives The Board recognises that one of its key objectives is to grow the value of the business for the benefit of shareholders and that such growth is strongly related, amongst other things, to the degree of entrepreneurial spirit in the Group.
In order to create the necessary entrepreneurial impetus within an organisation, compensation arrangements are required which are similar to those that an owner of a business would seek.
This has led to the adoption of a remuneration policy whereby levels of total remuneration are set which attract, retain and motivate executives, and which are provided through a combination of base salaries at median level or below and annual bonuses that have a direct and proportionate link to total value created for shareholders.
This provides the incentive for executives to act like owners of the business.
The Remuneration Committee and the Board believe that this more closely aligns the interests of shareholders and management whereby executives only receive substantial rewards when they have created high value in the business.
Over time and subject to the achievement of value-creating performance targets, this policy is likely to lead to a realignment of the component parts of total executive remuneration, so that a greater part of the total package received by executives is made up of incentive pay with the remainder coming from base salaries at the median level or below.
The establishment of performance targets for the Companys executive share option schemes and the new incentive pay arrangements, ensures that a substantial proportion of total remuneration is directly related to actual measurable performance.
Further details of the Annual Bonus Incentive Plan are set out in section 5b on page 34.
TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 31 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT continued Non-executive Directors fees and Chairmans remuneration The executive members of the Board review from time-to-time the fees of non-executive Directors, who play no part in determining their own remuneration.
The Chairmans remuneration is determined by the Remuneration Committee in the absence of the Chairman and is approved by the Board.
In future, the review of non-executive Directors fees and the Chairmans remuneration will take place every two years.
Service contracts The Companys policy on Directors service contracts is that service contracts and letters of appointment for executive Directors normally provide for notice periods of no longer than twelve months.
On appointment, a longer notice period may apply, but this will reduce over time to the normal twelve months notice period.
Notwithstanding the provisions in an executive Directors service contract or letter of appointment concerning termination payments, the Company will seek to reduce any compensation that may be payable to reflect the departing Directors obligations to mitigate loss.
External appointments The Companys policy on external appointments is that, with the approval of the Chairman of the Board, executive Directors are permitted to hold appointments outside the Company.
Any fees payable in connection with such appointments are normally retained by Directors unless otherwise agreed.
See further details set out in section 10 below.
Long term incentives and share options Performance conditions and phasing The Company has operated a number of share-based long-term incentive schemes in the past but following a review of executive remuneration, the Remuneration Committee and Board expect the number of plans and schemes to reduce over time as they lapse and are not renewed or replaced.
This affects The Tomkins Restricted Share Plan RSP and The Tomkins Long Term Loyalty Plan.
Existing obligations in respect of those schemes will be honoured but no new commitments will be entered into.
No further awards will be made under the Groups share-based incentive plans, other than The Tomkins Share Matching Scheme, which in due course will also be phased out, as awards cease to vest under the RSP.
As regards share options, the Companys policy on performance conditions and phasing is to align the interests of scheme participants with those of shareholders by setting appropriate performance conditions at levels that encourage and stretch management to maximise value creation.
In addition, performance conditions are selected that take account of current industry practice.
Performance conditions, where applicable, for each of the schemes operated by the Company are given below.
The Company has operated a policy of phasing the grant of options and recognises that, in exceptional cases, it may be necessary to increase initial grants to attract and retain senior executives and employees with specialist skills.
Other than options granted under the employees savings related share option scheme, no options are granted at a discount to the market price.
No amount is payable by the employee on the grant of an option.
The current executive share option schemes will lapse for the purpose of making grants in 2005.
Retirement benefits The Companys retirement benefit plan was closed to new members in April 2002 and, since that time, the Companys policy has been that new employees, including executive Directors and senior executives, will receive a payment from the Company to enable them to make contributions to retirement benefit schemes of their choice on behalf of themselves and their dependants.
No change to this policy is expected over the next two years.
James Nicol and Ken Lever are not entitled to any retirement benefits defined in terms of final or average salary but they receive a payment at an annual rate of 37.5 per cent of their basic salary, to enable them to make contributions to retirement benefit schemes of their choice on behalf of themselves and their dependants.
All payments made by Tomkins plc were for the year ending 3 January 2004.
PERFORMANCE GRAPH UNAUDITED INFORMATION The graph set out below plots Total Shareholder Return on a holding in the Companys shares for each of the past five years ended 31 December, measured against the performance of the FTSE Engineering and Machinery Index.
This index was chosen because its major constituents are, like Tomkins, moderately diversified engineering groups with a significant manufacturing presence outside the home UK market.

On 23 July 2003, 2,000 shares were purchased for each of them at a market price of 2.45 and the cost of these shares forms part of their remuneration.

Retirement benefits James Nicol and Ken Lever are not entitled to any retirement benefits defined in terms of final or average salary but, in addition to the figures above, they receive a payment at an annual rate of 37.5 per cent of their basic salary, which for the year ending 3 January 2004 amounted to 293,000 eight months to 31 December 2002 188,000 and 141,000 eight months to 31 December 2002 88,000 respectively, to enable them to make contributions to retirement benefit schemes of their choice on behalf of themselves and their dependants.
Chairmans remuneration The Remuneration Committee noted during the course of the year that since David Newlands became Chairman of Tomkins in June 2000, his remuneration had remained the same.
Having taken into consideration comparative remuneration data, the contribution made by the Chairman to the Companys affairs and the time he devotes to the Companys business, the Committee recommended to the Board that his remuneration should be increased from 150,000 to 175,000 per annum plus 2,000 Tomkins plc shares, with effect from 1 January 2004.
This recommendation was approved by the Board.
Non-executive Directors fees The executive members of the Board reviewed the fees paid to non-executive Directors and noted that the basic fee paid to non-executive Directors of 30,000 plus 2,000 Tomkins plc shares was last reviewed in 2000.
Having taken into consideration comparative remuneration data, the contribution made by individual non-executive Directors to the Companys affairs, the time they devoted to the Companys business, and the extra responsibilities placed upon them arising from the changes in corporate governance requirements in the UK and the US, the executive Directors concluded that the basic fee should be increased to 40,000 plus 2,000 Tomkins plc shares commencing 1 January 2004.
At the same time, the fee paid to the Chairman of the Audit Committee was increased to 15,000 per annum, the fee paid to the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee was increased to 10,000 per annum and the fee paid to the Chairman of the Health, Safety and Environment Committee was increased to 12,500 per annum.
Members of the Audit Committee will receive an additional fee of 7,500 per annum, members of the Remuneration Committee will receive an additional 5,000 per annum and non-executive members of the Health, Safety and Environment Committee will receive 5,000 per annum and 1,500 per meeting day, all with effect from 1 January 2004.
TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 33 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT continued b.
Current schemes Annual Bonus Incentive Plan, Share Options and Long-term Incentives i Annual Bonus Incentive Plan The executive Directors and senior executives participate in the Companys Annual Bonus Incentive Plan the Plan.
Each participant in the Plan receives a percentage of bonusable profit of the business for which he or she has responsibility.
Bonusable profit is based on operating profit less a charge for tax, less certain exceptional items and less a charge for invested capital.
The objective of the Plan is to reward the senior executives for increasing the overall value created in the business based on the margin of the after-tax return on invested capital in excess of the weighted average cost of capital.
Accordingly, bonusable profit may increase at a faster rate than operating profit where the margin of the return over the cost of capital increases.
This aligns the interests of management and shareholders.
In arriving at bonusable profit, adjustments may be made for operating exceptional items relating to strategic manufacturing initiatives to match the costs of the strategic manufacturing initiatives to the benefits over a period of up to three years.
Adjustments are also made for nonoperating exceptional items.
Such adjustments are made with the approval of the Remuneration Committee.
The charge for taxation reflects the ongoing charge for tax excluding any benefit from exceptional adjustments to tax provisions.
The charge for invested capital is based on applying the estimated weighted average cost of capital to the average invested capital in the Group.
The estimated weighted average cost of capital takes into account the capital structure of the Group and the costs associated with each element of capital.
It is estimated to be 9 per cent.
The invested capital is based on the book value of assets in the Group excluding goodwill relating to acquisitions made prior to 30 December 1999.
The incentive bonus of the executive Directors of Tomkins plc is based on a percentage of the bonusable profit of the Group which, for the year ended 3 January 2004, was 96.3 million.
James Nicol received the sum of 1,146,000, Ken Lever received the sum of 337,000 and Anthony Reading received the sum of 160,000, which took account of the businesses for which he had responsibility.
In the current financial year, Anthony Reading is entitled to receive a bonus in respect of 51 weeks from 1 January 2004 as part of his termination arrangements.
Although there is no limit to the bonusable profit on which bonuses are calculated, significant growth in bonusable profit in any one year is unlikely to arise due to the nature of the Groups business.
The bonus awards are payable as to four-sevenths in cash, one-seventh in bonus shares and two-sevenths in deferred shares.
The bonus is paid at the end of June, September and December based on 75 per cent of the bonus earned to the end of the previous quarter with the balance of the full entitlement to the bonus for the calendar year paid at the end of March following the calendar year end.
Bonus shares are restricted and vest only after a period of three years after the initial bonus award.
Dividends are paid on the bonus shares.
Deferred shares are awarded at the time of the initial bonus award but the vesting of the shares is conditional on continued employment with the Group three years after the award.
Dividends are not paid on the deferred shares.
As a condition of continued participation in the Plan, the executive Directors are required to hold shares with a purchase cost equivalent to one years total after tax remuneration including bonus based on an average of the previous three years.
Increases in annual base salary of participants are restricted to the equivalent rate of increase in the Retail Price Index in the UK or equivalent index in the country in which a participant works.
The restrictions on the increases in salary together with the growth in bonus, assuming increases in bonusable profit, will result in the incentive pay element of remuneration increasing over time.
The share awards will increase the investment each of the directors has in Tomkins plc shares.
ii Share Options The Tomkins Executive Share Option Scheme No.
2 ESOS 2, The Tomkins Executive Share Option Scheme No.
3 ESOS 3 and The Tomkins Executive Share Option Scheme No.
4 ESOS 4 ESOS 2 has expired for grant purposes, though options already granted remain outstanding and can be exercised in accordance with the rules of the scheme.
ESOS 3 is an Inland Revenue-approved scheme under which Tomkins employees who are resident in the United Kingdom for tax purposes are able to receive options with an aggregate exercise price not exceeding 30,000 that attract favourable tax treatment.
ESOS 4 is not approved by the Inland Revenue and is a scheme under which options granted do not attract favourable tax treatment in the United Kingdom.
There is a limit to the number of options that can be granted under the ESOS 4 scheme of four times annual remuneration which includes annual bonuses and certain benefits-in-kind.
Under ESOS 4, options granted in excess of four times a participants annual earnings super options will only be exercisable if at least five years have elapsed since the date of grant and then only if, over a five-year period following the grant of the option, the growth in the Companys earnings per share is such that it would be in the top quartile of a league table for growth in earnings per share over a five-year period for companies in the FTSE 100 index.
ESOS 3 and ESOS 4 will continue and their current performance condition will remain in place until they lapse for grant purposes in 2005.
The performance condition is based upon the growth in Tomkins earnings per share, which must exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index by an average of 2 per cent per annum over a three-year period before an option can be exercised.
When the schemes were introduced in 1995, the earnings per share performance condition was widely adopted and the choice of 2 per cent was in accordance with contemporary practice.
In determining whether or not the growth in earnings per share performance condition has been met, a simple arithmetic calculation is made annually when the Companys results are known.
34 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 Tomkins Premium Priced Option This was an option specifically and solely granted to James Nicol as part of the incentive package on his joining Tomkins.
No performance conditions were attached to this option in order to attract him to the Company and retain his services and this therefore does not comply with Schedule A of the Combined Code.
It consists of a non-transferable option to acquire 5,076,142 shares with an aggregate market value of 10 million, granted on 11 February 2002.
The price per share payable on the exercise of the option will be 197 pence in respect of 2,538,072 shares A option shares, 276 pence in respect of 1,522,842 shares B option shares and 345 pence in respect of 1,015,228 shares C option shares.
The options vested as to one-third of A, B and C option shares on 18 February 2003, will vest as to one-third of A, B and C option shares on 18 February 2004 and as to one-third of A, B and C option shares on 18 February 2005.
The option will lapse on 11 February 2012 or earlier in certain circumstances.
Ongoing Option This was also an option specifically and solely granted to James Nicol on 11 February 2002, as part of the incentive package to attract him to the Company.
It consisted of a non-transferable option to acquire 1,522,842 shares at 197 pence, which may not be exercised before 18 February 2005 and unless and until the performance condition has been satisfied or waived.
The performance condition will be achieved if, on or after the third anniversary of the date of grant, the rate of increase of earnings per share over any three-year period is equal to or greater than the rate of increase of the Retail Price Index plus 9 per cent.
The performance condition may be waived or amended by the Remuneration Committee.
If there is a change of control of the Company then the option is exercisable immediately regardless of whether the performance condition is satisfied.
The same lapsing events for the Premium Priced Option, apply to this option.
If there is a variation in the share capital of the Company the Remuneration Committee may adjust the number of shares in either the Premium Priced Option or the Ongoing Option as it reasonably deems appropriate to take account of the variation.
The Tomkins Savings Related Share Option Scheme No.
2 This is a standard Inland Revenue-approved savings related share option scheme, which is open to employees who are resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom.
No grants under this scheme were made during the year.

2 Options included in the above table relate to the Tomkins Executive Share Option Schemes No.
4 J Nicol 2,569,456 shares, K Lever 1,078,000 shares and, in the case of James Nicol, Premium Priced Options 5,076,142 shares and Ongoing Options 1,522,842 shares.
iii Long-term Incentives Deferred Matching Share Purchase Plan This was specifically and solely introduced for James Nicol as part of the incentive package to attract him to the Company.
Under the Deferred Matching Share Purchase Plan 3,045,684 shares Matching Shares were awarded on 11 February 2002 following the purchase by James Nicol of 1,015,228 Tomkins plc shares the Purchased Shares.
After three years from 18 February 2002, or earlier in certain circumstances, the award will vest in respect of 1,015,228 Matching Shares.
The remaining 2,030,456 Matching Shares will vest according to the share price at that time, to the extent that, for every 1 pence that the share price increases over 197 pence, being the market price on 8 February 2002, up to a maximum of 591 pence, James Nicol will receive 5,153 shares.
He may elect at any time prior to the vesting of the award to receive either the shares, or at his option, a cash payment equal to the market value on the date of the award.
The award is conditional upon James Nicol or his relatives or trustees of a family trust fund holding the Purchased Shares for at least three years.
Until the award vests in respect of at least one-third of the Matching Shares, James Nicol is entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the net dividends payable on the Purchased Shares.
The cash payment shall reduce pro rata to the extent of any vesting of the award up to one-third of the Matching Shares.
The aggregate value of the entitlement of James Nicol in respect of 1,015,228 Matching Shares and a further 371,016 Matching Shares derived from 5,153 shares multiplied by the difference in the market price at 3 January 2004 of 269 pence and 197 pence at the year end amounted to 3,729,000 31 December 2002 1,929,000.
TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 35 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT continued c. Closed schemes The Tomkins Restricted Share Plan RSP, The Tomkins Share Matching Scheme SMS and The Tomkins Long Term Loyalty Plan LTLP The RSP required either an element of annual cash bonus to be taken in restricted shares in the form of a Trustee Award, or employees could acquire further shares in the Company in the form of a Company Award, using cash bonuses already paid to them.
Both Trustee and Company Awards were subject to forfeiture if an employee left the Company before the end of a three-year restricted period.
The last award made was in July 2001.
The SMS matched vested Trustee or Company Awards under the RSP.
SMS awards were up to two conditional share matching awards vesting a further two years and four years respectively after the end of the RSP restricted period, each award being for the same number of ordinary shares vesting under the RSP, with proportionate reductions to the matching awards on a disposal of any vested shares.
When existing commitments to match RSP awards have been satisfied, the SMS will close.
The LTLP allowed participants to use their own funds to acquire Tomkins shares, which were matched up to a maximum of 100,000 matched shares per employee.
The sale or transfer of any of the shares purchased by the employee at any time during a seven-year restricted period would result in the forfeiture of the matched shares.
The last awards made were in July 1997.
With shareholder approval, these share schemes were introduced in 1995 and 1996 with no performance conditions attached and accordingly they do not comply with Schedule A of the Combined Code.
Directors interests in Tomkins shares at 3 January 2004 The Directors current interests in Tomkins shares are set out in the Directors report on page 24 and, in the case of the executive Directors, where appropriate these include shares held through their participation in the RSP, SMS and LTLP together the Schemes.

36 TOMKINS PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2003 Accrual for Anthony Reading as a Director ceased on 31 December 2003.
He continued in service beyond his sixtieth birthday, and his alternative pension formula based on retiring at 65 applies.
Pensionable Earnings on this formula comprises basic earnings only.
Re-calculating his accrual to 31 December 2002 on the formula would have resulted in an accrued pension of 152,000 pa higher than the 103,000 pa accrued pension disclosed last year, but of less value.
His accrual was augmented during the year by 13,256 pa, the benefit he would have accrued as a Director during the 2004 year.
Taking account of the re-calculated accrual to 31 December 2002 and the augmentation to his accrual of 13,256, the total increase in accrual for Anthony Reading in the period, after allowing for inflation, amounted to 33,123.
The total increase in accrual before allowing for inflation amounted to 37,366.
The transfer value of the increase, before any allowance for early retirement terms, amounts to 422,000.
