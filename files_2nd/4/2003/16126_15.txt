As Trinity Mirror plc is currently a constituent of the FTSE Mid-250 Index, that index minus Investment Trusts is considered the most appropriate form of broad equity market index against which the Groups performance should be graphed.
Performance, as required by the legislation, is measured by Total Shareholder Return share price growth plus dividends paid.
