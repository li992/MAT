12550 Tullow R&A03 p30-p72 aw 5 27 04 2:49 PM Page 38 Directors Remuneration Report Year Ended 31st December 2003 Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, which set out requirements for the disclosure of Directors Remuneration.
The report is also prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Companys Members on the auditable part of the Remuneration Report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report that has been subject to audit has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
The report is therefore divided into separate sections to disclose the audited and unaudited information.
A resolution to approve the entire report will be proposed at the AGM of the Company.
Unaudited Information Remuneration Committee Composition The Remuneration Committee consists solely of the Non-Executive Directors, namely Mr P. Plunkett Chairman, Mr R. Courtney, Mr S. McTiernan and Ms C. Spottiswoode.
Mr E. Maleki who was a member of the Committee throughout the year ceased membership upon his retirement as a Director on 21st April 2004.
Terms of Reference The terms of reference of the Committee are primarily to determine the Executive Directors remuneration packages, service agreements and employment conditions.
The Chief Executive and other relevant executives are invited to attend meetings of the Committee but do not take part in any decision affecting their own remuneration.
The Committee also receives advice from the Company Secretary and the Head of Human Resources.
During the year, the Committee sought the advice of New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, as independent remuneration consultants, who also provided advice to the Company in connection with the operation of its share incentive arrangements and the establishment of the Tullow Oil UK and Irish Share Incentive Plans.
The Committee has since formally appointed New Bridge Street Consultants LLP as its remuneration advisers.
Remuneration Policy The Groups policy is to maintain levels of remuneration so as to attract, motivate and retain Directors of the highest calibre who can contribute their experience and independent views to the Groups operations.
Executive Directors must be properly rewarded and motivated to perform in the best interests of shareholders.
The elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors are basic salary, annual bonus, benefits, pensions and participation in the Companys share option scheme.
It is Company policy to grant options to key management to encourage identification with shareholders interests.
Consequently, a significant element of Executive Directors remuneration is performance-linked.
The Committee takes into account the remuneration practices of other international companies of similar size and other companies operating in the FTSE Oil and Gas Sector.
Executive Directors Remuneration The basic salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed annually with regard to personal performance, Company performance, changes in responsibilities and competitive market practices.
Following the most recent review the basic annual salary of each Executive Director with effect from January 2004 is: Mr A. Heavey 351,750 Mr M. ODonoghue 210,000 Mr G. Martin 231,000 Mr T. Hickey 210,000 Mr J. Lander retired 16th April 2004 183,729 38 Tullow Oil plc Annual Report & Accounts 2003 12550 Tullow R&A03 p30-p72 aw 5 27 04 2:49 PM Page 39 Each Executive Director is entitled to participate in the Executive Annual Bonus Scheme in respect of each financial year of the Company.
Under the scheme, bonuses are payable to all Executive Directors conditional on personal performance and the achievement of certain corporate targets set by the Company related to reserve replacement and performance, benchmarked against the FTSE 250 and certain peer group companies to be measured over the financial year.
The bonus payable to an Executive Director in respect of any financial year may not ordinarily exceed 50% of the Directors basic salary at the end of such financial year this may be increased to 100% in exceptional circumstances and at the absolute discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Due to a change in the manner by which bonuses are determined, the bonuses disclosed in the Directors remuneration table on page 42 reflect the bonuses earned by the Executive Directors where applicable in respect of their services during both 2002 and 2003, as more particularly described in the first note to the table.
Any bonuses paid are not pensionable.
The Executive Directors do not participate in the Company pension plan.
Each Executive Director is entitled to receive a payment of 10% of his basic salary into his private pension scheme with the exception of Mr J. Lander who received a 20% contribution to his pension scheme, as well as 30 days annual leave, permanent health insurance, private medical insurance and life assurance benefits.
Mr A. Heavey is provided with a car, as was Mr J. Lander up to the date of his retirement.
The Group also reimburses the Executive Directors in respect of all expenses reasonably incurred by them in the proper performance of their duties.
Share Incentive Plans The only share option scheme operated by the Company during the year was the 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme.
Options have previously been granted under the 1988 Executive Share Option Scheme and the 1998 Executive Share Option Scheme both of which are no longer operated.
Grants under the 2000 Scheme have been made to the majority of employees including the Executive Directors, during the year.
Details of the options outstanding for each Executive Director are set out on page 43.
Options previously granted under the 2000 Scheme normally only become exercisable following the third anniversary of the date of grant and then only if the Companys Total Shareholder Return is greater than that of the FTSE Mid 250 index over any three year period following grant.
This performance target was chosen as the Board believed that it represented the most appropriate means of aligning the interests of participants with that of shareholders by linking the reward available to the returns generated for shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee plans to review the operation of the 2000 Scheme in the light of emerging trends in market and best practice particularly in relation to the structure of performance targets.
The Committee obtains confirmation from its brokers as to the extent to which the performance conditions have been satisfied under the 2000 Scheme in order to provide third party verification.
Options granted under the 1988 and 1998 Scheme are not subject to performance conditions.
Executive Directors may also participate in the Tullow Oil UK and Irish Share Incentive Plans, which were adopted at last years AGM, and launched at the beginning of 2004.
These are all-employee plans that have been set up in both the UK and Ireland which enable employees to make contributions out of salary up to prescribed limits each month, which are used by the Plan trustees to acquire Tullow Oil shares.
The Company makes a matching contribution to the trustees to acquire a matching number of shares on a one-for-one basis.
Non-Executive Directors Fees The Board sets the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors and the fees paid are set on a level to attract the persons with the necessary experience and ability to make a significant contribution to the Companys activities.
Each Non-Executive Director receives an annual fee plus an allowance for acting as Chairman of any committee.
Each Non-Executive Director is also entitled to reimbursement of necessary travel and other expenses.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any operational Executive Share Option Scheme or annual bonus scheme and are not eligible to join the Companys Pension Scheme.

For Tullow, TSR is primarily represented by share price performance as, up to November 2003, no dividends had been declared or paid.
Tullow has been a member of the FTSE 250 Index since September 2001 and, as this index is also used as a comparator for share plans and remuneration in general, the Directors believe it represents the most appropriate benchmark.
The graphs below show Tullows TSR over the ten year period from 1st January 1994 to 31st December 2003 and the five-year period from 1st January 1999 to 31st December 2003.
In each case the relevant indices are set to 100 at the beginning of the period.

Each service agreement is on similar terms.
Mr A. Heavey and Mr M. ODonoghue also entered into a service agreement with Tullow Oil International Limited on 16th September 2002 on similar terms to their service agreements with the Company.
The terms of each of these service contracts is not fixed, although each Executive Director is required under his service agreement to retire from service upon attaining the age of 65.
Each agreement is terminable by the Director on six months notice and by the Company on twelve months notice.
There are no specific provisions under which any Executive Director is entitled to receive compensation upon the early termination of his service agreement other than in accordance with these notice periods.
Each service agreement sets out restrictions on the ability of the Director to participate in businesses competing with those of the Group or to entice or solicit away from the Group any senior employees of the Group for a period of six months after the termination of his employment.
Each of the Non-Executive Directors is engaged by the Company under the terms of a letter of appointment dated 6th February 2002 in the case of Ms C. Spottiswoode and Mr S. McTiernan and dated 17th January 2003 in the case of Mr P. Plunkett and Mr R. Courtney.
Subject to retirement, for example by rotation under the Articles of Association, the appointments are for the period to 28th February 2005 in the case of Ms C. Spottiswoode and Mr S. McTiernan and to 31st December 2005 in respect of Mr P. Plunkett and Mr R. Courtney.
In each case, the appointment is renewable thereafter if agreed by the Directors and the Board.
There are no notice provisions and no arrangements under which any Non-Executive Director is entitled to receive compensation upon the early termination of their appointment.
The above reflects the Committees policy that service contracts should be structured to reflect the interests of the Company and the individuals concerned, while also reflecting market and best practice.
Furthermore, it is also the Committees policy that, in the event of early termination of a Directors service contract, the Committee will take account of the departing Directors duty to mitigate his loss when determining the amount of compensation that is paid.
