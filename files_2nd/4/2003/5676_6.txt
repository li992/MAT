Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC Directors Remuneration Report Introduction This remuneration report sets out the group's policy and structure for the remuneration of executive and non-executive directors together with details of directors' remuneration packages and service contracts.
The report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and shareholders will be invited to approve this report at the Annual General Meeting on January 27 2004.
The remuneration committee The remuneration committee is chaired by The Viscount Rothermere.
Its other members are CJF Sinclair, JC Botts and JD Bolsover.
All members of the committee are non-executive directors of the company.
The Viscount Rothermere and CJF Sinclair are also directors of Daily Mail and General Trust plc but have no personal financial interests in the company other than as shareholders, and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The executive chairman normally attends meetings of the remuneration committee, but is not present at any discussion concerning his own remuneration.
For the year under review the committee also sought advice and information from the companys managing director and finance director.
The committee's terms of reference permit its members to obtain professional external advice on any matter, at the company's expense, although none did so in 2003.
The group itself can take external advice and information from many sources in preparing proposals for the remuneration committee, but no material assistance from a single source was received in relation to remuneration decisions for 2003.
Remuneration policy The group believes in aligning the interests of management with those of shareholders.
The two consistent objectives in its remuneration policy since the companys inception in 1969 have been the maximization of earnings per share and the creation of shareholder value.
The first objective is achieved through a comprehensive profit sharing scheme that links the pay of executive directors and key managers to the profits and growth in profits of the group or relevant parts of the group.
This scheme is completely variable with no guaranteed floor and no ceiling.
To support the implementation of the policy of profit sharing, the group is divided into a number of profit centres.
The manager of each profit centre is paid a profit share related to the profit centres profits and profit growth.
Each profit centre is part of a larger business group.
Each business group manager has an incentive based on the business groups profits and profit growth.
Profit sharing encourages directors and managers to grow their businesses, to launch new ventures and to search for acquisitions that would fit well with their businesses.
All executives on profit shares are aware that if profits rise, so does their pay.
Similarly if profits fall, so do their profit shares.
The profit shares of executive directors and senior managers make up much of their total pay.
For example, of the total remuneration of the fourteen executive directors who served in the year, 67% was derived from profit shares.
The creation of shareholder value is also encouraged through an executive share option scheme.
The companys previous scheme was approved by shareholders in 1985 and expired in 1995, although options granted under this scheme may be exercised before various dates through to 2005.
A new executive share option scheme was approved by shareholders in January 1996 and the performance criteria under which options granted under this scheme may be exercised are set out on page 29.
During the year share options were granted to DC Cohen, CR Brown, CR Jones, E Bounous, SM Brady, D Alfano, G Mueller and MJ Carroll pages 27 & 28.
Options are granted in phased blocks over a period of several years.
The directors believe that the profit sharing and share option arrangements are responsible for much of the companys success since 1969.
These arrangements serve shareholders by aligning the interests of the directors and managers with those of shareholders and are considered an important driver of the company's growth strategy.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the board.
Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Page 19 Directors Remuneration Report continued Remuneration structure Executive directors It is the group's policy to construct executive remuneration packages such that a significant part of a directors compensation is based on the growth in the groups profits contributed by that director.
The details of the remuneration packages of individual directors are set out below.
Basic salary and benefits The basic salary and benefits are generally not the most significant part of the directors overall package.
Each executive director receives a salary which is reviewed annually by the committee.
Certain non-cash benefits are also provided with all executive directors entitled to private health care, and life assurance through the membership of one of the pension schemes.
PM Fallon, PR Ensor, DC Cohen and GB Strahan also participate in the companys car scheme.
Pension schemes Each UK-based director is entitled to participate in either the Harmsworth Pension Scheme a defined benefit scheme, closed to new directors, the Euromoney Pension Plan, a money purchase plan or their own private scheme.
Directors based overseas are entitled to participate in the pension scheme arrangements applicable to the countries where they work.
Currently, NF Osborn, CR Brown, RT Lamont, D Alfano, G Mueller and MJ Carroll participate in the groups US 401 k plan.
Details of pension scheme contributions can be found on page 26 of this report.
There are no other post retirement benefits.
Profit share scheme The group believes in aligning the economic interests of management with those of shareholders and achieves this through a comprehensive profit sharing scheme that links the pay of executive directors to the profits and growth in profits of the businesses that the executive director manages.
Those executive directors who manage business divisions are set profit thresholds for the businesses for which they are responsible.
The profit thresholds are set by individual director at the time the director takes on responsibility for the business concerned and are adjusted if such responsibilities change.
The normal profit share arrangement pays 1% of profit from zero up to a threshold and then 5% of profits achieved in excess of this threshold.
Some of the directors have schemes which have been in place for a number of years and pay profit shares at slightly higher rates or which are subject to additional thresholds.
The profit shares of the chairman and managing director are based on the pre-tax profits of the group, thereby matching their profit share with the return the group generates for its shareholders.
The chairman is entitled to 6.49% of pre-tax profits.
The managing director is entitled to 3.84% of the pre-tax profits up to a threshold of 25,051,000 and an additional 1.44% of pre-tax profits in excess of this threshold.
The finance director receives a profit share linked to the adjusted earnings per share of the group EPS.
A fixed sum is payable for every percentage point the EPS is above 10p.
A further sum is payable for every percentage point that EPS is above 17.25p.
CHC Fordham, in addition to his profit share, has a second incentive linked to the performance of acquisitions.
G Mueller does not have a profit share but has an incentive based on the performance of Internet Securities, Inc.
This incentive is based on the achievement of turnover and costs against pre-agreed targets and is designed to encourage the building of sustainable profit in Internet Securities, Inc. All of the schemes are completely variable with no guaranteed floor and no ceiling and designed to be the most significant part of the executive director's remuneration package.

Participants save a fixed monthly amount of up to 250 for three or five years and are then able to buy shares in the company at a price set at a 20% discount to the market value at the start of the savings period.
In line with market practice, no performance conditions attach to options granted under this plan.
The executive directors who are currently participating in this scheme are PM Fallon, PR Ensor, NF Osborn, DC Cohen, GB Strahan, CR Jones and SM Brady details of which can be found on pages 27 and 28 of this report.
Share option schemes The directors consider that share options are an important part of overall compensation and align the interests of directors with those of shareholders.
1996 scheme The group operates an executive share option scheme approved by shareholders in 1996 in which potentially all employees can receive options.
Each year options are issued to a selection of individual employees on a merit basis.
These options are exercisable at least three years after their grant and are subject to certain performance conditions.
All executive directors have options under the 1996 scheme.
For options expiring on February 24 2004, January 7 2005, February 7 2007, January 29 2009, February 11 2009, June 25 2009 and January 5 2010 the performance test set by the remuneration committee requires the growth in the company's earnings per share for the three consecutive financial years commencing from the year of grant to exceed the growth in the retail prices index by an average of 4% a year.
For the options expiring on June 25, 2009 only, there is an additional performance condition which requires that Internet Securities, Inc. must have achieved an operating profit for three consecutive months and a cumulative operating profit over a period of six months.
For all other options expiring after 2005, the performance test set by the remuneration committee requires that the Total Shareholder Return TSR of the company exceeds that of the average TSR for the FTSE 250 index for the same period.
The TSR test is carried out at the end of each calendar month starting 30 months after the option grant date.
For the performance condition to be satisfied, the TSR of the company must exceed that of the FTSE 250 in any four out of six consecutive months from that date.
1984 scheme In addition, PM Fallon, PR Ensor, NF Osborn, DC Cohen, CR Brown, GB Strahan, E Bounous and SM Brady have options issued to them under a previous executive share option scheme which expired in 1995 although options granted under this scheme may be exercised at various dates through to 2005.
There are no performance criteria attached to these options.

The price is based on the fair market value of the subsidiary and determined by the board.
There are no performance conditions attached to these options.
Details of directors' share options can be found on pages 27 to 29.
Put options GB Strahan has a put option whereby he is able to sell his 5% holding of shares in Coaltrans Limited, a subsidiary of the group, to Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC at a price per share based on a multiplier of Coaltrans Limited profits per share.
The multiplier varies if GB Strahan's contract is terminated or he is incapacitated.
G Mueller has a put option whereby he is able to sell his 9% holding of shares in Internet Securities, Inc. ISI, a subsidiary of the group, to Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC at a price per share based on a multiple of ISI's profit per share up to a ceiling.
G Mueller retains the rights granted under this put option should his employment contract terminate.
In addition G Mueller has an IPO registration right over ISI that he may exercise every 6 months subject to the agreement of the other shareholders.
If an agreement cannot be reached the company has the right to purchase his shares at a set price.
Non-executive directors The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the chairman and executive board with the aid of external professional advice if necessary.
Non-executive directors receive a fee and are re-imbursed expenses incurred in attending meetings.
They do not receive any performance related bonuses, pension provisions, share options or other forms of benefits apart from Sir Patrick Sergeant, who receives an expense allowance and a car, and JC Botts who is a participant in the Internet Securities, Inc. option scheme.
JC Botts' options are exercisable at the rate of 8.33% quarterly and are fully vested after three years, the price of which is based on the fair market value of the subsidiary and determined by the board.

With the exception of the chairman and managing director, each of the executive directors has a twelve month rolling service contract.
The chairman and managing director have two year rolling service contracts which were put in place well before the latest guidance on the preferred limit on the duration of directors service contracts.
The Remuneration Committee seeks to minimise termination payments and believes these should be restricted to the value of remuneration for the notice period.
With the exception of Sir Patrick Sergeant, none of the nonexecutive directors has a service contract.
All service contracts are reviewed from time to time and updated where necessary.
Service contracts terminate automatically on the director reaching their respective retirement ages.

Profit shares waived are paid by the company into private pension schemes as set out on page 25.
Under the Harmsworth Pension Scheme, the following pension benefits were earned by the directors: Increase Accrued annual Increase in in accrued pension at Transfer value Transfer value transfer value Transfer into annual pension September 30 September 30 September 30 net of directors scheme during the year 2003 2003 2002 contributions Director PM Fallon - 200 6,400 93,000 81,800 11,200 PR Ensor - 1,800 47,500 630,200 555,200 70,000 CR Jones - 100 8,200 54,800 51,700 3,100 DC Cohen 9,500 1,400 10,900 81,700 69,400 8,500 The accrued annual pension entitlement is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to September 30 2003 and ignores any increase for future inflation.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Retirement Benefit Schemes Transfer Values GN11 published by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries.
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of the directors pension benefits.
They do not represent a sum paid or payable to individual directors and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
Members of the scheme have the option of paying Additional Voluntary Contributions.
Neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.
The normal retirement age for the Harmsworth Pension Scheme is 62 years.
Mr PM Fallon's pension benefits relate to a deferred pension in the Mail Newspapers Pension Scheme for pensionable service between April 1 1978 and April 1 1986.
No further contributions have been made to this scheme by the group or Mr Fallon.
