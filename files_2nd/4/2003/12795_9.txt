21 Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Punch Taverns plc Report on Directors Remuneration Your Board believes that a properly constituted and effective remuneration committee is key to ensuring that the Companys policy on Executive Directors remuneration supports the enhancement of shareholder value.
The Board has therefore delegated to the Boards Remuneration Committee the assessment and recommendation of a broad policy on executive remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee is formally constituted with written Terms of Reference.
The Committee is chaired by Fritz Ternofsky and its other members are Phil Cox and Mike Foster.
The Committee determines the remuneration and benefits packages for Executive Directors and any changes to their service contracts, as well as the remuneration of Senior Group Executives.
The Committee also approves any share incentive and performance bonus arrangements.
The Remuneration Committee appointed, and received wholly independent advice on executive compensation and share schemes, from Halliwell Consulting during the year.
No other services were provided to the Company by Halliwell Consulting.
Except when his own remuneration was being discussed the Chief Executive, Giles Thorley, took part in discussions in relation to the remuneration and benefits of the other Executive Directors and Senior Group Executives.
During the year the Company complied with The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, and the recommendations of the Combined Code on Directors remuneration as implemented by the Financial Services Authority in its Listing Rules for listed companies, including the Best Practice Provisions of Schedule 1 of Section 1 of the Combined Code.
Part 3 of schedule 7a to the Companies Act 1985 requires that certain parts of the Report on Directors Remuneration are audited, whilst certain other parts are not.
Where disclosures are subject to audit, they have been marked as such.
Part A Remuneration Committee policy The Remuneration Committees policy is to set the main elements of the remuneration package at the following quartiles in comparison to the Companys comparator group: Base Salary Annual Bonus Potential Share Incentives Median At the Upper Quartile Upper Quartile The aim of this policy is to provide remuneration packages that will retain talented people in the business, enable the recruitment of appropriately skilled and experienced newcomers and be seen as competitive in the markets in which the Company operates.
It is the aim of the Remuneration Committee to encourage and reward superior performance.
It is the opinion of the Remuneration Committee that shareholders interests are best served by focusing a greater proportion of total remuneration on performance-related compensation.
The charts below show the current relationship between the performance elements and the fixed elements of the remuneration package for each of the Executive Directors.
Giles Thorley Robert McDonald 34% 35% 66% 65% Incentive Compensation Fixed Compensation 22 Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Punch Taverns plc Report on Directors Remuneration continued It should be noted that the real value received by Executive Directors under the share incentive arrangements will be dependent upon the degree to which the associated performance conditions have been satisfied at the end of the three year performance period and whether the share price of the Company has increased from the date of grant.
Further to the proposed acquisition of Pubmaster, the Company will propose at the Annual General Meeting that shareholders approve the adoption of the Punch Taverns plc Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Punch Taverns plc Deferred Share Bonus Plan and the Punch Taverns plc Share Incentive Plan, details of which are being issued to shareholders in a separate circular.
Comparator group The Companys current comparator group consists of the companies which constitute the FTSE 350 Leisure and Hotels Sector: Carnival plc Holidaybreak plc Rank Group plc fide Vere Group plc Intercontinental Hotels Group plc Stanley Leisure plc Enterprise Inns plc Luminar plc Wetherspoon JD plc First Choice Holidays plc Manchester United plc Whitbread plc Greene King plc Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc William Hill plc Hilton Group plc Mitchells & Butlers plc Wolverhampton & Dudley Breweries plc The basis of the selection of this comparator group was: Companies with related businesses to the Company.
Companies of a comparable size to the Company in terms of a mixture of capitalisation, turnover and number of employees.
The Remuneration Committee, with input from the Executive Directors, continually reviews the comparator group for its appropriateness to the current stage of the Companys development and market factors generally.
Base salary The Remuneration Committees policy is to set the base salaries of the Executive Directors at around the median by reference to the comparator group.
Factors taken into account by the Remuneration Committee when determining each Executive Directors base salary are: The median level of base salary for a similar position within the comparator group.
The individual Executive Directors performance.
The responsibilities of the Executive Director.
The experience of the Executive Director.
Performance bonus The maximum bonus potential under the Bonus Scheme has been set above the upper quartile against the comparator group.
The Remuneration Committee believes that significant bonus potential coupled with challenging targets provides maximum incentive for the Executive Directors to deliver short term value to shareholders.
The Bonus Scheme for 2003 was based on a variety of measures which supported the enhancement and retention of shareholder value.
The table below shows the maximum bonus available to the Executive Directors and the amount earned in respect of the 02 03 financial year: Maximum Bonus As a % of available as payable salary as at a % of salary for 02 03 23 August 2003 Giles Thorley 133% 135,000 45% Robert McDonald 125% 80,000 44% The performance measures for the Bonus Scheme are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and position of the Company, so that they continue to remain challenging.
23 Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Punch Taverns plc Report on Directors Remuneration continued Share incentives It is the aim of the Remuneration Committee to provide share incentive awards for Executive Directors at the upper quartile of those awarded to similar executives in the comparator group.
During the year it was the policy of the Remuneration Committee to make option grants equivalent to 1 x salary to Executive Directors.
However an additional grant equivalent to 1 x salary was made to Robert McDonald to ensure parity with a broader peer group of Finance Directors.
The Company operates two option schemes by which Executive Directors and other executives are able to acquire shares in the Company.
The first is the Savings Related Scheme, whereby the proceeds from a Save As You Earn savings contract can be used to exercise options granted at the commencement of the savings contract at a discount of 20% to the market value at the date of grant.
The second is a Discretionary Share Plan whereby options are granted over Ordinary Shares in the Company, at the prevailing market price at time of grant, exercisable between three and ten years after date of grant, with performance targets set by the Remuneration Committee.
Grants made during the year require annual growth in earnings per share of RPI 3% to vest.
No options have been exercised by any Executive Director during the year and no options have lapsed.
The Remuneration Committee have conducted a review of the Companys share incentive arrangements during 2003.
Issues at the forefront of the Remuneration Committees deliberations have been: The current nature of the market and the Companys business strategy.
The proposed accounting changes for share options.
The desire to introduce share incentive arrangements which are dependent upon a consideration of the Companys performance compared to the comparator group.
The use of a mixture of Share Options and Share Awards.
The desire to increase shareholdings amongst new Executive Directors and Group Executives.
The suitability of the current Share Option performance measure.
Pensions Giles Thorley and Robert McDonald are entitled to receive a contribution into their personal pension arrangements representing 12% of their salary.
Benefits in kind Executive Directors are entitled to receive standard benefits in kind appropriate for Executive Directors, such as car or car allowance, medical insurance and life assurance.
Executive Directors service contracts Details of the service contracts of the Executive Directors of the Company are as follows: Name Company Notice Period Contract date Unexpired term of contract months Giles Thorley 12 months 17 August 2001 Rolling Contract Robert McDonald 12 months 3 June 2003 Rolling Contract Contract will continue until terminated on notice by either the Company or the Executive Director.
There are no special provisions for compensation in the event of loss of office.
The Remuneration Committee would consider the circumstances of any individual case of early termination and would determine compensation payments accordingly.
A fair but robust principle of mitigation would be applied to the payment of compensation in the context of professional advice received as to contractual entitlement.
All Executive Directors service contracts are initially for a fixed period of one year from date of appointment, and will continue thereafter unless terminated by written notice of at least 12 months.
This arrangement is in line with best corporate practice for listed companies.
24 Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Punch Taverns plc Report on Directors Remuneration continued Non-executive Directors The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is determined by the Board based upon recommendations from the Chairman and the Chief Executive or, in the case of the remuneration of the Chairman, based on recommendations from the Senior Independent Non-executive Director and the Chief Executive.
The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is reviewed against the same comparator group as that of the Executive Directors.
The Non-executive Directors are not eligible for performance related bonuses, share incentives and do not participate in any Punch Taverns plc pensions arrangements.
It is the Boards policy to take into account the following factors in determining the fees of the Non-executive Directors: The median level of fees for similar positions within the comparator group companies.
The time commitment each Non-executive Director makes to the Company for example through membership of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees.
It is worth noting that the fees paid for the services of Cornel Riklin, Marc Jonas, Randl Shure and Mike Foster are paid to third parties for the provision of their services.
