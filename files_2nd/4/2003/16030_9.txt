TRA VIS PERKINS PLC Remuneration report For the year ended 31 December 2003 INTRODUCTION This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, the Regulations.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the board has applied the principles of good governance relating to directors remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the company at which the financial statements are presented for approval.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the companys members on the auditable part of the Remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION Remuneration committee The committee was established in July 2003, having previously been a combined Remuneration and Nominations Committee.
Its principal roles are to establish the companys policy on executive directors and senior executives remuneration, to determine the remuneration packages for each of the executive directors, and to review with the chief executive the remuneration packages for other senior executives.
It is required to give due regard to the best practice provisions contained in the New Code.
The committee members are Peter Maydon chairman together with Michael Dearden and Tim Stevenson.
These directors are non-executive and have no day to day involvement in the running of the business, no financial interest in the business except as shareholders and no conflicts of interest arising from other directorships.
The committee has been advised on remuneration matters by three independent external consultants, namely, Mercer Human Resources Consulting, Hay Group and New Bridge Street Consultants.
In addition, Andrew Pike, the company secretary and Rob Tansey, the group human resources director have advised the committee from time to time as requested.
Policy on executive directors remuneration The companys policy on executive remuneration is to ensure that it has an appropriate mix of fixed and variable pay over the short and long term, to attract and retain high quality executives with an appropriate blend of skills and experience.
The committee consults with the chief executive on the remuneration of the other executive directors and senior executives.
It aims to reward executives in line with the median of the top 250 companies in the FTSE All Share index and of a selected comparator group.
The committee believe this will enable the company to recruit and retain staff of high quality, contributing to the delivery of long-term shareholder value.
As a consequence the companys focus is on the following elements of the remuneration package: Basic salary: to remain competitive in the labour market: Annual bonus payment: to provide additional short term remuneration which directly reflects company and individual performance: The company proposes, subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting, to introduce for the most senior executives, a share matching scheme to complement the annual bonus scheme.
Further details are given on page 40 and in the letter from the chairman to shareholders dated 17 March 2004.
Share options: through the regular grant of options to reward outstanding business performance over the longer term: Pension arrangements: to enable directors to make appropriate provision for retirement.
A significant proportion of a directors total remuneration package is variable being subject to the achievement of business and individual objectives.
It is the committees intention to continue with this policy, and in applying it the committee has taken account of the provisions of Schedule A of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
Basic salary A directors basic salary is determined by the Remuneration Committee annually and when an individual changes role.
Salaries are reviewed in November each year, with increases taking effect from 1 January in the following year.
In the case of the three executive directors, with effect from 1 January 2004, their annual salaries are: J. P. Carter 255,000 P. N. Hampden Smith 275,000 F. J. McKay 485,000.
39 TRA VIS PERKINS PLC Annual bonus payments The committee establishes the objectives that must be met if a cash payment is to be made.
It believes that any annual bonus award should be related to the interests of the companys shareholders and that the principal measure of those interests is shareholder value.
Hence, bonus payments for all executive directors are based on a formula related to the level of net earnings per share achieved by the group.
There is also an element within the payment dependant on the achievement of individual objectives.
The maximum performance related bonus that can be paid in cash is 55 per cent of basic annual salary.
In order to determine whether the conditions for payment have been met, the committee assesses both business and individual performance against predetermined objectives.
Under the proposed share matching scheme see below the percentage of salary that can potentially be earned by executive directors under the annual bonus arrangements will increase to 75 per cent.
This is in line with market practice.
Share matching scheme The company proposes, subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General meeting, to introduce for the most senior executives, a Share Matching Scheme, to complement the annual bonus scheme.
Under the proposed scheme, executives would receive shares in the company of a value up to 35 per cent of their annual cash bonus Deferred Shares.
These shares would be held in trust for three years.
Executives would also have the opportunity to invest up to 35 per cent of annual salary in the companys shares, using the proceeds of their annual cash bonus.
After 3 years, subject to satisfaction of a performance criterion linked to the earnings per share growth of the company, executives might receive a further award of shares, the number of which would be in proportion to, on a predetermined basis up to a ratio of 1:1, the number of Deferred Shares and the pre tax value of the bonus used to acquire shares.
Further details of the scheme are contained in the letter from the chairman to shareholders dated 17 March 2004.
Share options For many years, the company has further motivated directors and senior executives through granting them share options.
The executive share option scheme adopted in 2001, which covers all executive directors and other senior executives, provides for the grant of options on an annual basis, with a value limit up to twice basic salary.
The current scheme enables executives to participate provided they are two years or more from normal retirement age.
The committee considers this to be unduly restrictive and shareholder approval is being sought at the Annual General Meeting to reduce this period to six months.
Currently, for all eligible executives, options may only be exercised if the growth in the companys earnings per share as reported in the companys published accounts exceeds inflation by at least 9 per cent over a three year period.
In the case of executive directors and certain other senior executives, achievement of this target will allow only 50 per cent of options to be exercised.
For all options to be exercisable, earnings per share growth must exceed inflation by at least 15 per cent over the three year period.
Between 9 per cent and 15 per cent the number of options exercisable is calculated on a straight line basis.
The committee believes that these performance conditions, which are kept under review, are closely linked to shareholder value and are, currently, sufficiently demanding.
The performance conditions for options granted between 2001 and 2003 maybe retested for two years if they are not satisfied at the end of the original 3 year period.
The committee considers that this provision is no longer in line with best practice and therefore options granted in 2004 and thereafter will not permit retesting of the performance conditions.
Under the 1995 executive share option scheme, options granted prior to 1998 were not subject to performance conditions.
Those granted between 1998 and 2000 are exercisable if the growth in the companys earnings per share exceeds inflation by at least 6 per cent over a 3 year period.
The committee considers these successive arrangements were in line with market practice at the time the grants were made.
Pension arrangements The general policy is for executive directors to be members of the companys final salary pension scheme and to accrue benefits at a rate of 1 30 of pensionable salary for each years pensionable service after appointment as a director.
In the case of John Carter and Paul Hampden Smith, the effective accrual rate is less than 1 30 due to their potential length of service upto retirement age, so that their pension does not exceed two thirds of pensionable salary.
As with all other members, executive directors dependants are eligible for dependants pensions and a payment of a lump sum in the event of death in service.
Except in the case of Frank McKay, the pension arrangements provide for a pension in retirement based on the directors length of service in the group pension scheme and the average of the best three of the last ten years of pensionable salary.
Frank McKay has been guaranteed, on retirement at age 60, a pension of thirty per cent of his final pensionable salary including the pension from a previous employment.
This pension will be funded partly by the group scheme and partly by separate funded and unfunded arrangements 40 TRA VIS PERKINS PLC established for him.
In the event that a directors pension benefits are limited by the Inland Revenue earnings cap, the general policy is to pay an age related annual salary supplement.
Paul Hampden Smith receives such a salary supplement.
For many years, bonus payments to executive directors and management formed a part of scheme members pensionable emoluments and both the company and the employee contributed a proportion of any such bonus to the scheme funds.
On 1 December 1995, the company changed its policy so that, from that date, for pension scheme members not then eligible for bonus payments and for all future entrants to the pension scheme, any such bonus payments that they may later become entitled to, would not form part of their pensionable salaries.
This does not affect scheme members, including executive directors, eligible for bonus payments prior to 1 December 1995 who presently continue to have such payments treated as part of their pensionable salaries.
For pensionable service from 1 December 2004, pensionable salary for all members will be basic salary only.
There have been no changes in the basis of directors pension entitlements during the year.
Except as described above for Frank McKay, there are no unfunded pension commitments or similar arrangements for directors.
The Remuneration Committee is in the early stages of considering the Governments proposals for changes in the taxation of pension arrangements, which are expected to be clarified during 2004.
These may in particular affect senior executives in the company.
The committee anticipates that during 2004, it will formulate a policy in relation to these proposals and communicate this to affected employees.
Service contracts The companys policy for executive directors is to have contracts which are not for a fixed period, and which are terminable on 12 months notice from the company, and 6 months from the director.
It is not the policy to specify what compensation would be payable on termination by the company.
If such compensation was due, it would be calculated by reference to the unexpired part of the notice period, and the directors salary and other benefits, including pension rights, taking due account of the directors duty to mitigate his loss.
Service contracts do not specify any particular level of compensation in the event of termination following change of control of the company.
Each of the executive directors has a service contract, the date of which is shown below, which will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
John Carter 6 August 2001 Paul Hampden Smith 8 October 1996 Frank McKay 1 November 1999 Non-executive directors The policy of the board is to recruit non-executive directors of the highest calibre, with a breadth of skills and experience appropriate for the companys business.
Non-executive directors are appointed for a period of 3 years, at the end of which the appointment may be renewed by mutual agreement.
It is the boards policy that non-executive directors will not generally serve for more than 6 years.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the board.
Each non-executive director receives an annual fee.
Michael Dearden up to 29 April 2004 and Chris Bunker from 29 April 2004 receive an additional fee for chairing the Audit Committee and Peter Maydon receives an additional fee for chairing the Remuneration Committee.
Ted Adams receives an additional fee for chairing the companys pension trusts.
