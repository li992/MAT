Under the rules of this plan, if he retained shares for a period of at least three years, the company would award him an equivalent number of shares on the third anniversary of the holding period.
These retained shares are shown under Mark Ronalds personal shareholding in table A.
The award made under the plan was not subject to performance criteria, other than that the individual remained in the companys employment, as the prime objective was to retain his services.
The aggregate net value of assets received by directors in 2003 from long-term incentive plans, as calculated at date of release from trust, was 217,745.

Executive Share Option Plan The BAE Systems Executive Share Option Plan has been used to grant options to the executive directors since 2001.
The performance conditions applying to the grants of options made in 2001, 2002 and 2003 are the same as for grants to be made in 2004, as set out on page 37 of this report with the exception of the re-testing provision: for grants made between 2001 2003, where the original three-year performance target is not met, performance is re-tested at the end of years four and five against the full period from grant.
The options will lapse at the end of year five if the targets have not been achieved.
Before 1996, and also on the completion of the British Aerospace MES merger in 1999, options were granted to executive directors under the predecessor Executive Share Option Scheme.
Options granted in 1995 can only be exercised if growth in the pre-exceptional EPS for any three-year period exceeds the sum of inflation for that period and a real growth requirement of 7.5%.
Options granted to the former GEC directors in 1999 were made on a similar basis but the real growth requirement is 9% for any three-year period.
Options granted to other executive directors in 1999 were conditional on the satisfaction of a performance condition based on the achievement of cost savings of the merger integration process over a three-year performance period.
Options will become exercisable on a sliding scale from zero to 100% between achievement of the base synergy cost savings target of 275m and the full stretch target of 400m.
Performance Share Plan From 1996 to 2000 conditional awards of shares were made to executive directors under the Performance Share Plan which was approved by shareholders in 1996.
All such awards have now vested or lapsed in accordance with the relevant performance measure, with those lapsing in 2003 detailed above.
Performance was measured relative to the other constituent members of the FTSE 100 over a three-year period, with 100% of the conditional shares vesting if the companys Total Shareholder Return TSR was in the top 20% of TSRs achieved by FTSE 100 companies, 10% vesting if the TSR was in the top 50%, and intermediate positions being calculated on a straight line pro-rata basis.
Vesting was also subject to a secondary measure requiring the EPS excluding exceptional items over the performance period to be no less than the average value for the three years prior to the performance period.
Awards were made in three equal instalments at the end of years three, four and five.
Performance conditions for the 2003 awards are the same as for awards to be made in 2004, as set out on page 38 of this report.

The benefits received by all the executive directors except for Mark Ronald, were cash allowances for a medical examination and for the provision of a car.
The benefits for Mike Turner also included a second residence support allowance of 46,123 for the costs of accommodation required in central London.
The benefits received by Mark Ronald were a cash allowance for a car, fuel and maintenance for the car, annual medical examination and medical insurance related benefits, and country club membership.
During 2003, non-executive directors were paid a basic fee of 30,000 per annum reflecting the time commitment required as a director and were also paid a fee of 1,000 for each of the six scheduled Board meetings that they attended.
Up to 28 April 2003 the chairman of the Audit Committee and the Nominations and Compensation Committee each received an additional fee of 6,000 in recognition of their duties as chairman of those committees.
Following changes to the committee structure from 29 April 2003, and to reflect the increasing time commitment required by the committee chairmen to fulfil their duties, the fees of the committee chairmen were reviewed and amended so that the chairmen of the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee received additional annual fees of 29,000 and 14,000 respectively and the chairman of the Nominations Committee, who is also the senior independent director, received an additional annual fee of 14,000.

From 1 March 2003 to 31 December 2003 his remuneration was 235,000 and comprised salary and a cash allowance for a car.
There were no other payments to former directors during the year other than the payment to Richard Lapthorne referred to in the notes to table F.

This right is granted on a cost neutral basis, and the 10 year pension is calculated by multiplying the whole life pension by an actuarial factor.
Of the total accrued pension at 31 December 2003, 227,518 will be paid for a period of 10 years only.
The corresponding accrued pension at 31 December 2002 allowing for the exercise of this right was 344,892 of which 189,674 would have been payable for 10 years and this pension has, for consistency, been used to calculate the increase in accrued benefits in 2003.
The 2002 remuneration report disclosed an accrued pension of 275,578 at 31 December 2002 - this figure assumed the right would not be exercised.
Of Mark Ronalds total accrued pension at 31 December 2003, 141,833 has a contingent 50% spouses pension.
the transfer value at 1 January 2003 is different from the transfer value of 2,338,500 disclosed in the 2002 remuneration report.
The transfer value disclosed last year, as calculated by independent actuaries, assumed that certain benefits would commence at age 65 instead of Mark Ronalds actual normal retirement age of 62 and, in addition, it did not take full account of his actual pensionable pay at the end of 2002.
Mark Ronald reached his normal retirement age of 62 in 2003.
Mark Ronald ceased to accrue any additional benefits under his non-qualified supplemental pension arrangements after 31 December 2003, and payments commenced under these arrangements in January 2004.
The payments are subject to his right to elect to receive lump sum payments in lieu of non-qualified supplemental pension payments.
Under the rules of the North America Qualified Plan, Mark Ronald will continue to accrue benefits under the plan until his actual retirement from company service.
The accrued pensions and transfer value at 31 December 2003 set out in the table above take account of the pension benefits already in payment.
Mark Ronald participates in the Section 401 k defined contribution arrangement set up for US employees in which the company will match employee contributions up to a limit.
In 2003, the company paid contributions of $2,200 2002 $2,000 into Mark Ronalds 401 k arrangement.
George Roses unapproved retirement arrangement is partly funded and partly unfunded.
The companys pension contribution to the funded unapproved retirement arrangement for George Rose in 2003 was 1,237,697 2002 320,172.
There were two main reasons behind the need to pay a substantially higher contribution in 2003: the need to change the actuarial basis underlying the calculations and investment under-performance.
The revised actuarial basis is consistent with the funding basis used for the approved pension schemes with adjustments to take account of the different tax treatment.
This change accounts for approximately 735,000 of the contribution in 2003.
The company has decided to deal with the under-performance of the underlying investments over a three-year period and, of the amount paid in 2003, 172,000 is accounted for by this item: similar payments are planned for the years 2004 and 2005 subject to the impact of the UK governments new pension taxation proposals.
This treatment reflects our policy for other employees in the same position.
The balance of 331,000 represents the normal contributions expected in any one year and this compares directly with the payment in 2002 of 320,172.
The accrued benefits shown in table F above include the benefits from the approved and unapproved arrangements.

Sir Charles Masefield, who retired from the Board on 28 February 2003, also commenced his pension in 2002 having reached normal retirement age.
None of these three individuals have accrued further benefits since retiring other than pension increases awarded to all pensioner members of their pension schemes.
Richard Lapthorne, a former director, has an unfunded pension scheme.
In 2003 the company paid Richard Lapthorne 82,758 2002 81,375 in respect of this arrangement.
