NEXT PLC DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT This report contains the information required by the Companies Act 1985 and the relevant parts of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and Schedule B to the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
The Board of Directors report that the Company has complied with these regulations throughout the year under review.
Information not subject to audit The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration of the Groups executive directors.
The members of the Committee who have served during the year are listed in this Annual Report.
They are independent non-executive directors of the Company and have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in the matters addressed by the Committee and have no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships.
Mr R J O Barton was appointed Chairman of the Committee on 18 July 2002.
Remuneration policy It is the objective of the Committee to reward directors competitively.
It is the practice to review the remuneration of directors on the same basis as any other employee of the Company and this takes into account a review of the performance of the individual and of the business.
A remuneration review is carried out by the Committee at least annually.
The other factors taken into account by the Committee in setting remuneration levels include the experience and responsibility of the individuals concerned.
The Remuneration Committee has appointed Monks Partnership to provide independent advice on directors and senior executives remuneration.
The parent company of Monks Partnership,  have provided other services to the Group during the year, principally tax advice.
The components of the Groups remuneration packages are as follows: Salary Salaries of directors are set by reference to those prevailing in the market, particularly within other major retail companies.
They are also tailored to individual experience, ability and performance.
Annual performance related bonus The executive directors, except Mr D C Jones, participate in an annual performance related bonus scheme which is based on a formula measuring the performance of the business.
The performance measure is principally earnings per share before tax, which must increase by RPI and 2% prior to any bonus becoming payable.
The formula has been determined by the Committee and includes an upper limit of 50% of salary.
Long term incentive plan A long term incentive plan was introduced for executive directors and senior executives in 1997 following approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
The plan was renewed in 2002 as part of the capital reconstruction.
Each year appropriate targets relating to the performance of the Group over the next three years, the performance period, are set.
Performance is measured by comparing Total Shareholder Return against approximately 20 other listed retail companies.
The comparator group of companies for the three year performance period ended January 2003 was as follows: Arcadia Dixons Laura Ashley N. Brown Body Shop Findel Marks & Spencer New Look Boots G. U. S. Matalan Selfridges Debenhams J Sainsbury MFI Furniture Tesco DFS Furniture Kingfisher Mothercare W H Smith Companies are only removed from the comparator group if they become delisted.
The Committee determines which new companies are to be added.
Changes to the comparator group are only made at the commencement of any three year performance period.
The same comparator group is to be used for the performance period ending January 2004.
JJB Sports has been added for the periods to January 2005 and 2006.
Arcadia has been removed for the period to January 2006 following that companys delisting and is being replaced by Signet.
fifteen NEXT PLC DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT The Remuneration Committee considers that the comparator group consists of companies which are most comparable to NEXT plc in size or nature of their business.
The Committee believe that comparison against a group consisting of 20 retail companies is more likely to reflect the Groups relative performance and minimise disproportionate factors, thereby resulting in appropriate awards being made to directors and senior management.
A graph below shows the relative Total Shareholder Return of the Group over a five year period when compared to the FTSE All Share index and FTSE General Retailers index.
The indices chosen for comparison demonstrate the Groups Total Shareholder Return in comparison to the average for a wide all-share index and against other companies in the same sector.
NEXT plc Performance Chart 1998-2003 Total Shareholder Return 160 160 140 140 120 120 GRAPH TO FOLLOW 100 100 80 80 60 60 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 Re-based to 31 January 1998 100 NEXT plc FTSE All Share FTSE General Retailers Under the rules of the plan the maximum award possible for each performance period is 100% of basic salary, however, the Committee has restricted the maximum award possible to 70% of basic salary for all performance periods commencing prior to January 2003.
For performance more than one percentage point below the median ranking company no award will be made.
For performance within one percentage point of the median the entitlement will be 30% of the maximum award.
For performance above the median the entitlement will rise, with the maximum award being earned for performance in the upper quartile of the comparator group.
No entitlements will be earned unless the earnings per share of the Company has increased by at least the increase in the Retail Price Index over the period.
Awards are granted provisionally at the start of a performance period and remain subject to performance conditions over the life of the plan before any entitlement is earned.
If no entitlement has been earned at the end of a three year performance period then the award for that period will lapse.
The Company has discretion as to whether entitlements earned are payable in NEXT plc shares or cash and has allowed participants the choice.
Entitlements earned will not be pensionable and will be based on salary and share price at the start of the performance period.
Individuals may not be included in the plan and receive grants under the NEXT Group 2002 Share Option Scheme in the same year.
Management share options: NEXT Group 2002 Share Option Scheme The management share option scheme was first established in 1984 and was renewed in 1995 by shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting.
The scheme was further renewed in 2002 as part of the capital reconstruction.
The scheme provides for options over shares, exercisable between three and ten years following their grant, to be allocated to Group employees at the discretion of the Board of Directors.
The total number of options which can be granted are subject to certain limits.
Options are set at the prevailing market price at the time of grant.
The maximum value of Inland Revenue approved share options which may be granted to any employee is restricted to 30,000.
In addition unapproved options can be granted under the scheme, the maximum number being calculated by a formula which restricts the aggregate option exercise price to four times total remuneration of the employee less the value of any outstanding approved share options.
It is not the practice to grant the maximum number of options allowable to any employee in one year.
Grants are generally made annually.
Exercise of options is subject to a performance condition where the percentage growth in earnings per share of the Group over a three year period must exceed RPI and a further 3% per annum.
No options were granted to directors or changes made to existing entitlements in the year under review.
Employees may not receive option grants under the scheme and be included in the long term incentive plan in the same year.
Sharesave options: NEXT Group 2002 Sharesave Scheme The Companys Sharesave option scheme was renewed in 2000 by shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting.
Invitations to participate are generally issued annually to all employees.
sixteen NEXT PLC DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT The scheme operates on a save-as-you-earn principle and is subject to the Inland Revenue maximum contribution limit of 250 per month per employee.
Options are exercisable either three, five or seven years from the date of grant.
Options are granted at the prevailing market rate less a discount of 20% as permitted by Inland Revenue regulations.
A similar scheme is operated by the Company for its employees in the Republic of Ireland.
No Sharesave options were granted to executive directors in the year under review.
Group pension scheme Executive directors are eligible for membership of the NEXT Group Pension Plan which has been approved by the Inland Revenue and which consists of defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The trustee of the scheme is a limited company, NEXT Pension Trustees Limited the Trustee.
All the directors of the Trustee are appointed and can be removed by NEXT plc.
The Chairman of the Trustee is a non-executive director of NEXT plc and the Board of the Trustee includes members of the scheme, a pensioner member and an independent director.
All directors of the Trustee receive a fee for their services, including those directors who are also employees of NEXT plc.
The schemes investments are kept entirely separate from the business affairs of the NEXT Group and the Trustee holds them in trust.
Responsibility for investment of the schemes funds has been delegated by the Trustee to professional investment managers.
Defined contribution section Employees of the Group can join a defined contribution section of the scheme.
Members elect to pay either 3% or 5% of their pensionable earnings which is matched by the Company.
For death prior to retirement, a lump sum of three times the members basic salary at the previous 1 April is payable along with the current value of the members fund, subject to Inland Revenue limits.
Defined benefit section The defined benefit section of the scheme was closed to new members in 2000 but will be continued for the benefit of existing members.
The section provides members with a retirement benefit of one sixtieth or one eightieth depending on chosen member contribution rate of final pensionable earnings including bonus for each year of pensionable service, payable from a normal retirement age of 60.
This section also provides a lump sum death in service benefit and dependents pensions on death in service or following retirement.
For death prior to retirement a spouses pension of 60% of the members prospective pension is payable.
A lump sum of up to three times the members final pensionable earnings plus a return of the members contributions with interest, is also payable.
For death after retirement a spouses pension of 60% of the members pre-commutation pension is payable.
A lump sum equivalent to the balance of five years pension is payable if death occurs within five years of retirement.
If death occurs after leaving service but before the pension becomes payable i. e. as a deferred pensioner, a spouses pension of 60% of the accrued deferred pension is payable along with a lump sum equal to the members own contributions with interest.
Childrens pensions are only payable on death in service.
In the case of ill-health retirement only the accrued pension is payable.
All benefits are subject to Inland Revenue limits.
Increases to pensions in payment are at the discretion of the Trustee although pensionable service post 1997 is subject to limited price indexation.
For all current scheme members basic pay, overtime and annual performance bonus are included in calculating pensionable earnings but no other items of remuneration are taken into account.
The inclusion of annual performance bonus in pensionable earnings is limited to a maximum of 35% of an employees annual salary in any year.
The inclusion of bonus in pensionable earnings has been the practice for many years and is appropriate for NEXT where a significant element of employee earnings is dependent on productivity or profit performance.
The Remuneration Committee believe that the Company should continue with established precedent.
Members contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings, whilst the Companys regular cost contribution rate is 12.5% of pensionable earnings.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the schemes financial position was undertaken as at 31 March 2002 and concluded that the scheme had a 2% deficit of assets compared to actuarial liabilities.
The Company made contributions at a rate of 10% of pensionable earnings up to April 2002 when the rate was increased to 12.3%.
The rate has been a further increased to 12.5% from 1 February 2003.
Members who joined the scheme after May 1989 and before October 2000 are subject to the Inland Revenue salary cap for approved pension schemes which is set at 97,200 per annum for 2002 2003.
Members subject to the cap may be provided with appropriate benefits through an unfunded, unapproved arrangement in relation to that part of their earnings which exceeds the cap.
The relevant members contribute towards the additional cost of providing these benefits by paying 5% of pensionable earnings in excess of the cap.
Specific information in respect of executive directors pension entitlements is presented below.
seventeen NEXT PLC DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Notice periods Each of the executive directors, except Mr D C Jones, has a rolling service contract which is terminable by the Group on giving two years notice.
The Committee considers that notice periods of two years are reasonable and in the interests of all parties to attract and retain high calibre directors.
Mr Jones has a rolling service contract with a one year notice period which became effective on 16 May 2002 on Mr Jones assuming the duties of Chairman on a part-time basis.
All directors service contracts were renewed on 3 October 2002 as part of the capital reconstruction.
The Committee will ensure that in the event of any termination payment being made to a director that full account will be taken of that directors duty to mitigate any loss and where appropriate the Committee may seek independent professional advice prior to authorising such payment.
Apart from service contracts no director has had any material interest in any contract with the Company or its subsidiaries.
Other benefits Executive directors receive benefits which may include the provision of a fully expensed company car, private medical insurance, reimbursement of annual subscriptions to appropriate professional bodies and staff discount when purchasing the Groups merchandise.
Other employees are also eligible for certain of these benefits.
Non-executive directors Remuneration of the non-executive directors of the Company is determined by the executive directors.
Remuneration consists of fees for their services in connection with Board and Board Committee meetings.
Letters of appointment do not contain notice periods.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for pension scheme membership and do not participate in any of the Groups bonus, share option or other incentive schemes.
