x DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Directors Remuneration Report The Board has prepared this report, in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985, which applies for the first time this financial year.
An ordinary resolution for the approval of this report will be put to the members at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The law requires the Companys auditors to audit certain of the disclosures provided.
Where disclosures have been audited, they are indicated as such.
The auditors opinion is included in their report on page 31.
Remuneration Committee The Company has seven Directors, all of whom are non-executive.
There is no separate remuneration committee and the Board as a whole considers changes to Directors fees from time to time.
Baillie Gifford & Co, who have been appointed by the Board as Managers and Secretaries, provide advice when the Board considers the level of Directors fees.
Policy on Directors fees The Boards policy is that the remuneration of Directors should be set at a reasonable level that is commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of the role and consistent with the requirement to attract and retain Directors of the appropriate quality and experience.
It should also reflect the experience of the Board as a whole, be fair and should take account of the level of fees paid by comparable investment trusts.
It is intended that this policy will continue for the year ended 30 April 2004 and subsequent years.
The fees for the non-executive Directors are determined within an aggregate limit set out in the Companys Articles of Association, which currently stands at 100,000.
Shareholders approval to increase the aggregate limit to 200,000 will be sought at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting see Resolution No.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share options, long-term incentive schemes or other benefits.
The Board carried out a review of the level of Directors fees during the year, and concluded that the fees should be increased from 18,000 to 22,500 for the Chairman and from 12,000 to 15,000 per Director.
The increase was effective from 1 November 2002.
Directors and officers liability insurance cover is held by the Company in respect of the Directors.
Directors service contracts It is the Boards policy that none of the Directors has a service contract.
All of the Directors have been provided with appointment letters and the terms of their appointment provide that a Director shall retire and be subject to election at the first Annual General Meeting after their appointment.
Thereafter they are obliged to retire by rotation, and, if they wish, to offer themselves for re-election, at least every three years after that.
There is no notice period and no provision for compensation upon early termination of appointment.
