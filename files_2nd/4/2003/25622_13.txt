Mr K A Carter exercised his right to draw his pension from 1st January, 2002 and from that date no further contributions to the scheme were made on his behalf.
Transfer value: The accrued pension entitlement is the amount that the director would receive from retirement age if they left service on that date.
The increase in the accrued entitlement is the difference between the accrued benefit at the year end and that at the previous year end.
