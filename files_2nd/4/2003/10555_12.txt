31 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Remuneration report Composition of the Remuneration Committee The members of the Committee are Sir Alan Cox, Mr D C Godwin and Mr L Kylberg, all of whom are independent, under the Chairmanship of Sir Clive Whitmore who is the senior independent non-executive Director.
The biographies of the Committee members are listed on pages 24 and 25.
Compliance The principles applied by the Remuneration Committee in forming their policy for 2003 were consistent with the best practice provisions of the Principles of Good Governance and Code of Best Practice issued by the Financial Services Authority the Combined Code and the Company has throughout the year under review complied with the provisions set out in The Directors Remuneration Report regulations 2002 and with the Listing Rules.
Policy on remuneration of executive Directors and senior executives a Total Level of Remuneration The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that remuneration packages offered are competitive and designed to attract, retain and motivate executive Directors and senior executives of the right calibre in order to run the Company successfully.
The Committee consults with the Chief Executive and has access to external remuneration consultants, which enables appropriate comparisons to be made.
The intention is to ensure rewards are linked to corporate and individual performance.
This policy takes account of the decentralised and differing nature of the Morgan businesses in addition to reflecting the technical challenges which the Company faces in a global market place.
Performance is assessed against the performance of the relevant global business in respect of the remuneration of senior Global Business Presidents and against the performance of the Group for the Executive Committee.
b The Main Components The Company has in place performance related reward policies with measurable targets.
These are designed to reduce the proportion of fixed remuneration and provide for a growing element of at risk pay, which is only available when good results are achieved.
In this way, there is a strong link between reward and performance which should be beneficial to shareholders, employees and the Company.
The targets are set on the basis of being challenging performance criteria reflecting the Companys objectives.
The main components are: i Basic Salary Basic salary for each executive Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the performance of the individual and information taken from independent sources covering 330 of the FTSE 350 companies and some 2,000 directors on the rates of salary for similar jobs in a selected group of comparable companies.
The Committee, which has not appointed a particular organisation to provide advice, relies on specific comparator information taken from a relevant Towers Perrin Executive pay review and also from the Incomes Data Services Directors Pay Reports.
A salary review for Directors and senior executives was carried out in July 2003. ii Annual Bonus The targets for annual bonus are set by the Remuneration Committee balancing the short term and longer term.
Superior performance is encouraged by providing challenging performance goals, which must be achieved before the maximum bonus is payable.
The bonus scheme includes individual objectives and targets linked to the Groups performance.
The Committee believes this at risk element of reward closely relates shareholder and employee ambitions and has chosen the criteria below to reflect such return.
The annual bonus is not pensionable.
The bonus scheme which has been implemented for 2004 is designed to reward the achievement of stretch targets and foster the continued development of inter-global business co-operation.
It is focused upon rewarding outstanding performance in operating profit and free cash flow.
It provides the opportunity of earning a bonus of up to 50% of basic salary with 75% of that opportunity being provided through operating profit performance and 25% of the opportunity deriving from free cash flow.
Operating profit for the purposes of the scheme is defined as the profit before tax, net finance charges, goodwill amortisation and all exceptional items at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Free cash flow is the operating profit as adjusted for depreciation and goodwill amortisation, movement of working capital and provisions, capital expenditure, proceeds and profit loss on sale of fixed assets, tax, and net finance charges but before dividend payments and other such payments at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The mechanism for payment of up to 50% of basic salary will be based as follows: No performance bonus will be payable unless 2003 actual figures are exceeded Operating profit % of basic salary payable 120% of 2003 actual 7.50 2004 budget 37.50 Free cash flow 3 x 2003 actual 2.50 2004 budget 12.50 The above is considered appropriate because it will align executive reward with shareholder return.
The same scheme is also applicable to members of the Executive Committee.
In addition to this scheme, a maximum of 10% of salary will be available on the achievement of personal objectives.
This criteria is applicable to each of the executive Directors.
The Group Chief Executive has the opportunity to earn up to 100% of basic salary.
32 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Remuneration report A similar scheme existed in 2003.
The mechanism for payment of the 2003 bonus was as follows: Operating profit % of basic salary payable 125% of 2002 actual 7.50 2003 budget 18.75 125% of 2003 budget 37.50 Free cash flow 125% of 2002 actual 2.50 2003 budget 6.25 125% of 2003 budget 12.50 The scheme for 2003 provided a payout of 20% of basic salary based on a sliding scale as above plus a further 10% for achievement of personal objectives making a total of 30%.
The figures for the executive Directors are shown in the table on page 34.
The bonus for Mr Knowlton was 50%.
iii Share Schemes The Company believes that share ownership by the executive Directors and senior executives strengthens the link between their personal interests and those of the shareholders.
Executive share options are not granted at a discount at the time of grant and must be held for a minimum period of three years.
Options granted since 1996 to senior and middle management personnel have performance criteria for the exercise of those options based on the growth in the Companys earnings per share over the three year period following grant and will require the growth in earnings per share to outperform inflation by at least 6% in aggregate over that period.
No executive share options were granted to Directors in 2003.
Full details of all options in issue are shown on page 34.
Options issued to Directors, as shown in the share option table on page 34 on 25 October 1993, do not have performance criteria, which was common practice at the time.
These options lapsed and were not exercised on 24 October 2003.
Those Directors who received options under the Company employee Sharesave scheme are included in the table on page 34.
No performance conditions apply to those options.
The Morgan General Employee Benefit Trust The Trust, relating to the US, holds 140,805 Ordinary shares in the Company and the independent trustees can at their discretion utilise such shares in order to satisfy any obligations which may exist under employee share schemes.
A total of 336,064 Ordinary shares are held by the Morgan General Employee Trust.
The Committee has sought advice from Inbucon on its share schemes.
c Companies Used for Comparison In assessing all aspects of pay and benefits, Morgan compares the packages offered by similar companies.
These companies are chosen having regard to: ithe size of the company its turnover, profits and number of people employed: ii the diversity and complexity of its businesses: iii the geographical spread of its businesses: and iv its growth and expansion profile.
