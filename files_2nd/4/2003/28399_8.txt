Directors remuneration report 1 Introduction This is the directors remuneration report of Provident Financial plc the company for the financial year ended 31 December 2003 which was prepared pursuant to and in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations.
In accordance with the Regulations, a resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the annual general meeting of the company to be held on 5 May 2004.
2 The remuneration committee 2.1 From 1 January to 30 June 2003 the remuneration committee the committee consisted of Charles Gregson and John Maxwell under the chairmanship of Angela Heylin.
Following Angela Heylins retirement as a director on 30 June 2003 the committee consisted of Charles Gregson and Graham Pimlott under the chairmanship of John Maxwell for the rest of the year.
2.2 The committee met seven times during the year.
All the meetings were attended by all the members, with the exception of two meetings which were not attended by Charles Gregson.
2.3 Pursuant to its terms of reference, the committee considers the framework of executive remuneration and makes recommendations to the board.
It determines the specific remuneration packages and conditions of service of the Chairman, the executive directors and the Company Secretary, including their service agreements.
It also monitors the level and structure of the remuneration of the most senior management below board level within the group.
No director is involved in determining his own remuneration.
2.4 The Chairman and the Chief Executive each have the right to attend and speak but not vote at meetings of the committee other than when their remuneration or any matter relating to them is being considered in which case they absent themselves from the meeting.
In 2003 the committee consulted with the Chairman, John van Kuffeler, about the proposals for the Chief Executives remuneration and with the Chief Executive, Robin Ashton, about the proposals for the other executive directors.
The Company Secretary, Rosamond Marshall Smith, is secretary to the committee and attended the meetings of the committee in 2003: as a solicitor she provided legal and technical support to the committee.
2.5 The committee took advice on one matter from Monks Partnership.
Monks Partnership is a trading name of  LLP, which also provides audit, accounting and tax services to the company.
In July 2003 the committee decided to appoint remuneration consultants who were independent and did not provide any other services to the group.
Following a tender process, New Bridge Street Consultants LLP NBS were appointed in September 2003 and subsequently provided advice to the committee on remuneration and service contracts.
Neither NBS nor Clifford Chance LLP which has a financial interest in NBS provided any other services to the group during the year.
The committee has also been advised by Slaughter and May who are the groups city solicitors and who have advised the group on various legal matters, principally of a corporate nature, during the year.
In all cases the advisers were instructed by the secretary on behalf of the committee.
3 Statement of the companys policy on directors remuneration Remuneration policy 3.1 The remuneration policy applied by the committee is based on the need to attract, reward, motivate and retain executive directors in a manner consistent with the long-term accumulation of value for shareholders.
The committee is also conscious of the need to avoid paying more than is reasonable for this purpose.
3.2 The executive directors remuneration consists of a basic salary, an annual cash bonus subject to performance conditions and other benefits.
The directors participate in pension schemes.
Additionally they may participate in an employee savings-related share option scheme which is not subject to performance conditions, executive share option schemes and a performance share plan both of which are subject to performance conditions.
The remuneration policy is designed to ensure that a significant proportion of the executive directors remuneration is linked to performance, through the operation of the annual cash bonus and the executive share incentive schemes.
3.3 The committee reviews the executive directors remuneration annually.
Following the appointment of two new directors to the board in 2001 and the appointment of a new Chief Executive, the policy was to set the executive directors basic salaries in the lower quartile to median range at that time.
Following a two-year period of successful trading and a remuneration review during the year, the committee decided to move salaries, in stages over two years, towards the median level, subject to satisfactory performance.
3.4 The fees for the non-executive directors, other than the Chairman, are fixed by the board and are designed both to recognise the responsibilities of non-executive directors and to attract individuals with the necessary skills and experience to contribute to the future growth of the group.
Their business expenses are reimbursed by the company.
Full details of their fees for 2003 with 2002 comparative figures are set out in the table of directors remuneration on page 55 in paragraph 4 below.
3.5 It is currently envisaged that the existing policy on directors remuneration will continue for subsequent financial years but it will be reviewed again in December 2004.
52 Provident Financial Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Directors remuneration report continued 3 Statement of the companys policy on directors remuneration continued Cash bonus 3.6 An annual cash bonus is payable, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions.
The bonus is calculated as a percentage of salary.
The purpose of the bonus scheme is to provide a meaningful incentive for executive directors which is clearly focused on improving the groups performance and aligns, so far as is practicable, shareholder and executive director interests.
Executive directors are eligible for annual cash bonuses by reference to the growth in the companys audited earnings per share as defined in the bonus scheme over the previous financial year and the achievement of agreed personal objectives.
The total bonus payable cannot exceed 100% of salary.
In exceptional circumstances the committee may make such adjustments to the calculation of earnings per share as it considers fair and reasonable.
Bonuses do not form part of pensionable earnings.
Share options 3.7 The company currently operates two senior executive share option schemes.
Further details are set out in paragraphs 3.7.
1 The Provident Financial plc Senior Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 is an Inland Revenue approved scheme.
The aggregate exercise prices of the options held by an executive under this scheme must not exceed 30,000.
The Provident Financial plc Unapproved Senior Executive Share Option Scheme 1996 is not approved by the Inland Revenue.
The aggregate exercise prices of the options granted to an executive annually under both schemes must not exceed two times his salary.
2 Both schemes have performance targets which have to be met before any options can be exercised.
3 For options granted prior to 2002 the performance condition is that over a three-year period the real growth in earnings per share as defined must average 3% a year after making appropriate adjustments for inflation.
4 For options granted in 2002 and 2003 the following performance conditions apply: a where the option is granted over shares with an aggregate exercise price of up to one times the directors salary, the real growth in earnings per share after adjusting for inflation must average 3% a year over a fixed three-year period this period may be extended to four or five years : b to the extent that the option is granted over shares with an aggregate exercise price in excess of one times the directors salary, the condition is 4% rather than 3% real growth in earnings per share.
5 A performance condition based on earnings per share has been used in both executive schemes since their establishment in 1995 and 1996.
It is considered that this aligns, so far as is practicable, the interests of the directors with those of the shareholders.
The performance conditions were amended in 2002 pursuant to the approval of the company in general meeting but retained earnings per share as their basis, reflecting the alignment of the interests of the directors and those of the shareholders.
The performance conditions permit limited retesting by reference to a fixed base.
The committee is conscious of the fact that since 2002 there has been a change in attitude by institutions towards even limited retesting: but, since the current executive schemes expire in 2005, the committee considers it appropriate to make no change at present on the basis that a full review will be carried out in December 2004 and that retesting is not expected to form part of any new executive schemes.
6 The grant of options under the schemes to executive directors and senior managers is normally considered once in each year after the announcement of the companys results in accordance with a formula determined by reference to salary.
7 No executive options have been granted at a discount.
3.8 The executive directors together with other eligible group employees may participate in the Provident Financial plc Employee Savings-Related Share Option Scheme 2003.
Participants save a fixed sum each month for three or five years and may use these funds to purchase shares after three, five or seven years.
The exercise price is fixed at up to 20% below the market value of the shares at the date directors and employees are invited to participate in the scheme.
Up to 250 can be saved each month.
This scheme does not contain performance conditions as it is an Inland Revenue approved scheme designed for employees at all levels.
53 Provident Financial Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Directors remuneration report continued 3 Statement of the companys policy on directors remuneration continued Performance share plan 3.9 The Provident Financial Performance Share Plan the performance share plan entitles executive directors who waive up to 50% of their annual cash bonus to be considered for participation.
Participants receive a basic award of shares of up to the value of the waived bonus, together with a matching award of an equivalent amount which is subject to a performance condition.
In normal circumstances the awards vest after three years.
For awards granted in 2003 and 2004 the matching award will vest only if the companys average growth in earnings per share as defined is equal to or greater than RPI plus 3% over a period of three consecutive financial years, the first of which is the financial year starting immediately before the grant date of the matching award.
The performance conditions were selected by the committee after consideration of other possible types of condition.
The committee took the view that the use of this earnings per share target aligned, so far as is practicable, the interests of the directors with those of the shareholders.
Other benefits 3.10 The executive directors are provided with company-owned cars and fuel or a cash alternative, long-term disability cover under the companys insured permanent health policy and medical cover for them and their immediate families.
Benefits in kind are not pensionable.
Shareholding policy 3.11 The company has a share retention policy for executive directors which encourages them to build up a shareholding from shares acquired under the senior executive share option schemes referred to in paragraph 3.7 above and the performance share plan referred to in paragraph 3.9 above, provided that gains have been made on options and matching awards have vested under the performance share plan.
Over a five-year period commencing on 1 May 2002 a director should, in this way, aim to acquire a shareholding with a market value which is equal to or in excess of two times his annual salary.
The committee reviews the shareholdings of the executive directors in the light of this policy once a year.
Service agreements 3.12 In December 2003 the committee reviewed and amended the companys policy in relation to the notice periods in the service agreements of the executive directors.
The current policy is for executive directors service agreements to provide for both the company and the director to give one years notice.
Prior to December 2003 the policy was for two years notice to be given by the company.
No compensation was paid to the directors for the change.
No director has a service agreement containing a liquidated damages clause on termination: in the event of the termination of an agreement, particularly for poor performance, it is the current policy to seek full mitigation of loss by the director concerned and to ensure that any payment made is the minimum which is commensurate with the companys legal obligations.
Where possible, the company would seek to make any payment in instalments and subject to appropriate conditions.
Other directorships 3.13 The company will normally permit an executive director to hold up to two non-executive directorships and to retain the fees from the appointments.
However, any proposed appointment will require the approval of the board.
In accordance with the revised Combined Code, the board would not permit an executive director to take on more than one non-executive directorship of a FTSE 100 company or the chairmanship of such a company.
None of the executive directors currently holds a non-executive directorship.
Detailed information 3.14 Full details of salaries, bonus earnings and other benefits for 2003 with 2002 comparative figures for the executive directors are set out in the table of directors remuneration on page 55 in paragraph 4 below.

8 Directors service agreements 8.1 Four directors, Charles Gregson, Chris Johnstone, John Maxwell and David Swann are offering themselves for re-election, and two directors, Ray Miles and Graham Pimlott, are offering themselves for election at the annual general meeting to be held on 5 May 2004.
Details of the service agreement of each director with the company or letter of appointment, as relevant, are set out in paragraphs 8.2 and 8.4 below.
8.2 Each executive director has a service agreement which requires one years notice of termination to be given by the company and one years notice of termination to be given by the director.
No notice of termination has been given by either the company or any of the directors and thus in each case the unexpired term is one year.
There are no provisions for compensation payable upon early termination of any of the agreements.
However, in the event that a director is not re-elected at an annual general meeting of the company, the agreement is automatically terminated and this is treated as a breach by the company.
The dates of the agreements are as follows: Robin Ashton 28 January 2002 amended by letter of variation on 23 December 2003 : John Harnett 30 January 2002 amended by letter of variation on 24 December 2003 : Chris Johnstone 26 April 2001 amended by letter of variation on 24 December 2003 : and David Swann 26 April 2001 amended by letter of variation on 23 December 2003.
8.3 The Chairman, John van Kuffeler, has a service agreement dated 29 January 2002 amended by letter of variation on 24 December 2003 which requires one years notice of termination to be given by the company and six months notice of termination to be given by him.
No notice of termination has been given by either party and thus the unexpired term is one year.
8.4 Each of the non-executive directors has a letter of appointment.
Each director is appointed for a fixed period of three years, subject to election by shareholders.
The initial three-year period may be extended by one further three-year period and, in exceptional cases, for a further period subject to re-election by shareholders.
The dates of the letters of appointment and the unexpired terms are as follows: Charles Gregson 24 February 2004 unexpired term: to 31 May 2005: John Maxwell 1 May 2003 unexpired term: to 14 May 2006: Ray Miles 31 December 2003 unexpired term: to 31 December 2006: Graham Pimlott 26 June 2003 unexpired term: to 25 June 2006.
58 Provident Financial Annual Report & Accounts 2003 Directors remuneration report continued 8 Directors service agreements continued 8.5 In 2003 payments were made to two former directors Howard Bell, formerly Chief Executive, and Peter Bretherton, formerly Director of Corporate Affairs as a result of the arrangements which were made when they retired from the board in 2001 pursuant to the companys succession planning.
The former directors each agreed to retire before their normal retirement dates in order to facilitate the change in board structure and agreed to enter into a new service agreement.
In considering appropriate arrangements for them, the committee took into account a number of factors: these included the requirements of the businesses of the group, the fact that the timing of the changes was designed to be at the most opportune time for the future development of these businesses, the need for a smooth transition in changes of management at the highest level, the benefit of retaining the facility to use the services of these senior executives and the need to protect the commercial interests of the group.
Each former director had a service contract which required two years notice to be given by the company.
8.6 Howard Bell entered into a fixed term service agreement with the company as an executive under the terms of which he would continue to receive basic salary increased annually to take account of inflation and certain benefits principally a company car and pension contributions until his normal retirement date of 28 March 2004.
This contract also contains restrictive covenants to safeguard the companys interests.
In 2003 he received 352,309 in salary and 147,952 by way of other benefits including pension contributions.
In addition he may, subject to the relevant scheme rules, exercise outstanding executive and employee savings-related share options in respect of 173,310 shares until 27 September 2004, at prices ranging between 520p and 985p.
8.7 Peter Bretherton also entered into a similar fixed term service agreement containing restrictive covenants with the company as an executive under the terms of which he would continue to receive basic salary increased annually to take account of inflation and certain benefits until 31 July 2003.
In 2003 he received 137,114 in salary and 62,713 by way of benefits including pension contributions.
In 2003 he exercised executive options granted to him in 1997 and 2000 over 63,681 shares on which he made a gain of 30,114 and a savings-related share option over 1,389 shares on which he made a gain of 1,785.
He has no outstanding rights to exercise options.
9 Audit The elements of the directors remuneration including pension entitlements and share options set out in paragraphs 4 to 7, 8.6 and 8.7 of this report which are required to be audited, have been audited in accordance with the Regulations.
10 Performance graph The graph below shows a comparison of the total shareholder return TSR for the companys shares for each of the last five financial years against the total shareholder return for the companies comprising the FTSE 250 Index.
This index was chosen for this comparison because the company is currently a member of this index and has been a member for approximately 85% of the five-year period.
