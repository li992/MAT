Board report on remuneration The remuneration committee the Committee determines the remuneration of the executive Directors and makes recommendations to the Board of any changes to the terms and conditions of employment of executive Directors.
The Committee consists of four independent non-executive Directors: Ken Clarke Chairman, Neil Cross, Adrian Loader and Patrick Ponsolle.
Jeff Harris and Stefano Pessina attend meetings in advisory capacities but are not present when their own remuneration is discussed.
Remuneration policy The aims of the Groups remuneration policy has been, and will continue to be, to maximise the position of the Group in the European healthcare sector by attracting, retaining and motivating the highest calibre of executive Directors and senior executives and align the rewards of those individuals with the interests of shareholders by linking part of their remuneration package to the performance of the Group and the creation of long-term shareholder value.
In implementing the remuneration policy, the Committee has considered the principles in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued by the UK Financial Services Authority, which applied to this period, with regard to Directors remuneration.
In accordance with the remuneration policy, the remuneration of executive Directors is made up of a combination of basic salary, annual performance bonus, non-cash benets, long-term incentive plan benets, share options and pension benets, all of which are detailed below.
The executive Directors remuneration is reviewed at the start of each calendar year.
Service contracts Geoff Cooper, George Fairweather, Per Utnegaard and Steve Duncan are employed within the Group under contracts that can be terminated by either party with notice of twelve months.
Stefano Pessina and Ornella Barra have service contracts that can be terminated by the Group with notice of twelve months or by each of them with notice of six months.
There are provisions in the service contracts for payment in lieu of current salary to cover the required notice period.
Were the situation to arise, the Company intends to apply the principle of mitigation to any payment of compensation on termination as a result of unsatisfactory performance.
The dates of the executive Directors current service contracts are: Director Contract date S. Pessina 10 December 2002 G. I. Cooper 4 March 1994 G. R. Fairweather 28 March 2002 O. Barra 10 December 2002 P. Utnegaard 3 September 2003 S. W. J. Duncan 29 December 1995 The Company recognises that its executive Directors may be invited to become non-executive Directors of other listed companies and that such duties can broaden experience and knowledge, which will benefit the Company.
Executive Directors are therefore allowed to accept one external non-executive appointment with the Companys prior approval as long as this is not in any way connected with the companys business and would not lead to any conict of interest.
Fees received by the Director may be retained.
Jeff Harris is a non-executive Director of Bunzl and retained fees for that appointment of 7,916 during the period he was executive Chairman of Alliance UniChem Plc.
He is also a Director of Andreae-Noris Zahn, a German company in which the Group has an interest, the fees payable being retained by the Company.
Stefano Pessina is a non-executive Director of Galenica, an associate company.
He waived his entitlement to a Directors fee as part of the agreement with Galenica on reciprocal board representation.
Geoff Cooper was appointed a non-executive Director of Abbey National in January 2004 and will retain the fees payable.
George Fairweather was appointed a non-executive Director of Mitchells & Butlers in April 2003 and retained fees paid of 33,986 in 2003 for that appointment.
Salaries The setting of basic salary reects the Committees assessment of the market rate for relevant positions, taking into account the levels of responsibility, the individual Directors experience and his or her contribution to the business.
For determining basic salary in 2003 and 2004, the Committee appointed and received advice from Monks Partnership.
Monks Partnership does not provide any other service to the Company.
Where a Director is entitled to a benefit but chooses not to take that benefit, a supplement to the salary is paid in lieu of that benefit.
The amount paid to each Director in 2003 is detailed in the emoluments section below.
Benets Other benets available to executive Directors relate to the provision of company cars or a car allowance, private medical insurance, and, for Stefano Pessina, and in the case of Ornella Barra from September 2003, the cost of travel to and from work and accommodation while working for the Group in the UK.
The provision of these benets reects market practice and is not related to performance.
The value of these non-cash benets for each Director in 2003, including expenses chargeable to UK income tax, are detailed in the emoluments section below.
38 Alliance UniChem Plc Annual performance bonuses The annual performance bonus rewards executive Directors for the Group and individual divisions for which they are responsible achieving their budgeted performance, after the cost of the bonuses.
The payment also takes into account personal performance.
In 2003, the budgeted performance was based on the challenging but achievable 2003 budget for earnings, before amortisation of intangible assets, at constant exchange rates, agreed by the Board at the beginning of the year.
Depending upon responsibilities, a bonus of between 5% and 15% was payable for performance of 100% of the Group and divisional performance, rising to 40% for performance of 105% of the Group and divisional budgeted performance.
Personal performance was based on a 360-degree appraisal process and determined by the remuneration committee.
Depending on responsibilities, a bonus of up to 15% was payable based on this appraisal.
The maximum bonus an executive Director could receive was 50% of their basic salary.
The amount due to each Director in respect of performance in 2003 is detailed in the emoluments section below.
Non-executive Directors All non-executive Directors are entitled to a basic fee of 35,000.
Jeff Harris retired as an executive in April 2003, continuing as Chairman in a non-executive capacity under which he is entitled to a total fee of 250,000 per annum.
In addition, in 2003 he received 15,000 of unfunded pension payments directly from the Company, further details of which are set out in the pensions section of this report.
Ken Clarke is the Deputy Chairman and senior independent non-executive Director and receives a total fee of 125,000 per annum, which includes a fee of 5,000 per annum for chairing the remuneration committee.
Neil Cross receives a total fee of 45,000, which includes a fee of 10,000 per annum for chairing and serving on the audit committee.
Other members of the audit committee are each paid an additional fee of 5,000 per annum.
The fees paid reect the time non-executive Directors are required to commit to their duties and amounts paid to non-executives in comparable companies.
The UK Board Index of the 150 largest quoted companies by market value published by Spencer Stuart was used to assess comparability.
The Board reviews these fees periodically and no Director is permitted to vote in respect of their own remuneration.
Non-executive Directors derive no other benets from their ofce and are not eligible to participate in the Groups pension arrangements.
Jeff Harris receives a pension in respect of his service whilst acting as an executive of the Company.
It is Company policy not to grant share options to non-executive Directors or to require part of their fees to be paid in the form of shares.
Jeff Harris will continue to be eligible to receive share options in connection with allocations made under the long-term incentive plan whilst he was an executive Director.
In the case of the award arising from the 2000 allocation he has a year in which to exercise his option.
In the case of any award arising from the 2001 allocation he will be entitled to 50% of the award and will have six months to exercise the award and in the case of any award arising from the 2002 allocation he will be entitled to 25% of the award and will have six months to exercise the award.
Non-executive Directors are appointed for xed terms, normally of three years.
Non-executive Directors who have served beyond six years are subject to a more rigorous review when they come up for re-election.
This review takes account of the need for progressive refreshing of the Board.

Long-term incentive plan The long-term incentive plan is a discretionary arrangement under which allocations are made to executive Directors with the aim of rewarding them for creating shareholder value.
Each allocation takes the form of a non-binding statement of intent to make an award of a stated maximum amount following the end of a specified performance period.
The allocation is determined as a percentage of basic salary in the year the performance period starts.
The Directors allocations outstanding at 24 February 2004 are: 2001 allocation 2002 allocation 2003 allocation 2004 allocation maximum amount maximum amount maximum amount maximum amount Director J.

Total shareholder return measures the total return to shareholders in terms of share price growth and dividends reinvested in the shares of the Company over the performance period.
Inbucon Group provides the Committee with a total shareholder return monitoring report and advises on performance under the long-term incentive plan based on diluted earnings per share performance.
Earnings per share are dened as the diluted earnings per share before amortisation of intangible assets and exceptional items as reported for a full accounting year.
RPI-x is the index of retail prices for all items excluding mortgage payments as published by the UK Government.
The performance against RPI-x is calculated on a per annum compound basis.
For the 2001 and 2002 allocation, the total shareholder return measure is compared with the performance of companies in the FTSE 250.
Performance measure Achievement % awarded Total shareholder return below median at median 50% 12.5% for every 1% above median 1.5% up to upper quartile 75% 50.0% Earnings per share below RPI-x 3% at RPI-x 3% 5.0% for every 0.1% above RPI-x 3% 4.5% up to RPI-x 4% 50.0% For the 2003 and 2004 allocations, the total shareholder return measure is compared with the performance of companies in the FTSE 100, and the earnings per share measure was changed to: Performance measure Achievement % awarded Earnings per share below RPI-x 5% at RPI-x 5% 5.0% for every 0.1% above RPI-x 5% 4.5% up to RPI-x 6% 50.0% The award takes the form of a right to acquire ordinary shares in the Company for a nominal sum within a period of ten years from the date of the award.
The number of shares will be determined by the market price of the Companys shares at the date of the award.
The Committee has the discretion to withhold or reduce awards to any extent it considers appropriate, having regard to the Groups underlying financial performance and irrespective of the level of attainment of the performance targets.
During 2003, awards were made on allocations with the performance period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2002.
During the performance period, the Company was in the 86th percentile of the comparator group on total shareholder return and the increase in earnings per share was in excess of RPI-x 4%.
On this basis, awards equivalent to 100% of the allocations were made and converted into share options at 467 pence per share, as follows: Allocation Award nominal value Award share options Director number J.

Following the end of the performance period for the 2001 allocation detailed above, the Committee has recommended to the trustees of the 1992 Employee Trust that awards equivalent to 82% of the allocation are made.
Their basis for doing this is that during the performance period, the Company was in the 63rd percentile of the comparator group on shareholder return and the increase in earnings per share was in excess of RPI-x 4%.

Per Utnegaard is eligible to join the Companys pension scheme with effect from 1 January 2004.
The accrued pension is a benefit of the dened benefit plan of the Companys pension scheme.
The arrangements of the pension scheme are as follows: the normal retirement age of the Directors is 60: Jeff Harris received an unreduced pension from age 55, based on arrangements entered into with the Company in 1992.
The pension arising was agreed to be calculated on the basis of the annual rate of basic salary at the time of retirement plus the annual average of car fuel benefit and bonus over the three years preceding retirement.
14,000 of this pension is unfunded and paid directly by the Company, and the cost for this is reported in the emoluments disclosure.
The above gures take account of this unfunded pension liability.
All current executive Directors pension benets are calculated excluding bonuses.
Directors are required to pay a contribution of 5% of basic salary: a spouses pension of one half of the Directors pension is payable on death after retirement: a statutory minimum pension for the legal widow and the Directors accumulated contributions are payable on death after leaving service but before retirement: Directors pensions are automatically increased each year after retirement in line with ination: additional increases may be payable at the discretion of the Trustee of the scheme, subject to the approval of the Company: no allowance is made for discretionary benets within transfer values.
The Company pays the additional money purchase contributions into separate schemes with no additional contributions from the Directors.
Any additional voluntary contributions paid by the Directors, and the benets arising from such contributions, are excluded from the table.
