The Committee makes recommendations to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, on an overall remuneration package for executive directors and other senior managers.
The Remuneration Committee complies with the Combined Code for Corporate Governance of the Financial Services Authority.
This report also complies with disclosures required by the Director Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
During the year the Committee and the Company received specific advice on remuneration matters relating to share schemes and the Enterprise Inns Incentive Plans from Ernst & Young LLP E&Y.

Remuneration Policy Executive Directors In relation to executive directors, the Remuneration Committee has responsibility in determining an overall remuneration package for executive directors in order to attract, retain and motivate high quality executives capable of achieving the Companys objectives and thereby enhancing shareholder value.
To achieve this, the remuneration package consists of basic salary and benefits, pensions, performance related cash bonuses and long and short-term incentive plans under which incentives earned are satisfied by the award of shares.
The details of individual components of the remuneration package and service contracts are as follows: Basic salary and benefits: Basic salary is a fixed cash sum payable monthly.
The basic salary and benefits are reviewed annually.
Benefits principally comprise car allowances or the use of a motor car, fuel and private medical insurances.
Pensions: The pension contributions are amounts paid to the directors individual defined contribution schemes.
Enterprise Inns Incentive Plans At the Annual General Meeting held on 21 January 1997 an ordinary resolution was passed adopting the Enterprise Inns Incentive Plan the Plan, which provides for participants to earn non-pensionable cash bonuses and short-term and long-term incentives.
The Plan rules recite the Companys intention to satisfy all share incentives awarded under the Plan using ordinary shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust.
At the Annual General Meeting held on 24 January 2002 an ordinary resolution was passed adopting the Enterprise Inns Incentive Plan 2002 the 2002 Plan.
The 2002 Plan has replaced the Plan and no further awards are to be made under the Plan.
The 2002 Plan also provides for participants to earn non-pensionable cash bonuses and short-term and long-term share incentives will be satisfied using shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust.
The Company established an Employee Benefit Trust on 26 September 1996.
As at 30 September 2002 the trust, which has been funded by a combination of loans and gifts from the Company, had purchased an aggregate of 893,558 shares.
On 17 September 2003 the trust purchased 70,000 ordinary shares and on 18 September 2003 the trust purchased a further 150,000 ordinary shares.
The cost of these purchases was 2,039,000 and was funded by a gift from the Company.
Options over 141,555 shares were exercised on 2 December 2002.
It is intended that the remaining 972,003 shares held by the trust will be used to satisfy other awards made under the Enterprise Inns Incentive Plans.
Under the terms of the Enterprise Inns plc Incentive Plans, executive directors can participate in long-term and short-term incentives dependent upon achievement of compound growth in adjusted earnings per share adjusted EPS.
Adjusted EPS has been chosen to reflect the core focus of the Group on continuous and sustainable earnings growth.
The Committee believes that these arrangements provide rewards which reflect an appropriate balance between individual and Company performance and align rewards of Directors with the longterm interests of shareholders.
These awards are satisfied by the issue of shares.
Further details are set out below.
Enterprise Inns Annual Report 2003 18 Report on Directors Remuneration Performance related bonuses: Under the terms of the 2002 Plan, executive directors are eligible to participate in an annual cash bonus scheme as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The annual cash bonus is expressed as a percentage of salary calculated by reference to the growth in adjusted EPS.
To qualify for any award, the growth of adjusted EPS must exceed the RPI by 2.5% and to qualify for the maximum award of 30% of salary, adjusted EPS growth must exceed the RPI by 15% in the relevant financial year.
Awards between the minimum and maximum limits are calculated on a straight-line basis pro rata to the growth in adjusted EPS between the minimum and maximum targets.
The cash bonus awards for the year are shown in the remuneration table on page 21.
Short-term incentive Under the terms of the 2002 Plan the short-term incentive depends upon achievement of annual growth in adjusted EPS measured against RPI.
There is a one-year performance period for awards.
No short-term award is made unless adjusted EPS exceeds RPI by at least 2.5% over the performance period.
To achieve the maximum award of 20%, adjusted EPS must exceed RPI by 15%.
Short-term incentives may not ordinarily be exercised for 36 months after the end of the performance criteria period.
Long-term incentive Under the Plan, the long-term incentive awards ordinary shares to participants upon achievement of compound growth in EPS measured against RPI over 3 years.
To qualify for any award, adjusted EPS must exceed RPI over a three year period by 5% compound 15.8% simple, and to qualify for the maximum award of 50% of salary averaged over a three year period, adjusted EPS must exceed RPI over a three year period by 15% compound 52.1% simple.
Long-term incentives may not ordinarily be exercised until 24 months after the end of the performance criteria period.
Under the 2002 Plan, the long-term incentive awards ordinary shares to participants upon achievement of compound growth in adjusted EPS measured against RPI over 3 years.
To qualify for any award, adjusted EPS must exceed RPI over a three-year period by 5% compound 15.8% simple, and to qualify for the maximum award of 100% of salary averaged over a three year period, adjusted EPS must exceed RPI over a three-year period by 20% compound 72.8% simple.
The participants of the 2002 plan will bear the cost of any income tax and any primary class 1 or secondary class 1 national insurance contributions for which the Company must account to the Inland Revenue.
Remuneration Policy Non-Executive Directors Fees: The fees for non-executive directors are determined by the Board within the limits in the Articles of Association.
The non-executive directors are not involved in any discussions or decision about their own remuneration.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors takes the form solely of fees, which are set by the Board having taken advice on appropriate levels.
Service contracts: The Companys policy is for all executive directors to have a service contract under which they are entitled to receive twelve months notice of termination.
There are no special provisions in the executive directors contracts for compensation in the event of loss of office.
The Committee would consider the circumstances of any individual case of early termination and would determine compensation payments accordingly.
A fair but robust principle of mitigation would be applied to the payment of compensation in the context of professional advice received as to contractual entitlement.
