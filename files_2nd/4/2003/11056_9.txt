REMUNERATION REPORT The role of the remuneration committee, whose members are John Grieves Chair, Dick Barfield and Carolyn McCall, is to make recommendations in relation to the Companys policy on remuneration of senior management and to consider and approve on behalf of the Board and the shareholders, the salaries, incentives and other benefit arrangements of the executive directors.
It also oversees the Companys share option schemes.
This report complies with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations which apply to the Company for the first time this year.
It sets out how the principles of the Combined Code relating to executive director remuneration are applied by the Company.
This reports sets out the Companys policy on executive directors remuneration for 2003 2004 and, so far as practicable, for subsequent years.
The inclusion in the report of remuneration policy in respect of years after 2003 2004 is required by the Regulations.
The remuneration committee is able to state its remuneration policy for 2003 2004 with reasonable certainty, but is less certain that this policy will continue without amendment in subsequent years.
This is because the remuneration committee considers that a successful remuneration policy needs to be sufficiently flexible to take account of future changes in the Companys business environment and in remuneration practice.
Statement of remuneration policy New Looks policy on the remuneration of its executive directors and other senior management for 2003 2004 and subsequent financial years will continue to be that remuneration should be adequate to attract, motivate, develop, and retain personnel of a high calibre, recognising that they are key to the ongoing success of the business, and should reward them for enhancing shareholder value.
Account will also be taken of the experience, performance and ability of the individual director.
In determining policy on the remuneration of executive directors and considering specific remuneration packages for individual directors, the remuneration committee will normally obtain independent advice from remuneration consultants and will consult with the Chief Executive.
The remuneration consultants used during the year ending 29 March 2003 were Kepler Associates who were appointed by the committee in February 2002.
Kepler Associates also provided advice on the level of remuneration for retail board executives, long term incentive schemes and bonus target setting.
The Director of Human Resources Robin Lewis and the Company Secretary also assisted the committee.
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer are the Groups main legal advisers and provided advice to the committee on the Companys share option plans.
The Board continues to be committed to formal and transparent procedures for developing remuneration policy, fixing executive remuneration and ensuring that no director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.
Remuneration is structured such that remuneration packages are intended to be competitive and that a significant proportion of the remuneration of executive directors is variable and linked to performance.
Each year the remuneration committee sets targets and determines bonus payments by performance against such targets.
The remuneration committee has decided that it is currently in the best interests of both the Company and its shareholders to set bonus targets solely by reference to corporate performance.
Targets are principally related to the profitabililty of the Group.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for each executive director has been set at 100% of basic annual salary.
An element of remuneration policy is to grant share options to all senior employees and executive directors as part of the overall remuneration package to reward performance.
Performance conditions are attached to each of the executive share option schemes operated by the Company, details of which are set out in the Share Schemes section later in this report.
The remuneration committee considers that the performance conditions are stretching and appropriate and that the time periods involved show not only expected annual growth but demonstrate that long-term sustainable growth is essential in providing shareholder return.
It is the Companys intention to continue to grant such share options to encourage and reward performance.
The Company also operates a share ownership guideline of one times salary for executive directors.
The remuneration committee will keep these guidelines under review.
In each year, the Company will make contributions to a personal pension plan of each executive directors choice and, where appropriate, to a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme FURBS or such other pension scheme as may be agreed from time to time of an amount equal to, in aggregate, 20% of the executive directors basic annual salary.
Neither bonus payments nor benefits in kind are pensionable.
ANNUAL REPORT 2002 03 25 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Total remuneration for executive directors is made up of fixed and performance related elements.
Consistent with its policy, the committee places considerable emphasis on the performance related elements of remuneration that comprise annual bonus and share options.
As a proportion of each executive directors total remuneration including retirement benefits, approximately 57% of total remuneration is performance related and approximately 43% is fixed.
The non-performance related percentages are calculated taking into account basic annual salary plus pension and benefits.
The performance related percentages assume 100% bonus of basic annual salary and the fair value of options granted during the year under the Executive Share Option Plan.
The fair value has been calculated using a methodology based on a Black Scholes valuation.
The Company will continue to review the mix of fixed and performance related remuneration on an annual basis.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors including the Chairman is determined by the Board as a whole, based on independent advice received from Kepler Associates and review of current practices in other companies.
Non-executive directors do not participate in any incentive arrangements.

Performance is measured by Total Shareholder Return share price growth plus dividends paid.
The graphs look at the value of 100 invested in New Look Group plc in June 1998 compared with that invested in the FTSE All-Share General Retailers Index, and also with the FTSE All-Share Index.
In the directors opinion, the FTSE All-Share General Retailers Index represents the most appropriate index against which the Total Shareholder Return of the Company should be measured, as the index includes a number of companies which are most directly comparable with New Look.
However, as a more broadly based performance comparison over the same period, the second graph shows a comparison with the FTSE All-Share Index.
26 ANNUAL REPORT 2002 03 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Directors service agreements The Companys policy is that all executive directors have service agreements with a twelve month rolling notice period and which may, at the Companys discretion, be terminated immediately by the Company with a payment in lieu of notice of basic annual salary.
The details of the service agreements of those who served as executive directors during the year are: Length Effective date of contract Contractual of service unexpired Notice termination agreement term period provisions S Sunnucks 1 1 May 1998 12 month 12 months Liquidated sum equal to 95% rolling contract of salary and benefits P Wrigley 2 October 2000 12 month 12 months Pay in lieu of notice equal to one years rolling contract basic salary or amount of unexpired notice C McPhail 4 June 2001 12 month 12 months Pay in lieu of notice equal to one years rolling contract basic salary or amount of unexpired notice A Miller 18 January 2000 12 month 12 months Pay in lieu of notice equal to one years rolling contract basic salary or amount of unexpired notice 1 If the Company terminates the service agreement in breach of contract, the Company will pay an amount equal to 95% of salary and the cost of providing benefits which includes pension contributions, car and fuel, medical insurance and permanent health insurance but excludes bonus for a twelve month period.
Non-executive directors are appointed by letters of appointment, with the exception of the arrangement for Tom Singh described below, and do not have contracts of service or contracts for services.
They are appointed for a three-year term.
However, the Company is entitled to terminate an appointment at any time, without compensation, in accordance with the articles of association.
In July 2002, the nomination committee minuted that it noted and would follow the then current guidelines that non-executive directors should be appointed for a maximum of nine years.
This position will be kept under review and consideration would be given to any changes to published guidelines.
On 1 May 2001, upon cessation of his full-time employment with the Company, Tom Singh commenced consultancy services in the field of womens fashion wear and other such matters as agreed.

In the year ended 30 March 2002, Stephen Sunnucks, Alastair Miller, Tom Singh and Phil Wrigley waived their rights to receive pay increases linked to the Retail Price Index, as set out in their service agreements.

For the 53 weeks ended 30 March 2002, Carl McPhail was paid a joining bonus of 136,000.
Share schemes The Company operates two Inland Revenue Approved and Unapproved executive share option schemes.
The Executive Share Option Scheme the Executive Scheme was adopted at the time of float in June 1998.
The 2002 Executive Share Option Plan the Executive Plan was adopted at our Annual General Meeting held on 18 July 2002.
28 ANNUAL REPORT 2002 03 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Executive plan The Executive Plan has been designed to be competitive with those offered by our peers in the retail sector whilst ensuring that rewards are linked to the achievement of stretching corporate performance.
For executive directors the potential rewards are substantial but such rewards remain dependent on achieving outstanding returns for shareholders.
Phased annual grants will be made and will fall into two categories: A Options and B Options.
Grant levels will be reviewed on an annual basis.
The exercise price of an Option will not be less than the market value of a share at the time of grant.
Both types of Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant provided the following performance targets are achieved.
A Options will vest upon achievement of a real earnings per share growth of 5% per annum over a three year period.
There is a fixed base year and two re-test opportunities after four and five years.
A Options will become exercisable on the third anniversary of grant if the performance target is satisfied.
The ceiling on the level of A Option grants is one and a half times salary per annum.
B Options will vest on a sliding scale, with 20% vesting on achieving real earnings per share growth of 5% per annum and the maximum only vesting if real earnings per share growth of 15% per annum is achieved.
The growth is tested over a three year period with two retest opportunities after four and five years and from a fixed base year.
The ceiling on the level of B Option grants is three times salary per annum for executive directors.
Other participants will receive a reduced level.
Provided the performance target is met, B Options will become exercisable in three equal tranches on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant.
If a partially vested tranche is exercised then no further shares under that tranche can be exercised.
The committee considers that a three year average earnings growth objective is a sufficient and appropriate time period to reward the directors for continuing long-term earnings growth.
Options granted under the Executive Plan cannot normally be exercised until the Groups share ownership target of one times salary has been achieved.
Existing options count towards the share ownership target provided they are vested and are in the money.
The following two schemes, namely, the Executive Scheme and Family Option Scheme, have been closed since the approval of the Executive Plan.
Executive scheme closed Options were granted at market value at the time of grant and are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant provided that the increase in the Companys earnings per share over a three year period exceeds the Retail Prices Index by 15%.
Under the schemes rules no executive may be granted options over more than four times salary.
Family option scheme closed Tom Singh, New Looks founder and largest shareholder, and his family interests made available a total of 7 million shares, which represented 3.5% of the Companys equity, over which share options could be granted under the Family Option Scheme.
Options were granted at market price at the time of grant and are normally exercisable in three tranches between two and four years from the date of grant.
Other than in the case of certain options granted to executive directors, the exercise of options was not dependent on the satisfaction of a corporate performance target following grant.
ANNUAL REPORT 2002 03 29 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED In November 2001, options were granted to the executive directors under the Family Option Scheme, over a total of 975,000 shares, with a performance condition that the share price must equal or exceed 250p for 20 consecutive days by the date of exercise.
This condition was met on 21 May 2002.
These options will normally be exercisable in two equal tranches between three and four years from the date of grant.
The remuneration committee will determine whether the performance conditions have been met under all the above schemes using the methods set out in the relevant scheme rules.
Their findings will then be verified by the Companys auditors.
Sharesave scheme The Company operates a Sharesave scheme for UK employees.
Under the scheme, employees may purchase shares in the Company with their savings and interest from save as you earn savings contracts.
This scheme operates within specific tax legislation.
As an all employee share scheme, no performance conditions apply to the exercise of options under this scheme.
Options were granted during the year in accordance with the Companys policy of encouraging share ownership throughout the Group.
Sharesave options were granted during the year at an exercise price of 213p, being the market price less a discount of up to 20% as permitted by the relevant legislation.
They are normally exercisable after either three or five years from the start of the savings contract.
