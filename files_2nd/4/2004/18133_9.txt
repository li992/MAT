THE WORK OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The Board has appointed a Remuneration Committee that comprises James Dean Chairman and Keith Harris who are both considered to be independent Non-Executive Directors.
The remit of the Committee is to consider and recommend to the Board: a.
The remuneration of the Executive Directors, including performance related bonuses b.
The administration of the Companys share option schemes The Committee has maintained the same membership throughout the year, and has held one formal meeting during the period.
In addition, the members of the Committee have had informal contact as necessary throughout the year.
The Committee received advice from the Executive Chairman, Sten Mortstedt.
REMUNERATION POLICY The Companys policy on remuneration is to set overall remuneration packages at a level sufficient to attract, retain and incentivise high calibre staff with a view to enhancing long-term shareholder value.
Executive Directors Consistent with this policy, emoluments awarded to Executive directors are intended to be competitive and comprise a mix of both performance and non-performance related remuneration.
This is designed to incentivise directors and to align their interests with those of shareholders, whilst adhering to the goals of Corporate Governance.
The Remuneration Committee conducts an annual analysis of the remuneration and emoluments of the Directors against a group of 10 appropriate quoted real estate companies.
In all cases, this analysis showed that, whilst the performance of CLS was in the upper quartile of the review group, the remuneration of the Directors was in the third quartile.
The Board does not anticipate any significant change to its remuneration policy in the year ending 31 December 2005.
Non-Executive Directors The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is reviewed and determined by the Board, having received the recommendations of the Executive Directors.
Their remuneration consists of fees for their services to the Board and any additional services such as chairing Board committees.
Basic salaries The basic salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed annually as at 1 January.
The annual review takes account of similar positions in a range of comparable companies as indicated above.
Performance-Related Remuneration The performance-related element, if any, of each Executive Directors remuneration is determined after taking into account the performance of the individual and the performance of the Company, together with the emoluments of the individual, compared to those in the comparator group mentioned above.
Sten Mortstedt does not receive a performance-related element in respect of his remuneration as the Remuneration Committee considers that the size of his shareholding in the Company gives an adequate link to performance.
No Non-Executive Director receives a performance-related element of their remuneration.. 59 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT for the year ended 31 December 2004 2.

SHARE OPTIONS AUDITED The Board has delegated to the Remuneration Committee the authority to grant options under the Companys 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme an Inland Revenue Approved scheme and under the Companys Unapproved Share Option Scheme.
As ten years have elapsed since the adoption of the 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme, no new options can be granted.
After careful review, the Board does not currently intend to seek the approval of the shareholders for the adoption of a new Inland Revenue Approved scheme.
Share options have normally been awarded to Executive Directors on the commencement of employment, and there is no policy to provide options to Directors on an annual basis.
It is current policy not to provide share options to Non-Executive Directors.
The exercise of share options granted under the Schemes is conditional upon the satisfaction of performance criteria, namely the growth in the net assets of the Group being at least equivalent to the growth of the All Properties Capital Growth Index maintained by Investment Property Databank Limited.. 61 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT for the year ended 31 December 2004 6.
