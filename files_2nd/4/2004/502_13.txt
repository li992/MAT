44 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 Remuneration Policy The Committee has adopted the following policy for the remuneration of Executive Directors throughout 2004.
It is intended that this policy will apply in 2005 and future years.
Annual Salaries Salaries are determined by a combination of the individuals contribution to the business and the market rate for the job.
The Company typically pays the market median, for standard performance in the job, and pays up to the market upper quartile for upper quartile performance.
On occasions it may be necessary to pay above the market median to attract people of the right calibre to meet the needs of the business.
The appropriate market rate is the rate in the market place from which the individual is most likely to be recruited.
The Company operates in a number of market places throughout the world where remuneration practice and levels differ.
This can result in pay and benefit differentials between the Executive Directors.
In arriving at an appropriate market rate, reference is made to a number of well-established salary surveys covering similar jobs of the same size in a large sample of over 400 companies in the manufacturing and service sectors in the UK.
The same consistent approach is taken for expatriate and overseas salaries where reference is made to the appropriate surveys for the geographical location.
The Companys pay systems are designed to allow progression that reflects an individuals contribution to the business and to control overall cost.
Pay and benefit structures are designed to be cost effective to achieve the right level of attraction and retention at the best value.
The Company is always mindful of the need for good corporate governance in respect of pay and benefits for all its employees including Directors.
Performance related elements of Remuneration A significant proportion of Executive Directors remuneration is performance related through annual bonus and share plans as further explained below.
Annual Cash Bonuses The Company pays competitive bonuses that are intended to place the total cash earnings of executives at around upper quartile for the market place in high performance years.
The factors to be measured for bonus purposes and the corresponding levels of bonus are pre-determined at the start of the year.
Bonuses are paid as close to the end of the performance period as practicable so that they reflect current performance.
All Executive Directors participate in a scheme which allows them to earn bonuses on a graduated scale if a targeted level of earnings per share is exceeded.
The performance criteria are designed to enhance shareholder value and the Committee approves all financial targets and personal goals: no bonus will be paid if targets and goals are not achieved.
For the Group Chief Executive and the Finance Director, all of their bonus is based upon earnings per share.
75% of the bonus of Regional Directors is based upon the same measure with 25% based upon profit achieved in their own region.
In 2005, 50% of the bonus of Regional Directors will be based upon earnings per share and 50% upon the profit achieved in their own region.
The Group Chief Executive and the Director responsible for North America have a maximum bonus opportunity of 75% of basic salary.
The maximum for other Executive Directors is 50% and in 2005 this maximum will increase to 60%.
The Committee does, however, also have discretion to reward outstanding individual achievement.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 45 Remuneration Report continued Long-Term Incentive Arrangements At the 2004 Annual General Meeting shareholders approved the introduction of Long-Term Incentive Arrangements consisting of a performance share plan and a co-investment plan which cover about 100 executives in the business worldwide and operate as follows: Performance Share Plan Under this plan, executives are granted a conditional award of shares, some, all or none of which will vest three years later, depending upon the Companys performance over the deferral period.
The measurement of performance commences in the year in which the award is made and awards are subject to the executive remaining in service at the end of the period.
Two performance measures are utilised: 75% of plan awards is measured against earnings per share EPS and 25% against Return on Capital Employed ROCE.
The first performance measure is real i. e. excluding inflation compound growth in aggregate EPS over a three-year period.
The definition of EPS is the fully diluted EPS published in the Annual Report, although the Committee has the discretion to make adjustments to ensure the measure is consistent from year to year and represents a fair measure.
The Committee selected this measure because it believes that it is well aligned with shareholder interests as well as being readily understood by executives.
Having considered the businesss future plans and prospects, the Committee decided that an appropriate range for real compound annual growth in EPS over the next few years is 3%-8%, if inflation averages 2% per year, this would be 5%-10% growth in normal terms.
There is no award for aggregate real compound EPS growth of 3% per annum or less.
The maximum award is made if aggregate EPS is equivalent to real compound annual growth of 8% or more.
For performance between these levels, awards would be made on a straight line, pro-rata, basis between zero and the maximum level.
The second performance measure is average ROCE over a three-year period.
The Committee selected this measure because it believes that an adequate level of ROCE is essential for the maintenance of shareholder value and this measure is already in use throughout the business.
The Committee will review the appropriate ROCE performance range for each annual grant of awards to be made under the plan, taking account of the businesss future plans and prospects.
Having considered these factors in respect of awards made in 2004, the Committee decided that an appropriate range for the three-year performance period 2004-2006 is ROCE of between 13.7% and 15.7% per annum.
There would be no award for average ROCE of 13.7% or less.
The maximum award would be made if average ROCE is 15.7% or more.
For performance between these levels, awards would be made on a straight line, pro-rata, basis between zero and the maximum award.
The Committee has increased this range for awards made in 2005 and the range for the three-year performance period 2005-2007 will be ROCE of between 15% and 17% per annum.
The Committees intention is that the maximum award would be for shares with a value equal to one years salary at date of grant and that, in practice, only Executive Directors would receive awards at this level.
Whilst the rules of the plan permit a maximum award of shares up to a value equal to two years salary, the Committees intention is that in most circumstances the maximum award would be a value equal to one years salary, and that, in practice, the number of people receiving awards at this level would be very restricted.
During 2004 Executive Directors were granted awards of between 70% and 100% of their basic salary.
46 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 Co-Investment Plan Under this plan executives are allowed to invest up to a maximum of 20% of their base salary in Aggreko shares.
The offer will be made to them each year shortly after bonuses are declared.
This means that executives can use their net bonus to acquire shares at market price but there is no direct link to the bonus paid.
Provided that the executive continues to hold these shares for three years the Company will make a matching award.
There will be an automatic match of three shares for every four the executive holds i. e. a 75% match.
Higher levels of matching award will be dependent upon performance up to a maximum total matching award of six shares for every four the executive holds, i. e. a 150% match, if the maximum level of performance is achieved.
The performance measures and performance targets under this Co-Investment plan are exactly the same measures as those which will apply under the performance share plan, i. e. real compound growth in aggregate EPS in a range from 3% to 8% per annum on a straight line, pro-rata, basis and average ROCE of between 13.7% and 15.7% per annum.
Savings-Related Share Option Schemes The Company believes that savings-related share schemes generally encourage the matching of interests between employees and shareholders.
The Aggreko Savings-Related Share Option Scheme Sharesave is normally offered annually to all employees and Executive Directors who have at least six months service.
Executive Share Option Schemes Prior to 2004 senior executives were invited to participate in an Executive Share Option Scheme at the discretion of the Committee.
Following the implementation of the Performance Share and the Co-Investment Plans, it is anticipated that further grants under the existing Executive Share Option Schemes will only be made in exceptional circumstances where the new plans are not appropriate.
The allocation of Executive Share Options was based on multiples of remuneration dependent upon the seniority 1 and job size of the individuals appointment, with the maximum multiple of 1 3 times remuneration in any one year being available to Executive Directors.
UK participants in the Executive Share Option Scheme received part of their entitlement under a scheme that has received approval under the Taxes Act conferring certain tax relief on participants.
The Treasury limit for outstanding options under the approved scheme is currently 30,000 for each participant, with the balance of the participants entitlement being held under an unapproved scheme.
All executive options that have been granted are subject to performance conditions based on both total shareholder return TSR and growth in Earnings Per Share EPS.
TSR is calculated by reference to the increase in the Companys share price plus dividends paid.
EPS is Basic Earnings Per Share as disclosed in the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account.
At the time when the individual wishes to exercise the option which can only normally occur after three years have elapsed since grant, the growth in the Companys TSR is compared to that of the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding investment trusts over a specified period.
If the Companys TSR matches or exceeds that index, and the Companys EPS growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 3 per cent per annum, over three consecutive years, the option is capable of exercise.
Retesting of performance conditions is limited to six monthly intervals between 3 and 5 years after the date of grant.
If further grants are made under the existing schemes it is the Committees intention that performance testing will only occur once, immediately after the three-year period following the date of grant.
Mr F A B Shepherd was eligible for an award under the Phantom Option Scheme on 25 September 2002.
This award was approved by the Committee in order to continue to incentivise Mr Shepherd at a time when he was no longer eligible to participate in Aggrekos Approved and Non-Approved Executive Share Option Schemes.
The intention was that, where possible, the terms and conditions described under Share Option Schemes should also apply to Mr Shepherds award under the Phantom Option Scheme.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 47 Remuneration Report continued Retention of shares by Executive Directors The Committee has adopted a policy that encourages Executive Directors to use the Long Term Incentive Plans and Executive Share Option Schemes to acquire and retain a material number of shares in the Company with the objective of further aligning their long-term interests with those of other shareholders.
Under this policy, on vesting of share grants, an Executive Directors of less than 55 years of age should hold at least 50% of the net proceeds in shares until their aggregate holding was equivalent to at least 50% of their salary.
Other Benefits Other benefits, including pensions, are based on current market practice and take into account long-term trends in provision.
Further details on pension provision are set out on pages 51 and 52.
Service Contracts and Notice Periods All of the Executive Directors have service agreements that require one years notice from the individual and one years notice from the Company.
Mr F A B Shepherd has a service contract that expires at a normal retirement age of 65 while other directors have a normal retirement age of 60.
On early termination, Executive Directors are entitled to Basic Salary and benefits for the notice period at the rate current at the date of termination.
External Appointments The Company has allowed Mr R C Soames to continue to serve as a Non-executive Director of Baggeridge Brick PLC.
He is also permitted to retain his earnings from that position and these earnings amounted to 24,468 for the year ended 31 December 2004 2003 10,000 six months.
Remuneration of Chairman and Non-executive Directors The Board, within the limits set out in the Articles of Association, determines the remuneration policy and level of fees for the Non-executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee recommends remuneration policy and level of fees for the Chairman to the Board.
Remuneration comprises an annual fee for acting as a Chairman or Non-executive Director of the Company.
Additional fees are paid to Non-executive Directors in respect of service as Chairman of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and as Senior Independent Director.
When setting these fees, reference is made to information provided by a number of remuneration surveys, the extent of the duties performed and the size of the Company.
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors are not eligible for bonuses, retirement benefits or to participate in any share scheme operated by the Company.

48 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 Review of past performance The following chart looks at the value at 31 December 2004 of 100 invested in the Company on 31 December 1999 compared with the value of 100 invested in the FTSE Mid 250 over the same period.
The other points plotted are the values at the intervening financial year-ends.
The FTSE Mid 250 was selected as a comparator as this index is used as one of the performance measures for the Executive Share Option Schemes.
A general index is considered more appropriate than sector and peer group comparators given the unique nature of the Companys business.

Other pay represents the amount paid to Directors in order to fund pension benefits beyond the Inland Revenue earnings cap.
Mr R C Soames was the highest paid director.
His entitlements under the Pension plan and details of his potential receipt of shares under the Executive Share Option Schemes and Long-Term Incentive Arrangements are disclosed separately.
With respect to 2004, performance targets were set for the bonus scheme at the start of the year and at that time the Company described 2004 to investors as a year of transition with the expectation of an underlying trading performance broadly similar to 2003.
In the event, strong trading results, particularly in North America, led to better than expected results.
Aggrekos diluted Earnings per Share rose by 6.7% from 10.14 pence to 10.82 pence, exceeding market expectations and the stretch performance targets set at the start of the year for the bonus plan.
This has resulted in both the Chief Executive and the Finance Director earning maximum bonus levels of 75% and 50% of salary respectively.
For the regional Executive Directors, 25% of their bonus was linked to profits generated by their region.
The varying performance of the regions is reflected in the total bonus earned by each of the Directors as described in the above table of emoluments.
Details of changes in basic salary and fees are set out in the table below.
All Directors salaries and fees are reviewed annually as at 1 July.
