Directors remuneration report Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the new Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
The report is divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing policy on remuneration for Executive Directors and senior management and determining specic remuneration packages.
Brian Collie is Chairman of the Committee and Agns Touraine and Sven Boinet are Committee members: they are all independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee members have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no potential conicts of interests arising from cross directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Group HR Director and Group Company Secretary also attend Remuneration Committee meetings and other Executive Directors attend when required except that no Executive Director takes part in discussions relating to their own remuneration and benets.
The Remuneration Committee received wholly independent advice on executive compensation and incentives only from Halliwell Consulting during the year.
The Remuneration Committee is formally constituted with written Terms of Reference.
A copy of the Terms of Reference is available to shareholders by writing to the Group Company Secretary at the registered ofce, details of which are set out on the inside back cover of the Annual Report.
The Remuneration Committee formally met twice during the year.
The Board have reviewed the Groups compliance with the Code on remuneration related matters.
It is the opinion of the Board that the Group complied with all remuneration related aspects of the Code during the year.
Remuneration policy overview Following a full review of Executive Director and senior management remuneration completed in December 2003, shareholders approved a new remuneration policy at the 2004 AGM.
The Remuneration Committees new policy as operated in 2004, and expected to be operated in the foreseeable future, is to set the main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors at the following quartiles in comparison to the Companys Comparator Group: Base salary Annual bonus potential Pension Benets in kind Share incentives Lower Quartile Medium to Upper Quartile Market Practice Market Practice Upper Quartile The Remuneration Committee will continue to review the policy on an annual basis to ensure that it is in line with the Companys objectives and shareholders interests.
The objective of the remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages that will motivate and retain talented people in the business and enable the Company to be competitive when recruiting appropriately skilled and experienced newcomers.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the policy will retain and develop further the Groups entrepreneurial culture whilst also focusing the majority of executive remuneration on performance, which the Committee believes will best serve shareholders interests.
It is therefore the aim of the Remuneration Committee to encourage and reward superior performance by Executives.
It should be noted that the real value received by the Executive Directors under the share incentive arrangements will be dependent upon the degree to which the associated performance conditions have been satisfied at the end of the three year performance period and the share price of the Company at that time.
Comparator Group The Companys Comparator Group for 2004 for the purposes of benchmarking remuneration and comparative performance was: Amazon Luminar Arena Manchester United Burberry Merchant Retail Carphone Warehouse Monsoon Easyjet MyTravel Ebay N Brown Ebookers New Look First Choice Next Game Group Punch Taverns HMV Restaurant Group formerly City Centre Restaurants Holidaybreak Sportech InteractiveCorp Ted Baker LA Fitness Wembley The basis of the selection of this Comparator Group was: retail companies with a comparable market capitalisation to that of Company: retail companies with a significant online presence: leisure and travel companies with which the Company competes for similar customers spend: and US based companies competing in a similar market or fashion to lastminute.
On an ongoing basis the Remuneration Committee, with input from the Executive Directors, will continue to review the Comparator Group to ensure that it is appropriate given the current stage of the Companys development and market factors generally.

com plc annual report 2004 annual report 2004 15 15 Directors remuneration report continued Fixed and variable remuneration The charts below demonstrate the balance between xed and variable performance based pay for the year ended 30 September 2004 for each of the current Executive Directors: Key Fixed remuneration is calculated as: salary, pension, benets.
Performance remuneration is calculated as: bonus available, face value of LTIP on grant, fair value of options on grant.
The main elements of these packages and the performance conditions are described below.
With the exception of David Howell, who has been a non-executive of The Berkeley Group plc and Nestor Healthcare Group plc during the year, the Executive Directors do not have any external appointments as directors of other companies.
The Remuneration Committee has permitted David Howell to retain his earnings from his external appointments, which amounted to 30,000 during the year.
Elements of Executive Directors remuneration Basic salary The Remuneration Committee reviewed the Executive Directors salaries in 2003 and decided to adjust salary levels to around the lower quartile twenty fifth percentile position of the Comparator Group but phased over the course of the year.
It was the view of the Remuneration Committee that a significant increase in salary 33% was required for the CEO in order to move his salary level to a comparative position within the Executive Director team.
The table below shows the overall salary increases implemented over the year.
Details of actual amounts paid are set out in the audited section of the report.
Percentage Lower quartile of Name Salary 2003 Current salary increase Comparator Group Brent Hoberman CEO 150,000 200,000 33% 234,000 David Howell CFO 140,000 160,000 14% 154,500 Ian McCaig COO 135,000 148,000 9.5% 190,750 The Committee believes that this approach is appropriate given the need to both reward and motivate Executive Directors to lead the Company through the next stage of its development, but also ensures that the xed cost of the Executive Director team to shareholders is minimised.
When determining the salary of the Executive Directors the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration: the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills, in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity, in particular the lower quartile salary levels of those companies within the Comparator Group: the performance of the individual Executive Director: the individual Executive Directors experience and responsibilities: and pay and conditions throughout the Company.
com plc Annual Share Bonus Plan the ASB approved at the 2004 AGM The policy is to set the maximum annual bonus potential between the median and the upper quartile in relation to the Comparator Group.
The following table shows the split between the maximum immediate cash bonus, bonus share and deferred bonus share potential for participants in the ASB: Deferred Bonus Shares based on Maximum annual pre-tax value Position bonus potential Cash element Bonus shares of bonus shares Executive Director 100% 50% 25% 25% Deferred Bonus Shares will only be released if the executive is still employed by the Company at the end of the three year deferral period from the Award Date.
If the executive disposes of any of the Bonus Shares during the three year deferral period a corresponding proportion of Deferred Bonus Shares will be forfeited.
The maximum bonus potential available for the Executive Directors for the financial year 2003 4 was 100% of salary with performance targets being based on EPS 25%, EBITDA 50% and individual targets 25%.
The financial targets were not met and therefore no bonuses have been paid to Executive Directors under the ASB during the year.
The same bonus parameters and performance measures will be operated for the financial year 2004 5.
Bonus targets are reviewed and agreed by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of each financial year.
Bonus payments are not pensionable.

Both these Plans have been operated by the Company during 2004.
New policy The Remuneration Committee aims to provide annual rather than one-off share grants to Executive Directors at the upper quartile level compared to the Comparator Group.

com plc annual report 2004 annual report 2004 17 17 Directors remuneration report continued Performance condition selection & measurement Options The Remuneration Committee felt that EPS growth as a key performance measure for the Company was an appropriate performance condition for the vesting of options.
The Remuneration Committee took the following factors into account when deciding the appropriate EPS performance measure for grants of options during 2004: the median and upper quartile historic levels of year on year growth in EPS for the Comparator Group companies: and the projected EPS growth for the Company provided by external analysts.
Given the Companys transition to profitability and the corresponding low EPS base point, in addition to challenging EPS growth targets, the Remuneration Committee has decided that option vesting will also be subject to a Total Shareholder Return TSR underpin.
As such option vesting will only occur if the Companys TSR performance is at least at the median position within the Comparator Group.
LTIPs Comparative TSR was selected as the performance condition for LTIP awards by the Remuneration Committee as it ensures that Executive Directors have outperformed their peers in the Comparator Group over the measurement period in delivering shareholder value before being entitled to receive any of their awards irrespective of general market conditions.
General The Remuneration Committee will satisfy itself that the recorded TSR is a genuine reection of the underlying financial performance of the Company.
Measurement The Remuneration Committee determines whether the performance conditions for share awards or options are satisfied.
Where performance requirements are based on EPS the Committee will use the principles behind the audited gures disclosed in the Companys financial statements, and may take advice from independent advisors as to whether any adjustments are required to ensure consistency in accordance with the terms of the performance conditions.
Where the performance measure is TSR, Halliwell Consulting, the Remuneration Committees advisors, will calculate the TSR in accordance with agreed principles.
Dilution The current operation of the Companys share plans is within the ABI limits on both an annual and rolling basis for all share plans and discretionary share plans.
Shareholding requirement Senior management, Executive Directors and members of the Operating Board who have been selected to participate in the ASB, Option Schemes and LTIP will be required to retain a proportion of the share awards released or options exercised each year to build up the shareholding requirement over a five-year period.
The following table shows the minimum shareholding requirement as a percentage of salary which participants will be required to build up over a fiveyear period from March 2004: Position % of salary at end of five year period Brent Hoberman CEO 250% David Howell CFO 200% Ian McCaig COO 200% When considering whether the participant has met the minimum shareholding requirement the Remuneration Committee will take into account all shares held by the Executive Director.
Participants will only be required to meet the minimum shareholding requirement from shares provided through the Company share arrangements.
Pension In line with the standard employee package, the Company provides each Executive Director with a salary supplement of 14% of basic salary, which may be taken by way of a contribution to their individual pension arrangements.
Benets in kind Benets comprise life assurance, permanent health and private medical insurance.
Other remuneration matters SAYE Scheme The Company operates an Inland Revenue approved savings related share option scheme for the benefit of Group employees.
Eligible employees, including Executive Directors and Operating Board members, may be granted options over the Companys shares at a discount of up to 20% to the prevailing market price at the time of grant of the option, which subject to certain conditions can be exercised after either three or five years.
Approximately 12% of eligible Group employees currently participate in the Scheme.
