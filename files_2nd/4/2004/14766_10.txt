S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2004 D IRECTORS R EMUNERATION R EPORT Policy on directors remuneration This report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee of St Ives plc the committee and approved by the board.
Information relating to remuneration of the directors on pages 21 and 22, directors pension entitlements on pages 22 and 23 and directors share options on pages 23 and 24 has been audited.
The board is responsible for setting the Companys policy on directors remuneration in respect of the 2003 2004 financial year and future years and the role of the committee, inter alia, is to apply the Companys policy and decide on the remuneration of each executive director.
No director is involved in determining his or her own remuneration.
The primary objectives of the Companys policy on executive directors remuneration are rstly, that it should be structured so as to attract and retain executives of a high calibre with the skills and experience necessary to develop the Company successfully and, secondly, to reward them in a way which encourages the creation of value for the shareholders.
The setting of appropriate targets for executive directors, which have to be achieved for them to earn a performance-related bonus, and the determination of their overall remuneration package is undertaken annually by the committee.
Targets may be adjusted, where appropriate, to take account of any change in the issued share capital of the Company.
It is the Companys policy that a bonus shall not exceed 75 per cent of the executives basic pay for the year in question and shall not qualify for pension benets.
The committee periodically considers available remuneration and benets data relevant to UK public companies and others in the same business sector as the Company.
The Companys policy on setting non-executive directors remuneration is to offer a directors fee sufficient to attract and retain individuals of appropriate calibre such that they are able to apply an independent view based on their experience and skills.
Non-executive directors are not entitled to participate in the Groups share option schemes, nor in any long term incentive plan.
It is the Companys policy that executive directors should serve under rolling service contracts of twelve months duration or less and that there should be no special provisions for compensation in the event of termination.
Payment in lieu of any unworked notice on termination of service shall therefore be a matter of negotiation between the parties.
The Companys policy on non-executive directors letters of appointment are that they shall be for an initial three-year term, thereafter subject to notice at any time and retirement by rotation at Annual General Meetings of shareholders.
Executive directors may accept appointments outside the Company provided that the permission of the board has been obtained.
Fees from all such appointments shall be accounted for to the Company.
Details of the executive directors service contracts and non-executive directors letters of appointment are shown on page 21.
During the year the committee drew on advice and assistance from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, the Chairman of the Company and the Company Secretary, in connection with the grants of awards to the executive directors and certain other members of senior management under the St Ives plc Executive Share Option Scheme 2001 Scheme and the St Ives plc Equity Partnership Plan EPP.
The executive directors remuneration consists of five components: basic salary: performance-related bonus: benets in kind and pensions arrangements: share options: and participation in the EPP.
Basic salary Each director is paid an annual basic salary, which is reviewed annually by the committee to ensure that it suitably reects the executives experience, responsibility and market value.
Performance-related bonus The committee annually sets objectives relative to the performance of the Group, operating unit or individual as appropriate, as an incentive to the executive directors to achieve relevant and demanding targets for the forthcoming financial year.
For 2004 2005 the committee has set an incentive for the executive directors to achieve a targeted profit before taxation, goodwill amortisation and exceptional items.
In addition the 18 S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2004 committee has previously set a further bonus element which may be payable in October 2005 in the event that, in any financial year ending on or before August 2005, the Groups profit before exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and taxation exceeds a specic target.
The bonuses which may be earned by Wayne Angstrom and Patrick Martell are also partly dependent on the US division and the Book division, respectively, meeting or exceeding their profit before interest targets for 2004 2005.
In appropriate circumstances the committee may award a discretionary performance-related bonus to a director.
Bonus payments made to executive directors in respect of 2003 2004 varied between 16.8 per cent and 64.4 per cent of annual basic salary.
Benets in kind and pension arrangements Executive directors receive benets in kind, which may include the provision of a car, fuel and medical insurance, or the cash equivalent.
Brian Edwards, Patrick Martell and Raymond Morley each participate in the Groups dened benets pension scheme, which has a normal retirement age of 65.
Wayne Angstrom participates in a Section 401 k Plan set up in the USA for the benefit of employees of St Ives Inc.
Miles Emley joined the Company after the imposition of the Inland Revenue earnings cap introduced by the Finance Act 1989.
In his case, the Company contributes to a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benets Scheme, a Self Invested Personal Pension and life assurance cover.
These arrangements are made for the purpose of providing pension and death in service benets for Miles Emley and his dependants, as nearly as is practicable, comparable to those of his colleagues who are contributory members of the Groups dened benets pension scheme.
There are no unfunded pension promises or similar arrangements for directors.
Share options Executive directors and certain members of senior management have been granted share options under the Groups discretionary share option schemes.
These share options were not granted at a discount and, therefore, over time will reward management when shareholders are rewarded, but not otherwise, as is proper.
As a result of the adoption of the 2001 Scheme no options have been granted under any of its predecessor schemes since 28 October 1999.
The Companys policy is to grant options to executive directors at the discretion of the committee up to an annual maximum of 150 per cent of basic salary 400 per cent in exceptional circumstances.
It is also the Companys policy normally to phase the granting of share options, rather than to award them in a single large block to any individual.
The committee decides on an appropriate performance condition which has to be satisfied before options can normally be exercised.
Details of options granted to directors under the Groups discretionary share option schemes are given in the table of directors share options on pages 23 and 24 and the committees view on what it has decided to be an appropriate performance measurement is set out below.
Options granted in October 2002 and October 2003 under the 2001 Scheme can only be exercised if, after a period of between three and five years commencing from the year ended 2 August 2002 and 1 August 2003 respectively the base year, the following are satisfied: 25 per cent of any option may be exercised in the event that the Companys Earnings Per Share before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation EPS growth has exceeded the UKs Retail Prices Index RPI, plus at least 3 per cent per annum compound since the base year: RPI plus at least 4 per cent over the same period must be achieved to exercise the next 25 per cent of the grant: RPI plus at least 5 per cent for the third 25 per cent and RPI plus 6 per cent for the final 25 per cent of the grant to be exercisable.
To the extent that the foregoing performance condition is not satisfied by the fifth anniversary of grant, the options lapse.
Options granted to the executive directors and outstanding under the discontinued 1995 and 1992 Schemes cannot be exercised unless a performance condition is satisfied, which is an increase in EPS on average of not less than 2 per cent per annum above RPI over a period of at least three years.
Outstanding options granted under the 1985 Scheme, which will have expired by 1 November 2004, are exercisable without restriction.
19 S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2004 D IRECTORS R EMUNERATION R EPORT continued Policy on directors remuneration continued Options can only be exercised between the third and seventh anniversary of grant in the case of the 1995 Scheme and between the third and tenth anniversary of grant in the case of the Groups other discretionary schemes.
Executive directors may participate in the Companys Savings-Related Share Option Schemes Sharesave schemes.
Long term incentive plan Executive directors and certain members of senior management participate in the EPP.
Under the terms of the invitations made in October 2002 and October 2003 the participants, having purchased St Ives plc shares on the open market and deposited them with an Employees benefit Trust, potentially qualify for an award of free matching shares, in the ratio of between 0.5:1 if three years EPS growth from the base year is RPI plus 1 per cent per annum, compound and 3:1 if EPS growth from the base year is RPI plus 8 per cent per annum, compound.
The level of match will be determined on a straight-line basis if the Companys EPS growth over the three-year period falls between the two points.
There will be no re-testing of performance following the end of the three-year period.
Performance conditions share option scheme and EPP On page 25 of this Report, a graph is included illustrating the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR over the past five years, compared with that of the FTSE 350.
Shareholders will, however, note that this performance measurement has not been adopted by the committee for determining the extent to which options may be exercised or matching share awards taken up under the Groups discretionary share option schemes and the EPP.
The committee considers that, so far as the shareholders are concerned, the directors primary objective should be the delivery of sustained, long-term real growth in earnings per share: and that it is appropriate therefore that this is the measure which should be applied to the exercise of options and award of matching shares.
The committee continues to favour real EPS growth rather than TSR for the following reasons: a TSR is an unreliable measure because it is highly dependent on the Companys share price performance and is outside the control of the participants: b the interests of shareholders, who look for sustained financial performance and strong cash ow, may not be best served if the directors actively seek ways of affecting the share price: and c the committee does not favour a criterion whether EPSor TSR-based that is dependent on performance relative to a group of comparators because i there are no Listed companies of comparable size trading in the Companys markets and ii while it would in theory be possible to treat the FTSE 350 as a single comparator group, the committee believes that to do so would dilute the incentive inherent in the Companys real EPS increase if it were referenced to the performance of a remote group of non-competing companies with no direct relevance to the Companys business.
The board seeks to deliver long term sustainable growth in earnings, employing consistently applied and appropriately prudent accounting policies.
In view of current best practice and the latest ABI Guidelines, the committee has decided that a single test will be applied on the third anniversary of the date of grant in respect of any future grants of share options made under the 2001 Scheme.

The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Professional Guidance Note GN11.
The transfer values disclosed above do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual director.
Instead they represent a potential liability of the dened benets pension scheme.
The increase in the accrued pension during the year shown above excludes any increase arising from the statutory revaluation in deferment up to normal retirement age.
The inclusion of the statutory revaluation in deferment up to normal retirement age would have the effect of increasing the accrued pension during the year to 10,759 per annum for Brian Edwards, 14,319 per annum for Patrick Martell and 6,997 per annum for Raymond Morley.
