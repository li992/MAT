Directors responsibilities The responsibilities of the Directors are set out on page 41.
Internal control The Directors have overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining the Groups systems of internal control and risk management and for reviewing their effectiveness.
These systems are designed to manage, and where possible eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
An ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group has been established, in accordance with the guidance of the Turnbull Committee on internal control issued in September 1999.
This process has been in place for the whole of the year ended 30 June 2004 and up to the date on which the financial statements were approved.
The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, considers the effectiveness of the operation of the Groups systems of internal control and risk management during the year and this review has been carried out for the year ended 30 June 2004 and up to the date on which the financial statements were approved.
This review relates to the Company and its subsidiaries and does not extend to joint ventures.
The Audit Committee meets on at least a quarterly basis with the Groups internal audit team and the external auditors.
There is a comprehensive budgeting process, and the annual budget, which is regularly reviewed and updated, is approved by the Board.
Risk assessment and evaluation take place as an integral part of this process.
Performance is monitored against budget through weekly and monthly reporting cycles.
Monthly reports on performance are provided to the Board and the Group reports to shareholders each quarter.
Each area of the Group carries out risk assessments of its operations and ensures that the key risks are addressed.
A Risk Management Committee, chaired by the CFO and comprising senior executives, reviews the management of risks in all areas of the Group on a cyclical basis.
The results of the Risk Management Committees review are integral to the budgeting and forecasting process and are integrated into the internal audit planning.
The internal audit team provides objective assurance as to the effectiveness of the Groups systems of internal control and risk management to the Groups operating management and to the Audit Committee.
During the year, KPMG reviewed the effectiveness of the Groups Audit and Risk Management Department.
