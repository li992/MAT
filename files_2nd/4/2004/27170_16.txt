Directors Remuneration Report The Board has prepared this report, in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.
An ordinary resolution for the approval of this report will be put to the members at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The law requires the Companys Auditors to audit certain of the disclosures provided.
Where disclosures have been audited, they are indicated as such.
The Auditors opinion is included in their report on page 41.
Remuneration Committee The Company had five non-executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee, chaired by Lady Balfour of Burleigh, comprises the nonexecutive Directors, excluding the Chairman of the Company as detailed on page 37.
Policy on Directors Remuneration The Boards policy is that the remuneration of the Directors, all of whom are non-executive Directors, should reflect the experience of the Board as a whole, be fair and comparable to that of other investment trusts in the same AITC Sectors of Global Growth and Income and Global Growth, which also have a similar capital structure, and investment objectives.
It is intended that this policy will continue for the year ended 31 December 2005 and subsequent years.
Neither the Board nor the Remuneration Committee has been provided with advice or services by any person in respect of its consideration of the Directors remuneration although they expect, from time to time, to review the fees paid to the boards of directors of other investment trust companies.
The Companys policy is for the Directors to be remunerated in the form of fees, payable quarterly in arrears, to the Director personally or to a third party specified by him her.
The fees for the non-executive Directors are determined within the limits set out in the Companys Articles of Association, which limit the aggregate of the fees payable to the Directors to 100,000 per annum.
The Companys policy is that fees payable to the Directors should reflect the time spent by them on the Companys affairs and should be sufficient to enable candidates of a high quality to be recruited.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share options, longterm incentive schemes or other benefits.
During the year ended 31 December 2004 the Remuneration Committee carried out a review of the level of Directors fees and concluded that they were out of line with the fees of the Companys peer group bearing in mind the increased time commitment of 6 board meetings and a separate strategy meeting each year.
Therefore, it was decided that the fees should be increased from their present level of 21,000 for the Chairman and 14,000 for each Director to 25,000 for the Chairman, 16,000 for each Director and a further 1,000 for the Chairman of the Audit Committee, with effect from 1 July 2004.
Directors and officers liability insurance cover is held by the Company in respect of the Directors.
This insurance is neither a benefit in kind nor does it form part of the Directors Remuneration.
Directors service contracts None of the Directors has a contract of service or contract for services and a Director may resign by notice in writing to the Board at any time: there are no set notice periods.
All Directors are appointed for an initial period of three years: this period may be varied by mutual consent.
The Articles of Association provide that, at the Annual General Meeting each year, one third of the Directors for the time being or if their number is not a multiple of three, the number nearest to one third shall be subject to retirement by rotation.
Directors, therefore, shall retire and be subject to re-election at the first Annual General Meeting following their appointment and thereafter shall be obliged to retire by rotation, and offer themselves for re-election, at least every three years.
Any Director who attains the age of 70 is subject to annual re-election.
No compensation is payable for loss of office.
Company performance The graph opposite compares the total return assuming all dividends are reinvested to Ordinary Shareholders, assuming the notional investment of 100 into the Company on 31 December 1999, compared with the total Shareholder return on a notional investment made up of shares of the same kinds and number as those by reference to which the FTSE World-UK Index and FTSE World Index ex-UK are calculated.
These indices were chosen for comparison purposes, as they are components of the Companys benchmark 40% FTSE World-UK and 60% FTSE World ex-UK and are the benchmarks used for investment performance measurement purposes by most of Murray Internationals Trust peer group.
Please note that past performance is not a guide to future performance.
