Remuneration Committee Report At the EGM held on 24 February 2004 shareholders approved a new remuneration policy for the Companys Executive Directors, the key features of which are as follows: a salary freeze for three years for the Executive Directors 1 May 2003 to 30 April 2006 : a change to the structure and method of payment of bonuses: the introduction of a new Long Term Incentive Plan, The Berkeley Group plc 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan the 2004 LTIP : and the introduction of a new all employee share incentive plan, The Berkeley Group plc 2004 Share Incentive Plan the 2004 SIP.
The percentage of shareholdings voting who supported the new policy and the introduction of the 2004 LTIP were 94% and 92% respectively.
This policy was formulated by the Remuneration Committee in response to concerns raised by shareholders at the 2003 AGM and was only nalised after extensive consultation with the Companys major shareholders and institutional shareholder bodies, such as the ABI, NAPF and PIRC.
The Remuneration Committee believed that the new policy with the emphasis on performance should encourage Executives to focus on delivering the business strategy adopted at that time, thereby enhancing shareholder value as well as providing meaningful incentive to Executives.
This report will be put to a second advisory vote of the Companys shareholders in 2004 at the Annual General Meeting on 27 August 2004.
As announced on 25 June 2004, the Company has concluded a strategic review resulting in a proposed restructuring.
The Board believes it is appropriate in light of this proposed restructuring to review the new remuneration policy, approved by shareholders at the EGM on 24 February 2004, so that it aligns managements incentives with the achievement of the return of capital and maximising the value of the continuing business.
The Remuneration Committee will consult fully with key shareholders on the proposed changes.
This report has been prepared in accordance with The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the regulations.
The auditors are required to report on the auditable part of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the regulations.

Remuneration Policy Overview Following the concerns raised by shareholders at the 2003 AGM, the Remuneration Committee conducted a full review of the remuneration policy.
As part of this process, an extensive shareholder consultation process was carried out in order to ensure that the remuneration policy, as well as meeting the Companys objectives was in line with shareholders expectations.
As a result of this process, a new remuneration policy has been approved by the Companys shareholders.
This report sets out details of Executive remuneration during the year and the ongoing remuneration policy.
The objective of the remuneration policy is to encourage, reward and retain the current Executives.
The Remuneration Committee believes that shareholders interests are best served by remuneration packages having a large emphasis on performance-related pay.
Emphasis on performance should encourage Executives to focus on delivering the business strategy.
It is the opinion of the Remuneration Committee that the new policy will provide meaningful incentives to Executives and ensure that the appropriate balance between xed and performance-related pay is maintained.
The policy agreed by shareholders at the EGM on 24 February 2004 was to set the main elements of the Executive Directors remuneration package against the following quartiles in the Companys comparator group: Base salary Annual bonus potential Pension Benets in kind Share incentives Upper decile Upper decile Lower quartile to median Market practice Upper quartile to upper decile For the purposes of benchmarking remuneration the Remuneration Committee uses the following comparator group of companies: Company name Amec plc Carillion Plc McCarthy & Stone Plc Travis Perkins Plc Balfour Beatty Plc Crest Nicholson Plc Novar Plc Ultraframe plc Barratt Developments Plc George Wimpey Plc Persimmon Plc Westbury Plc Bellway Plc Marshalls Plc Redrow Plc Wilson Bowden Plc Bovis Homes Group Plc McAlpine Alfred Plc Taylor Woodrow Plc 24 www.
co. uk The Remuneration Committee reviews the policy on an annual basis to ensure that it is in line with the Companys objectives and shareholders interests.
In addition, the life of the new LTIP and bonus framework is five years, requiring the Company to revert to shareholders for a formal approval at the end of this period for any future arrangements.
The charts below demonstrate the balance between xed and variable performance based pay for each Executive Director for the year ended 30 April 2004: Mr R St J H Lewis Executive Chairman Mr A W Pidgley Mr R C Perrins Group Managing Director Group Financial Director Fixed Fixed Fixed compensation compensation compensation 57% 18% 23% Performance Performance Performance compensation compensation compensation 43% 82% 77% Mr A Carey Divisional Director Mr G J Fry Divisional Director Key Fixed compensation is calculated as: Fixed Fixed Salary compensation compensation Benets 25% 32% Performance compensation is calculated as: Performance Performance compensation compensation Bonus paid 75% 68% Face value of LTIP on grant Fair value of options on grant The main elements of these packages and the performance conditions are described below.
Elements of Executive Directors Remuneration Basic Salary Policy: Upper Decile Salary Freeze 1 May 2003-30 April 2006 Year Ended 30 April 2004 The Remuneration Committee reviewed the Executive Directors salaries in May 2003 and provided the rises set out in the table below.
The two rises of note are to the Group Managing Director and the Group Finance Director.
The Remuneration Committee used a wide range of benchmarks, FTSE 100, Property Companies, Construction and Building Companies and House Builders when deciding on these rises.
It was the view of the Remuneration Committee at the time that the increase in salary for the Group Managing Director was required to ensure that he retained his comparative position and to draw a line under elements of his remuneration package which had been open for some time.
The Remuneration Committee provided the rise to the Group Finance Director based on their view of his performance and growth in capabilities over the period.
FY2003 Salary Level of salary frozen for Name salaries rises % three-year period Roger Lewis Group Chairman 210,000 5% 220,000 Tony Pidgley Group Managing Director 650,000 15% 750,000 Tony Carey Divisional Director 385,000 5% 405,000 Greg Fry Divisional Director 275,000 5% 290,000 Rob Perrins Group Finance Director 250,000 30% 325,000 The Executives current salaries are set at the upper decile compared to the comparator group.
It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee that they should remain at this level in line with the Committees view that the Company has one of the most experienced Executive teams within the sector.
co. uk Remuneration Committee Report continued Future Policy The Remuneration Committee, with the rises in 2003, feels that it has reached its desired policy for Executive salary levels and is therefore implementing a salary freeze for the Executive team from 1 May 2003 to 30 April 2006 three years.
The next salary review date will be, in the normal course of events, 1 May 2006.
It should be noted that in line with the Companys policy on salary reviews, the reviews on 1 May 2006 will not result in automatic salary increases.
It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee to look to the bonus and share arrangements to reward Executives for their performance rather than to increases in base salary.
The Remuneration Committee will retain the discretion to increase salary levels if Executives are promoted or on the occurrence of any unforeseen event which materially affects the Company and or the market in which it operates.
In the event of such an unforeseen event the Remuneration Committee will consult shareholders before adjusting salary levels.
When determining the salary of the Executive Directors the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration: the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity, in particular those companies within the comparator group: the performance of the individual Executive Director: the individual Executive Directors experience and responsibilities: and the pay and conditions throughout the Company.
Annual Performance Related Bonus Policy: Upper Decile Bonus Potential The policy of the Remuneration Committee is to set the maximum annual bonus potential at the upper decile in relation to the comparator group.
Year Ended 30 April 2004 To date the maximum bonus potential for Executives has been uncapped.
However, the Remuneration Committee has taken into account the concerns of shareholders regarding the uncapped nature of the Executive bonus arrangements and has decided to alter the structure of the bonus to reect these concerns further details of the new structure are set out below.
In anticipation of the future change in policy, the Executives agreed to the introduction of a retrospective cap on bonuses for the current bonus year 1 May 2003 30 April 2004 of 300% of salary.
However, for the year ended 30 April 2004, where the Remuneration Committee did in fact determine a bonus greater than 200% of salary for the Group Managing Director and the Group Finance Director, they decided of their own volition to cap the bonus payment at 200% of salary.
Bonus targets are reviewed and agreed by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of each financial year.
The performance measures for the Executive Directors bonus scheme are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and position of the Company, so that they continue to remain challenging.
The targets for the year ended 30 April 2004, their level of achievement and the corresponding bonus earned for the Executive Directors is set out in the following tables: Name R Lewis T Pidgley T Carey G Fry R Perrins Maximum bonus potential % of salary 300% 300% 300% 300% 300% 2003 4 bonus paid 165,000 1,500,000 498,509 259,735 650,000 2003 4 bonus paid % of salary 75% 200% 123% 90% 200% Upper decile bonus payments in the 200% 200% 175% 175% 200% comparator group as a % of salary The above table shows that the Remuneration Committee set challenging performance conditions for the payment of bonuses for the year ended 30 April 2004, so that while the performance of the Company was strong, this did not result in maximum bonus payments.
The performance targets for the bonus year ended 30 April 2004 were based on Group profit targets for the Group Executive Directors and Divisional profit targets for the Divisional Executive Directors.
Once the targets were achieved a percentage of the over performance was allocated to the Executives by the Remuneration Committee using pre-determined formulae.
The level of the profit targets is commercially sensitive and therefore is not disclosed by the Company.
co. uk The Remuneration Committee felt that profit targets were the appropriate performance measure for bonuses as they were in line of sight of the Executives and their delivery is key to long-term shareholder value.
However, the Remuneration Committee recognises that in the current climate it would be helpful to be able to disclose the detail of the performance targets for bonuses payable to the Executives, which would always be difficult due to the commercially sensitive nature of this information.
Therefore, the Remuneration Committee has decided, in the future, to use ROCE Return on Capital Employed see later for a complete denition as the performance measure for the Group Executive Directors as this measure ensures that Executives are focused on maintaining earnings whilst having the additional benefit of measuring the efficiency with which capital is being used to generate those earnings.
For Divisional Executive Directors, 75% of the bonus potential will still be based on the satisfaction of Divisional profit targets as the Remuneration Committee feel that it is important that the Divisional Executive Directors have a strong focus on the performance of the Divisions which they are running, with the remaining 25% based upon Group ROCE.
Future Policy Further to meetings with major shareholders during the year, the Remuneration Committee has taken into account their concerns regarding the uncapped nature of the Executive bonus arrangements.
Therefore, the Remuneration Committee is imposing a cap of 300% of salary for the bonus year starting on 1 May 2004 30 April 2005 and subsequent bonus years.
In practice, the bonus plan will be designed with the effective cap on a maximum payout of 200% of salary.
The Remuneration Committee would only in very exceptional circumstances, outside the normal operation of the bonus plan, consider a bonus payment greater than 200% of salary.
On the occurrence of very exceptional circumstances and prior to any commitment to make a bonus payment, the Remuneration Committee would consult shareholders to obtain their agreement that the circumstances gave rise to the level of bonus payment proposed.
The structure of bonus payments will be changed as follows: Position % cash % shares Executive Bonus will be paid in cash up to a Any bonus payment above 100% of salary maximum of 100% of salary will be invested, net of tax, in shares Any shares provided under the bonus arrangements must be retained by the Executives for 18 months.
The new bonus arrangements will take effect from 1 May 2004 the start of the new bonus year.
The performance targets for the annual bonus plan for the 2004 Financial Year 1 May 2004 to 30 April 2005 are principally ROCE Return on Capital Employed at Group level and principally ROCE and PBT profit Before Tax at the Divisional level.
The following table shows the weighting for participants between Group and Divisional performance: Position Group performance Divisional performance Chairman 100% of participants bonus potential is based Group Managing Director on the ROCE performance of the Group Finance Director Divisional Executive Directors 25% of participants bonus potential is based 75% of participants bonus potential is based on on the ROCE performance of the Group achieving Divisional PBT targets All Executives A balanced score card will be operated considering other elements of the Companys and individual Executive's business objectives when making final bonus determinations.
Bonuses will always require the respective ROCE and PBT targets to be met in order to trigger payment.
The ROCE target for the 2004 bonus plan year is set out in the following schedule.
Currently the annual ROCE target for the bonus is the same as the three-year average target for the 2004 LTIP.
This will not necessarily be the case in future years because the target for the annual bonus is for a 12-month period whereas the target for the 2004 LTIP is the performance averaged over a 36-month period.
However, the Remuneration Committee will not materially change the nature of the performance conditions or their method of calculation without prior shareholder consultation.
co. uk Remuneration Committee Report continued ROCE for bonus year % of ROCE-based bonus payable 15% 0% 16% 20% 17% 40% 18% 60% 19% 80% 20% 100% There is straight line pay-out between points.
Participants in the annual bonus plan will only be eligible to receive a bonus if they meet the performance targets.
However, the Remuneration Committee will retain the discretion to adjust bonus payments either up or down if in their opinion the results would otherwise be inappropriate.
It should be noted that this discretion will be exercised sparingly to ensure certainty for participants and transparency for shareholders.
If the Remuneration Committee does exercise its discretion to adjust bonus payments it will only do so where there is an objective justication which can be explained to shareholders in the Remuneration Committee report.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee will ensure that any changes to the basis of payment or financial performance targets are independently veried.
On an ongoing basis, the Remuneration Committee will continue to set robust and challenging performance targets at the beginning of each financial year taking into account the business plan for that year and general market conditions.
Bonus payments are not pensionable.
The following formula sets out how the Company calculates ROCE for both the 2004 annual bonus plan and the new 2004 LTIP: Earnings before Interest, Tax and Goodwill ROCE % x 100 {} Average Shareholders Funds Average Net Debt i Average Shareholders Funds is calculated by taking the Opening Balance Sheet Net Assets from the Groups Accounts for the relevant Financial Year and the Closing Balance Sheet Net Assets from the Groups Accounts for the relevant Financial Year and dividing by two.
ii Average Net Debt is calculated by taking the Opening Net Debt from the Groups Accounts for the relevant Financial Year and the Closing Net Debt from the Groups Accounts for the relevant Financial Year and dividing by two, and where the Group is cash positive, such cash is excluded from the calculation.
Share Incentives Policy: Upper Quartile to Upper Decile The Remuneration Committees policy is to provide annual share grants to Executives between the upper quartile and upper decile level compared to the comparator group.
The Remuneration Committee determines whether the performance conditions for share awards or options are satisfied.
Where the performance requirements are based on earnings per share, ROCE or PBT the Committee will use the principles behind the audited gures disclosed in the Companys financial statements, and may take advice from independent advisors as to whether any adjustments are required to ensure consistency in accordance with the terms of the performance conditions.
Where the performance measure is TSR, Halliwell Consulting, the Remuneration Committees advisors, shall calculate the TSR in accordance with the principles behind the regulations and sign-off these gures prior to the release of any award.
Overview Until the EGM on 24 February 2004, the share incentive arrangements in place for executives comprised Long Term Incentive Plans and Executive Share Option Schemes details are as set out below.
It was the Remuneration Committees policy to grant awards to participants under either the Long Term Incentive Plans or the Executive Share Option Schemes and only in exceptional circumstances would grants be made in the same year under both arrangements.
co. uk Following shareholder approval at the EGM, the new 2004 LTIP has been adopted by the Company.
The Remuneration Committees policy is that Executives who participate in the new 2004 LTIP will receive no further award under either the existing Long Term Incentive Plans or the Executive Share Option Schemes.
It should be noted that participants in the 2004 LTIP will not be entitled to the grant of awards under any other discretionary share plan operated by the Company participants will be entitled to participate in any all-employee arrangements operated by the Company.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee intends to introduce a shareholding requirement for Executives in conjunction with the new 2004 LTIP, details of which are set out on pages 30-32 of this report.
Existing Share Incentive Arrangements a The Berkeley Group Long Term Incentive Plan Until the EGM, the principal form of long term incentive eligible to Executive Directors was through the Berkeley Group Long Term Incentive Plan the Existing LTIP.
Under the Existing LTIP, individuals were granted awards annually, the vesting of which were subject to the attainment of pre-determined performance targets measured over a three-year period.
Awards were structured to deliver a pre-determined cash value and a number of shares, each worth at the outset 50% of the value of the total annual award.
The shares element was xed by reference to the market value of the Companys shares at the date of grant.
The maximum value that could be delivered under an award based on the share price at the date of grant is 200% of an individuals annual salary excluding bonuses and all other benets as at the date of grant.
The cash element is payable following the third anniversary of the date of grant of the award provided the performance targets have been met.
The participant is normally only entitled to the share element following the fourth anniversary from the date of grant of the award, by which time the outstanding value of the underlying shares will have increased or decreased in line with the Companys share price performance over the period since the date of grant.
Performance under the Existing LTIP was measured according to the level of audited cumulative pre-tax profits of the division or Group company in which the participant is employed over the relevant period.
Achievement is determined on an all or nothing basis over a period of three years with no opportunity for re-testing.
For awards under the LTIP to vest, the audited net assets of each division or Group Company, after taking account of changes in share capital and dividend distributions, must also have increased by at least a cumulative rate of 10% per annum since the base year.
These performance conditions were selected because it was the Boards view that profit and asset growth will ensure the delivery of enhanced value to the Companys shareholders.
Details of LTIP awards granted during the year are set out at page 36.
The following table sets out the expected value of the LTIP awards on the date of grant made under the Existing LTIP to the Executive Directors during the year ended 30 April 2004: Name T Pidgley T Carey G Fry R Perrins LTIP award % of salary 200% 200% 150% 150% Expected value of LTIP award 1,500,000 810,000 435,000 487,500 Expected value of LTIP awards as a % of salary 200% 200% 150% 150% Upper quartile share grants in the comparator group 240% 215% 215% 165% Based on historical analysis of the achievement of the performance requirements the expected value of the LTIP is 100% of its face value.
b The Berkeley Group plc 2000 Approved & Unapproved Executive Share Option Plans the Option Plans Two executive option plans were introduced in 2000.
Under the option plans individuals were eligible to be granted options annually over shares worth up to 100% of annual salary excluding bonuses and all other benets.
The Remuneration Committee had the discretion to vary this amount in exceptional circumstances, in which case the limit was 200% of annual salary excluding bonuses and all other benets.
Exercise of options granted is conditional upon meeting dened performance targets based on the increase in earnings per ordinary share over a three-year period.
co. uk Remuneration Committee Report continued On 19 April 2004, a grant of options was made to Mr A W Pidgley under the Option Plans, details of which are shown on page 37.
The performance target attaching to this option provides that over a three-year period EPS growth must exceed RPI 4%p.
a. for 50% of the option to vest, with full vesting requiring EPS growth of RPI 8%p.
The rules of the Plan under which this option was granted allows for limited re-testing.
However, the Remuneration Committee has taken into account the wishes of shareholders and this option to the Group Managing Director will not allow re-testing of the performance target.
The expected value of this option on the date of grant is 631,349, 84% of salary using the Black-Scholes Calculation.
It should be noted that during the shareholder consultation exercise carried out by the Company this option and its proposed terms were specically drawn to shareholders attention.
The majority of shareholders by percentage holding confirmed that they would accept the grant of this option.
No other grants of options have been made to Executive Directors under the Option Plans during the year.
Earnings per share was selected as the performance measure as, in combination with options, it ensures that both the Companys share price and its underlying financial value increases before any benefit is provided to Executives.
New Share Incentive Arrangements The Berkeley Group plc 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan the 2004 LTIP The 2004 LTIP was approved by shareholders at the EGM on 24 February 2004.
Prior to the EGM, the Company conducted a full consultation with major shareholders and shareholder bodies which ensured that the terms of the Plan were acceptable to the majority of shareholders by percentage holding and complied with corporate governance best practice.
Executive Directors and certain senior executives are eligible to participate in the Companys 2004 LTIP.
The Plan provides appropriate incentives to reward sustained success through the achievement of challenging business targets, thereby better aligning the interests of shareholders and Executives.
The maximum annual award that can be made to an individual is 300% of salary: although it should be noted that the only Executive Director currently eligible to receive the maximum level of award is the Group Managing Director.
Eligible executives are awarded rights to receive a maximum number of shares at the beginning of a three-year period, a proportion of which they will be entitled to receive at the end of that period depending on the extent to which if at all the challenging performance conditions, set by the Remuneration Committee at the time the allocation is made, are satisfied.
The release of the first grant of awards under the 2004 LTIP will be dependent upon the satisfaction of two performance measures.
The release of 50% of each award will be dependant on the comparative Total Shareholder Return performance of the Company against the comparator group set out earlier in the report over a three-year period and the release of the other 50% of the awards will be dependent on the average ROCE performance of the Company over a three-year period from the date of grant.
The Remuneration Committee has selected a comparative TSR and a ROCE measure to ensure that the Company is not only consistently delivering high levels of returns but that on a comparative basis it is also delivering at least median share price performance against its competitors.
In addition, the use of the ROCE measure ensures an efficient use of shareholders funds to generate profitability at a consistent level over the long term.
When combined with the TSR measure it ensures that this absolute performance successfully ows through to the comparative performance of the Company against its competitors.
It should be noted that the Remuneration Committee will satisfy itself that the recorded TSR is a genuine reection of the underlying financial performance of the Company.
Due to the combined nature of awards made under the proposed share incentive policy, some of the corporate performance measures that the Remuneration Committee will be considering in determining whether the recorded TSR is a genuine reection of the underlying financial performance of the Company are its ROCE, EPS and PBT performance over the measurement period.
No grants were made under the new LTIP during the year.
co. uk The following tables set out the proposed levels of award for the 2004 2005 LTIP grant, the performance conditions and level of release for a given level of performance: Name LTIP award as % of salary Mr A W Pidgley Group Managing Director 300% Mr A Carey Divisional Executive Director 200% Mr G J Fry Divisional Executive Director 150% Mr R C Perrins Group Finance Director 150% Below Board maximum 100% The following table sets out the first proposed release for the 50% of the LTIP award subject to comparative total shareholder return: TSR position against comparator group Long-Term Incentive Plan % of shares released Below median 0% At the median 30% of half the award At the upper quartile 90% of half the award At the upper decile 100% of half the award There is straight line vesting between points.

Dilution In accordance with the ABI guidelines the Company can issue a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital in a rolling ten-year period to employees under all its share schemes.
In addition, of this 10% the Company can only issue 5% to satisfy awards under discretionary or executive schemes.
The Company adheres strictly to these limits.
Shareholding Requirement The following table shows the minimum shareholding requirement as a percentage of salary which Executives will be required to build up over a fiveyear period: Position Current shareholding as % of salary % of salary at end of five-year period Group Executive Chairman Mr R St J H Lewis 1,212% 200% Group Managing Director Mr A W Pidgley 2,609% 400% Divisional Director Mr A Carey 445% 200% Divisional Director Mr G J Fry 338% 200% Group Finance Director Mr R C Perrins 82% 200% Executives will be required to retain a proportion of the share awards released each year to build up the shareholding requirement over a five-year period.
For example, awards granted in 2004, 2005 and 2006 will be released in 2007, 2008 and 2009.
A proportion of each released award shall be retained as shares so that by the end of 2008 Executives should have met the minimum shareholding requirement.
co. uk Remuneration Committee Report continued When considering whether the Executive has met the minimum shareholding requirement the Remuneration Committee will take into account all shares held by the Executive.
Participants will only be required to meet the minimum shareholding requirement from shares provided through the Company share arrangements: if these do not provide shares the Executive will not be expected to purchase shares in the market.
If the Company share arrangements provide the Executive with shares and the appropriate percentage is not retained by the Executive, the Remuneration Committee will reduce the future levels of share incentives granted.
The Remuneration Committee will consider the circumstances surrounding an Executives disposal of shares as part of its determination.
For example, if an Executive was required by a Court order to transfer shares this would be a mitigating factor.
Pension Policy: Lower Quartile to Median The Executive Directors are all members of one or more of the following pensions schemes in operation within the Group, namely The Berkeley Group Staff Benets Plan, The Berkeley Homes Executive Pension Plan and The St George PLC Retirement and Death Benets Scheme.
No element of remuneration other than basic salary is pensionable.
Three Directors have benets accruing to them under a dened contributions scheme and three have benets accruing to them under a dened benets scheme.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in these schemes.
Details of pension costs for Executive Directors are set out in the audited section of the report on page 35.
Benets in Kind Policy: Market Practice In line with market practice, the Companys policy is to provide Executive Directors with the following additional benets: a fully expensed company car: and medical insurance.
Other Remuneration Matters Existing All Employee Share Schemes SAYE Scheme The Company operates an Inland Revenue approved savings related share option scheme for the benefit of Group employees.
Eligible employees, including Executive Directors and senior executives, may be granted options over the Companys shares at a discount of up to 20% to the prevailing market price at the time of grant of the option, which subject to certain conditions can be exercised after either three or five years.
Approximately 23% of eligible Group employees currently participate in the scheme.
New All-Employee Share Schemes The Berkeley Group plc 2004 Share Incentive Plan 2004 SIP Shareholders approved the 2004 SIP at the EGM on 24 February 2004.
Under the Inland Revenue approved rules of the SIP the Company can offer employees the opportunity of purchasing 1,500 of shares a year out of pre-tax salary.
The Company can then match each share purchased with an award of Matching Shares.
The maximum ratio of Matching Shares to employee purchased shares is two to one.
However, the Company is still determining the date of launch and how the SIP will operate.
Non-executive Directors Fees Policy: Upper Decile Fees All Non-executive Directors have specic terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set by the articles of association and based on independent surveys of fees paid to non-executive directors of similar companies.
The 2004 fee levels will be based on a specic survey of the fees paid to non-executive directors in the comparator group by Halliwell Consulting.

co. uk Executive Directors Contracts The policy on termination is that the Company does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations.
The only event on the occurrence of which the Company is potentially liable to make a payment to any of the Executive Directors is on cessation of employment: with the maximum payment being 12 months salary.
No payment is due on either a Company takeover or in the event of liquidation.
In addition, Executive Directors will be expected to mitigate their loss.
The Remuneration Committee is considering introducing phasing the payments of notice on cessation in line with the combined ABI and NAPF guidelines, subject to existing contractual constraints.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee ensures that there have been no unjustified payments for failure.
None of the Executive Directors contracts provides for liquidated damages.
There are no special provisions contained in any of the Executive Directors contracts which provide for longer periods of notice on a change of control of the Company.
Further, there are no special provisions providing for additional compensation on an Executive Directors cessation of employment with the Company.
Non-executive Directors All non-executive appointments are subject to a notice period of one month and subject to successful re-election upon retirement by rotation as required by the Companys articles of association.

The transfer values of the Directors accrued benets under the Dened benefit Plan, as set out above, are calculated in accordance with the Retirement Benets Scheme Transfer Values GN11 published by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries.
The transfer values disclosed above represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the liability in respect of qualifying services.
As such they represent a potential liability of the pension scheme.
These transfer values do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual Director and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
Members of the fund have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions: neither these contributions nor the resulting benets are included in the transfer values in the table above.
In addition to the above, the Company made the following contributions to dened contribution plans: Dened Contribution Plan Company Company contributions contributions 2004 2003 Age A W Pidgley 56 37,500 32,500 A Carey 56 60,750 57,750 G J Fry 47 43,500 41,250 141,750 131,500 35 www.

Accordingly, participants will receive the cash element of these awards on 7 August 2004 and the share element 12 months later, assuming they remain in the employment of the Group.
The relevant performance measures are set out on page 29.
These are the achievement of pre-determined cumulative pre-tax profits over a three year period and cumulative net asset growth of at least 10% over the period, taking account of changes in share capital and dividend distributions.
For Messrs Pidgley and Perrins these targets are measured on the Group results and for Messrs Carey and Fry on the relevant divisional results.

2 On 30 April 2003, Mr Pidgley was granted 205,481 options.
The vesting of these options will be based on share price growth rather than the EPS based conditions mentioned above.
The options will vest in full only if the Companys share price increases by at least 50% within a three to five-year period based on the three-month average share price set on the date of grant.
The number of shares vesting will be calculated on a sliding scale for share price growth between 20% and 50%.
At 20% growth, 10% of the options vest.
These options will lapse if the performance conditions have not been met within five years of grant.
3 Under the 1996 Scheme, the shares under option are released subject to the Companys average yearly EPS growth being at least as much as the increase in RPI 3% in each year over three consecutive years.
