Ms J Cowley joined the company as human resources director on 24th August 2004 and, as part of her responsibilities, she attends meetings of the Committee to provide views and advice on remuneration matters.
The Committee authorised the appointment of two independent external consultants, Watson Wyatt and Towers Perrin.
Watson Wyatt provided advice on the discretionary share option schemes and the Deferred Share Award Plan, including the measurement of the companys total shareholder return.
Towers Perrin provided external market data on levels of senior executive remuneration.
At the request of the Committee, Deloitte & Touche LLP provided advice in relation to the terms of appointment and remuneration package of the new chief executive.
REMUNERATION POLICY The companys current remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages that enable the company to attract and retain the best people, reward individual and company performance and align executives interests with those of shareholders.
During 2005, the company will be undertaking a review of the effectiveness and competitiveness of the total remuneration packages of executive directors and senior executives including the companys share option schemes.
COMPONENTS OF Each executive directors total remuneration consists of base salary, annual bonus, share options, pension and other benefits.
REMUNERATION It is the companys policy that the total remuneration of each executive director should comprise a balance between fixed remuneration and variable performance-related remuneration.
The variable performance-related remuneration comprises remuneration elements linked to both short term financial performance and longer term shareholder value creation.
The policy is that a significant proportion currently between 24.0% and 53.3% of the total package should be variable performance-related remuneration.
30 COMPONENTS OF The relative importance of these elements for 2004 is summarised below: REMUNERATION continued BASE SALARY 1 2 AND BENEFITS PERFORMANCE BONUS SHARE OPTIONS TOTAL R C Payne 79.9% nil 20.1% 100% E F Brown 82.7% nil 17.3% 100% Notes: 1.
Includes entitlements under the Bonus and Deferred Share Award Plan and the Senior Executive Bonus Scheme.
The value of share options have been calculated using Black-Scholes.
Summaries of the executive directors contracts are set out on pages 34 and 35.
Base Salaries Executive directors base salaries are reviewed annually with effect from 1st January.
External market data for companies of comparable size, company performance, individual performance and changes in position or responsibilities are taken into consideration when setting base salary levels each year.
Bonuses At the start of each financial year, the Committee sets the performance measures that must be met if a bonus is to be paid under the Senior Executive Bonus Scheme or under the Bonus and Deferred Share Award Plan.
The performance measures are designed to focus senior management on the business priorities for the coming financial year and align executives interests with those of shareholders.
With regard to the Senior Executive Bonus Scheme 2004, approximately 500 senior executives including the sector managing directors, other than the chief executive and the finance director, were eligible to participate in the scheme.
The performance measures were profit and for those executives based in the businesses, profit and turnover.
A threshold performance level must have been achieved below which no bonus is paid.
For the sector managing directors including Mr E F Brown, the bonus entitlement under this scheme was subject to a maximum of 50% of basic salary.
With regard to the Bonus and Deferred Share Award Plan 2004, the performance measure was the growth in the companys earnings per share eps over the eps for the previous year in excess of the rate of inflation.
For every 1% increase and pro rata for lesser percentages in the companys eps over the eps for the previous year over 2% in excess of the rate of inflation Mr R C Payne would receive 6.65% of base salary maximum 53.3% and the sector managing directors including Mr E F Brown would receive 3% of base salary maximum 24.0%.
Bonuses are awarded on or about 1st March following the end of the financial year to which they relate.
In accordance with the companys Bonus and Deferred Share Award Plan, 50% of the annual bonus as calculated above is paid in cash with the remaining 50% being paid in the form of company shares.
The number of shares awarded is calculated by reference to the two prices shown in the quotations for the companys shares immediately preceding the date of the award plus one quarter of the difference between these two prices.
These shares are held in trust on a conditional basis for a period of one year from the date of award.
The directors interests in shares awarded under the Deferred Share Award Plan in respect of 2002 and 2003 are summarised in the Pay and Benefits section of this report starting on page 36.
No bonuses were made to executive directors under either the Bonus and Deferred Share Award Plan 2004 or the Senior Executive Bonus Scheme 2004.
For 2005, the Bonus and Deferred Share Award Plan will not be operated and the company will operate a cash bonus scheme for the executive directors and other members of the CEB.
The Committee is currently reviewing the bonus and other incentive arrangements but it envisages that the performance measures under the scheme will include corporate and, where applicable, business unit financial measures and other performance measures.
The financial measures will be profit, and for the sector managing directors will be profit and contract portfolio net gain.
Under the scheme, a cash bonus of 40% of base salary will be paid for on-target financial performance with the opportunity to earn up to 80% of base salary for exceptional performance.
Details of the remuneration arrangements for Mr Flynn are set out on page 35.
31 Remuneration Report continued COMPONENTS OF The Committee has awarded the finance director, Mr R C Payne, a special bonus of 100,000 in recognition of his exceptional REMUNERATION efforts and commitment following Mr Wilde stepping down as chief executive in July 2004 until Mr D Flynn joined the company continued as chief executive in April 2005.
Share options Each year, a grant of options to purchase shares in the future is made to executive directors and other senior executives.
The option price is the mid-market closing price immediately preceding the date of grant.
The company has share option schemes for approximately 500 senior executives worldwide.
Grants of share options up to and including 1999 were based upon individual performance and conditional on the achievement of a 15% increase in basic earnings per share in the financial year preceding the date of grant, which was duly achieved.
Share options granted in the period 1996 to 1999 inclusive were subject to an exercise condition under which the companys earnings per share needed to be at least 2% 3% in 1999 in excess of the UK rate of inflation over a period of three years, which was duly achieved.
From 2000 onwards, grants of share options were made under the Discretionary Approved and Discretionary schemes Discretionary Schemes and the levels of grant were based on base salary and company grade.
The Committee believes that the performance measures set out below best satisfy the alignment of shareholders interests with those of executive directors in particular and executives in general by ensuring that benefits under the schemes are only realisable if there has been a material real growth in earnings per share.
Under the Discretionary Schemes there are two levels of option award: Level 1 awards apply to all senior executives including executive directors and Level 2 awards apply to executive directors and sector managing directors.
Level 1: In 2004, the grant levels awarded were in the range of 16.7% to 66.66% of base salary.
For the option to be exercisable, the companys annual, average earnings per share growth for a three year performance period needs to be at least 4% per annum higher than the UK rate of inflation over the same period.
Failing this, the companys annual growth in earnings per share on average over a greater period up to a maximum of ten years needs to be at least 4% in excess of the UK rate of inflation for the option to be exercisable.
For Level 1 options granted in 2005, retesting will be permitted for one year only, making a maximum period of four years.
Level 2: In 2004, the grant levels awarded were in the range of 33.33% to 44.44% of basic salary.
The performance condition for Level 2 option awards is the companys total shareholder return TSR performance compared with the TSR performance of the FTSE 100 Index and a defined group of comparator companies which comprises support services companies over the same three year period no retesting is permitted.
TSR is defined as the appreciation of the share price including reinvested dividends and is calculated by a firm of external consultants, Watson Wyatt.
The performance condition is as follows: FTSE 100 Index Comparator Companies TSR Position % of option that will vest Below median 0% 0% Median 25% 25% Upper Quartile 50% 50% Where TSR performance is between median and upper quartile, the proportion that will vest is calculated pro rata, on a straight line basis.
The selected comparator group for the Level 2 share options granted in 2004 was as follows: The Capita Group plc Grupo Ferrovial Servicos SA Securitas AB Cintas Corporation Hays plc Serco Group plc Compass Group plc International Service Systems A S The Servicemaster Company The Davis Services Group Plc Rentokil Initial plc Sodexho Alliance SA Group 4 Securicor plc 32 COMPONENTS OF The comparator groups for Level 2 share option awards prior to 2004 i. e. since the introduction of the Discretionary Schemes REMUNERATION in 2000, are similar to the list on page 32, save that, from time to time, changes are required to reflect acquisitions and mergers continued of comparator companies.
The Committee believes that the composition of the comparator group fairly reflects those companies in the support services sector which would be regarded as a legitimate peer group for the company.
A summary of the progress towards satisfaction of the performance targets for Level 1 share options, granted since 2000 is set out in the following table: AVERAGE EXERCISE TARGET AVERAGE EPS GRANT PRICE PENCE PERIOD GROWTH % GROWTH % 2000 156.5 2000 to 2003 6.6 -1.2 2001 205.25 2001 to 2003 6.1 10.6 2002 266.75 2002 to 2004 7.1 -2.2 2003 204.5 Minimum period has yet to elapse N A N A 2004 152.0 Minimum period has yet to elapse N A N A The performance condition for Level 2 share options granted has been satisfied as follows: PERCENTAGE EXERCISABLE EXERCISE PERIOD FIXED ANY BALANCE GRANT PRICE PENCE PERIOD OF YEARS WILL HAVE LAPSED 2000 156.5 2000 to 2002 85% 2001 205.25 2001 to 2003 100% 2002 266.75 2002 to 2004 0% 2003 204.5 2003 to 2005 To be established 2004 152.0 2004 to 2006 To be established Note: The exercise price for Level 2 share options will be adjusted to reflect the cost of holding the shares less the dividend income thereon.
