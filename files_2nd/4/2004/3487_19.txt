if the performance condition is met.
The performance condition is based on Headline Earnings Per Share as defined by the Institution of Investment Management and Research EPS.
It is intended that for any options granted during the year to 31st August 2005 to become exercisable, the growth in the Companys EPS must exceed inflation by at least 15% per annum compound.
At this level of growth, 40% of the options will become exercisable.
For all of the options to become exercisable, growth in EPS must exceed inflation by at least 25% per annum compound.
There is straight-line vesting between these two points.
The performance of the Company will initially be measured over three financial years, measuring from the base financial year, being the year ended immediately prior to the grant.
If the target has not been met at the end of this period, it can be re-tested for a further two years from a fixed base.
An EPS condition was chosen as in the Committees opinion EPS growth requires substantial improvement in the Companys underlying financial performance before the options may be exercised.
The Committee will regularly review the performance conditions for future option grants, but future conditions must be considered by the Committee to be no less challenging in the circumstances than the initial condition approved by shareholders in 2003.
The condition may be varied in certain circumstances following the grant of an option to take account of technical changes so as to achieve its original purpose.
Chrysalis Annual Report and Accounts 2004 62 Report of the board on remuneration The extent to which Performance Share Awards and Matching Share Awards vest is as follows: Matching Share Award matching Performance Share Award TSR performance ranking ratio on a pre-tax basis vesting percentage Below median 00% Median 1:1 25% Upper quartile 2.5:1 100% Between median and upper quartile pro rata between 1:1 and 2.5:1 pro rata between 25% and 100% The performance period will begin on the first day of the financial year in which the grant is made and end three years later.
There is no opportunity to re-test the performance condition if it is not met after the three year performance period.
TSR will be averaged over the six month periods, beginning three months prior to the beginning and end of the performance period.
The Committee chose the performance condition because it aligns the interests of Executives with shareholders by requiring superior TSR performance compared to similar companies.
The performance condition will be reviewed at the end of the three year performance period by the Committee in conjunction with its advisors.
The Committee will regularly review the performance conditions for future awards, but future conditions must be considered by the Committee to be no less challenging in the circumstances than the initial condition.
The condition may be varied in certain circumstances following the grant of an award to take account of technical changes so as to achieve its original purpose.
Service contracts The Committee reviews and agrees Directors service agreements.
The Committee agrees with the recommendation contained in the Code that there is a strong case for setting notice or contract periods at, or reducing them to, 12 months or less.
The Committee has had and will continue to have regard to these recommendations but is conscious of the need to secure the services of key executives for the benefit of the Company and the shareholders which may, on occasions, necessitate contracts for longer periods.
All of the Executive Directors service agreements can be terminated by either party by giving 12 months notice.
