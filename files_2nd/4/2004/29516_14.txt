d The benefits column includes amounts relating to car allowances and medical and life insurance benefits.
The expatriate directors, Mr DeNoma and Mr Nargolwala, carry out their duties overseas and have their remuneration adjusted to take local living costs into account.
This adjustment is to put them in a position, after taxation differentials, where they are no worse off as a result of carrying out their duties overseas.
The benefits column for the expatriate directors includes additional benefits, such as allowances for working overseas, the provision of accommodation or education of children, granted to directors working overseas.
For Mr DeNoma and Mr Nargolwala, these allowances and benefits amounted to $503,508 2003: $510,940 and $483,192 2003: $583,608, respectively.
e The value of share awards is an expected value of any discretionary share awards granted during the course of the financial year.
The values are based on, in the case of options, an adjusted black scholes value, and in the case of performance shares, an initial value adjusted for factors such as performance conditions, risk of forfeiture and lack of dividends.
