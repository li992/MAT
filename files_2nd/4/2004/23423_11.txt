Policy on Directors Remuneration The policy of the Remuneration Committee is that remuneration of non-executive Directors should be fair and sufficient to attract and retain Directors to properly oversee the affairs of the Company and should reflect the specific circumstances of the Company, the duties and responsibilities of the Directors and the value and amount of time committed to the Companys affairs.
It is intended that this policy will continue for the year ended 30 September 2005 and subsequent years.
