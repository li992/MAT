At less senior levels, annual grants are they exceed long term target underwriting returns.
The basis of the Plan is that participants will benefit to the extent that, in their particular over shares representing lesser multiples of salary.

The Board receives recommendations in this respect from a special committee chaired by the Chairman, with the Chief Executive and two other directors one executive and one non-executive, each of which changes each year as the other members.
Recommendations and decisions are made taking account of professional advice and other information on the level of such fees paid by comparable companies for comparable services.
AMLIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2004 59 The Chairmans remuneration is determined by similar criteria, but by the Remuneration Committee.
The minimum time commitments given by each director, as detailed in the Board corporate governance statement, are also taken into account.
During the review of non-executive directors fees as at 1 July 2004, the special committee recommended, and the Board agreed, that the non-executive fees within its responsibility should be set by reference to the upper quartile of such fees paid by companies of similar size on account of the well above average complexity and regulatory responsibilities involved.
Each non-executive director is paid a basic fee and may be paid further for additional services, including for acting as Deputy Chairman of the Company, or serving as chairman of a committee or as members of more than one committee or of certain subsidiary boards.
Non-executive directors have contracts for services rather than employment contracts.
Their terms of appointment are formalised in letters of appointment which are updated from time to time.
The latest letters of appointment of the Chairman and the other non-executive directors are dated 8 September 2004.
Non-executive directors, as is the case with executive directors, are appointed on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, usually for a three year term.
Non-executive directors may be removed, or not nominated for re-election at the end of their term, in each case in accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company.
All of the non-executive directors are currently serving three year terms.
The commencement and expected year of expiry of each of the nonexecutive directors current terms are as follows: Current term Date of expiry commenced of current term N J C Buchanan 19 May 2004 AGM in 2007 R S Joslin 12 June 2002 18 May 2005 K T Kemp 12 June 2002 18 May 2005 R W Mylvaganam 12 June 2002 18 May 2005 Lord Stewartby 12 June 2002 18 May 2005 R J Taylor 12 June 2002 18 May 2005 Details of nominations of directors at the Annual General Meeting on 18 May 2005, where applicable, are contained in the circular including the notice of the meeting, which is being circulated to shareholders with this report.
If a non-executive director is not nominated or re-elected at the end of a term of office, the director is not entitled to any extra payment on termination.
In other circumstances three months notice of termination may be given by either side.
Copies of the letters of appointment of non-executive directors are available for inspection at the Companys registered office.
