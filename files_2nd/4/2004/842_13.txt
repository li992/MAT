AMEC plc annual report 2004 51 Directors remuneration report continued Directors remuneration and related matters The auditors are required to report on the following information on pages 52 to 54 of the directors remuneration report.
Individual aspects of remuneration were as follows: Benefits 2004 2003 v vi Salary fee Bonus in kind Total Total 000 000 000 000 000 i Executive: Sir Peter Mason 670 239 40 949 1,021 J D Early 263 139 16 418 378 ii J A Monville 370 185 7 562 542 iii S J Siddall 388 148 22 558 513 iv C A Riva from 1 August 2003 532 140 33 705 426 D Robson to 31 July 2003 268 G E Payne to 31 March 2003 67 Non-executive: J M Green-Armytage 191 191 46 E P Airey 46 46 52 J A Dallas 35 35 43 M O Hesse 46 46 78 J-P Jacamon 35 35 38 S Gillibrand to 21 January 2004 12 12 167 Total board 2,588 851 118 3,557 3,639 Notes i Sir Peter Masons salary includes a taxable supplement in relation to earnings above the earnings cap for pension purposes of 95,000 2003: 88,000. ii Mr Monvilles salary comprised 480,000 paid by SPIE S.

These reflected the achievement of AMEC plc profit performance that was midway between the threshold and stretch targets set at the start of the year and varying achievement against specific business targets and personal objectives.
vi The value of benefits in kind received during the year relates principally to the provision of a company car or car allowance, travelling expenses, life assurance and private medical expenses insurance.
Unemployment insurance is also made available to Mr Monville in accordance with French practice and certain relocation expenses have been reimbursed to Mr Riva.
None of these benefits are pensionable.
iv The performance conditions applied to awards made under the Executive Share Option Schemes during the year were varied from previous years, including the removal of the facility to retest.
All awards were at nil cost.
v Certain of the options were capable of being exercised as at 31 December 2004 as all performance conditions had been met.
If the options had been exercised on that date the approximate gain before appropriate taxes for each of the current directors would have been: Sir Peter Mason, 1,900,000 and Mr Early, 76,875.
Had the remainder of the options been capable of being exercised and vested in full as at 31 December 2004, the approximate latent gain before appropriate taxes for each of the current directors would have been: Sir Peter Mason, 213,000: Mr Early, 99,420: Mr Siddall, 118,000: Mr Monville, 29,000 and Mr Riva, 70,000.
These hypothetical figures assume that all performance conditions will be fully met, which may not in practice transpire.
The Performance Share Plan 2002 the PSP was approved by shareholders in 2002.
The PSP replaced the Long-Term Incentive Plan the LTIP which was introduced in 1998.
The design of the PSP took account of the provisions of Schedule A to the Combined Code.

ii For the LTIP awards made in April 2001, AMEC failed to meet the minimum performance conditions and, therefore, the awards lapsed in April 2004. iii For the LTIP awards made in April 2002, AMEC failed to meet the earnings per share performance condition and, therefore, these awards will lapse in April 2005. iv The terms and conditions of the PSP and the LTIP have not been varied during the year.
v The closing price of the shares at 31 December 2004 was 297.75 pence 2003: 260.00 pence.
vi The range of the closing prices for the shares during the year was 252.25 pence to 342.00 pence.
vii The register of directors interests, which is open to inspection at the companys registered office, contains full details of directors shareholdings, share options and awards under the PSP and the LTIP.
viii Had the restricted shares detailed above vested in full as at 31 December 2004 the approximate latent value before appropriate taxes for each of the current directors would have been: Sir Peter Mason, 1,466,000: Mr Early, 689,000: Mr Siddall, 763,000: Mr Monville, 696,000: and Mr Riva, 956,000.

ii Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with version 1.5 of guidance note GN11 issued by the actuarial profession.
iii The value of net increase represents the incremental value to the director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption service terminated at the year-end.
It is based on the accrued pension increase after deducting the directors contribution.
iv The change in the transfer value includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the company and directors, such as stock market movements.
It is calculated after deducting the directors contribution.
v Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
Mr J A Monville is a member of the SPIE top-up pension scheme for senior executives.
Although the scheme, arranged through an insurance company, is a defined benefit scheme, it is not possible to disclose his pension benefits in the above format.
A pension is payable by SPIE only in the event of Mr Monville reaching his normal retirement age of 65 or, following the attainment of age 60, by agreement with AMEC.
No pension is due or payable in other circumstances and Mr Monville currently has no accrued right to a pension payment.
His pension at the normal retirement age, or as agreed by AMEC, would be based on the average of his last three years base salary and bonus, up to a maximum of 20 per cent of this figure.
It is not possible to attribute a value to the accrued funds as these are not separately identified by the insurance company.
