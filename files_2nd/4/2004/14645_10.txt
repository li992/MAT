3The options expired prior to the date first exercisable.
4The final exercise price and number of purchase rights under the ESPP, an all employee share plan, cannot be determined until maturity ie 12 months following the date of grant.
The purchase rights granted calculation was based on the market price of an Ordinary share less a 15 per cent discount at the date of grant and the rate of exchange between the US dollar and sterling on the date of grant.
In accordance with the rules of the ESPP, My Chungs purchase rights were exercised automatically as part of a maturity on 1 January 2004 over 17,328 Ordinary shares in respect to his 2003 ESPP account.
The small difference between the rights outstanding at the year end and the amount purchased was caused by exchange rate uctuations between the US dollar and sterling.
