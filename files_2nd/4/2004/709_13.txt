5 The performance-related bonus figures shown above include the deferred and matching elements of the bonus that are received in shares.
The deferred bonus shares are forfeitable in certain circumstances and 50% of the deferred bonus shares are released to the executive after two years and the remaining 50% of the deferred bonus shares are released to the executive after three years.
It should be noted that the matching shares are conditional, except under exceptional circumstances, on continued employment with the Group and therefore a significant amount of the performance-related bonus reported in the table above is not received by the Director until the end of the deferral period that operates under the Deferred Bonus Plan.

Directors interests The Companys Register of Directors Interests contains full details of the Directors shareholdings and options to acquire shares in the Company.
Shareholdings The beneficial interests of Directors in the Ordinary Share capital of the Company at 31 August 2004 were as follows: At 1 September 2003 At 31 August 2004 or date of appointment, if later Number of Ordinary Shares Number of Ordinary Shares Paul Adams Bruno Angelici 2,000 Philip Bowman 430,653 308,833 Donald Brydon 11,500 11,500 Graham Hetherington 156,724 107,253 John Rishton Sir Gerry Robinson David Scotland 142,746 77,766 Richard Turner 131,977 106,875 Total 875,600 612,227 Notes 1 At 31 August 2004 the Allied Domecq employee trusts held 27,073,905 2003: 32,549,067 unallocated Ordinary Shares in the Company on discretionary terms for the benefit of certain Group employees.
The Executive Directors were treated as interested in these shares in their capacity as potential beneficiaries.
As at 20 October 2004 these holdings had reduced to 26,183,923 Ordinary Shares.
2 The above table includes interests in deferred bonus shares awarded under the Companys Deferred Bonus Plan and partnership shares purchased pursuant to the Companys Share Partnership Plan and associated matching shares.
The Directors beneficially own such shares, however certain of these shares are forfeitable in specific circumstances.
The table excludes interests in matching shares under the Companys Deferred Bonus Plan and interests in the Companys Share Option and Long Term Incentive Schemes disclosed on pages 52 and 53.
3 Philip Bowman purchased a further 66 shares and Richard Turner purchased a further 181 shares between 1 September 2004 and 20 October 2004.
No Director had a non-beneficial interest in shares or stocks of the Company at any time either during the year ended 31 August 2004 or between 1 September 2004 and 20 October 2004.
Includes American Depositary Shares representing underlying Ordinary Shares.
As a result of the Remuneration Committees review of long term incentive arrangements, the Committee has introduced guidelines under which the Executive Directors are expected to build up significant personal holdings of Allied Domecq shares.
We believe this will further align their interests with those of Shareholders.
The guidelines are 2 x salary for the Chief Executive and 1 x salary for other Executive Directors.
Cash award audited As reported last year, in November 2002, the Remuneration Committee made awards of deferred cash bonuses to certain senior executives including the four Executive Directors.
These awards were made to take the place of grants of options under the Long Term Incentive Scheme which would have been made but in the event could not properly be made because of consolidation activity in the industry.
In making these awards the Remuneration Committee took account of the value created for Shareholders.
The structure of the award has been designed to retain those executives who are eligible to receive the awards.
The award was equal to 100% of base salary as at 1 January 2003.
The payment of the award was subject to the executive remaining in employment on the payment dates.
Half of the award was paid on 1 September 2003 and the other half was paid on 1 September 2004.
2 Details of the performance conditions related to the Executive Share Option Schemes and the Long Term Incentive Scheme are included on pages 47 and 48 of this report.
