44 Alliance UniChem Plc Board report on remuneration The remuneration committee the Committee determines the remuneration of the executive Directors and makes recommendations to the Board of any changes to the terms and conditions of employment of executive Directors.
The Committee consists of four independent non-executive Directors: Ken Clarke Committee Chairman, Neil Cross, Adrian Loader and Patrick Ponsolle.
Jeff Harris, Ian Meakins and Stefano Pessina attend meetings by invitation in advisory capacities but are not present when their own remuneration is discussed.
Remuneration policy The aim of the Groups remuneration policy is to maximise the position of the Group in the European healthcare sector by attracting, retaining and motivating the highest calibre of executive Directors and senior executives, aligning the rewards of those individuals with the interests of shareholders by linking part of their remuneration package to the performance of the Group and the creation of long-term shareholder value.
In implementing the remuneration policy, the Committee has considered the principles in the Code with regard to Directors remuneration.
In accordance with the remuneration policy, the remuneration of executive Directors is made up of a combination of basic salary, non-cash benefits, annual performance bonus, long-term incentive plan benefits, share options and pension benefits, all of which are detailed below.
The executive Directors remuneration is reviewed at the end of each calendar year.
No Director is permitted to vote in respect of their own remuneration.
Service contracts Ian Meakins, George Fairweather, Per Utnegaard and Steve Duncan are employed under contracts that can be terminated by either party with notice of 12 months.
Stefano Pessina and Ornella Barra have service contracts that can be terminated by the Group with notice of 12 months or by each of them with notice of six months.
There are provisions in the service contracts for payment in lieu of current salary to cover the required notice period.
Were the situation to arise, the Company intends to apply the principle of mitigation to any payment of compensation on termination as a result of unsatisfactory performance.
Geoff Cooper resigned from the Board and from the role of Deputy Chief Executive on 29 July 2004 when the decision to appoint Ian Meakins was finalised and he left the Company at the end of the year.
His emoluments for the year as a Director and employee and his payment for loss of office are set out in the emoluments section of this report.
The principle of mitigation was not applicable as his departure was not as a result of unsatisfactory performance.
The dates of the executive Directors current service contracts are: Director Contract date I. K. Meakins 16 September 2004 S. Pessina 10 December 2002 G. R. Fairweather 28 March 2002 O. Barra 10 December 2002 P. Utnegaard 11 February 2005 S. W. J. Duncan 29 December 1995 The Company recognises that its executive Directors may be invited to become non-executive Directors of other listed companies and that such duties can broaden experience and knowledge which benefit the Company.
Executive Directors are therefore allowed to accept one external non-executive appointment with the Companys prior approval, as long as this is not in any way connected with the Companys business and would not lead to any conflict of interest.
Fees received by the Director may be retained.
Ian Meakins is a non-executive Director of mmO and retained fees for that appointment of 4,167 during the period he was Chief 2 Executive.
Stefano Pessina is a non-executive Director of Galenica, an associate company.
He waived his entitlement to fees as part of the agreement with Galenica on reciprocal board representation.
George Fairweather is a non-executive Director of Mitchells & Butlers and retained fees paid of 49,500 in 2004 for that appointment.
Per Utnegaard was appointed a non-executive Director of the Davis Service Group in January 2005 and will retain fees payable.
Geoff Cooper was appointed non-executive Director of Abbey National in January 2004 and served until 1 December 2004.
He retained fees paid of 52,000 in 2004 for that appointment.
Jeff Harris is a Director of Andreae-Noris Zahn, an associate company, the fees payable being retained by the Company.
45 Alliance UniChem Plc Salaries The setting of basic salary reflects the committees assessment of the market rate for relevant positions, taking into account the levels of responsibility, the individual Directors experience and their contribution to the Group.
For determining basic salary in 2004 and 2005, the committee appointed and received advice from  PwC Monks Partnership.
PwC provide remuneration and other consultancy services directly to the Company.
The amount paid to each Director in 2004 is detailed in the emoluments section on page 47.
Following a report from PwC in December 2004, the remuneration committee reviewed salaries payable to the executive Directors based on market related base salary data from a comparator group of companies consisting of 20 companies from the 25 smallest FTSE 100 companies by market capitalisation excluding financial companies and 20 companies from the 25 largest FTSE 250 companies by market capitalisation excluding financial companies.
Salary increases, which are effective from 1 January 2005, were based on this data after taking account of the performance of each Director.
Executive Directors basic salaries at 1 January 2005 are as follows: Director I. K. Meakins 625,000 S. Pessina 485,000 G. R. Fairweather 375,000 O. Barra 310,000 P. Utnegaard 315,000 S. W. J. Duncan 315,000 Benefits Benefits available to executive Directors relate to the provision of company cars or a car allowance, private medical insurance, and, for Stefano Pessina and Ornella Barra, the cost of travel to and from work, accommodation and subsistence while working for the Group in the UK.
The provision of these benefits reflects market practice and do not relate to performance.
The value of these benefits for each Director in 2004, including expenses chargeable to UK income tax, are detailed in the emoluments section on page 47.
Where a Director is entitled to a benefit but chooses not to take that benefit, a cash supplement is paid in lieu of that benefit.
Salary supplements Salary supplements include cash payments and long-term financial provision.
Annual performance bonuses The annual performance bonus scheme rewards executive Directors for the Group and individual divisions for which they are responsible for achieving their budgeted performance, after the cost of bonuses.
Payments also take into account personal performance.
The maximum bonus an executive Director could receive in 2004 was 50% of their basic salary.
In 2004 the budgeted performance was based on the challenging but achievable 2004 budget for earnings, before amortisation of intangible assets and exceptional items, at constant exchange rates, agreed by the Board at the end of the previous year.
Depending upon responsibilities, a bonus of between 5% and 15% was payable for performance of 100% of the Group or Group and divisional performance, rising to 40% for performance of 105% of the Group and divisional budgeted performance.
Personal performance was based on a 360 appraisal process and determined by the remuneration committee.
Depending on responsibilities, a bonus of up to 15% was payable based on this appraisal.
The Committee has agreed that the maximum bonus opportunity for 2005 will be increased from 50% of base salary to 100%.
The Committee is satisfied that the new level is commensurate with that in companies of a similar size and complexity to Alliance UniChem.
Depending on the responsibilities of an individual Director, 80% of the bonus will be based on Group and or divisional financial results and 20% of the bonus will be based on personal performance.
A target bonus of 40% of base salary will be paid for the achievement of a stretching target which exceeds budget.
Bonuses will start to accrue on the achievement of 96% of the stretch target and the maximum bonus of 80% will be paid for achieving 104% of target.
Ian Meakins earned a bonus payment of 300,000 in 2004 to compensate him for the lost opportunity to earn a bonus from his previous employer in 2004.
This bonus was based on Group performance targets.
The amounts earned by each Director are detailed in the emoluments section on page 47.

48 Alliance UniChem Plc Board report on remuneration Long-term incentive plan The long-term incentive plan is a discretionary arrangement under which allocations are made to executive Directors with the aim of rewarding them for creating shareholder value.
Each allocation takes the form of a non-binding statement of intent to make an award of a stated maximum amount following the end of a specified performance period.
The allocation is determined as a percentage of basic salary in the year that the performance period starts.
The Directors allocations outstanding at 24 February 2005 are: 2002 allocation 2003 allocation 2004 allocation 2005 allocation maximum amount maximum amount maximum amount maximum amount Director J. F. Harris 308,666 1 I. K. Meakins 400,000 625,000 S. Pessina 216,666 233,333 300,000 485,000 G. R. Fairweather 155,775 220,000 233,333 375,000 O. Barra 160,666 180,000 193,333 310,000 P. Utnegaard 206,666 315,000 S. W. J. Duncan 156,667 186,666 315,000 1 Ian Meakins received a 2004 allocation of 400,000 on an exceptional basis to compensate him for the lost opportunity to receive financial benefit from his previous employer.
The performance periods for the allocations are: 2002 allocation 2003 allocation 2004 allocation 2005 allocation Period start 1 January 2002 1 January 2003 1 January 2004 1 January 2005 Period end 31 December 2004 31 December 2005 31 December 2006 31 December 2007 The amount of the award is dependent on the achievement of certain performance measures during the performance period that the Committee believe are the most appropriate measure of the underlying performance of the Group.
Total shareholder return measures the total return to shareholders in terms of share price growth and dividends reinvested in the shares of the Company over the performance period.
Inbucon Group provides the committee with a total shareholder return monitoring report and advises on performance under the long-term incentive plan based on earnings per share performance.
Earnings per share are defined as diluted earnings per share before amortisation of intangible assets and exceptional items for a full accounting year.
RPI-x is the index of retail prices for all items excluding mortgage payments as published by the UK Government.
The performance against RPI-x is calculated on a per annum compound basis.
49 Alliance UniChem Plc For the 2002 allocation, the total shareholder return measure is compared with the performance of companies in the FTSE 250.
Performance measure Achievement % awarded Total shareholder return below median at median 50th percentile 12.5% for every 1 percentile above median 1.5% up to upper quartile 75th percentile 50.0% Earnings per share below RPI-x 3% at RPI-x 3% 5.0% for every 0.1% above RPI-x 3% 4.5% up to RPI-x 4% 50.0% For the 2003, 2004 and 2005 allocations, the total shareholder return measure is compared with the performance of companies in the FTSE 100.
For the 2003 and 2004 allocations, the EPS targets are: Performance measure Achievement % awarded Earnings per share below RPI-x 5% at RPI-x 5% 5.0% for every 0.1% above RPI-x 5% 4.5% up to RPI-x 6% 50.0% To bring the level of awards into line with market practice, the committee has raised the 2005 allocation to 100% of basic salary.
The committee considers that the 2004 TSR targets for vesting remain challenging.
The EPS targets were raised in 2003.
The committee has agreed to leave the target at which awards begin to vest at RPI-x 5% p. a. but increase the target at which the full EPS element vests from RPI-x 6% to RPI-x 7% p. a.
Given that EPS growth for the 2005 allocation will be measured in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards which may affect EPS growth, the Committee considers that the EPS targets it has set are challenging for the 2005 allocations.
The award takes the form of a right to acquire ordinary shares in the Company for a nominal sum within a period of ten years from the date of the award.
The number of shares will be determined by the market price of the Companys shares at the date of the award.
The committee has the discretion to withhold or reduce awards to any extent it considers appropriate, having regard to the Groups underlying financial performance and irrespective of the level of attainment of the performance targets.
50 Alliance UniChem Plc Board report on remuneration During 2004, awards were made on allocations with the performance period 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2003.
During the performance period, the Company was in the 63rd percentile of the comparator group on total shareholder return and the increase in earnings per share was in excess of RPI-x 4%.
On this basis, awards equivalent to 82% of the allocations were made and converted into share options at 562 pence per share, with the exception of Jeff Harris who was only entitled to 41% of the allocation, reflecting his period as an executive Director.

Following the end of the performance period for the 2002 allocation detailed above, the committee has recommended to the trustees of the 1992 Employee Trust that awards equivalent to 86.8% of the allocation are made.
Their basis for doing this is that during the performance period, the Company was in the 66.2 percentile of the comparator group on shareholder return and the increase in earnings per share was in excess of RPI-x 4%.
Performance Total shareholder return for the Company and total shareholder return for FTSE 250 and FTSE 100 companies, being the comparator groups used for the long-term incentive plan, over the five years ending 31 December 2004 were: % 125 100 75 50 25 0 -25 -50 Dec 99 Jun 00 Dec 00 Jun 01 Dec 01 Jun 02 Dec 02 Jun 03 Dec 03 Jun 04 Dec 04 Alliance UniChem Plc Source: Bloomberg FTSE 100 FTSE 250 51 Alliance UniChem Plc The increase in earnings per share over the five years ending 31 December 2004 compared to RPI-x 3% and RPI-x 5% over the same period is: % growth 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 EPS RPI-x 3% RPI-x 5% Share option schemes In addition to the long-term incentive plan, the Company operates two discretionary and one savings related share option scheme, which are open to executive Directors as well as certain other employees.
Details of outstanding options under these schemes are shown in note 23 to the financial statements.
Options granted under the discretionary 1997 Share Option Scheme since May 2003 have no retesting of performance measures and have a fixed performance period being a defined three year period made up of three consecutive accounting periods.
This period commences on 1 January of the year of the award.
The performance target is that the earnings per share growth of the Company must be greater than the increase of RPI-x 4% compound over the performance period.
Earnings per share are defined as the diluted earnings per share before amortisation of intangible assets and exceptional items over the defined accounting periods.
RPI-x is defined as the index of retail prices for all items excluding mortgage payments as published by the UK Government.
For options granted prior to May 2003 there is retesting of the performance measures where the earnings per share growth of the Company must be greater than the increase of RPI-x 4% compound at any time during the exercise period.
The performance conditions for options granted up to and including 2001 have been satisfied.
There are now no outstanding options under the discretionary Executive Share Option Scheme 1990 and no further awards will be made under this Scheme.
