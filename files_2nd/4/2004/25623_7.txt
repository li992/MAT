Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2004 37 Remuneration Report For awards granted in 2004 to fully vest, the performance condition required growth in the Companys earnings per share EPS over the single three year period from 2004 to 2006 as set out below: Growth of EPS in excess of the Retail Prices Index RPI over 3 years: Proportion of awards vesting: RPI 3% per annum or less 0% Between RPI 3% and 10% per annum Pro-rata between 0% and 100% RPI 10% per annum 100% The same performance conditions will apply to awards which will be made in 2005 and the performance period will be 2005-2007.
EPS has been chosen as an appropriate performance condition because it is a key measure used by the Company to measure its underlying financial performance.
The Committee will ensure that a consistent basis of measurement is used for EPS during the transition to international accounting standards.
Details of awards granted to executive directors during 2004 under the LTIP 2004 and in former years under other share schemes are set out on pages 40 to 41.

3 Pension allowance payable to individual directors.
4 Other benefits include life assurance cover, car benefit allowance, medical insurance and permanent health insurance and dividend income on shares held under the LTIP as they mature.
5 For 2004, the Committee decided that substantially lower bonuses should be payable than in the previous year, to reflect the fact that the Group did not meet its targets for the year.
6 The benefits for Mr McGill are for the period from 1st January, 2004 to 26th November, 2004.
Following his resignation in November 2004, Mr McGill has received the contractual level of remuneration in respect of his notice period of 364 days based on his contract dated 1st March, 1997.
This amounted to 611,039 comprising basic salary of 496,154 and other benefits of 114,885.
In addition the Remuneration Committee has exercised its discretion to permit the exercise of the awards made under the LTIP scheme in respect of the 2002 and 2003 financial years but only to the extent that the performance conditions attaching to these awards have been met.
Therefore Mr McGill will be entitled to exercise an award for 62,500 shares in respect of 2002 and for 31,000 shares in respect of 2003.
All other awards and entitlements have lapsed.
Subsequent to the end of the year, a one-off payment of 43,864 was made to Mr McGill in respect of accumulated dividends on the aforementioned vested LTIP awards.

For 50 per cent of each award, EPS growth pages 37 and 38. is measured over three years.
Full vesting occurs if average annual EPS growth exceeds inflation by at least 10 per cent and vesting only starts if average annual EPS growth exceeds inflation by 2 per cent, with pro rata vesting between 2 per cent and 10 per cent.

Transfer values: All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The transfer value of the accrued entitlement represents the cash equivalent of the directors pension benefits which would be offered by the Trustees of Jardine Lloyd Thompson Pension Scheme to another pension scheme as consideration for the other scheme taking on the liability for providing the directors pension benefits at retirement.
The transfer value itself does not represent an actual sum payable to the individual director as part of pay and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The increase in the transfer value less directors contributions is the increase in the transfer value of the accrued benefits during the year after deducting the directors personal contributions to the scheme.
