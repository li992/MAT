Pension arrangements During the year the Group operated a final salary pension scheme and a Group Personal Pension Plan GPPP.
During the year, for the final salary scheme the Group contributed 32.0% of the pensionable payroll for all members.
Members contributed in accordance with the Rules.
All employees in the Group final salary pension schemes have permanent health insurance and death-inservice life assurance cover to the value of four times their salary, subject to acceptance by insurers.
The Group introduced the GPPP for new entrants with effect from 29 September 1997 to which it contributes 7.0% of pensionable salary and members contribute a minimum of 3.5% of their pensionable salary.
Membership of the GPPP provides permanent health insurance and death-in-service life assurance cover to the value of between two and four times pensionable salary, subject to acceptance by insurers.
During the year, the Group operated a final salary pension scheme for employees who joined the Scheme prior to 29 September 1997.
The funds of the Scheme are administered by Trustees and are separate from the Group.
A valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 1 September 2003.
This resulted in a long-term Group contribution rate of 32.0% of members total earnings.
The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the funding position of the Scheme are those relating to the differences between the long-term rate of return on investments and the rate of increase in earnings.
The 1 September 2003 valuation for the Scheme assumed that the long-term investment return pre-retirement would exceed salary increases by 3.9% per annum and price inflation by 4.9% per annum.
It assumed that the long-term investment return after retirement would exceed salary increases by 2.1% per annum and price inflation by 3.1% per annum.
The market value of the Scheme assets was 135.3m, which was sufficient to cover 78.5% of members accrued benefits, after allowing for future increases in earnings at the long-term rate.
A provision of 1.5m 2003: 3.0m is included in creditors representing the cumulative excess of pension costs charged to the profit and loss account over the Group contributions paid.
