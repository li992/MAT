Role and membership of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee decides both the level and structure of Executive Directors pay and the remuneration of the Chairman.
The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is a matter reserved for the Chairman and the Executive Directors and no director is involved in setting his or her own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee is a Board committee consisting exclusively of independent nonexecutive directors: Peter Wilson Chairman, Michel Brossard, Bernard Dufau and Andrew Robb.
Their biographical details appear on page16.
The Chairman may attend Remuneration Committee meetings except when his own remuneration is discussed.
It has written terms of reference from the Board, which currently specify its major duties as: To make recommendations to the Board on the Companys framework of executive remuneration and its cost, and to demonstrate that executive remuneration is set objectively and that executive directors are fairly rewarded.
To determine specific remuneration packages for each of the executive directors, following the process described below, together with conditions of employment including pension rights, contracts of employment and any compensation package in the event of the early termination of a contract.
To monitor the remuneration of senior executives below main board level, and provide a wider perspective for determining annual salary increases for executive directors.
To establish incentive schemes for Executive Directors, set performance criteria and monitor their performance.
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the Company has applied the principles set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code when forming its remuneration policy.
Pay decisions are made with regard to the advice prepared by the Chairman, the Chief Executive and the Company Secretary who are invited to attend meetings of the Remuneration Committee as and when appropriate.
In making its decisions the Remuneration Committee has access to the relevant external advisers appointed by the Committee and the Company.
The Remuneration Committee has sought advice from Towers Perrin, and Ernst and Young LLP.
The Remuneration Committee also appointed an independent advisor, HRCS Limited to assist in the co-ordination of the recommendations for the proposed Long-Term Incentive Plan, and the proposed all-employee share plan.
Details of these are set out in the Appendix to the Notice of Annual General Meeting.
Towers Perrin has provided market practice data in connection with this and Ernst & Young LLP has advised on the design structure and best practice.
Remuneration policy and a description of each element of remuneration Kesas businesses are well positioned to achieve sustained growth and key to this is the move towards a more performance oriented culture with a clear link between remuneration and performance.
The core principles on which the remuneration structure is founded are as follows: a To establish base pay levels on the basis of mid-market practice amongst UK and European companies of comparable size.
b To provide benefits, such as pensions, on a basis that is appropriate to the local market in which the employee works.
c To establish performance related incentives in order to provide the opportunity to deliver substantial rewards for high performance.
d To align the interests of employees and shareholders to deliver real value growth and to encourage wider share ownership amongst all Kesa employees.
24 Kesa Electricals Annual Report 2003 As the demerger took place part of the way through the financial year, the Remuneration Committee did not have sufficient time to put in place a suitable Long-Term Incentive Plan for Kesa executives.
At the time of the demerger, Kingfisher shareholders approved a demerger award plan under which a one-off grant of shares was made.
This was to act as a retention tool for Kesa executives, together with recompense for options granted in October 2002 that had lapsed and to reflect their exclusion from the regular Kingfisher option grant which took place in April 2003.
For the period from the demerger to 31 January 2004, the Remuneration Committee put in place an additional cash award for the executive directors and other senior management of up to 30% of salary, on top of the annual cash bonus scheme.
Payouts are based on achievement of the Groups operating profit and cash flow targets.
Set out in the Appendix to the Notice of Annual General Meeting are the details of the new Long-Term Incentive Plan which will be implemented later on this year subject to shareholder approval.
Upon approval the plan will: Provide a link between management performance and reward by rewarding senior management for delivering superior Total Shareholder Return.
Use equity in the Company for reward purposes more efficiently at all levels in the organisation.
Encourage key executives to build and maintain a significant shareholding in the Company.
Ensure its arrangements are in line with current best practice and the views of its investors.
Link to performance If the LTIP is approved, each element in the reward package would then support the achievement of different corporate objectives.
These are illustrated below: Element Purpose Performance standard a Base salary Reflects the competitive salary level for the Individual contribution particular job and takes account of personal contribution and performance.

c Performance shares Aligns with shareholder interests through Total Shareholder Return under the LTIP delivery of shares.

total shareholder growth of the the FTSE 250.
In fair value terms, the proportion of total pay excluding pensions and benefits, which is variable, is equal to approximately 40 per cent.
The remuneration package for the executive directors consists of salary, health insurance, annual bonus, company car or cash in lieu, pension and participation in the Companys employee share plans.
The levels of individual base salary, bonus and share scheme awards are reviewed annually.
The Remuneration Committee considers that all the elements of the package are of equal importance in supporting the Groups remuneration policy.
The Committee believes that linking incentives to profit growth helps to reinforce our growth objectives and is an appropriate measure for a predominantly retail business.
Elements of the directors remuneration are further explained below: a Base salary To ascertain the jobs market value, external remuneration consultants annually review and provide data about market salary levels and advise the Remuneration Committee.
These market rates are based on peer group data and are derived from the pay position described above.
Before making a final decision on individual salary awards, the Committee assesses each directors contribution to the business to reflect individual performance.
b Annual bonus To reward annual performance, the Chief Executive is eligible for an annual bonus with a target of 60 per cent of base salary and a maximum of 100 per cent of salary for substantially exceeding targets.
The other Executive Director is eligible for an annual bonus with a target of up to 50 per cent 25 Kesa Electricals Annual Report 2003 of base salary and a maximum of 80 per cent of salary for substantially exceeding targets.
For the period 2003 04 the bonus targets were operating profit and cash flow.
An additional bonus of up to 30 per cent is payable, depending on financial performance as there was no Long-Term Incentive Plan in place.
Directors currently receive their annual bonus in cash.
However, if the proposals to introduce the LTIP are approved at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, their bonus will be 50 per cent in cash and 50 per cent in Kesa shares which will be held in trust under the terms of the proposed LTIP.
Further details of the LTIP are set out in the appendix to the Notice of the Annual General Meeting.
c Pensions and other benefits Pensions are offered in line with local competitive practice.
The retirement age for directors in France is 60.
Senior employees may participate in le plan fide retraite complementaire Kesa Internationale which is a defined benefit scheme and provides life insurance of 4.25 times annual basic salary including travel allowance.
Pensionable salary is the annual gross remuneration received over the three preceding years, excluding profit sharing plans, any termination payments and any exceptional compensation.
The retirement age for directors in the UK is 60 under arrangements which broadly provide a pension of two thirds of final salary subject to Inland Revenue limits, life assurance at four times salary and ill health and dependents pensions.
Incentive payments such as annual bonuses are not pensionable.
To the extent that the salary of an Executive Director exceeds the permitted maximum the earnings cap, a supplement of 13 per cent of the excess over the earnings cap is paid to the executive as a pension supplement.
Further details are provided under the disclosure of the arrangements for each director.
Cars or a car allowance are provided on a basis that is consistent with competitive practice.
d Share incentives Apart from the legacy schemes inherited on the Demerger from Kingfisher, known as the Kesa Group Incentive Compensation Plan, the Company has only one other share award plan the Demerger Award Plan, under which a one-off grant of awards has been made.
The Demerger Award Plan was designed to ensure executives interests were aligned with those of shareholders, and to reflect the lost opportunity to participate in the 2002 and 2003 Kingfisher Option Awards.
Only one half of the award is subject to performance criteria because the original awards were not subject to any.
Executives also face a financial penalty if they leave the Company in the three-year period following the demerger.
e Service contracts The Boards policy is to limit service contracts of Executive Directors to one year rolling terms.
In the event of termination of the directors contract, any compensation payment is calculated in accordance with normal legal principles, including the application of mitigation to an extent appropriate to the circumstances of the case and local legislation.
With the exception of the proposed introduction of the LTIP, no significant changes to the Companys remuneration policy are expected.
Performance graph illustrating Kesas performance against the FTSE 250 The following performance graph shows the Total Shareholder Return TSR for Kesa measured against the performance of the FTSE 250 since demerger in July 2003, as vesting 50 per cent of the shares under the Demerger Award Plan is linked to the satisfaction of TSR.

Columns 1 and 2 represent the deferred pension to which the directors would have been entitled had they left the Group on 31 January 2003 and 2004, respectively.
Column 3 is the transfer value of the deferred pension in column 1 calculated as at 31 January 2004 based on factors supplied by the actuary of the relevant Group pension scheme in accordance with actuarial guidance note GN11.
Column 4 is the equivalent transfer value, but calculated as at 31 January 2003 on the assumption that the director left service at that date.
Column 5 is the change in transfer value of accrued pension during the year net of contributions by the director.
Retirement benefits continued Column 6 is the increase in pension built up during the year, recognising i the accrual rate for the additional service based on the pensionable salary in force at the year end, and ii where appropriate the effect of pay changes in real inflation adjusted terms on the pension already earned at the start of the year.
Column 7 is the capital value of the pension in column 6.
It represents the amount of cash required to secure that increase in accrued pension.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to pension benefits from the Company.
The disclosures in columns 6 and 7 are as required by the UK Listing Authoritys Listing Rules.
The requirements of the Listing Rules differ from those of the Companies Act.
The Listing Rules require the additional pension earned over the year to be calculated as the difference between the pension accrued at the end of the financial year and the pension accrued at the start of the financial year, less the increase in the pension earned over the year solely due to inflation.
The change in the transfer value required by the Companies Act will also be significantly influenced by the assumptions underlying the calculation at the beginning and the end of the financial year and market conditions.
Directors service contracts The disclosures required by the Regulations in respect of directors service contracts are as follows: Jean-Nol Labroue Mr Labroues service contract dated 13 June 2003 is covered by the applicable French collective Bargaining Agreement in force within Kesa Electricals SAS which sets certain of his terms and conditions of employment.
Mr Labroues service contract provides for an annual basic salary of 484,616 and receives a travel allowance of 12,115 per month.
Mr Labroue also participates in mandatory French retirement benefit arrangements.
In line with French practice, Mr Labroues pensionable salary is the annual gross remuneration received by him over the three preceding years, excluding profit sharing plans, any termination payments and any exceptional compensation received by him.
Under his service contract, Mr Labroues employment may be terminated on not less than six months notice given by either party.
Kesa Electricals SAS may require Mr Labroue not to serve out his notice but in that case Kesa Electricals SAS must maintain his contractual remuneration and benefits save for bonus and incentive arrangements during the notice period.
In addition to notice, if certain conditions are met, Kesa Electricals SAS may be required under French law to make a further payment to Mr Labroue as compensation for the termination of his employment.
This payment is not likely to exceed 12 months remuneration.
In addition, Mr Labroues service contract provides that if during the 12 months immediately following a change of control of Kesa Electricals, Kesa Electricals SAS gives Mr Labroue notice of termination of his employment other than cause, and is entitled to receive a liquidated damages payment equivalent to twelve months remuneration.
For these purposes one months remuneration for Mr Labroue is calculated by reference to his annual basic salary at the time including the allowance for his travel outside France, and such bonus and benefits provided to him in the 12 months prior to the month in which the change of control occurs.
Any amounts payable under French law to Mr Labroue on any termination of his employment count towards the liquidated damages payment and are not deducted from the contractual obligations.
Martin Reavley Martin Reavley has a service contract with Kesa Electricals dated 16 June 2003.
Mr Reavleys service contract provides for an annual basic salary of 275,000, the use of a company car or travel allowance, pension benefits and private medical insurance.
Mr Reavley is also provided with life insurance of four times the earnings cap.
Under his service contract he is subject to post-employment restrictive covenants.
Mr Reavleys pension and life insurance benefits will be provided under the Kingfisher pension scheme until 31 March 2004.
Mr Reavley is also provided with a pension supplement of 13 per cent of such amount of his basic salary as exceeds the permitted maximum as defined in the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 the earnings cap which is 99,000 for the 2003 2004 financial year.
Mr Reavley participated in the Demerger Award Plan and received an annual cash award under the Kesa Electricals bonus scheme for the 2003 2004 financial year.
Under his service contract, Mr Reavleys employment can be terminated on not less than 12 months notice given by Kesa Electricals or not less than six months notice from Mr Reavley.
In the case of notice given by Kesa Electricals, a payment may be made in lieu of the unexpired portion of notice and Kesa Electricals can reduce the payment to take into account the receipt of a lump sum and mitigation.
In addition Mr Reavleys service contract provides that if during the 12 months immediately following a change of control of Kesa Electricals, Kesa Electricals gives Mr Reavley notice of termination of his employment other than for cause or on the grounds specified in the contract he is entitled to receive a liquidated damages payment equivalent to either ten or 12 months remuneration.
Any such payment will include ten months salary, pension supplement, medical insurance premium and company car allowance if Mr Reavley has not reached the age of 50 at the date of termination of his employment.
29 Kesa Electricals Annual Report 2003 If however, Mr Reavley has reached the age of 50 at the date of termination of his employment, he will receive 12 months salary, pension supplement, medical insurance premium and company car allowance.
Kesa Electricals is also obliged to procure that benefits payable to Mr Reavley under any applicable pension arrangements remain in service for a further ten or 12 months depending on his age as above and at the higher of the rates of salary at the change of control or a termination and to consent to his early retirement if Mr Reavley is aged 50 or over at the date of termination.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts and their appointment may be terminated at any time without compensation.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed for specified terms of three years and their appointments reviewed at the end of each three-year term.
The Combined Code The constitution and operation of the Remuneration Committee are in compliance with the principles of good governance and Code of Best Practice set out in the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Shareholding guideline It is one of the tenets of Kesas reward strategy that shareholders and directors interests be aligned.
To reinforce this, the Remuneration Committee expects that, over a period of years, Executive Directors will build a personal holding in Kesa shares.
To underpin this commitment, the Remuneration Committee expects that, while the guideline holding remains unfulfilled, Executive Directors will not dispose of any shares vesting to them under the proposed LTIP and the Demerger Award Plan save for any disposals necessary to meet tax liabilities arising from them, until they hold shares worth the following percentage of their base salary.
CEO 150% of base salary Other Executive Directors 100% of base salary Executive Committee Members 50% of base salary 12.
Directors interests The beneficial interests of the Directors, together with non-beneficial interests, in the ordinary shares of the Company are shown below.
