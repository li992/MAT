co. uk DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT 1.
Introduction All matters relating to the remuneration of the executive directors are determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The Committee, which is chaired by Mr. M. J. Allen, is appointed by the Board and is composed of the Chairman and three non-executive directors: the quorum for the valid transaction of business is three and no executive director has any right of attendance or membership.
The principal objective of the Remuneration Committee is to ensure that the executive directors and senior management are both highly motivated and fairly rewarded for their contribution to the Groups overall performance having regard to the interests of the shareholders, the overall remuneration structure within the Group and practices adopted by comparator companies.
When considering the remuneration of the directors, the Committee benchmarks the return to shareholders achieved by the company with that of a comparator group comprising representative companies from the passenger transport and support services sectors.
The Committee is required to determine and agree with the Board, and keep under review, both the policy and the detailed elements of the remuneration packages of the Chairman and the executive directors.
In formulating its policy the Committee will have due regard to the practices adopted by the comparator group.
As a result of the review of the work of the Board Committees, the remit of the Committee has been extended to cover the tier of senior management immediately below Board level.
The remit of the Committee requires it to regularly review targets and benefits under any performance related pay arrangements to ensure that they remain consistent with the long-term interests and expectations of the shareholders.
Periodically the Committee will critically evaluate the merits and effectiveness of performance related pay schemes as they affect the Board and senior management.
The Committee considers all elements comprising executive remuneration, including basic salary, performance related bonus, awards under the companys Long Term Incentive Plan, pension provision, benefits in kind and service agreement terms.
From 1 January 2000 directors bonuses have not been taken into account in computing pension benefits.
With regard to the forthcoming statutory changes relating to pension arrangements effective from 6 April 2006 work on possible options is being progressed.
In the case of the executive directors, the Committee takes independent advice from specialist consultants in developing its remuneration policy and ensuring that the overall reward package remains competitive.
It is the policy of the Committee that the benchmark for executive directors salaries should be the median of equivalent roles in comparable companies in the transport and support services sectors.
With effect from 1 January 2005, the base salaries of the executive directors were increased by 4 per cent.
The executive directors participate in a performance related bonus arrangement with bonus being paid on the attainment of specified targets established by the Committee and agreed with the director.
The Chief Executive is targeted on Group performance: the other executive directors are targeted on Group, divisional Messrs Clayton and Martin and personal performances.
The Group performance and divisional performance elements are based on the achievement of targets for earnings per share and divisional profit: the personal performance element is entirely at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and is a qualitative element reflecting individual performance against key personal objectives.
The non-executive directors do not participate in any performance related pay arrangements.
Benefits in kind are awarded as the Committee considers appropriate and currently comprise company cars or a cash allowance on a basis that is cost neutral to the company, fuel, medical insurance and telephone costs.
The non-executive directors fees are currently limited by the Articles of Association to 400,000 per annum in the aggregate and the Articles permit the directors to increase this cap annually in line with the index of wage inflation.
Within the aggregate cap the annual fee for each non-executive director is determined by the Board, the non-executive directors taking no part in the deliberations.
The fee payable to each of the non-executive directors remained unaltered throughout the period under review.
Each of the non-executive directors is appointed for a fixed term not exceeding three years.
The appointments are renewable with the agreement of both parties again for terms not exceeding three years.
Except in unusual circumstances, the maximum aggregate service of a non-executive director will be limited to nine years.
Each of the executive directors has a rolling service contract which is subject to twelve months notice.
With the exception of Mr. S. P. Lonsdale, all the executive directors have contracts dated 19 November 2001: Mr. S. P. Lonsdales contract is dated 5 September 1997.
Each of the executive directors service contracts contain an explicit provision for compensation payment on termination, except in the case of misconduct.
Where a directors service contract is terminated by the company, a severance payment will be made comprising the sum of: i the directors basic annual salary at the time of notice: and ii the performance related element estimated to be payable to the director in respect of the financial year in which notice is served: and iii an amount representing the value of benefits in kind in the audited accounts of the company for the financial year immediately preceding the date of termination.
In principle the Board will permit the executive directors to accept appointments outside the company.
However before accepting such appointments the director s involved must receive the prior written approval of the Board.
In considering such cases the Board will always satisfy itself, as far as is possible, that such appointments will not detract from the executive directors expected contribution to the company, 24 Arriva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 www.
co. uk nor that such appointment will create any conflict of interest.
Any fees earned by an executive director in such a capacity will be assigned to the company as in the case of Mr. R. J. Davies appointment as a non-executive director of Barratt Developments PLC, where the annual fee of 33,000 is paid directly to the company on a quarterly basis.

Mr. R. J. Davies has residual interests in two of the Groups discretionary share option schemes, the Executive Share Option Scheme and the Share Incentive Scheme, both of which incorporate performance target requirements which must be achieved before the exercise of the share option is permitted.
The performance targets are set by the Remuneration Committee and may be varied from time to time.
The current target requires the companys earnings per share over a period of three consecutive years prior to any exercise to exceed the Retail Prices Index by a minimum of 2 per cent p. a. i. e. 6 per cent over the three year period.
Following the introduction of The Long Term Incentive Plan in 2000, the executive directors ceased to be eligible to receive further grants of options under the discretionary share option schemes.
