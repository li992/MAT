Wm MORRISON SUPERMARKETS PLC Directors remuneration report 52 weeks ended 1 February 2004 The company is required by the Companies Act 1985 to prepare a directors remuneration report for the 52 weeks ended 1 February 2004 and to put that report to a shareholder vote.
A resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the annual general meeting of the company to be held on 20 May 2004.
The auditors are required to report on part of the directors remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information Directors remuneration The pay and benets for executive directors are determined by Sir Kenneth Morrison, Marie Melnyk and Robert Stott taking into account individual performance and market conditions.
The basic salaries of the directors are reviewed annually and when a change of responsibility occurs.
Directors are entitled to participate in the profit related pay scheme which is open to all employees after a certain period of employment with the company.
In addition, directors are entitled to certain other benets such as vehicle expenses, telephones and private health insurance consistent with the industry norm.
Details of entitlements to share options and pension arrangements are disclosed under the heading directors emoluments and pension entitlements and directors share options elsewhere in this report.
Policy on directors remuneration The policy on the board of directors remuneration for current and future financial years is to provide remuneration packages for directors bearing the following in mind: the need to attract, retain and motivate directors of the quality required: what comparable companies are paying taking into account relative performance: pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the group: the use of performance related elements for example through the adoption of share option schemes dependent upon the performance of the company to align the interests of directors and shareholders.
The board has given full consideration to Schedule A of the combined code on directors remuneration in framing its remuneration policy.
In addition to basic salary the directors receive other benets, some of which are performance related.
Those that are related to performance are entitlements under the companys profit sharing scheme applicable to all employees and entitlements to exercise any options granted under the Wm Morrison Supermarkets Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 the 1995 Scheme.
Those elements of the directors remuneration and benets that are not related to performance are health insurance, vehicle running costs, telephone expenses and pension entitlements.
It is the boards view that those elements of remuneration and benets that are profit related are in the case of each of the directors sufciently important to incentivise the director concerned to improve the performance of the company.
Share options In May 1995 the company adopted the 1995 Scheme which is available to directors and other senior employees.
The scheme offers options at the market price two weeks prior to the date of the grant which are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
The maximum exercise value of ordinary shares subject to options held by an individual must not exceed the greater of four times earnings and 100,000.
The exercise of options under the scheme is subject to performance criteria broadly requiring an increase in group operating profits of at least 20% between the year prior to the date of grant and its third or any succeeding anniversary.
The 1995 scheme replaced the Senior Executive Share Option Scheme 1985.
The 1985 scheme has now expired although there are still live options held under that scheme.
Options granted under the 1985 scheme were not subject to the achievement of performance criteria but were subject to a maximum individual limit of four times basic salary.
14 Wm MORRISON SUPERMARKETS PLC Directors remuneration report continued The Wm Morrison Supermarkets plc Sharesave Scheme 2000 was approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting held on 18 May 2000.
Options are offered at a discount of 20% to the mid-market closing price on the day prior to the offer and are exercisable for a period of 6 months commencing 5 years after the savings contract commencement date.
All employees including directors are eligible to participate once they have met the necessary service requirements.
In common with similar schemes, the exercise of options under this scheme is not subject to any performance conditions.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption in UITF 17: Employee Share Schemes in accounting for the Sharesave Scheme.
It is presently the boards policy to leave the performance conditions relating to the exercise of options granted under the 1995 Scheme unchanged for the grant of options in the current and subsequent financial years.
The performance conditions are, in the boards view, appropriate to ensure that options may only be exercised where there is consistent underlying improvement in the financial position of the company judged by reference to operating profit.
Pension arrangements Each director is entitled to a pension equal to 2 3rds of pensionable pay providing he or she has served on the main board of the company for at least 20 years at normal retirement date which in each case is on his or her 62nd birthday.
For periods of less than 20 years pension entitlement is accrued at the rate of 1 360th of pensionable pay for each month of service as a director.
This is in addition to any entitlement built up prior to being appointed to the board up to a maximum of 2 3rds pensionable salary at age 62.
Pensionable pay is the directors annual salary as at 6th April each year plus the amount of profit related pay earned in the tax year just ended.
The accrued pension is that which would be paid annually on retirement at 62, based on service to 1 February 2004.
In the case of members joining the pension scheme prior to 1 June 1989 the pension payable is based on final pensionable pay calculated as the average of the highest 3 years pensionable pay in the directors last 10 years of employment.
For members joining the scheme after 31 May 1989 final pensionable pay is the lower of the average of the highest 3 years pensionable pay in the directors last 10 years of employment and the maximum earnings limit which in 2003 04 is 99,000.
M M Melnyk, M Ackroyd, D R Hutchinson and R A Owen joined the scheme prior to 1 June 1989.
M Gunter and R W Stott became members subsequent to that date.
K D Morrison is in receipt of a pension from the scheme in addition to his total emoluments shown above.
In the event of death in service a lump sum death benefit equal to three times the directors pensionable pay at the date of death is payable.
In addition a spouses pension equal to one quarter of the pensionable pay at the date of death will be paid.
If a former director in receipt of a pension dies before the 5th anniversary of his retirement a lump sum equal to the payments he would have received over that period will be paid.
If a former director who dies is survived by a spouse that spouse will continue to receive a pension equal to one half of the pension payable at the time of death.
The pension arrangements for the directors ensure that benets provided are consistent with those provided by other companies in the market place.
The expected cost of providing retirement benets to the directors is assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualied actuaries.
The pension arrangements include life assurance cover whilst in employment, an entitlement to a pension in the event of ill health or disability and a pension for the spouse and any dependant children on death.
profit related pay is included in the denition of pensionable pay for all members of the companys pension scheme.
This element of the directors remuneration is pensionable to ensure they receive the same benets as other members of the scheme.
No contributions were paid or are payable by any directors under the terms of the scheme.
There are no early retirement rights.
Post retirement pensions increase in line with the annual increase in the retail price index or by 5% per annum compound, whichever is the lower.
