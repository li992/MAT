Aegis Annual Report & Accounts 2004 Remuneration report The Remuneration Report is presented to shareholders by the Board and sets out the remuneration policies operated by the Company and details the remuneration of each director.
The Remuneration Report will be put to the Annual General Meeting for approval by the shareholders.
This vote is advisory only.
The Board has an established Remuneration Committee, the members of which are disclosed on page 31.
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP NBSC has been appointed by the Remuneration Committee to provide advice on directors remuneration and the Companys share incentive schemes.
NBSC provides no other services to, and has no other connection with, the Company.
Remuneration policy In determining the remuneration packages of the executive directors, the Committee has regard to two fundamental principles: the importance of attracting, motivating and retaining management of the highest calibre: and linking reward to the Groups performance.
The Committee has applied, and continues to apply, these principles to develop remuneration packages which: provide a competitive base salary designed to attract and retain executive directors of the highest calibre and to reflect their role and experience: provide incentive arrangements which are subject to challenging performance targets, reflect the Companys objectives and recognise the importance of providing sustained motivation of management to focus on annual, as well as longerterm, performance: and align the interests of the executive directors with those of shareholders.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Committees approach is that a substantial proportion of the overall remuneration package should be linked to performance, through participation in short-term and long-term incentive schemes.
The Committee determines remuneration packages with regard to the prevailing pay and benefits conditions across the Groups markets.
Remuneration package of executive directors The main components are: Base salary and benefits Base salary and benefits are determined on an annual basis by the Committee after a review taking into account the individuals performance, market trends and the performance of the Group as a whole and, where relevant, the performance of the business for which the executive is responsible.
For guidance, the Committee has regard to available research and published remuneration information on companies within the same industry and markets in the countries in which the executives are based.
Base salaries prevailing at the date of this report are: Robert Lerwill 600,000, Jeremy Hicks 330,000, Adrian Chedore 293,774 and David Verklin 384,096.
A summary of the benefits payable to executive directors is given on page 38.
Bonus schemes All of the executive directors participate in the Groups Annual Cash Bonus Scheme based upon achievement of individual objectives and financial targets profit before tax and management charges linked to Group and, in the case of directors with operational responsibilities, regional performance.
This may result in the payment of cash bonuses of up to 25% of base salary for on-target financial performance, with the opportunity to earn higher bonuses for exceptional performance up to 75% of base salary 100% for the Chief Executive Officer.
Additionally, the executive directors with operational responsibilities Adrian Chedore and David Verklin participate in a separate deferred annual cash bonus scheme based on achievement of a demanding year on year profit growth of the businesses for which they are responsible.
This additional plan has been in operation in order to provide competitive total cash remuneration using, as a benchmark, other media businesses and to reflect their critical contribution to the business.
This additional bonus is potentially worth up to 200% of base salary.
The payment of half of any such bonus is deferred for one year.
This deferred bonus will normally be forfeited in the event that the director leaves the Group.
34 Remuneration report continued Share-based incentives At the 2003 Annual General Meeting shareholders approved the adoption of a new 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme and a new 2003 Performance Share Plan.
These schemes replaced all of the previous share-based incentive schemes and were designed to reflect changes in the guidelines issued by institutional shareholders and developments in market practice.
i 2003 Executive Share Option Scheme In any financial year, an executive can receive share options worth no more than three times basic salary in normal circumstances.
As part of his agreement on becoming Chief Executive Officer, Robert Lerwill was granted options over 1.5 million shares on 9 March 2005 at an exercise price of 106.5p, equating to 2.66 times salary.
The exercise of options is based upon the Companys earnings per share EPS growth relative to inflation RPI, and the following performance conditions apply: Average annual EPS growth in excess of RPI Proportion of option grants exercisable 3% Up to 0.5 x salary 3% to 7% 0.5 to 1 x salary pro rata, on a straight-line basis 7% to 12% 1 to 2 x salary pro rata, on a straight-line basis 12% to 17% 2 to 3 x salary pro rata, on a straight-line basis Following a review by the Remuneration Committee, the EPS growth targets have been increased as detailed above for grants made in 2005 in recognition of the outlook for the business, to ensure that performance conditions remain appropriately stretching.
EPS growth targets for awards made in 2003 and 2004 are detailed on page 40.
These EPS performance conditions are tested after three financial years beginning with the year in which options are granted.
For grants made after 31 December 2004 there is no provision for retesting.
To the extent that the performance conditions are not satisfied, the options lapse.
ii 2003 Performance Share Plan In any financial year, an executive can receive a conditional award of shares worth no more than two times basic salary in normal circumstances.
On 9 March 2005 Robert Lerwill was granted a conditional award of 1 million shares worth on the date of award 1,065,000, equating to 1.77 times salary.
The extent to which awards vest is determined partly by reference to the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR performance relative to a group of similar businesses and partly by reference to the Companys EPS growth relative to RPI.
The following TSR targets apply: TSR performance relative to peer group Proportion of award vesting Median or below nil 1st or 2nd 50% For intermediate performance Nil to 50% pro rata on a straight line basis The following companies will be included in the peer group for calculation of TSR performance: Dentsu Inc. Publicis Groupe S. A. Havas SA Reed Elsevier plc The Interpublic Group of Companies Inc Taylor Nelson Sofres plc IPSOS S. A. Viacom Inc.
The News Corporation Limited VNU N. V. Omnicom Group Inc WPP Group plc Pearson plc The following EPS performance conditions apply: Average annual EPS growth in excess of RPI Proportion of award vesting 3% or less nil 15% 50% 3% to 15% nil to 50% pro rata, on a straight-line basis These TSR and EPS performance conditions are tested after three financial years beginning with the year in which awards are made.
There is no provision for retesting.
To the extent that the performance conditions are not satisfied, the awards lapse.
35 Aegis Annual Report & Accounts 2004 Remuneration report continued The assessment of these performance conditions will be carried out by NBSC, in its capacity as adviser to the Committee.
In relation to EPS measurement, the Remuneration Committee will ensure that a consistent basis of measurement is used during the transition to International Financial Reporting Standards.
The Committee believes that using both EPS growth and TSR for awards under the Performance Share Plan provides a balanced incentive between assessing the Companys relative returns to shareholders and its underlying financial performance.
For share options, the sole use of EPS as a performance condition is considered an appropriate underpinning performance condition to the requirement inherent in an option to grow the share price.
The use of EPS for both options and as part of the performance share award is considered appropriate after recognising the difference between the two incentives and the different level at which the EPS ranges are targeted.
Overall, the blend between EPS and TSR performance conditions and the two different types of plan are considered to provide a well-rounded incentive for the Companys executives.
No further awards will be made under the previous closed schemes, although awards granted in the past will continue to be exercisable in accordance with the rules of each respective scheme.
The closed schemes are the 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme, the 1998 Management Incentive Scheme and the Leveraged Investment Plan.
Details of the performance conditions of these are given on pages 40 and 41.
Details of all share incentive awards outstanding for each executive director serving during 2004 are set out on pages 39 to 41.
Pensions All UK executive directors participate in Inland Revenue approved defined contribution pension schemes.
Douglas Flynn also made his own unapproved pension arrangements funded by additional salary payments.
Pensionable salary is limited to base salary excluding all bonuses and other benefits.
Non-UK executive directors have arrangements in line with market conditions and statutory obligations operating in their own countries.
Robert Lerwills total annual employer contributions are 250,000.
Service contracts Details of the service contracts of those who served as executive directors during the year and Robert Lerwill, the new Chief Executive Officer, are set out below.
All directors have rolling service contracts which expire at normal retirement age unless terminated beforehand in accordance with the terms of the individual contract.
Name Contract date Notice period from Company Notice period from director Robert Lerwill 22.02.05 12 months 6 months Adrian Chedore 21.02.03 12 months 6 months Jeremy Hicks 09.02.01 12 months 6 months David Verklin 01.07.98 6 months 6 months Notes: Robert Lerwills contract contains an initial notice period of 18 months, rolling down to 12 months on a monthly basis over the six-month period following 7 February 2005.
This increased initial notice period was agreed as part of Robert Lerwill agreeing to become Chief Executive Officer.
Adrian Chedore has agreed, with effect from 1 April 2005, to drop the additional 12-month change of control notice period which he previously had in his contract.
Jeremy Hicks has agreed to drop the additional 12-month change of control notice period which he previously had in his contract on a month by month basis over a 12-month period commencing on 1 January 2005, such that by 31 December 2005 his notice period from the Company will be 12 months.
David Verklin has agreed, with effect from 1 April 2005, to drop the additional 6-month change of control notice period which he previously had in his contract.
However, David Verklin still retains a contractual entitlement on termination of an amount equal to 12 months salary and benefits in addition to any payments in respect of his normal 6-month notice period.
The Remuneration Committee believes that this provision is appropriate in this instance given the need to retain a key senior operational executive in the context of highly competitive local market conditions.
Unless there are exceptional circumstances, it is the Companys policy that under any new service contracts, notice periods to be given by the Company will not exceed 12 months whether or not a change of control of the Company occurs.
In addition, new contracts will not normally include liquidated damages clauses and any termination payments will be calculated on normal contractual principles taking into account a directors duty to mitigate loss.
36 Remuneration report continued Former director Name Contract date Notice period from Company Notice period from director Doug Flynn 22.10.99 24 months 6 months resigned 31.03.05 In addition to payments in respect of notice periods, Doug Flynn had a contractual entitlement on termination to an amount equal to two times any bonus received in the previous 12 months.
In the event of a change of control, he was entitled, within 6 months, to give notice to terminate his employment and receive a payment equal to 24 months salary and benefits plus an amount equal to any bonus received in the previous 12 months.
Following his resignation Doug Flynn received no contractual compensation.
Non-executive directors Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial term of three years with a one-month notice period.
Renewal of appointments for a further term of three years is not automatic.
The fees of the non-executive directors are determined at a Board meeting at which the non-executive directors do not vote.
Fees are disclosed on page 38.
Non-executive directors have letters of engagement rather than service contracts and do not receive benefits or pension contributions and do not participate in any Group incentive scheme.

For executive directors, between 57% and 72% of the maximum potential under the annual cash bonus scheme was earned in respect of 2004.
For the two executive directors whose deferred annual bonus is determined purely by the level of year on year growth in the financial performance of their respective businesses, bonus earned in respect of 2004 was on the basis of having grown year on year profits by at least 15%.
c Fees in respect of Charles Strauss were paid to Unilever for the period up to 13 May 2004 when he retired from Unilever.
Since that time fees have been paid direct to him.
d Since July 2004 Leslie Van fide Walle has a standing instruction through the Companys brokers to use his fees received monthly net of taxes to purchase shares in the Company.
Prior to that date his fees were paid to Shell.
At 31 December 2004 there were four directors 2003: four who had benefits accruing under money purchase pension schemes.
Figures shown for pensions are the contributions paid by the Company to both approved and unapproved retirement benefits schemes.
It is the Boards policy that executive directors with external non-executive positions are allowed to retain any fees from such positions.
However, before an executive director can accept an external non-executive position permission must be sought from the Chairman who will take into consideration the time commitment involved.
As at the date of this report Robert Lerwill and Jeremy Hicks had external non-executive directorships as follows: Director Company Annual Fees Robert Lerwill British American Tobacco 60,000 Robert Lerwill Synergy Healthcare 23,000 Jeremy Hicks First Choice Holidays 38,000 None of the directors was materially or beneficially interested in any contract of significance with the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings during or at the end of the financial year ended 31 December 2004.

41 Aegis Annual Report & Accounts 2004 Remuneration report continued Unaudited performance graph The following graph illustrates the Companys TSR between 31 December 1999 and 31 December 2004 relative to the FTSE Media & Entertainment Index, in accordance with paragraph 4 of the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
Aegis Group plc is a member of the FTSE Media & Entertainment Index and the Remuneration Committee considers that a comparison of the Companys TSR relative to similar businesses is more appropriate than a comparison with a general FTSE Index, in order to reduce the impact of general stock market trends.
