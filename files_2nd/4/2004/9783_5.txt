The Plan is a dened contribution arrangement, where employees may choose to contribute between 3-15% of their salary.
Member contributions of 3-6% are matched by Company contributions of 6-12%.
The employee is free to choose from a range of investment vehicles, where the total contribution will be invested.

As a result, they also receive a pension-related salary supplement of 10% of the difference between the pension earnings cap and their base salary.
com a Pension Benets continued 2 The pension for Roger Holmes is based on a uniform accrual of two-thirds of the pension earnings cap less the pension which he has accrued from membership of previous employers pension schemes.
The pension for Justin King is based on his deferred pension at his date of retirement of 28 March 2004.
3 In accordance with the Listings Rules, the additional pension earned in the year in excess of ination and the transfer value relates only to the period since Maurice Helfgotts appointment to the Board.
All other gures relate to the 12-month period.
4 The pension shown for David Norgrove is before commutation and is inclusive of an augmentation of one additional year of service as part of his termination package which is shown in the emoluments table.
It excludes his AVC pension.
He chose not to receive his termination payment as shown in the emoluments table in cash, but requested the Company to pay an identical sum into the Pension Scheme in order to enhance his pension.
The accrued entitlement represents the deferred pension to which the director would have been entitled had they left the Company on 29 March 2003 and 3 April 2004 respectively.
Under the Listings Rules, the additional pension earned relates to the increase in the deferred pension during the year gross and net of ination respectively.
The transfer value of the deferred pension calculated as at 3 April 2004 is based on factors supplied by the actuary of the relevant Company pension scheme in accordance with actuarial guidance note GN11.
The equivalent transfer value calculated as at 29 March 2003 is on the assumption that the director had left service at that date.
Ination has been assumed to be equivalent to the actual rate of price ination which was 2.8% for the year to 30 September 2003.
The measurement date accords with the Listing Rules.
The transfer values are the lump sums which could have been paid to another pension scheme for the benefit of the director.
It is not possible for a transfer value to be paid directly to the director personally.
Luc Vandevelde and Vittorio Radice do not participate in the Company Pension Scheme.

2 The pension scheme entitlement for Clinton Silver is supplemented by an additional, unfunded pension paid by the Company.
