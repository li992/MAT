Annual Report & Accounts 2004 Directors Remuneration Report This Report is prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985.
As the Board of Directors is comprised solely of non-executive Directors, it is exempt under the Listing Rules from appointing a Remuneration Committee.
The determination of Directors fees is a matter dealt with by the whole Board.
It is the Companys policy to determine the level of Directors fees having regard to the level of fees payable to nonexecutive Directors in the industry generally, the role that individual Directors fulfill in respect of Board and Committee responsibilities and the time committed to the Companys affairs.
Following a review in 2003 of Directors fees the basic annual fee paid to the Chairman and each Director were increased in line with the Companys peer group to 23,000 and 15,500 respectively from 1 October 2003.
The annual aggregate limit on fees payable to the Board of Directors under the Companys Articles of Association was increased on 15 December 2003 to 150,000.
No element of the Directors remuneration is performance related, no Director past or present has any entitlement to pensions and, the Company has not awarded any share options or long-term performance incentives to any of the Directors.
The Directors interests in contractual arrangements with the Company are as shown on page 25 of the financial statements.
Subject to these exceptions, no other Directors were interested in contracts with the Company during the period or subsequently.
None of the Directors have a service contract with the Company.
The Board requires that Directors shall not remain in office for longer than three years without submitting themselves for re-election.
