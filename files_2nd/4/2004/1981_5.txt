The Davis Service Group Plc 17 Report and accounts 2004 Report on directors remuneration The report on directors remuneration contains the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 the auditable part which comprises that set out in the tables and accompanying notes on pages 18 to 20 and has been prepared in accordance with schedule B of the Combined Code.
The remuneration committee The remuneration and benets of the executive directors of the company are determined by the remuneration committee whose members are non-executive directors: Christopher Kemball Chairman, Neil Benson, John Burns and Philip Rogerson.
The Chief Executive is invited to attend meetings but may not take part in any discussion on matters concerning himself.
The terms of reference of the committee are to determine the companys policy on executive directors remuneration throughout the group and to consider and approve the individual salaries and other terms of the remuneration packages for the executive directors.
Remuneration policy The committees policy is to pay competitive salaries having regard to the directors experience, the size and complexity of the job and any material special factors which may arise from time to time.
During the year, the committee appointed external consultants, New Bridge Street Consultants, and started a review of the groups policies, the structure of its reward packages and their relative weightings in order to align them more closely to individual and corporate performance.
Although the review has been substantially completed, the committee decided to delay its implementation until after the appointment of the new Chief Executive.
As a result of this decision, the Long Term Incentive Plan for the executive directors and a small group of senior management, under which no awards were made in 2003 or 2004, has been suspended for 2005.
The committee expects to complete its work and, after appropriate consultation, to propose the new executive remuneration plan to shareholders at the annual general meeting in 2006 which, if approved, will be backdated to the beginning of that year.
Remuneration packages In the temporary absence of a longer term benets element, the remuneration package for group executive directors comprises short-term elements only.
Short-term benets comprise annual salary, annual performance related cash bonuses, provision of a company car, life assurance and medical expenses insurance.
Short-term performance bonuses The maximum bonus, based on achievement of targeted levels of budget and payable in cash, is 25% of base salary.
This is extendable to 40% if profits in excess of budget are achieved.
Under these arrangements the Chief Executive and the Finance Director received non-pensionable bonuses of 20% and 38% respectively.
Paul Smeeth, who has direct divisional responsibilities, is incentivised on the basis of achievement of targeted divisional profit.
In respect of 2004 he did not receive a performance bonus.
In addition, with effect from 2003 the Chief Executive and Finance Director were incentivised based on performance improvements in the Sophus Berendsen division.
The incentive scheme, which was self-nancing and was based on achieving targeted operating margins and certain additional development criteria for the division, provided for a cash bonus of not more than the annual salary of the participants.
Whilst the criteria were met at the divisional level in 2003, it was decided, in light of the shortfall in group earnings for that year, that the bonuses of the Chief Executive and Finance Director should not vest that year.
Given that the improved performance was sustained during 2004, the committee decided that non-pensionable bonuses equal to 2004 annual salaries should now vest and accordingly approved payment of them during the year.
No further payments will be made under this arrangement.
Executive directors salaries Salaries for executive directors were reviewed in line with ination and the following salaries have been effective from 1st January 2005: John Ivey 463,000: Roger Dye 273,000 and Paul Smeeth 228,000.
With effect from 1st May 2005, in his new role as Chief Executive, Roger Dye will receive a salary of 375,000.
Other share option schemes Discretionary grants of share options are the principal form of long-term incentive for other managers throughout the group.
The share option scheme is controlled by the remuneration committee, which considers it to be an important component in the overall executive remuneration package.
Options are granted on a phased basis under the rules of the Davis 1998 Share Option Scheme which, amongst other conditions, incorporates rules concerning performance attaching to the right to exercise the options that have been granted.
These performance rules require the groups normalised earnings per share growth over a three year period to exceed the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index by an average of at least 3% per annum.
The exercise prices of options granted are not set at a discount to the market value of the companys shares at date of grant.
All employees, including executive directors, are eligible to participate in the groups sharesave scheme.
Retirement benets Executive directors other than Roger Dye are members of the groups main contributory pension scheme which provides for members contributions at the rate of 5% of pensionable salary.
Subject to Inland Revenue limits, they are eligible for a pension of up to two-thirds of pensionable salary at normal retirement age of 60.
The pension scheme also provides for payments on death.
Employers contributions are being paid to the pension scheme in respect of the companys executive directors and other senior executives within the group, at an appropriate rate of pensionable salary.
Further details of the pension scheme are set out in note 8 on page 34.
Roger Dye has a personal pension arrangement to which the company made payments equivalent to 30% of salary.
Life assurance cover of four times salary and permanent health insurance up to 75% of salary are also provided.
