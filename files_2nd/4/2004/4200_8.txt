Front [91299] 3 10 05 12:45 PM Page 27 Report on the directors remuneration The directors remuneration is determined by the remuneration committee.
Its members are given on page 35.
The parts of this report which are subject to audit by  LLP are indicated with an asterisk.
Directors remuneration policy The remuneration of executive directors and senior executives is determined by the remuneration committee.
The key objectives of Crodas executive remuneration policy are to ensure that individual rewards and incentives are comparable with those provided by similar companies having regard to the Groups turnover, business sector and market worth and the need for skills to manage international businesses to enable the Group to attract and retain high calibre people to give full consideration to the relevant principles on directors remuneration set out in the 2003 FRC Combined Code to ensure a balance between fixed and performance related remuneration, the latter being related to objective measurement of the financial performance of the Company.
The committee believes that the interests of shareholders and directors are more closely aligned to cash profitability and the control of working capital of the Group, rather than being based on performance relative to peer groups where external factors beyond the control of the directors can have a disproportionate influence on bonus payment, both favourable and adverse.
Basic salary and benefits The basic salary and benefits of the executive directors are set in relation to those paid by companies comprising the FTSE mid 250 in view of the difficulty in establishing a list of companies who are true comparators with the Companys operations.
In 2004 we used salary information as published by Income Data Services.
During the course of 2005, in addition to its normal review procedures, the committee intends to commission independent consultants to undertake a general review of salary, benefits and contractual terms of the executive directors and senior executives to ensure that the benchmarking utilised by the committee is still relevant.
Performance-related bonus schemes The Company operates bonus schemes for its directors and senior executives.
Bonus payments are not pensionable.
In respect of 2004, the bonus scheme for executive directors was related to target income incorporating an element for the control of working capital and with bonuses payable on a graduated scale from 0.5% of salary for each 1% that performance percentage exceeds 90% of target income, rising to 3% of salary for each 1% of performance percentage above 112.5% of target income.
Target income is defined as the Group EBITDA for continuing operations before exceptional items less a notional interest charge on working capital employed for the previous year.
The maximum amount of bonus payable is 100% of salary with the element of any bonus in excess of 50% of salary being deferred until 31 December 2005, and any bonus up to 50% of salary paid by 31 March 2005.
Bonuses earned by each director in respect of 2004 are included in the table of directors remuneration on page 29 and represent 24.3% of basic salary.
For 2005 a similar bonus scheme will apply.
Share options Senior Executive Share Option Schemes are in place.
Options which may be exercised between three and ten years from the date of issue are granted to executive directors and senior executives both in the UK and overseas.
The share options are based on market prices of the Companys ordinary shares at the time of grant.
The aim of the option schemes is to align closely the interests of the executive directors and senior executives of the Company with those of its shareholders.
To this end the options granted under the option schemes, which were extended by a resolution passed at the Companys 1995 AGM, will be subject to satisfaction of performance conditions before they can be exercised.
Options granted between 1996 and 1999 cannot be exercised for a minimum period of three years after the date of grant, but are then exercisable at any time during the following seven years provided the Companys basic earnings per share before exceptional items have increased by more than 2% plus the rate of UK inflation per annum in any period of three consecutive years following the date of grant.
Report on the directors remuneration 27 1.
Front [91299] 3 10 05 12:45 PM Page 28 Report on the directors remuneration The rules of the Senior Executive Share Option Schemes adopted with effect from 1 January 2000 enable options to be awarded annually in the absence of special circumstances on a graduated scale awarding options to a value of one years salary for the Group Chief Executive, 80% of salary for other executive directors and decreasing percentages for other senior employees.
Basic earnings per share before exceptional items must grow at RPI plus 7% per annum for 100% of the options allocated to be exercisable.
The performance period commences at the date of grant and lasts for a minimum of three years and a maximum of ten years until an average growth rate of at least RPI plus 3% per annum over the whole period has been achieved.
With earnings per share growth at RPI plus 5% per annum 75% of the options are exercisable and at RPI plus 3% per annum 50% of the options are exercisable.
Details of options granted to directors are shown in the table on page 31.
With the introduction of a new accounting standard covering share based payments and its consequent impact on Group profits, no options were granted in 2004 and it has been decided that no options will be granted under the Senior Executive Share Option Schemes in 2005 or future years.
When new financial reporting standards are introduced which impact on the calculation of earnings per share, base year earnings per share is correspondingly adjusted to ensure that performance criteria are applied on a consistent basis.
It is the Companys current intention to satisfy the exercise of share options primarily from shares held in the Employee Share Ownership Trust and shares purchased in the market and not by the issue of new shares.
Details of shares held for this purpose are given in note 27 on page 65.
The Company intends to introduce new incentive schemes, details of which are set out in the circular accompanying the notice of the 2005 AGM.
Pension and other benefits Pensions, company cars, medical insurance, annual leave and other benefits are in line with those provided to executive directors in similar businesses.
Benefits in kind are not pensionable.
Croda has a number of different pension plans in countries in which it operates.
Pension entitlements for Crodas executives are tailored to local market practice, the length of service and age of the participants.
The principal pension plans in the UK are defined benefit schemes which provide a pension based on a proportion of final salary.
Pension provision for the executive directors will, during the course of 2005, be reviewed in the light of the change in regulation arising from the Finance Act 2004 to be introduced in April 2006.
The Company does not envisage the cost to the Company being increased as a result of such review.
Service contracts and external appointments M Humphrey and B M Richmond have service agreements with the Company which are terminable on either side on six months notice.
In addition, if the service agreements are terminated by the Company without just cause, a termination payment equivalent to eighteen months remuneration is payable by the Company.
The Chairman and non-executive directors have letters of appointment for a fixed term as shown below, subject to earlier termination by either party on written notice.
They have no entitlement to contractual termination payments.

It is normal practice for executive directors to retain fees provided for non-executive appointments.
Throughout 2004 B M Richmond was a non-executive director of Carclo Plc for which she received fees of 20,000 2003: 19,500.
Apart from service agreements and share schemes, no director has had any material interest in any contract with the Company or its subsidiaries requiring disclosure under the Companies Act 1985.

The Chairmans and non-executive directors fees are determined on the basis of current fee levels in similar businesses.
Fees are reviewed by the Board every two years.

Fees for the non-executive directors were increased to 30,000 with effect from 1 January 2005 following a review of current practice.

Front [91299] 3 10 05 12:45 PM Page 30 Report on the directors remuneration Pension rights Pension benefits of M Humphrey are funded under the Croda International Supplemental Scheme CISS.
If he remains a contributory member of the CISS, he will be entitled on retirement at age 60 to a pension equal to two-thirds of his final annual pensionable remuneration.
Because of his length of service with the Group he is not subject to limitation on the level of final remuneration known as the earnings cap.
If directors retire before age 60 a reduction is applied to the accrued pension unless retiring at the Companys request.
In the event of death a pension equal to two-thirds of the directors pension would become payable to the surviving spouse.
Pensions in payment are guaranteed to increase in line with the rate of inflation up to a maximum of 10% per annum.
During the year, B M Richmond was paid 52,476 2003: 50,022 in addition to her basic salary to enable her to make independent provision for her retirement.
B M Richmond is also entitled to death in service benefits from the CISS up to the Inland Revenue earnings cap with the balance being administered by the Company, but receives no other benefits from that fund.

3 The figure represents the difference between the total accrued pension at 31 December 2004 and the corresponding pension one year earlier after an adjustment to exclude inflation was provided as required under paragraph 12.43A c ix a of the Listing Rules.
4 Transfer values are quoted on the basis recommended by the scheme actuary for valuation of accrued benefits if the member had transferred benefits to another approved scheme on the relevant date.
The increase in transfer value between 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2004 takes account of changes in market conditions over the period.
5 The figure represents the difference between transfer values of the accrued benefits at 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2003, less contributions paid by M Humphrey.
6 This figure represents the transfer values of the increase in accrued benefits over the period, adjusted for inflation, less contributions paid by M Humphrey.
The Company has contributed to the CISS at the rate of 13.3% of salary with effect from 1 April 2004.
This is the average cost of pension accrual based on the demographic profile in the CISS as certified by the actuary, after allowing for members contributions.
In addition, the Company contributes 70,000 per month towards elimination of an existing scheme deficit.
On an individual basis, the cost to the Company of providing benefits for M Humphrey is estimated at 20% of salary.
This allows for M Humphreys personal contributions, which were increased from 4% to 6% with effect from 1 April 2004.
Members of the CISS have the option to pay voluntary contributions.
Neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in this table.
