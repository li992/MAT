The middle market quotation on the date of disposal was 552p per share.
20,200 of these options were linked to a corresponding number of options.
Accordingly, the exercise of these options automatically caused the 20,200 counterpart options to lapse.
The shares were sold on the day of exercise at a price of 548.3p per share, realising a gain of 168.3p per share on the 60,600 options and 226.3p per share on the 20,200 options.
No options were granted to directors under the 1984 Share Option Scheme during the year.
These options are linked to corresponding grants of options.
Accordingly the exercise of one linked option over a number of shares automatically causes its counterpart to lapse in respect of the same number of shares: therefore these options do not increase the total number of shares under option.
The totals in the table reflect the number of shares under option.
All new grants of options are subject to a performance target which has been approved by the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds.
The middle market quotation for the ordinary 25p shares of the company at the close of business on 31 March 2004 was 652.5p.

Directors pension benefits for the year ended 31 March 2004 Three executive directors, Nicholas Ritblat, Robert Bowden and Graham Roberts, earned pension benefits in the scheme during the year.
Robert Bowdens and Graham Roberts benefits from the tax approved scheme are restricted by the earnings cap and they are, therefore, entitled to benefit from the companys Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme FURBS.
The benefits provided by the FURBS are defined lump sums.
Non-executive directors do not participate in any company-sponsored pension arrangement.
In consequence of the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, company accounts are subject to two sets of disclosure requirements in relation to directors pensions rather than one.
The extended Companies Act 1985 requirements have to be observed in addition to, not in place of, the current UK Listing Authority requirements.
The requirements differ slightly and these Regulations are expected to remain in force for the time being.
The three tables shown opposite provide the details of the directors pensions necessary to satisfy the two sets of requirements.
