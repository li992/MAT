London Merchant Securities plc 28 Remuneration Report of the Board of Directors Remuneration Committee The members of the Remuneration Committee are: Mr P J Grant Chairman Mr G C Greene Mrs J fide Moller Mr D Newell The Secretary of the Committee is Mr S C Mitchley.
The Committee considered advice from Clifford Chance, who also provided other legal services to the Company during the year.
The Committee also considered advice from the Hon R A Rayne and Mr M A Pexton, but they were not involved in discussions about their own remuneration.
Policy on directors remuneration The Companys policy is to provide an overall remuneration package which will attract, retain and incentivise directors of the right calibre.
Non-executive directors receive a fee and necessarily incurred expenses.
They do not participate in any bonus, incentive or pension arrangements.
Their remuneration is established by the Board by reference to market rates.
The constituent elements of the remuneration package for each executive director are: base salary annual performance-related bonus long-term incentives pension benefits Basic salary In recommending basic salaries for executive directors the Remuneration Committee takes into account information from an independent source on market rates in comparable companies.
Annual bonus Each executive director is eligible for an annual bonus based on the performance of the individual and of the aspects of the business for which they are responsible.
During the year ended 31st March 2004, the Chief Executive was eligible for a bonus of up to 100% and other directors could receive a bonus of up to 50% of basic salary.
For the year to 31st March 2005 it is proposed to maintain the maximum for the Chief Executive at 100% of basic salary and to increase the maximum payable to other directors to 70% of basic salary.
Long-term incentives All executive directors participate in the Executive Share Option Scheme, which is designed to increase the alignment of their interests with those of other shareholders.
The Companys policy is to make an annual grant of options up to a maximum value of one times basic salary, in order to provide a continuing incentive.
The Remuneration Committee will take individual performance into account in recommending the level of any grant of options.
The performance condition for exercise of the options granted from September 2002 onwards is that in the first three year period after grant of the options shareholders funds must have increased by a percentage greater than the increase in the Retail Price Index plus 9%.
For future grants of options it is proposed to adopt a performance condition which more closely aligns the interests of executives with returns to shareholders.
The proposed new condition allows for exercise of options only if the Total Shareholder Return TSR over the first three year period after grant exceeds the arithmetic average of the TSR for the FTSE 250 and the TSR for the FTSE Real Estate index for the same period.
The Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the vesting of an option is justified by the underlying performance of the Group during the measurement period.
A Long Term Incentive Plan was established for Mr M A Pexton as part of the terms of his recruitment to the Company in April 2002, prior to his appointment as an executive director in October 2002.
Under the Plan he has cash-settled options with the same performance conditions as those governing the Executive Share Option Scheme.
It is not intended to make further grants to him under this Plan.
The Chief Executive, Mr R A Rayne, participates in the Carried Interest Plan, which applies to certain executives who have responsibility for investments made by the venture capital division, and was approved by shareholders in 2001.
The Plan is intended to correspond to the incentive arrangements applicable in the venture capital industry.
Mr Rayne is entitled to 7% of the pre-tax net capital gains realised on the cost of direct investments i. e. excluding investment in funds after a preferred return to LMS of 6.5%.
The percentage of realised capital gains which may be allocated to participants in aggregate may not exceed 20%, after the return of capital.
No payment was made to Mr Rayne under the Plan in the year ending 31st March 2004.
Executive directors, other than Mr Rayne, are eligible to participate with staff in the Companys Share Incentive Plan, which allows employees to be granted free shares and to purchase shares which are matched equally by shares bought by the Company.
They are also eligible to participate alongside other employees in the Companys Sharesave Scheme, established under the Save As You Earn legislation.
Under the Scheme employees make regular payments into a savings account which, after a predetermined period, can be used to purchase shares at a price set at the start of the savings period.
London Merchant Securities plc 29 Notice periods Executive directors contracts are rolling contracts terminable with one years notice.
The appointment periods for non-executives are three years or until they are due for retirement by rotation, whichever is the earlier.
Executive directors contracts contain no specific provision for payments on termination of employment, other than following a change of control, where there is provision for payment of 95% of annual salary and benefits.
In determining the amount of any termination payment the Board will take into account the duty of the executive to mitigate loss.
