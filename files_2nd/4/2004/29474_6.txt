REMUNERATION REPORT The Directors have pleasure in presenting their Remuneration Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2004, in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
The Report will be put to shareholders for approval at the forthcoming AGM.
It also contains additional information required by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and by the new Combined Code referred to in the Corporate Governance Report on page 27.
The sections marked with an asterisk have been audited by KPMG Audit Plc.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee, on behalf of the Board, determines the remuneration packages of the Chairman and executive Directors of the Company.
The Committee also monitors remuneration of the Executive Committee and supervises the operation of the executive long term incentive schemes.
The Committee comprises The Viscount Weir as Chairman, Derek Netherton, Charles Bailey and Michael Sorkin, all of whom are independent non-executive Directors.
The membership and terms of reference of the Committee are reviewed at least annually and the terms of reference are available on request.
Details of the number of meetings of the Committee during the year can be found in the Corporate Governance Report on page 31.
The Company Secretary, Hugh Gladman, acts as Secretary to the Committee, providing advice on legal and regulatory issues and the design and operation of the long term incentive schemes.
At the Committees request, Committee meetings are also attended by other executives, in particular Mark Lund, the Chief Executive and Mike Wilson, the Chairman, who make recommendations to the Committee regarding changes to the remuneration packages of individual Directors or policy generally.
Such recommendations are discussed by the Committee and adopted or amended as the Committee sees fit.
No Director is present at any part of a meeting of the Committee when his own remuneration or contractual terms are being discussed.
The Committee also has access, as required, to professional advice and market data and this was provided by Monks Partnership and New Bridge Street Consultants LLP NBSC in 2004.
Both firms were appointed by the Committee to provide advice on executive remuneration, long term incentives and other remuneration issues and have not provided any other services to the Company.
Remuneration Policy The Committee applies the principles set out in the Combined Code when setting remuneration policy.
Overall, the Committee aims to set executive remuneration at an appropriate level to attract, retain and motivate executives of the necessary calibre.
35 REMUNERATION REPORT continued The policy for setting the Chairmans remuneration is set out on page 39.
For other executive Directors, the policy is set out below.
When looking at total remuneration salary, pension, fringe benefits, annual bonus and long term incentives, the Committee aims to set salary, pension and fringe benefits at around the median position for companies of similar size in the UK financial services market, with significant annual bonus and long term incentive awards enhancing an executives potential total remuneration, but only if stretching short term and long term performance targets are achieved.
In this way, the Committee aims to incentivise the Directors to achieve above average results compared to competitor organisations.
The incentive schemes are designed to be retentive in nature as well as linking the value of an award to movements in the share price, in line with shareholder interests.
The Committee has followed the provisions of Schedule A to the new Combined Code in designing schemes of performance-related remuneration.
Further details of all of the above elements of remuneration are set out below.
Salaries Salaries are reviewed annually in January, using data on the salaries and benefits for executives of other financial services groups and companies in other sectors of a comparable size to the Company.
In September 2004, Mike Wilson became Chairman of the Group, Mark Lund Chief Executive and Andrew Croft was appointed to the Board as Finance Director.
In view of these changes, the Committee decided to increase the salaries of Mark Lund and Andrew Croft to 350,000 and 200,000 respectively, with effect from 1 September 2004, on the understanding that their salaries would be more fully reviewed in January 2005.
The Committee carried out a full review of the salaries of all the executive Directors in January 2005, with the help of data provided by NBSC.
As stated above, the Committee aimed to set salary levels at around the median position for companies of a similar size in the UK financial services market, with adjustments then being made to take into account the responsibility and accountabilities of each role, the experience of the relevant individual and any other relevant factors.
On this basis, the Committee approved the following salaries for the executive Directors with effect from 1 January 2005: New Salary Previous Salary Mike Wilson 500,000 450,000 Mark Lund 380,000 350,000 David Bellamy 250,000 210,000 Ian Gascoigne 250,000 220,000 Andrew Croft 230,000 200,000 Further details about the decisions of the Committee regarding the remuneration of Mike Wilson are contained on page 39.
36 REMUNERATION REPORT continued Annual Cash Bonus For 2005, the Committee has determined that the maximum cash bonus will be 60% of salary, as in 2004, which would only be payable if the Committee considers that outstanding performance has been achieved by the Group and also by the individual Director concerned.
Up to 40% of salary will be awarded by reference to the performance of the Group, largely based on growth in operating profit before tax, although the Committee retains the discretion to amend the bonus, up or down, to take into account other relevant factors such as the Groups performance compared with competitor organisations, regulatory issues and completion of other business plan objectives.
Up to a further 20% of salary will be awarded by reference to individual performance and the achievement of personal objectives set at the start of the year.
Following his appointment as Chairman, Mike Wilson will no longer participate in the annual bonus scheme.
No executive Director has a contractual right to receive an annual bonus award and the performance targets set by the Committee are based on a sliding scale, to encourage top-end achievement.
The satisfaction of the targets will be assessed by reference to the Companys internal management information systems, which the Committee believes is the most appropriate method, given the internal nature of the performance targets.
Deferred Bonus Connected to the annual cash bonus scheme is the deferred bonus scheme under which any amount payable to a Director by way of annual cash bonus in any year is matched by an equal amount paid pursuant to the deferred bonus scheme.
Under the deferred bonus scheme, the deferred element of the annual bonus is used to purchase shares at market value in the Company to be held in an employee trust.
The shares held in the trust vest to the Director after three years and are not subject to further performance conditions due to the performance targets which apply prior to any entitlement being granted, although entitlement to the award is normally lost if the executive Director ceases to be employed by the Group prior to vesting.
The Committee believes that the deferred bonus scheme is an effective incentive for the executive Directors, whilst at the same time offering strong retentive characteristics going forward, as well as being aligned with shareholder interests due to the value of the award on vesting being dependent on share price performance.
Long Term Incentive Schemes All UK employees of the Group, including the executive Directors, are eligible to enter into a Save As You Earn SAYE contract, under which they are able to save up to 250 per month, and at the end of the 3 or 5 year savings period acquire shares in the Company at a price not less than 80 per cent of the market price at the date of the invitation to participate.
Since 1997 the Company has operated a discretionary share option scheme for executive Directors and senior employees under which options are granted at market value.
With the help of NBSC, the Committee has reviewed the merits of this arrangement, taking into account recent changes in accounting rules, market practice, the views of institutional shareholders and the relative advantages and disadvantages of share option schemes and performance share plans.
37 REMUNERATION REPORT continued As a result of this review, the Committee has decided to seek shareholder consent at the forthcoming AGM for the approval of a new Performance Share Plan PSP.
This will enable the Committee to make awards of performance shares rather than grants of share options.
The Committee believes that PSP awards will act as a better incentive mechanism for the executive Directors and senior management and also be more retentive, whilst at the same time reducing the accounting costs which would otherwise have been incurred by continuing with share option grants.
Full details of the proposed PSP are set out in the Notice of the AGM and a brief summary of the plans performance conditions is set out below.
The Committee will be able to make annual conditional awards of performance shares worth up to 200% of salary to an individual in normal circumstances, although initial grants will be restricted to 150% of base salary for the executive Directors.
Awards will vest after three years subject to the achievement of a performance condition.
For the purposes of the initial awards in 2005, two-thirds of the shares will be subject to an earnings growth condition and one-third of the shares will be subject to a comparative Total Shareholder Return TSR condition, both measured over a single three-year period.
The Committee believes that this will provide an appropriate balance of targets that both incentivise the executives whilst also keeping their interests aligned with those of shareholders.
The Committee has set out the initial earnings targets, taking into account the relatively low base point from where the growth targets will be measured.
The Committee will ensure that appropriately demanding targets are set for each award but recognises that this level of growth is unlikely to be appropriate for subsequent awards if profitability recovers strongly and earnings are measured from a much higher base point.
Earnings per share is calculated by reference to adjusted consolidated profit after tax on the achieved profit basis of accounting for both the life and unit trust businesses on a fully diluted per share basis.
The adjustment to the consolidated after tax figures will be to strip out any earnings from Life Assurance Holding Corporation an investment that has been sold, the achieved profit investment variance and any economic assumption change.
Shareholders will appreciate that these factors are not within the control of management, with the latter two factors combined producing wide variations in reported earnings due to stock market fluctuations.
The two-thirds of the shares based on earnings will vest if the following growth targets are achieved: Average annual earnings growth Proportion exercisable Below RPI 12.5% Zero RPI 12.5% 25% RPI 22.5% or more 100% Between the above points Pro rata between 25% and 100% 38 REMUNERATION REPORT continued A consistent approach will be taken to measuring earnings over the transition period to international accounting standards.
The one third of shares based on TSR will vest as follows: Companys ranking compared # to comparator group at end of performance period Proportion exercisable Below median Zero Median 25% Upper quartile 100% Between the above points Pro rata # The initial comparator group will comprise: Aberdeen Asset Management, AMVESCAP, Aviva, Bradford & Bingley, Britannic Group, Close Brothers, F&C Asset Management, Friends Provident, HHG, Investec, Legal & General, Old Mutual, Prudential, Rathbone Brothers, Royal & SunAlliance, Schroders, Singer & Friedlander, Teather & Greenwood.
These companies were selected by the Committee as a result of having business interests comparable to those of the St. Jamess Place Group.
Pension and Death in Service Benefits Employer contributions of 17.5% of base salary are made to the money purchase section of the Groups occupational pension scheme for the executive Directors, with the exception of Mark Lund who receives a contribution of 15% of base salary.
Sir Mark Weinberg received a salary supplement to his base salary in lieu of the above pension contributions until the date of his resignation from the Board.
To the extent that pension contributions were restricted by the earnings cap, such shortfalls were paid by way of taxable salary.
The costs of the pension and death in service arrangements for the executive Directors during the year ended 31 December 2004 are shown on pages 43 and 44.
Chairmans Package The Committee reviewed Mike Wilsons salary and benefits package and the terms of his service agreement in January 2005, following his appointment as Chairman with effect from 1 September 2004.
With the help of NBSC, a benchmarking exercise against the packages of other full time executive Chairmen was undertaken, although it was apparent that wide variations in responsibilities and remuneration meant that it was difficult to make meaningful comparisons across comparator companies.
In view of Mike Wilsons ongoing full time commitment to the Group, his financial services experience and importance to the ongoing success of the business, the Committee decided to increase his salary to 500,000 per annum but, in light of his new role as Chairman, he will not be entitled to participate in the annual discretionary bonus scheme or the accompanying deferred bonus scheme.
His salary increase is designed to maintain his total remuneration, compared to 2004, taking into account that he will no longer be entitled to participate in the said bonus schemes.
39 REMUNERATION REPORT continued The Committee believes that Mike Wilson should be entitled to participate in, and receive annual awards under the PSP, if approved by shareholders at the AGM.
However, awards will be granted on the basis that any shares in the Company which vest to Mike Wilson following the satisfaction of the performance condition should be retained by him until he ceases to be a Director of the Company, less any shares required to meet any tax liability on vesting.
The Committee also decided to extend Mike Wilsons service agreement to 5 December 2008, being the date of his 65th birthday, although either party can terminate the agreement earlier on giving 12 months notice.
Service Agreements It is the Committees policy that service agreements should generally terminate on the executives 60th birthday and should not contain notice periods in excess of one year.
The terms and conditions of the Directors service agreements are reviewed regularly and all service agreements contain an express obligation on the executive to mitigate his loss in the event the agreement is terminated.
In addition, the Company reserves the right to pay an amount representing the value of salary and benefits in lieu of any outstanding period of notice on a monthly basis so that, should the executive obtain alternative employment during the notice period, the monthly payments can be reduced to take into account any earnings received under the new employment.
When considering the size of any proposed termination payment, the Committee would take into account a number of factors including the health, length of service, age and the performance of the relevant executive, including the duty to mitigate his own loss, with a broad aim to avoid rewarding poor performance while dealing fairly with cases where the departure is due to other reasons, for example illness.
Details of the current service agreements of the executive Directors are set out below.
Mike Wilsons service agreement dated 15 May 2002 can be terminated, inter alia, by either party giving the other not less than twelve months written notice.
The agreement will automatically terminate on 5 December 2008 or such later date as the parties shall agree and provides for an annual salary of 500,000 and benefits in kind, including life assurance, pension provision, private health insurance and a company car together with a chauffeur.
Mark Lunds service agreement dated 15 May 2002 can be terminated, inter alia, by either party giving the other not less than twelve months written notice.
The agreement will automatically terminate on Mark Lunds 60th birthday and provides for an annual salary of 380,000 and benefits in kind, including life assurance, participation in the discretionary bonus scheme, pension provision, private health insurance and a company car.
40 REMUNERATION REPORT continued David Bellamys service agreement dated 15 May 2002 can be terminated, inter alia, by either party giving the other not less than twelve months written notice.
The agreement will automatically terminate on David Bellamys 60th birthday and provides for an annual salary of 250,000 and benefits in kind, including life assurance, participation in the discretionary bonus scheme, pension provision, private health insurance and a company car.
Ian Gascoignes service agreement dated 19 March 2003 includes a provision for termination, inter alia, by either party giving the other not less than twelve months written notice.
The agreement will automatically terminate on Ian Gascoignes 60th birthday and provides for an annual salary of 250,000 and benefits in kind, including life assurance, participation in the discretionary bonus scheme, pension provision, private health insurance and a company car.
It is intended that the service agreement for Andrew Croft, which, at the date of publication, is in the process of being drafted, will include provision whereby the agreement can be terminated, inter alia, by either party giving the other not less than twelve months written notice.
The agreement will automatically terminate on Andrew Crofts 60th birthday and provides for an annual salary of 230,000 and benefits in kind, including life assurance, participation in the discretionary bonus scheme, pension provision, private health insurance and a company car.
The service agreement for Sir Mark Weinberg was replaced on 1 September 2004 to reflect his resignation as Chairman and his appointment as President.
His previous agreement provided for an annual salary of 200,000.
The Company entered into a new service agreement with Sir Mark Weinberg on 1 September 2004 to reflect his new position as honorary President.
The agreement provides for an annual salary of 150,000 and there are no further benefits in kind.
The agreement can be terminated, inter alia, by either party giving the other not less than 3 months notice.
Currently, no executive Director acts as a non-executive Director on the Board of another company.
Non-executive Directors The remuneration of the non-executive Directors is determined by the Board as a whole, within the limits set by the provisions of the Articles of Association.
The Board reviewed the fees paid to the non-executive Directors in early 2005, in light of the increase in the number of Board meetings and increased responsibilities due to the new Combined Code and other corporate governance changes.
The Board decided to increase the basic annual fee to 20,000 per annum with effect from 1 January 2005, with additional fees being paid in respect of Board Committee and other responsibilities.
