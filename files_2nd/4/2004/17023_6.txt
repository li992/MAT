46 Westbury plc Annual Report 2004 2004 account 26-64 7 5 04 10:56 am Page 47 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 29 February 2004 1.
Principal accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards in the United Kingdom.
A summary of the more important Group accounting policies is set out below.
These policies have been applied consistently.
Basis of accounting The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis of accounting and are made up to the nearest Friday to 28 February each year.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Westbury plc and its subsidiary undertakings.
The results of subsidiary undertakings or businesses acquired during the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date on which control passed.
Uniform accounting policies are adopted by the Group and its subsidiary undertakings.
Turnover Group turnover for the year principally consists of the contract price from legally completed sales of new properties which are stated net of cash discounts and the sale of land where unconditional contracts have been exchanged,.
The purchase of secondhand houses is regarded as an incentive for the sale of new houses.
Subsequent sale of second-hand houses is therefore excluded from turnover.
Space4 turnover is recognised on the sale of factory manufactured house shells, which normally is the point of delivery.
Incresco turnover is recognised on issue of an invoice for the commission on financial service related products, with provisioning for anticipated cancellation.
Joint arrangements A joint arrangement is an undertaking in which the Group has an interest that does not carry on its own business, but acts as a vehicle to facilitate the Groups activities.
The Groups share of profits and losses of joint arrangements is included in the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account, and the Groups share of their separate assets, liabilities and cash flows are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Group Cash Flow Statement respectively.
Joint ventures A joint venture is an undertaking in which the Group has a participating interest and is jointly controlled under a contractual arrangement.
The Groups share of profits less losses of joint ventures is included in the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account, and the Groups share of their gross assets and gross liabilities is included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Since the accounting policies of joint ventures do not necessarily conform in all respects to those of the Group, adjustments are made on consolidation to reflect the accounting policies of the Group.
Intangible fixed assets Intangible assets comprise of purchased goodwill and know-how licences.
Goodwill, being the difference between the price paid for the subsidiary undertakings or businesses acquired and the fair value of their net assets at acquisition, is capitalised on the balance sheet and amortised through the profit and loss account over its useful economic life, being 20 years for the Maunders acquisition in 1998 and 6 years for the Prowting acquisition in 2002.
This goodwill will be subject to impairment reviews in accordance with the provisions of FRS 11.
Goodwill on acquisitions before 28 February 1998 was written off to reserves and has not been reinstated, as permitted under FRS 10.
The know-how licences for Space4 and Incresco are stated at cost less amortisation.
The Space4 know-how licence is amortised based on its expected usage in terms of units produced and the Incresco know-how licence is amortised over 5 years.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are written down to an estimated residual value on a straight-line basis at the following annual rates: Plant, machinery and equipment 20-25% Motor vehicles 25-33% Buildings 4% Plant, machinery and equipment of Space4 is depreciated based on its expected usage in terms of units produced.
