28156 annual 16 57 pe 7 12 04 11:57 AM Page 48 Directors Remuneration Report Introduction This report sets out the remuneration policy and details of the remuneration of the executive and non-executive directors of the Group for the year ended 24 April 2004.
The report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and approved by the Board for submission to shareholders.
A resolution will be put to shareholders at the annual general meeting on 8 September 2004 inviting them to approve the report.
The Companies Act, as amended by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, requires the auditors to report on the auditable part of this report.
The report has, therefore, been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited Information Remuneration Committee Composition The Remuneration Committee the Committee consists entirely of independent non-executive directors.
Throughout the financial year, from 26 April 2003 to 24 April 2004, the members of the Committee were Louise Patten Chairman, Alan Giles, Mike Firth and Peter Wilson.
There have been no changes to the composition of the Committee between the year end and the date of this report.
The company secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
The Committee met seven times during the year.
Terms of reference The Committee is responsible for considering and making recommendations to the Board on the Companys framework of executive director remuneration and its cost and for determining, on the Boards behalf, specific remuneration packages for each of the executive directors and members of the Group Executive Committee, and the terms of any severance packages.
It is also responsible for deciding on the grant of share options under the Companys discretionary share option schemes.
No directors are involved in setting their own remuneration.
Material assistance to the Committee During the year, in order to assist it in determining remuneration for the directors and senior executives, the Committee has consulted the executive chairman, John von Spreckelsen, the head of human resources, Jan Maggs, and, in her former capacity as human resources director, Katie Bickerstaffe.
Towers Perrin provide advice to the Committee on remuneration matters, primarily on executive incentive awards, and the Committee sought their advice throughout the year.
Towers Perrin were appointed by the Committee and do not provide any other services to the Company.
The executive chairman and head of human resources attend meetings of the Committee when it is considering the performance and remuneration of the other executive directors.
Remuneration policy statement The Committees goal is to provide and operate a remuneration policy which is consistent with the Groups objectives and with evolving best practice requirements.
The aim is to attract and retain high quality board directors and other senior executives and to align executive rewards with growth in earnings per share and return on shareholders funds using a combination of base salary, benefits and, in particular, highly focused incentive arrangements designed to improve performance over both the short and long term.
Remuneration policy The Committee followed the approach described in the Remuneration policy statement in reviewing executive director remuneration arrangements in 2003 04 and, subject to review by the Committee in the light of changes in business performance, the regulatory environment or market practice, intends to follow that approach in reviewing and determining such arrangements in the future.
In making its recommendations to the Board and determining individual packages, the Committee has given consideration to the relevant provisions of both the Original Code and the new Combined Code and this report follows the provisions of Schedule B to the Original Code and Schedule A to the Combined Code, as well as the requirements of the Companies Act as amended by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
In deciding on individual packages, the Committee pays regard not just to salaries, benefits and incentive arrangements in comparable businesses but to the need to balance rewards across the business as a whole.
The relative importance of the fixed and variable elements of the packages described below will vary according to the results achieved.
Base salary, car entitlement or cash supplement pension and funded unapproved pension scheme contributions are not dependent on performance.
Base salary reviews are dependent on performance.
Annual bonuses and longer term incentive packages will not deliver any value to directors if the targets and performance conditions are not met.
The maximum annual cash bonus entitlement under the executive deferred bonus scheme approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting in September 2003 is generally fixed at 40%, although the scheme does enable the Committee to pay the matching deferred bonus in cash in certain circumstances and the Committee retains a general discretion to pay bonuses inclusive of cash and deferred bonuses under the scheme to a maximum of 100% of base salary for any year.
Details of the scheme as implemented for 2003 04 are set out on page 49.
The Committee adopted a policy during the year for executive directors to hold a minimum of 50,000 shares in the Company after five years on the Board.
It is the Committees policy that all executive directors are employed under rolling service contracts with notice periods of twelve months and no termination payment other than a provision for payment to be made in lieu of notice.
It is the Companys policy that all non-executive directors are appointed under letters of appointment with initial or renewed terms of three years or until the next annual general meeting following such three year period with no prescribed notice periods and no compensation on termination.
Executive directors are generally permitted to accept one non-executive appointment outside the group and to retain any directors fee.
48 Somerfield plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 2004 28156 annual 16 57 pe 7 12 04 11:57 AM Page 49 Total remuneration The total remuneration package of the executive directors consists of the following elements: Base salary Base salary is reviewed annually.
The base salary for each executive director is determined by the Committee taking into account performance and advice and information from independent sources on the rates of salary for similar levels of responsibility in a selected group of comparable companies.
Pay levels and pay reviews within the Group are also considered as part of the annual review.
Executive Deferred Bonus Scheme At the annual general meeting in September 2003, shareholders approved the Somerfield plc Executive Deferred Bonus Scheme 2003 the Scheme a detailed description of which was set out in the circular sent to shareholders on 31 July 2003.
Following that approval, the Scheme was formally adopted by the Committee on 4 September 2003 and their participation in the Scheme notified to the executive directors and other members of the Group Executive Committee.
The key features of the Scheme are:  The Committee sets Scheme targets for each financial year and communicates them to those invited to participate.
 The Scheme is self-funding with targets set so that cash payments and associated employer costs, plus an accrual for the share match element, are met from incremental profits above the target.
 The Scheme comprises a mixture of cash, deferred shares which have to be held for a period of three years from the date on which they are awarded and share match which is delivered as nil cost options, with the level of award increasing for achieving higher targets.
 The Committee will also set a vesting condition for the share match option if any option is granted, measured over a three year period from the date of grant.
 The Committee has the discretion to pay bonuses entirely in cash with no share match entitlement in certain circumstances e. g. where a director is within three years of retirement.
For 2003 04, the Committee set the following scale of entitlements: Performance Cash bonus Deferred share bonus Matching nil cost Level as a percentage of basic salary as a percentage of basic salary share options as multiple of gross deferred share bonus Target Level 1: 25% Target Level 2: 15% 15% 2 Target Level 3: 25% 25% 2.8 Target Level 4: 40% 40% 4 The targets for 2003 04 were set by reference to operating profit.
Operating profit for 2003 04 exceeded target level 1 but did not reach target level 2, so participants became entitled solely to the cash bonus, full details of which are set out on page 52.
If share match options had been awarded, their exercise would have been subject to a vesting condition measured over the three years from April 2004 to April 2007.
Although Bill Williams ceased to be a director on 11 March, his employment continued to 24 April 2004 so he became entitled to the cash bonus in full.
For 2004 2005, the Committee has decided to set the initial target by reference to profit before tax excluding exceptional items PBT with the same structure for base and incremental targets and bonuses as is set out in the table above.
Now that the Company is in a more stable condition, the Committee believes PBT to be a more appropriate target than operating profit since that is the figure against which institutional investors and analysts typically measure business performance.
The vesting condition for the share match, which will require the achievement of stretching financial performance targets over three years, will be set by the Committee when the share match if any is granted.
Somerfield plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 2004 49 28156 annual 16 57 pe 7 12 04 11:57 AM Page 50 Directors Remuneration Report Continued Share options The Committee has decided that it will not ordinarily make any further awards of share options to directors under the existing discretionary executive approved and unapproved share option schemes, although awards would be considered for new appointments or in other exceptional circumstances where the Committee considers an award to be justified.
Awards may continue to be made, on a limited basis, to other employees, including senior executives who are not on either the Board or the Group Executive Committee.
Full details of share options awarded to the executive directors before April 2003 are set out on page 54.
The performance conditions applying to all outstanding share options are set out on page 55.
No discretionary executive share options were awarded to any executive director during the year.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme The Company has operated an Inland Revenue approved Savings Related Share Option Scheme since flotation in 1996.
The scheme operates for the benefit of all employees with at least six months service, including directors.
Under this scheme, employees save on a one weekly or four weekly basis via a bank or building society with an option to buy shares in the Company at the end of a three or five year period at a discount of 20% on market value at the time the option was granted.
There are no performance conditions attached to savings related share options.
Buy As You Earn The Company also operates an Inland Revenue approved Buy As You Earn share incentive plan for the benefit of all employees with six months service, including directors.
Under this scheme, employees save on a one weekly or four weekly basis to buy shares in the Company at market value on the date of purchase.
Pensions The Company contributes to personal pension arrangements for its executive directors as none of the directors is a member of the Somerfield Kwik Save Pension Scheme.
There is also a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme the Somerfield FURBS.
Contributions to the Somerfield FURBS are included as other emoluments within the table of total directors emoluments on page 52.
For John von Spreckelsen, the Company contributes a sum equal to 25% of his base salary towards the provision of a pension.
To the extent that the contribution exceeds the maximum permissible contribution to a personal pension under capping legislation, the excess is paid to John von Spreckelsens personal FURBS.
For each of the other executive directors, the Company contributes a sum equal to 20% of their base salary towards the provision of a pension.
To the extent that the contribution exceeds the maximum permissible contribution to a personal pension under capping legislation, the excess is paid either to the Somerfield FURBS or as additional salary.
Before his retirement from the Board on 11 March 2004, Bill Williams had elected to have the whole contribution paid into the Somerfield FURBS.
Benefits In addition to base salary, bonus, pension and other incentive arrangements described in this report, the Company provides a range of benefits in kind including a company car or cash allowance, a disability income replacement scheme, private medical insurance, life and accident insurance, mobile phone and employee discount card.
Non-executive directors Fees for non-executive directors are determined by the Board as a whole and are reviewed annually.
The non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in the Companys bonus, pension or share option schemes but do receive an employee discount card.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts.
They are appointed under letters of engagement which, in every case, envisage an initial or renewed term of three years or to the nearest annual general meeting beyond such three year term.
None of the letters of engagement provides for payment of compensation on termination.
Service contracts and compensation All executive directors are employed under rolling service contracts entitling them to a notice period from the Company of 12 months.
Directors have to give the Company a notice period of 6 months.
All contracts terminate automatically on the director reaching normal retirement age, currently 65.
Full details are set out in the table which follows.
The Boards policy is to engage directors on rolling service contracts with notice periods limited to 12 months save in exceptional circumstances to be considered by the Committee should the need arise.
One director, Bill Williams, left the business during the year.
Full details of his severance payment is set out on page 52.
In settling severance terms for Bill Williams, and in accordance with its policy on negotiating termination payments, the Committee negotiated a severance package providing for instalments to be paid every four weeks from 24 April 2004 when Bill Williams ceased to be employed until 26 February 2005.
Any earnings from other employment in that period will be set against payments.
Payments to Bill Williams FURBS will, however, be made in full.
