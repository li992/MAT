Directors remuneration report 37 HMV Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 The Board presents its Remuneration Report to the members of the Company.
In preparing this report and establishing its policy the Board has given full consideration to, and follows the provisions of, the Combined Code and the Companies Act 1985.
In accordance with the Companies Act the tables setting out Directors remuneration, benefits under long-term incentive schemes, pension arrangements and Directors interests in shares and share options of the Company on pages 39 to 42 have been audited.
The information on pages 37 and 38 is not required to be audited.
Constitution of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee, which is chaired by Roy Brown and also comprises David Kappler, Lesley Knox and Mark McCafferty meets as required not normally fewer than three times a year on behalf of the Board.
The Remuneration Committees remit is to determine the Companys policy for executive remuneration, to determine the remuneration packages of the Chairman, the Executive Directors and certain other senior executives, including pension rights and compensation payments, and to oversee the implementation and operation of share incentive schemes.
Advisers The Remuneration Committee takes advice and or obtains services from the following individuals and entities.
Towers Perrin have been appointed by the Remuneration Committee as its advisers in respect of executive salaries, incentives and employee share schemes.
In addition the following advisers were appointed by the Company: a Inbucon Limited on executive salaries, incentives and employee share schemes: b Watson Wyatt LLP on pension matters: and c Mayer, Brown, Rowe and Maw LLP and Freeth Cartwright, solicitors, on employment contracts and associated legal issues.
The Remuneration Committee also receives advice from the Group Human Resources and Corporate Services Director, Mike Lymath.
Mr Lymath assists the Remuneration Committee by preparing an annual report on succession planning together with recommendations on share option grants and reviewing incentive arrangements.
Mr Lymath is not present for any discussion about his own emoluments.
The Chief Executive Officer of the Company, Alan Giles, and since his appointment as Chairman of the Board, Robin Miller, are normally invited by the Remuneration Committee to attend meetings of the Committee but are not present for any discussion about their own emoluments.
General policy The Companys remuneration policy aims to align the interests of Executive Directors and other senior executives with those of its shareholders.
It is the Remuneration Committees policy that variable performance-related pay and incentives should account for a significant proportion of the overall remuneration package of Executive Directors so that the remuneration of Executive Directors is aligned with the Groups performance.
For target performance the performance-related element accounts for just under half of the total package.
For superior performance this rises to two-thirds of the total package.
These figures exclude pension values, which can vary significantly from person to person and from year to year, and are shown later in this report.
The Committee confirms that there are appropriate policies and procedures in place to monitor the size of potential awards.
In setting the Companys remuneration policy, therefore, the Remuneration Committee believes that the Company should: a provide competitive rewards, which will attract and retain high calibre management necessary to enable the Company to operate in the highly competitive retail sector and which reflect individual responsibilities and experience: and b provide incentive arrangements which are subject to challenging performance targets reflecting the Companys objectives and which motivate executives to focus on both annual and longer term performance.
Performance targets are designed to provide maximum awards for exceptional performance.
The Remuneration Committee intends that Executive Director basic salary be positioned at or around the median level in the marketplace with the incentive arrangements if performance targets are met bringing overall remuneration into the upper quartile for the marketplace.
When assessing the marketplace the Remuneration Committee refers to survey data supplied by Towers Perrin which concentrates on companies with a broadly similar scope to that of the Company, made up of a general industry competitor group comprising 70 companies and a specific retailer comparator group of 11 companies.
Executive Directors remuneration is currently provided in the form of a combination of basic salary, an annual and a deferred bonus, and share options further details of which are given below through the HMV Group plc Incentive Plan for Senior Executives the HIPS.
The Board originally adopted this remuneration policy in 2001 and it has been reviewed during the financial year.
The Company intends to continue to recommend this policy to the Board subject to regular review.
It is the Companys policy that no Executive Director should have a fixed term service contract or notice period exceeding one year and that no Non-Executive Director should have a letter of appointment for a term of more than three years.
All the current Directors service contracts or letters of appointment comply with this policy.
Further details are found on page 42.
Components of the Executive Directors Remuneration The main components of the Executive Directors remuneration are: Salary The basic salary for each Executive Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account each Executive Directors performance, experience and responsibilities.
The Committee also has regard to salaries paid in the marketplace as described above.
Salaries are reviewed with effect from 1 July each year.
Benefits in kind Benefits in kind include provision of a car allowance, pension, medical and life insurance, permanent health insurance and staff discount.
The HIPS In 2001 the Company introduced the HIPS.
The HIPS has three elements an annual non-pensionable performance-related cash bonus, a deferred performance-related annual bonus payable in shares save for the award in 2001 which was paid in cash and share options.
The HIPS is designed to provide an incentive for senior management to achieve and exceed targets set by the Remuneration Committee and to ensure that annual remuneration varies in line with corporate performance.
Annual bonus The annual bonus the annual award awarded to each Executive Director is a percentage of salary based on the performance of the Group.
The annual award is a payment in cash, which is paid after the end of the financial year to which the performance relates.
Executive Directors are eligible to receive a maximum annual award of 75% of salary.
Further details about performance conditions applying to the annual award are set out on the next page.
Directors remuneration report continued 38 HMV Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Deferred annual bonus The Company operates a deferred bonus, linked to the annual award.
The Company makes an award to the Executive Directors with a value equivalent to the annual award the deferred award.
The deferred award normally vests following the third anniversary of the end of the financial year in respect of which the award is made, subject to achievement of further demanding cumulative performance targets based on the performance of the Group over the three year period and the performance of the individual.
Exceptionally the award for the financial year 2000 01 vests not at the end of the three-year period but instead a proportion of the award is paid at the end of each of the financial years in that three-year period provided the further performance targets have been met.
The 2000 01 award was made in cash.
Subsequent deferred awards were made in shares.
The 2003 04 award will also be made in shares.
Where payment is made in shares, the number of shares awarded is determined by reference to the value of the shares at the time the deferred award is made, not when it is paid.
Performance targets in respect of the annual bonus and deferred annual bonus Performance targets to determine the amount of the annual award and the maximum value when awarded of the deferred award for the period under review have been measured by reference to a target EBITDA after notional interest, target EBITDA and target stockturn.
These performance criteria were set by the Remuneration Committee in 2001.
If the target EBITDA after notional interest is reached then, for the Executive Directors, a sum equivalent to 25% of their salary is awarded under both the annual award and the deferred award.
If the target EBITDA after notional interest is not reached, the Executive Directors may still receive an award on a sliding scale of up to 25% of salary for each of the annual award and the deferred award for performance between 90% and 100% of target EBITDA after notional interest.
For performance above target EBITDA after notional interest and providing that target EBITDA has been achieved, awards are made to the Executive Directors on a sliding scale of up to a further 50% of salary making a maximum award of 75% of salary for both the annual award and deferred award.
The stockturn target must also be met for the maximum award to be made.
For the 52 weeks to 24 April 2004 an award of 71.1% of salary for each of the annual award and the deferred award will be made to the Executive Directors.
The assessment of whether these performance targets have been met has been carried out by the Remuneration Committee by reference to the audited accounts.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the above performance targets and has agreed that while EBITDA after notional interest and target EBITDA were appropriate at the time the HIPS was introduced and for the two-year period following the Initial Public Offering, it is now appropriate to change the performance criteria.
In this respect the Remuneration Committee has agreed that the performance criteria be changed to profit before interest and tax and profit before interest and tax after notional interest.
The performance target of stockturn is retained, as are the other constituent parts of the bonus scheme.
These performance targets have been selected because the Remuneration Committee believes they align the interests of the Executive Directors with those of the Companys shareholders.
The deferred awards made to date are set out on page 42.
Share options Until the Initial Public Offering of the Company in 2002 the Company operated the HMV Group plc Senior Executive Share Option Scheme the 1998 Scheme : no further grants will be made through the 1998 Scheme.
All grants made under the 1998 scheme were subject to performance targets, as set out below.
Details of the options held by the Executive Directors under the 1998 Scheme and not yet exercised are set out on page 41.
Outstanding grants made on 22 January 1999 are currently exercisable following the achievement of the relevant EBITDA targets for the 1998 99, 1999 00 and 2000 01 financial years.
Grants made on 7 September 2001 and 26 February 2002 became exercisable in tranches upon and following the Initial Public Offering of the Company in May 2002 achievement of the Initial Public Offering being the performance target.
The first tranche of these options became exercisable upon the Initial Public Offering.
The second tranche became exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of Initial Public Offering May 2003 and the third tranche became exercisable on the second anniversary of the date of Initial Public Offering May 2004.
Prior to the Initial Public Offering a new executive share option scheme, the HMV Group plc 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme the 2002 Scheme was adopted.
It is intended that this scheme will be used for further grants of options to the Executive Directors under the HIPS.
Options to acquire shares under the 2002 Scheme will be granted on a regular basis usually annually thus ensuring reward is spread over a number of years and is allied to the long-term growth in shareholder value.
The rules of the 2002 Scheme permit the granting of options to Executive Directors to a maximum of 300% of basic salary.
During the year under review the Executive Directors were granted options to the value of 150% of basic salary.
The options can normally only be exercised after three years and then subject to the achievement of earnings per share targets imposed by the Remuneration Committee at the date of grant.
The grants of options made to the Executive Directors under the 2002 Scheme are also set out on page 41.
For these options 40% of the option shall be exercisable if the Companys earnings per share exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index by at least 3% per annum.
100% of the option shall be exercisable if the Companys earnings per share growth exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index by at least 7% per annum.
Vesting will occur on a straight-line basis between these two points.
Earnings per share was determined by the Remuneration Committee to be the appropriate criterion given its clear linkage with shareholder value.
The Remuneration Committee will carry out the assessment of whether these performance conditions have been met by reference to the audited accounts.
The next grant of options under the 2002 Scheme is expected to take place in July 2004 at a proposed level of 150% of basic salary for the Executive Directors except Brian McLaughlin who will not be granted options as he is due to retire at the end December 2004.
Share Incentive Plan The Company also adopted in 2002 the HMV Group plc Share Incentive Plan the SIP.
This plan is intended to allow the Company to align the interests of all employees including the Executive Directors, all of whom are eligible to participate more closely with the interests of shareholders.
The Company has two employee benefit trusts the UK Trust and the Overseas Trust and a Canadian Custodian Account to facilitate the operation of these schemes.
Under the SIP employees may acquire Ordinary Shares in three ways.
Firstly, the Company can use the SIP as part of its broad incentive arrangements by awarding free shares to employees: in this regard an award of 120 free shares was made to every eligible employee, including the Executive Directors, on the Initial Public Offering.
The free shares are, for UK employees, held by the UK Trust, subject to the rules of the SIP, and are not normally vested in the individual employee until he or she has completed one years service from the date of the award.
There are no current plans to award further free shares to any employees.
Secondly, the Company may invite employees to purchase Ordinary Shares, known as partnership shares, and thirdly, the Company may, if it wishes, agree to match the shares purchased with additional shares, known as matching shares.
The Company has matched on a one for one basis since the inception of the plan and these matching shares do not vest until the employee has completed one years service from the date of the award.
All the Executive Directors participate in the SIP and their awards are set out on page 42.

The normal retirement age for Executive Directors is 60.
Brian McLaughlin and Neil Bright were, until 1 June 2003, members of the EMI Group Pension Fund but opted to transfer to the HMV Group Pension Scheme HMV Scheme as from that date.
Alan Giles, Brian McLaughlin and Neil Bright are now all members of the HMV Scheme which is a contracted-out defined benefit scheme providing them with benefits of up to one-thirtieth of final pensionable pay for each year of service.
Mr Bright is subject to the salary capping introduced by the Finance Act 1989.
The HMV Scheme, therefore, provides Mr Bright with benefits of up to one-thirtieth of the capped salary for each year of service.
Mr Bright pays 4% of his capped salary as a contribution to the HMV Scheme and the Company, in addition, contributes to a separate money purchase plan which provides him with additional benefits through a FURBS as noted below.
Mr Giles and Mr McLaughlin contribute 4% of their respective base salary annually as a contribution to the HMV Scheme.
In the event of death during employment the dependants of the Executive Directors would receive a pension and a lump sum.

These awards are subject to the qualifying conditions on page 38.
Service agreements No Executive Director has a service agreement containing a notice period exceeding one year.
The Remuneration Committee has considered the notice periods and termination arrangements set out below in the light of the Combined Code and continues to believe they are appropriate for the Executive Directors given their seniority and value to the Company.
The Executive Directors service contracts are summarised below: Notice Notice Date of period from period from service contract Company individual Alan Giles 23 April 02 12 months 12 months Brian McLaughlin 23 April 02 12 months 6 months Neil Bright 23 April 02 12 months 12 months The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements but have been engaged under letters of appointment.
These are dated 23 April 2002 for each of Roy Brown, David Kappler, Lesley Knox and Mark McCafferty and 3 November 2003 for Robin Miller.
All are terminable by the Company without liability for compensation.
All Non-Executive appointments are for an initial period of three years and can be extended for a subsequent period of three years.
Robin Miller and David Kappler, who are standing for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, have letters of appointment as Non-Executive Directors.
Neil Bright, who is also standing for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, has a service agreement, which provides for a notice period of one year.
Directors remuneration report continued 43 HMV Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Copies of the Executive Directors service agreements and the letters of appointment for the Chairman and each of the Non-Executive Directors are available at the registered office of the Company and will be available at the Annual General Meeting.
Compensation for early termination The arrangements for early termination of an Executive Directors service agreement are decided by the Remuneration Committee and will be made in accordance with the service agreement provisions of each of the Executive Directors.
Each service agreement provides for a payment in lieu of notice on early termination to the Executive Director which shall consist of base salary plus accrued bonus to date and the cash equivalent of all other benefits.
The Remuneration Committee may exercise discretion over unvested share options and or deferred bonus entitlement in accordance with the rules of the appropriate scheme.
In case of termination in breach of contract by the Company or termination by the Executive Director following material breach of contract by the Company within one year of a change of control of the Company, each Executive Director is entitled to compensation calculated on the same basis as set out above save that, in addition, he shall be entitled to an amount equal to the annual bonus he would have received for the 12 months after termination calculated on the basis of the Groups latest forecasts prior to the date of termination: the immediate vesting of all outstanding deferred bonus awards, the enhancement of pension arrangements by increasing the Executive Directors pensionable salary by 12 months, the provision of all other benefits to which the Executive Director is entitled for a period of 12 months or the financial equivalent thereof and, subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, the vesting of any unexercised share options.
The Committee considers that these arrangements are fair to both Executive Directors and shareholders, given that they are consistent with the contractual entitlements of the Directors but incorporate a performance-related element should the performance of the Company up to the date of termination warrant such a payment.
The Committee will, however, consider each case on its merits should the occasion arise.
If payments for termination are dealt with in accordance with the above provisions the restrictive covenants contained in each Executive Directors service agreement in favour of the Company will continue to apply.
Outside directorships No Executive Director may accept a non-executive directorship without the prior approval of the Board to ensure that they do not give rise to conflicts of interest.
During the period under review Alan Giles was a Non-Executive Director of Somerfield plc and received Non-Executive Directors fees of 40,000 in respect of this directorship.
Mr Giles does not intend to offer himself for re-election at the Somerfield plc 2004 Annual General Meeting and will consequently cease to be a Director from the end of that meeting.
In addition it has been announced that Mr Giles will be appointed a Non-Executive Director of Wilson Bowden plc with effect from 1 October 2004.
Brian McLaughlin and Neil Bright have no non-executive appointments.
Executive Directors may retain the remuneration from such appointments.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors remuneration The Chairman and the Executive Directors determine the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors for their services as members of the Board and its Committees in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association.
The Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration of the Chairman.
An annual review takes place in July each year.
The policy is to pay fees at a market competitive level in comparison with companies of broadly similar size in terms of market capitalisation.
The Company takes into account each individuals responsibilities and time commitments when setting fee levels.
The Chairman, Robin Miller, receives a basic fee of 125,000 pa.
The Non-Executive Directors receive a basic fee of 31,500 pa except for Roy Brown who receives a basic fee of 47,250 pa as the Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Non-Executive Director.
