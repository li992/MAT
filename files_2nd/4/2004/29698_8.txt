SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 29 Share options So as to link a significant proportion of their remuneration to the long term stock market performance of the Company and to the achievement of predetermined financial targets, the interests of the Companys executive Directors and other executives of the Group are aligned with shareholders through the operation of the Companys Executive Share Option Plan, which was introduced at the Extraordinary General Meeting held on 3 May 2001.
Options will be granted regularly to qualifying employees and secondees of the Group and the Committee will determine grant levels, taking into account the development of the business and individual performance.
All options are granted at the prevailing market price around the time of grant.
Options are exercisable subject to appropriate performance targets being met.
Performance conditions have been met.
For the options that were granted in March 2003 and March 2004, the target is for growth in the Companys net asset value per ordinary share to exceed the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 4% per annum over the three years from the date of grant.
If the performance target is not satisfied on the third anniversary of the date of grant, they may be re-tested every six months up to six years from grant.
The mid-market price of shares at 31 December 2004 was 579.0p and the range during the year was 445.0p to 579.0p.
SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 30 Remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2004 continued The Committee intends to continue to set appropriately demanding performance targets on the exercise of options.
For options granted in 2005, the target is for growth in the Companys net asset value per ordinary share to exceed the growth in the Retail Prices Index RPI plus 4% per annum over the three years from the date of grant.
If the performance target is not satisfied on the third anniversary of the date of grant it will lapse i. e. there will be no retesting of this performance condition.
This change has been introduced from 2005 to reflect best practice.
It is not anticipated that the value of shares under options granted in any financial year will, other than in exceptional circumstances, exceed two times an individuals remuneration.
The performance of the net asset value of the Company has been chosen as the target in order to align the interests of executive Directors and other executives of the Group with shareholders interests.
External advisers will confirm the performance criteria calculations for the Committee, which will be measured on a consistent basis.
Performance graph The Companies Act 1985 requires this report to include a performance graph comparing the Companys total shareholder return performance against that of a broad equity market index.
For this purpose, the Committee has decided that the FTSE All-Share Index is the most appropriate available index for comparative purposes because it is the principal index in which the Companys shares are quoted.
