NBrown AR04 B-END 1 AW 7 6 04 10:32 am Page 24 N Brown Group plc 24 Report and Accounts 2004 Remuneration report Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with The Directors Report Regulations 2002, the regulations This report will be put to an advisory vote of the companys shareholders at the annual general meeting on 7 July 2004.
The auditors are required to report on the auditable part of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the regulations.
The report is therefore divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information: Remuneration committee During the financial year, the remuneration committee of the board the committee comprised Ivan Fallon chairman, Robert Youngjohns and Lord Stone of Blackheath, all of whom are non executive and independent.
Robert Youngjohns resigned from the Board on 2 July 2003 since which date the committee comprised two members, Ivan Fallon and Lord Stone of Blackheath, whilst the search for a replacement non executive director was undertaken.
John McGuire was appointed to the committee on 23 March 2004.
The committee members have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interest arising from crossdirectorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The committee has formal written terms of reference which are available for shareholders to inspect at the registered office of the company.
The committee met three times during the year in question.
The committee was advised during the year by Deloitte & Touche LLP, the companys auditors, and Addleshaw Goddard who provided legal advice in relation to the share incentive arrangements and the chief executives remuneration.
In determining executive directors remuneration for the year, the committee consulted Alan White, the chief executive, and Paul Grundy, group financial controller.
No director played a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
The board have reviewed the groups compliance with the Combined Code 1998 the code on remuneration related matters.
It is the opinion of the board that the group complied with the remuneration related aspects of the code during the year, however, the following areas should be noted: the contract of the chief executive, Alan White, currently provides for a notice period of 2 years.
This was agreed by the committee as part of a complex remuneration package designed to persuade him to leave his previous employer in the summer of 2002 and because the remuneration committee considered this to be necessary to attract and retain him in view of his very considerable expertise of the home shopping market over the last 18 years.
the annual bonus plan provides for company expensed matching shares at the end of two years rather than three under the code and the provision of these matching shares is not subject to additional performance conditions.
the remuneration committee are aware of the potential conflict of interest in receiving remuneration advice from their auditors, Deloitte and Touche LLP.
The committee intends to address this concern in the future by seeking, where appropriate, all aspects of remuneration advice from advisors who are considered independent and who do not provide other services to the company.
Remuneration policy for executive directors and senior executives The committees policy is to set the main elements of the remuneration package to attract, motivate and retain executive directors and senior executives by offering them competitive remuneration packages, which are prudently designed and linked to individual and corporate performance.
The normal remuneration package for executive directors comprises basic salary, an annual performance-related bonus including a deferred element with a matching share award, a long-term incentive programme, a pension and other benefits in kind including a fully expensed company car or cash allowance and medical insurance.
The remuneration committee regularly reviews the structure of the executive package, including the balance between fixed and variable pay to ensure that the remuneration remains competitive and challenging.
A review of the bonus structure and the use of long-term share based incentives is planned for 2004.
The charts below demonstrate the balance between fixed and variable performance based pay for each executive director: Analysis of Performance vs Non Performance element of Remuneration Package Fixed Pay Variable Performance Related Pay 39% 42% 39% 31% 61% 58% 61% 69% Alan White Tim Kowalski Dean Moore Mike Bullas NBrown AR04 B-END 1 AW 7 6 04 10:32 am Page 25 N Brown Group plc 25 Report and Accounts 2004 Remuneration report Basic salary When determining the salary of the executive directors the committee has taken into consideration the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity, in particular those existing in the home shopping and retail market sectors: the performance of the individual executive director: the individual executive directors experience and responsibilities: and the pay and conditions throughout the company.
Salaries are reviewed on an annual basis.
Annual performance-related bonus Each executive director and senior executive participates in one of a number of annual performance-related bonus schemes.
Each scheme is designed to stretch the performance of the executive and is linked to the growth in annual profit and the achievement of other business targets.
These targets are reviewed and agreed by the committee at the beginning of each financial year to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and position of the company and that they continue to remain challenging.
Payments under the annual bonus schemes consist of an immediate cash element, a deferred element in shares net of tax and a 1:1 matching share element based on the pre-tax value of the bonus used to acquire the deferred shares.
Matching shares are released two years from their date of award provided the executive retains his deferred shares and remains in employment.
The levels of bonus earned for this year are set out in the following table: 1 Name Alan White Tim Kowalski Michael Bullas Dean Moore Maximum Bonus Potential Including Maximum Value of Deferred & Matching Shares %age Salary 110% 110% 110% 110% 2003 Bonus & Deferred Shares Paid 47,000 - 12,000 6,000 2003 Matching Share Award 17,625 - - 2,250 Total 2003 Bonus & Matching Share Award as a %age of Salary 18% - 6% 15% Median Bonus Paid as a %age of Salary in the companys comparators 30% - 30% 30% 1 This figure is based on a pro-rated bonus and salary due to Dean Moores appointment on 24 November 2003.
The performance targets used for 2003 were based on a combination of profit, customer service and sales adjustments.
The committee is in the process of finalising the bonus targets for 2004.
The provision of the matching shares is not subject to the satisfaction of any additional performance requirements.
It is the opinion of the committee that the difficulty in satisfying the underlying performance requirements to earn the annual bonus is commensurate with the potential value of the maximum immediate and deferred bonus payable.
Bonus payments are no longer pensionable.
Share incentives It is the policy of the committee that executive directors and senior executives generally receive an annual award under either the long-term incentive plan or one of the companys executive share option schemes.
Before allowing any individual to participate in both the long-term incentive plan and one of the executive share option schemes, the committee will carefully assess the expected value of the combined total award, particularly if it exceeds the maximum value possible under either scheme individually.
In addition, it is the committees policy only to grant combined grants where there are some or all of the following circumstances: to minimise the P&L cost to the company and dilutive cost for shareholders for a given share commitment to an executive: where different performance conditions apply to awards and options: or on initial recruitment of a senior executive.
The performance condition of earnings per share growth for both share awards and options was chosen because it is easily understood by eligible executives and is considered to be a suitably challenging measure in the current retail sector trading environment.
The committee determines whether the performance conditions for share awards and options are satisfied using the earnings per share information calculated in accordance with the principles behind the audited earnings per share disclosed in the companys financial statements and may take advice from independent auditors as to whether any adjustments are required to ensure consistency in accordance with the terms of the performance conditions.
This is done to ensure no director is in a position to rule whether performance conditions applying to his own incentives have been satisfied.
