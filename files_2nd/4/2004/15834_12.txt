qxd 24 11 2004 18:11 Page 27 Directors Remuneration Report Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 The Regulations which introduced new statutory requirements for the disclosure of Directors remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after 31 December 2002.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the Financial Statements will be approved.
The Regulations require the Auditors to report to the Companys members on the auditable part of the Directors Remuneration Report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information Remuneration Committee The Company has established a Remuneration Committee, which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code.
The members of the Committee are WA McIntosh Chairman, VH Watson and The RT Hon JM Jack who are all independent Non-Executive Directors.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest other than as shareholders, conflicts of interests arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board.
No Director plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
Remuneration policy Executive remuneration packages are prudently designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors of the high calibre needed to maintain the Groups position as a market leader and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders.
The performance measurement of the Executive Directors and key members of senior management and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the Committee.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board within limits set out in the Articles of Association.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors and senior management: basic annual salary including Directors fees and benefits: long-term incentive plan: share option incentives: and pension arrangements.
Basic salary An Executive Directors basic salary is determined by the Committee prior to the beginning of each year and when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a whole and relies on objective research which gives up-to-date information on a comparator group of companies.
Basic salaries were reviewed in September 2004 with increases taking effect from 1 October 2004.
Executive Directors contracts of service, which include details of remuneration, will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
In addition to basic salary and pension contributions, the Executive Directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, principally a car and private medical insurance.

qxd 24 11 2004 18:11 Page 28 Directors Remuneration Report continued Unaudited information continued Long-term Incentive Plan L-TIP The Topps Tiles Plc 2003 Executive L-TIP is a three year plan, set up in the period, which is due to mature at the financial period ending 30 September 2006.
The L-TIP is a cash based plan with performance targets based on the Group profitability over the three year period.
It is discretionary and will be operated by the Board acting through the Remuneration Committee.
The maximum total amount potentially payable under the plan if performance criteria are met is 4,000,000.
ND Ounstead and A Liggett each have been granted a 25% interest in the L-TIP.
The payment of the individual awards under the scheme is dependent on the participant remaining in employment with the Group and the Group achieving a cumulative total of at least 80,000,000 pre-tax profits before any accrual for the L-TIP over the three year period and the diluted earnings per share as shown in the Groups annual accounts must increase by an average of 15% per annum compounded annually over the same period.
In the event of a take-over, reconstruction or winding up of the Group, a proportion of awards will vest having regard to the number of months of the performance period that have elapsed and any other relevant factors.
Share options The share option scheme comprises two parts, the Topps Tiles Plc Approved Executive Share Options Scheme and the Topps Tiles Plc Unapproved Executive Share Options Scheme.
The Scheme is administered and the grant of options supervised by the Remuneration Committee.
The exercise of options will normally be conditional on the achievement of a specified performance target determined by the Remuneration Committee, who will have regard to guidelines on share options schemes issued by institutional investors.
Options may normally only be granted within 42 days of the announcement by the Company of its interim or final results each period, with the exercise price being not less than the middle market quotation averaged over the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of the grant.
No significant amendments are proposed to the terms and conditions of any entitlement of a Director to share options.
Pension arrangements BFJ Bester, ND Ounstead and A Liggett received contributions into their own personal pension schemes.
Directors contracts Executive Directors It is the Companys policy that Executive Directors enter into a contract with a twelve month term providing for a maximum of six months notice.
SKM Williams, BFJ Bester, A Liggett and ND Ounstead have entered into new service contracts on 1 October 2004 in accordance with the above policy.
In the event of early termination, the Directors contracts provide for compensation up to a maximum of six months basic salary for the notice period.
Non-Executive Directors All Non-Executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set by the Articles of Association and based on independent surveys of fees paid to non-executive directors of similar companies.
The basic fee paid to each Non-Executive Director in the period was 20,000.
It is the Companys policy that Non-Executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of six months notice.
Non-Executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Companys share option schemes and are not eligible to join the Companys pension scheme.
