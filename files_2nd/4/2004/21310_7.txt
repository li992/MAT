These awards were granted in the years 2000 to 2004, and include mandatory bonus deferrals.
For mandatory bonus deferrals under ESAS, the size of any award is subject to the same Group and individual performance criteria as the annual bonus.
Normally, the trustees will permit the executive to call for the shares from the end of the third year from grant of an award by granting a right to acquire shares a nil cost option exercisable for two years.
As this nil cost option is part of the structure of an ESAS award described above, which is a deferred share award plan, it would not be appropriate to attach a performance condition to the exercise of options.
If the right is not exercised, the trustees, may at the end of the fifth year, release all of the shares, including bonus shares equal to 30% of the basic award.
If the right is exercised, an executive may lose the opportunity of receiving one-third of the bonus shares.
The number of shares shown in the table includes the bonus shares where applicable.
b The trustees may release additional shares to participants which represent accumulated net dividends in respect of shares under award.
During 2004, the trustees released the following accumulated dividend shares 5,994 to John Varley, 1,501 to Gary Hoffman, 945 to David Roberts and 2,997 to Chris Lendrum.
These are not awarded as part of the original award and consequently are not included in the Released column.
c The trustees may release additional shares to participants which represent accumulated net dividends in respect of shares under award.
During 2004, the trustees released the following accumulated dividend shares 13,996 to Matthew W Barrett.
These are not included as part of the original award and consequently are not included in the Exercised column.
d The number shown on 1st January 2004 includes those shares provisionally allocated in respect of performance for 2003, for those individuals who were not Directors in 2003. e The shares under option shown in this column are already included in the numbers shown at 1st January 2004 and relate to provisional allocations made in 2000 and 2001 except that the figures do not include accumulated dividend shares under option as follows: 3,740 shares for John Varley, 18,363 shares for Roger Davis, 2,550 shares for Gary Hoffman, 1,516 shares for David Roberts and 3,182 for Chris Lendrum.
Under ESAS, a participant pays 1 to exercise an option, irrespective of the number of shares involved.
f The shares under option in this column are not included in the numbers shown at 1st January 2004.
Voluntary ESAS is an additional award under ESAS following a Director requesting that part of the cash bonus to which he would otherwise become entitled be waived, and is granted as a right to acquire shares which will become fully exercisable after five years.
g The awards in respect of 2004 were made in February 2005.
The shares awarded represent shares purchased by the trustees after 10th February 2005 at 5.91 in respect of a recommendation by the Company for an award, including a maximum potential 30% bonus shares, of 715,000 to Matthew W Barrett, 357,500 to Roger Davis, 357,500 to Gary Hoffman, 406,250 to Naguib Kheraj, 333,125 to David Roberts and 568,750 to John Varley.
b The 2002 grant is due to vest on 20th March 2005.
The number of shares due to vest represents the number over which an option may be exercised after the third anniversary from grant, as determined by the Committee in respect of the performance conditions attached to the options originally set at the time of the grant of the option.
The shares under option that are not due to vest will lapse.
The result of the economic profit performance against the target has resulted in the Target Award vesting.
The result of the relative TSR performance target against the comparator group of companies placed Barclays in fourth position for the 2002 to 2004 performance period with a vesting multiplier of one times the Target Award.
c Market price per share at 31st December 2004 was 586p.
d Chris Lendrum ceased to be a Director on 31st December 2004.

For convenience these are described as granted under ESOS in the above table.
d Executive Directors continue to have interests under the ESOS scheme as indicated in the table above.
No further awards will be made under this scheme.
Under the ESOS, options granted at market value to executives were exercisable only if the growth in earnings per share of the Company over a three-year period was, at least, equal to the percentage increase in the UK Retail Price Index plus 6%, over the same period.
The performance target for the 1999 ESOS grant was met.
