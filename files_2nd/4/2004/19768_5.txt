Directors Remuneration Report The following disclosures of this report contain information which is not subject to audit.
The Remuneration Committee the Committee meets at least once a year to consider all aspects of the Chairmans and executive directors remuneration, performance and employment and to review the Companys remuneration policies.
The Chairman absents himself from the deliberations of the Committee with regard to his remuneration.
The fees of the non-executive directors other than the Chairman are a matter for decision by a committee of the Board comprising the Chairman and Chief Executive and are reviewed annually taking into account the role and responsibilities of the directors.
Compliance with the Combined Code and the New Combined Code The constitution and operation of the Committee is, and has been throughout the period, in compliance with the principles incorporated within the Combined Code on Corporate Governance the Combined Code appended by the Financial Services Authority to the UK Listing Authoritys Listing Rules, with the exception that G Stanley Thomas, being a significant shareholder of the Company, is acknowledged as not being an independent non-executive director.
A third independent non-executive director is, at the date of this report, in the course of being recruited and it is envisaged that, on appointment, he or she will be invited to join the Committee.
The Committee has considered the implications of the New Combined Code which will replace the Combined Code for reporting years beginning on or after 1 November 2003.
The Committee takes the view that, where possible, it should comply with the New Combined Code early.
Composition of the Remuneration Committee The Committee comprises the three non-executive directors of the Company each of whom served throughout the year: Charles Scott Chairman, G Stanley Thomas and Gareth Jones.
Tim Simon served on the Committee until his resignation from the Board on 1 August 2003.
None of the directors have any personal interest in the matters to be decided other than as shareholders of the Company, any potential conflict of interest arising out of cross-directorships or any day to day involvement in the management of the Groups business activities.
During the year the Committee engaged the services of New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, an independent employment and benefits consultancy, specifically to advise on the introduction of a new bonus scheme for executive directors and the implementation of a proposed long term incentive scheme.
Policy The Committee aims to establish a level of remuneration sufficient to attract, retain and motivate executive directors of the calibre required to achieve the Groups objectives.
Reviews of the remuneration policy are carried out regularly.
In order to ensure that the range and level of emoluments and incentive schemes are competitive in the market place, the Committee uses survey data provided by external independent bodies on the remuneration policies of companies whose turnover and or business activities are similar to the Groups.
In addition, if the Committee considers it necessary, it will seek advice from independent consultants.
The components of executive directors remuneration packages include: Basic salary and non-cash benefits Salary and non-cash benefits, including company cars, life assurance, permanent health insurance and medical insurance, are determined by the Committee taking into account individual performance and information from independent sources on rates of salary and benefits for directors in comparable positions.
Bonus Prior to the year being reported on, the wholly discretionary annual bonus scheme provided for bonuses of up to 100% of salary, based partly on individual performance and the financial performance of the Group.
The Committee has reviewed the situation during the year and, with the assistance of New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, has introduced a new annual bonus scheme for the executive directors only, providing for bonuses of a maximum of 75% of salary.
The Committee establishes stringent strategic objectives for, and in consultation with, the Chief Executive and Finance Director, and the Chief Executive determines the objectives for the other executive directors, at the start of the financial year.
Under the new scheme, a directors bonus is determined in part by a formulaic comparison to budget of the audited EBITDA of the Group and, as appropriate, the businesses for which the individual director is primarily responsible the earnings element and in part by the Committees assessment of the extent to which the individual directors personal objectives have been met the objectives element.
The new scheme was introduced during the year and the proportion of earnings element to objectives element was 70:30 for Keith Brooks and Caroline Price and 50:50 for Paul Kehoe and Larry Gouldthorpe, in whose cases half of the earnings element related to their businesses.
It is intended that the split be 70:30 for all directors for the year to 31 March 2005 and beyond.
TBI Annual report and accounts 2004 26 27 Directors Remuneration Report continued Pensions Under the terms of their service agreements, the executive directors are entitled to a contribution to their personal pension plans.
Keith Brooks and Caroline Price are entitled to receive an annual contribution of 15% of basic salary to their respective personal pension plans.
Larry Gouldthorpe and Paul Kehoe are entitled to receive an annual contribution of 10% of basic salary to their respective personal pension plans.
Due to Inland Revenue maximum funding limits, the Company was unable to make its full contractual contribution of 15% of salary 45,000 to Caroline Prices pension during the financial year.
Instead it paid 34,730 to her pension during the year, which was the maximum that the Company was permitted to make under current Inland Revenue regulations.
The balance owed to her pension is 10,270.
It is the Companys intention to pay this amount into her personal pension in April 2006 once the governments proposed revision of pension arrangements outlined in the Chancellors budget in March 2004 comes into force.
The Company anticipates that it will need to adopt a similar approach for the financial year ending 31 March 2005.
Share ownership The Companys philosophy is to link the personal interests of the executive directors with those of shareholders through share ownership.
The Group has historically operated executive share option schemes, participation in which was open to executive directors and senior employees.
Performance graph The Companys TSR is defined as share price growth plus reinvested dividends.
For shareholders information, the Companys TSR performance for the five years to 31 March 2004 is shown on the graph below compared with the performance achieved by the FTSE 350 Transport Index.
The Committee believes that the FTSE 350 Transport Index is the most relevant benchmark to allow a meaningful assessment of the Companys performance within its sector.
TBI vs FTSE 350 Transport sector 1999-2004 TBI Total Return Index 140 FTSE 350 Transport Total Return Index 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 Dec-99 Dec-00 Dec-01 Dec-02 Dec-03 TBI Performance Share Related Plan The Committee has, with the assistance of New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, recently carried out a review of long-term incentive provision afforded to the executive directors and other key employees of the Company.
The main conclusion of this review is that the Companys current executive share option schemes details of which can be found on pages 30 and 31 should be replaced with a new Performance Share Plan the Plan, which will normally operate as the sole long-term incentive arrangement for the Companys executive directors and senior employees.
The main features of the Plan can be found in the Chairmans letter to shareholders dated 10 June 2004 and appropriate resolutions will be put to the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
In summary, awards may be made under the new Plan over shares worth up to 100% of a participants salary each year.
The vesting of awards is subject to a Total Shareholder Return TSRbased performance condition which compares TBIs TSR against that of the FTSE All-Share Transport sector over the three year period from grant.
The Committee has chosen this performance condition as it believes it appropriate for executives to be encouraged to generate returns to shareholders greater than the Companys sector peers.
The extent to which the performance condition is satisfied will be determined by the Committee, although the calculations will be undertaken by external consultants to ensure independent verification.
Details of the executive share option schemes and their performance conditions are provided as part of the disclosure on directors holdings.
TBI Annual report and accounts 2004 TBI Sharesave Scheme The scheme was adopted on 7 August 1998 and was approved by the Inland Revenue on 1 September 1998 under the provisions of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
Invitations to participate in the scheme are made periodically to permanent employees, including directors, who have been with the Group for at least one year.
Those who choose to participate save between 5 and 250 per month for a three year period after which they may use their savings to exercise an option to buy shares in the Company at a price determined at the start of the savings period.
The last invitation to participate in the scheme was made in November 2001.
Contributions to the scheme commenced in December 2001 and the options may be exercised between 1 January 2005 and 30 June 2005 at an exercise price of 52.65 pence.
Any previous options issued under the scheme have lapsed.
Service contracts The details of the service contracts of the executive directors are as follows: Contract date Notice period Contractual termination payments KM Brooks 27 October 1994 24 months Salary benefits payment in lieu of notice LD Gouldthorpe 15 March 1999 12 months Salary benefits payment in lieu of notice P Kehoe 29 May 2002 12 months Salary benefits payment in lieu of notice CF Price 14 September 1995 12 months Salary benefits payment in lieu of notice The executive directors contracts are on a rolling basis.
None of the contracts are for a fixed term.
The Committee has carefully considered Keith Brooks 24-month notice period and has discussed it with him.
It takes the view that it would not be in the interests of shareholders to renegotiate his contract, but will keep the matter under review.
None of the non-executive directors had a service contract during the year, but subsequent to the year end service contracts have been entered into for fixed terms as follows, each subject to three months notice of termination and retirement by rotation and re-election at AGMs, or annual re-election after nine years of service: Contract date Term expires GS Thomas 22 May 2004 28 March 2006 CT Scott 28 May 2004 14 May 2007 DG Jones 7 June 2004 13 December 2004 TBI Annual report and accounts 2004 28 29 Directors Remuneration Report continued The following disclosures in this report contain information that is subject to audit.

Notes 1 Granted under the TBI plc 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme.
This scheme has been approved by the Inland Revenue under the provisions of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
Options granted to individuals will normally be exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of grant.
The exercise of these options is primarily subject to the following performance criteria: For grants before December 1998: The increase in the Companys share price must fall within the top 40% of companies when ranked against the increase in the share prices of a peer group of companies in the property sector from the date of grant to the third anniversary of the date of grant.
The peer group of companies were as follows: Allied London, Argent, Asda Property, Birkby, Capital & Regional, Chesterfield, Derwent Valley, Evans of Leeds, Greycoat, Hambro Countrywide, Helical Bar, Mucklow A&J, Pillar Property Investments, Raglan Property, Scottish Metropolitan, St Modwen, Tops Estates, Town Centre, Waites City of London and Warner Estates.
At the time that these share options were granted, TBI was classified in the property sector and so a peer group of property companies was the most appropriate benchmark.
For grants during and since December 1998: The Companys TSR must fall within the top 50% when ranked against the TSRs of those companies which made up the FTSE 250 Index on the date of grant.
The TSRs of the Company and its comparator group may be measured over any three year rolling period between that date of grant and ending on the tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
Measurement of TSR performance may be done every three months after the initial three year period.
Provided the performance criterion has been satisfied over any three year period, an option may be exercised at any time during its life.
2 Granted under the TBI plc 1995 Unapproved Executive Share Super-Option Scheme.
Options granted under this scheme will be exercisable between the fifth and seventh anniversaries of the first day of the accounting period in which the date of grant fell.
The exercise of these options is primarily subject to the following performance criteria: For grants before December 1998: The increase in the Companys share price must fall within the top 25% of companies when ranked against the increase in the share prices of a peer group of companies in the property sector from the date of grant to the fifth anniversary of the date of the first day of the accounting period in which the date of grant fell.
The same peer group of companies were used as given above for grants before December 1998 under the TBI plc 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme.
For grants during and since December 1998: The Companys TSR must fall within the top 30% when ranked against the TSRs of those companies which made up the FTSE 250 Index on the date of grant.
The TSRs of the Company and its comparator group may be measured over any five year rolling period between the date of grant and ending on the seventh anniversary of the date of grant.
Measurement of TSR performance may be done every three months after the initial five year period.
Provided the performance criterion has been satisfied over any five year period, an option may be exercised at any time during its life.
3 Granted under the TBI plc 1998 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme.
The Finance Act 1996 restricted the value of options which could be granted to an individual under the 1995 Approved Scheme to 30,000.
The 1998 Unapproved Scheme was adopted on 7 August 1998 and allows options with a value up to four times an individuals eligible earnings to be granted, this being the limit which, but for the Finance Act 1996, would have been applied under the 1995 Approved Scheme.
The same performance criterion applies under this scheme as for grants during and since December 1998 under the 1995 Approved Scheme.
4 In order to resolve an oversight in the year ended March 1996, the Remuneration Committee agreed to provide a combination of further options and cash bonuses to Keith Brooks and Caroline Price: some of these options have since lapsed.
In the case of those options that remain, a cash bonus is payable on exercise.
The cash bonus is calculated as half the number of options exercised multiplied by the difference between 67.50p and 53.00p, which was the exercise price originally intended by the Committee.
5 These options have satisfied their performance criteria.
TBI Annual report and accounts 2004 The market price of the Companys shares at the end of the financial year was 67.25p and the market price during the year was in the range 42.75p to 72.50p.
In addition to the above, Paul Kehoe, Caroline Price and Larry Gouldthorpe each held 18,043 options under the TBI Sharesave Scheme, which were granted in December 2001.
These options will be exercisable in 2005 at an exercise price of 52.65p.
The Companys register of directors interests, which is open to inspection, contains full details of directors shareholdings and options to subscribe.
