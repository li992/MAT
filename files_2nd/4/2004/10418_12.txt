com 59 Executive share options The table below shows the options which remained outstanding under the share option element of the Portfolio held by Directors during the year ended 31 March 2004.
Vesting is subject to the satisfaction of corporate performance criteria as detailed on page 60.
The table also shows options over BT shares held by David Varney, David McGlade and Kent Thexton prior to demerger.
These were regranted over mmO 2 shares as indicated.
David McGlades legacy options were awarded in the form of ADSs one ADS 10 mmO shares at $23.243 per 2 2 ADS, and vest in three equal annual tranches on the first, second and third anniversaries of grant.
Kent Thextons legacy share options lapsed in full on 31 March 2004.
2 The options granted to David McGlade on 23 November 2001 were in the form of ADSs one ADS 10 mmO shares at $11.873 per ADS.
2 3 On resigning as a Director of mmO on 4 February 2004, the Remuneration Committee permitted Kent Thexton to retain his options for the maximum periods referred to in the final 2 column above.
The exercisability of these options is dependent on the applicable performance targets being met, and on Mr Thextons compliance with certain obligations under his consultancy agreement including restrictive covenants.
4 The options granted to Kent Thexton on 23 November 2001 vest in two equal annual tranches on the first and second anniversaries of grant and can be retested on two subsequent occasions.
Vesting of each tranche is dependent on mmO s TSR performance against the comparator group.
No part of the first and second tranches of options have vested to date as 2 the performance target has not been met.
Performance will be retested for the final time in respect of the first tranche at 18 November 2004.
Performance will be retested in respect of the second tranche at 18 November 2004 and 2005, if necessary.
5 The vesting of the options granted to Kent Thexton on 25 July 2002 is dependent on mmO s TSR performance against the comparator group at 18 July 2005.
Performance may be 2 retested at 18 July 2006, if necessary.
com Report on directors remuneration No share options were granted during the year, and no options were exercised by executive Directors during the year.
Unrealised gains on executive share options were nil as at 31 March 2004.
Options granted previously were granted on terms that they normally become exercisable on the third anniversary of grant subject to the TSR of the Company compared with the TSR performance of the companies in the FTSE 100.
For options granted in the year ended 31 March 2003, the first performance test is expected to be in July 2005.
If the performance goal is not satisfied in full after this period, it can be retested on two subsequent occasions, on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant, extending the length of the performance period at each test.
The proportion of options that can be exercised will increase if the Companys TSR performance improves between the test dates.
TSR performance from 18 July 2002 the start of the performance period to 31 March 2004 places mmO at first position within the comparator group.
For options granted in the year ended 2 31 March 2002, the first performance test is expected to be in November 2004.
TSR performance from 19 November 2001 the start of the performance period to 31 March 2004 places mmO at 31st position within the comparator group.
As noted above, these options will only 2 become exercisable in full if the Companys TSR performance meets the relevant target at one of the test dates described above.
Should options be granted in the future, we will have regard to best practice at the time on retesting and performance conditions.

Former long-term incentives BT Legacy Share Awards A number of key employees of mmO were participants in BT share plans prior to demerger.
The awards made under these plans have been 2 adjusted so that they relate solely to mmO shares, and any performance measure has been translated into a measure of mmO performance 2 2 from demerger to the end of the performance period.
On vesting, these awards will be satisfied in existing mmO shares held by an 2 employee trust which has already been funded by BT.
No further awards will be made under these plans to mmO employees.
2 mmO Legacy Option Plan 2 Subsisting options over BT shares granted under BT executive share option plans have been replaced with options over mmO shares, 2 granted under the mmO Legacy Option Plan, for those participants now employed by mmO.
The replacement options were granted on the 2 2 same terms, and are exercisable between the same dates, as the options for which they were exchanged.
There are no performance conditions relating to the vesting of these options other than continued employment with the mmO Group.
2 This reects the terms of the underlying BT option plan.
The legacy options will be satisfied using new issue shares, and options granted under this plan do not count towards the dilution limits established for mmO share option plans.
com Report on directors remuneration Cash-based incentives Prior to demerger, a variety of cash-based incentive plans operated in the mmO businesses in the UK, Germany and Ireland and also 2 within O Online.
mmO has taken steps to terminate some plans early and does not intend to renew the others when they reach the end 2 2 of their performance periods.
Under a plan introduced by O Germany in November 2000, eligible employees are entitled, no earlier than April 2004 and no later than 2 April 2007, to a payment based on the value of the goodwill of O Germany at that time.
Payment is only made if O Germany achieves 2 2 positive EBITDA in the financial year prior to payment.
As at 31 March 2004, the value of the goodwill of O Germany was such that these 2 awards have no value.
Under a plan operated by O Ireland, key employees and management are entitled to cash payments by reference to the performance 2 of O Ireland up to the date of payment.
The final payment in respect of this plan was made in the year ended 31 March 2004.
2 All participation has ceased and no further awards will be made.
