Caledonia Investments plc 34 Annual report 2004 Directors remuneration report This report has been prepared to comply with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations.
The tables included in the statements below on directors remuneration, pensions and share options have been audited.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is a standing committee of the board consisting solely of independent non-executive directors.
Its current membership comprises Mr M E T Davies chairman, Mr C M Allen-Jones and Mr J R H Loudon.
Mr P N Buckley, Mr T C W Ingram, Mr D G F Thompson and Major M G Wyatt also attended certain meetings of the Committee by invitation, although none were present when their own remuneration was discussed.
The Committee, whose written terms of reference are published on the companys website and are available on request from the company secretary, has been established for the following purposes: 1. to determine and agree with the board the framework and broad policy for the remuneration of the executive directors and such other members of the executive management as it is requested by the board to consider and to review the on-going appropriateness and relevance of the remuneration policy: 2. to approve the design of, and determine targets for, any performance related pay schemes operated by the company and to approve the total annual payments made under such schemes: 3. to review the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the board and shareholders and, for any such plans, to determine each year whether awards will be made and, if so, the overall amount of such awards, the individual awards to executive directors and other senior executives and the performance targets to be used: 4. within the terms of the agreed policy, to determine the total individual remuneration packages of each executive director and if requested by the board, other senior executives including, where appropriate, bonuses, incentive payments, share options and other awards: 5. to determine the policy for and scope of pension arrangements, service agreements, termination payments and compensation commitments for executive directors and, if requested by the board, other senior executives: and 6. to review and assess annually the remuneration trends across the company.
References to executive directors also include the chairman.
In determining such policies and individual remuneration packages, the Committee has given full consideration to the provisions of section 1.
1 of the Combined Code published in 1998.
During the year, the Committee received advice from Hay Group, a firm of independent remuneration consultants appointed by the company, assessing the comparability of the companys remuneration policies and individual remuneration packages with the marketplace and from Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in relation to directors service contracts.
Hay Group only advised in relation to the remuneration of executive directors and senior management and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer are the companys main legal advisers.
The Committee also consulted with the chairman and chief executive in relation to the remuneration of all of the executive directors other than their own.
Internal support was provided to the Committee by the company secretary.
Remuneration policy for executive directors The companys policy on executive directors remuneration is to provide remuneration packages which are sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate executive directors of the quality needed to manage and grow the company successfully, and in particular to deliver the companys financial aim of achieving consistently over the longer term, using five and ten year measurements, a total shareholder return in excess of the FTSE All-Share Total Return.
The companys objective for the year to 31 March 2005 and subsequent financial years is to continue to weight total remuneration more towards performance related elements, with proportionately lower basic salaries, but with potential for higher performance related awards subject to more demanding performance criteria.
In this way, the company believes that the remuneration of its executive directors will be further aligned with the performance of the company and therefore with the interests of shareholders.
The Regulations require that the directors remuneration report contains a statement on the companys policy on directors remuneration for the following financial year and for financial years subsequent to that.
Whilst it is intended that the policy statement set out in this report should continue to apply for the year to 31 March 2005 and for subsequent years, and the Committee is able to state its remuneration policy for the year to 31 March 2005 with reasonable certainty, it is less certain that this policy will continue without amendment in subsequent financial years.
This is because the Remuneration Committee considers that an effective remuneration policy needs to be sufficiently flexible to take account of future changes in the companys business environment and in remuneration practice.
Any changes in policy for financial years after 31 March 2005 will be described in future directors remuneration reports, which will continue to be subject to shareholder approval.
All statements in this report in relation to remuneration policy for years after 31 March 2005 should be read in this light.
Caledonia Investments plc 35 Annual report 2004 Policy on individual components of executive directors remuneration Basic salary and benefits Basic salary is determined by the Remuneration Committee by reference to the experience and responsibilities of the director concerned and taking into account external market research.
The companys policy is to pay salaries and other benefits which are competitive, but not excessive, in relation to the marketplace.
The company provides a range of benefits, such as company cars, life insurance, permanent health insurance, and private medical cover.
Company cars are however being phased out and replaced by cash alternatives.
Bonus The company operates a discretionary annual bonus scheme for executive directors, which takes into account both the performance of individual directors and of the company over the short and medium term.
The policy for the year ended 31 March 2004 was that bonuses of up to a maximum of 60% of basic salary may be awarded, dependent on the level of the outperformance of Caledonias net asset value per share with dividends added back over the FTSE All-Share Total Return index, measured over 1 and 3 years, and on the individual directors performance.
Any such awards are subject to the overriding discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee may also award bonuses outside the terms of the companys annual bonus scheme.
No bonus payments are pensionable.
Pensions The companys policy on pension provision is to provide a means whereby executive directors either receive a pension at retirement age from the company, or are funded to operate their own money purchase pension plans or other arrangements.
The executive directors, other than Mr T C W Ingram and Mr J M May, participate in the Caledonia Pension Scheme, which is a defined benefits scheme and is contributory for employees who joined the company after 1 April 1988, but which is now closed to new members.
The scheme provides a pension of up to two-thirds of final pensionable salary on retirement dependent on length of service and also provides for dependants pensions and lump sums on death-in-service.
All of the executive directors participating in the scheme, other than Mr J H Cartwright, transferred into the scheme from The Union-Castle Line Superannuation Scheme which was noncontributory, and this status has been preserved.
Mr Ingram and Mr May do not participate in any company pension scheme, but instead a fixed percentage of basic salary is paid into personal pension arrangements or as a cash supplement, which is inclusive of associated income tax and national insurance costs.
The percentage of basic salary is 25% for Mr Ingram and 10% for Mr May.
It is the companys policy that any future executive directors recruited from outside the company will be funded to operate their own pension arrangements and that the company will not offer participation in any defined benefits arrangements.
Share options A key objective of the companys remuneration policy is to motivate executive directors to deliver long term shareholder value.
The Remuneration Committee believes that this is best achieved through the grant of share options in addition to annual salary and bonus, as these provide the opportunity to build a meaningful shareholding in the company and link individual reward with corporate performance over the longer term.
It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee to grant options to directors and other senior employees at a level commensurate with their individual duties and responsibilities.
The maximum exercise price of options that can be granted to any executive under the companys share option schemes is equal to four times total annual emoluments.
Option grants are phased and no options are granted at a discount.
The Remuneration Committee may establish special arrangements for individual executive directors where it considers it necessary to do so to secure their appointment.
Special option terms were agreed with Mr T C W Ingram and Mr J M May in connection with their recruitment to the company, as described on page 40.
Caledonia Investments plc 36 Annual report 2004 Directors remuneration report continued Policy on executive directors service contracts It is the policy of the company that no executive director should be offered a service contract that cannot be determined within one year or which contains provision for predetermined compensation in excess of one years total emoluments.
All existing directors service contracts comply with this policy.
Policy on external non-executive directorships held by executive directors It is the companys policy to allow executive directors to hold external non-executive directorships unrelated to the companys business, provided that the time commitment required is not material.
Normally the company will retain any fees arising from such non-executive directorships, but may permit the executive director to retain fees in certain circumstances.
Details of any such fees retained by executive directors are disclosed on page 37.
Policy on non-executive directors remuneration and terms of appointment It is the companys policy that non-executive directors should be appointed for fixed periods of no more than three years from the next general meeting following their initial appointment in the case of new non-executive directors and that re-appointment at the end of such periods should not be automatic.
Non-executive directors are paid an annual fee determined by the board as a whole within the overall limit contained in the articles of association, but do not receive any other benefits for their service as non-executive directors from the company.
The basic fee for non-executive directors was 26,000 2003 25,000 and fees of 3,000 per annum 2003 nil were paid for the chairmanships of the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
Non-executive directors may also be paid additional fees agreed by the board where they have performed services that, in the opinion of the board, are over and above their normal duties.
The company is entitled to terminate a non-executive directors appointment at any time without compensation.
Performance graph The graph below shows the companys total shareholder return TSR against that of the FTSE All-Share Total Return index for the five financial periods ending on 31 March 2004 and has been prepared in accordance with the Regulations.
TSR has been calculated assuming that all dividends are reinvested on their ex-dividend date.
The FTSE All-Share Total Return index has been chosen as it is the benchmark by which the company measures its delivery of shareholder value over the longer term.

Benefits mainly comprised cars or cash alternatives, fuel for private mileage and private medical cover.
The fees in respect of Mr L A W Evans for 2003 were paid to Lazard & Co Services Ltd.
Included in the 2004 bonus for Sir David Kinloch was an amount of 58,875 paid outside the terms of the companys annual bonus scheme.
This was an award made to Sir David by the Remuneration Committee in recognition of his stewardship of the companys interest in ISIS Asset Management and his contribution to the development of that companys business.
In addition to the amounts shown above, Mr T C W Ingram was paid an amount of 42,265, before tax, in lieu of contributions to his personal money purchase pension arrangements as described in the statement on directors pensions below.
Certain executive directors also hold external non-executive directorships unrelated to the companys business, where it has been agreed that they may retain the fees arising therefrom.
Mr T C W Ingram is a non-executive director of Sage Group, for which he receives an annual fee of 30,000.
Mr Ingram was appointed to the board of Sage Group before he joined Caledonia.
Sir David Kinloch was receiving an annual fee of 11,000 as a non-executive director of JPMorgan Fleming Chinese Investment Trust at the time he ceased to be an executive director of Caledonia on 1 February 2004.
He has since retired from the board of this investment trust.
Mr J M May is chairman of Covenant Healthcare, which pays a fee of 20,000 per annum for his services to a private company owned by Mr May and his wife.
Mr May was appointed to this position prior to his joining Caledonia.
Caledonia Investments plc 38 Annual report 2004 Directors remuneration report continued Statement on directors pensions audited Pension benefits accrued by directors during the year under the companys defined benefits scheme were as follows: Transfer value of increase in Change in Increase in accrued pension transfer value Accrued Increase in accrued pension over the year, Transfer value of Transfer value of over the year, pension accrued pension during the year, net of directors accrued pension accrued pension net of directors at 31.03.04 during the year net of inflation contributions at 31.03.04 at 31.03.03 contributions Name 1 pa 2 pa 3 pa 4 5 6 7 P N Buckley 225,649 11,023 5,443 92,379 3,829,722 3,566,839 262,883 J H Cartwright 86,770 9,156 7,138 75,603 1,032,844 709,210 314,274 The Hon C W Cayzer 64,166 4,813 3,270 36,126 708,894 504,051 204,843 Sir David Kinloch 218,611 14,327 10,693 182,628 3,733,705 3,481,561 252,144 1.
Except for Sir David Kinloch, the accrued pensions were the amounts that would be paid at normal retirement age, ignoring any revaluation, if the director left service at the relevant date.
Sir David Kinloch retired on 31 January 2004 and his pension has been calculated as at that date.
The increase in accrued pension, net of inflation, in column 3 is calculated by subtracting the pension accrued to 31 March 2003, multiplied by the increase in the Retail Prices Index for the year to 31 March 2004, or earlier date of retirement, from the accrued pension to 31 March 2004, or earlier date of retirement.
The transfer value shown in column 4 represented the value of the increase in accrued pension during the year, as set out in column 3, minus directors contributions.
The change in transfer value over the year shown in column 7 calculated as column 5 less column 6 and any directors contributions reflected the impact on transfer values of factors beyond the control of the company and the directors, such as movements in stock markets.
These can cause transfer values at different points in time to fluctuate significantly.
Disclosed changes in value may therefore be subject to a large degree of volatility and may even be negative.
The transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the guidance note GN11, published by the Institute of Actuaries and Faculty of Actuaries.
During the year, the company made contributions to a money purchase personal pension plan for the benefit of Mr T C W Ingram of 29,700, being the maximum amount permitted for this tax year under Inland Revenue limits.
In accordance with his service contract, Mr Ingram elected to receive the balance of his agreed pension entitlement by way of cash payment of 42,265, before tax, in lieu of pension contribution.
The company also made contributions to a money purchase pension plan for the benefit of Mr J M May of 15,606, in respect of the period from the date of his appointment on 1 September 2003.
Caledonia Investments plc 40 Annual report 2004 Directors remuneration report continued Statement on directors share options unaudited The company has two executive share option schemes an original scheme established in 1988 and which expired in April 1998 for the purposes of new option grants, and a 1998 scheme approved by shareholders in July 1998, under which option grants commenced in September 1998.
Under the terms of both schemes, options may be exercised between three and ten years after the date of grant, although only one third of the shares comprised in an option may be exercised after three years from grant, with the remaining two thirds becoming exercisable six years after grant.
Options may only be exercised if a performance target is met.
All targets for options granted under the original scheme, which related to the companys earnings per share growth or the performance of its adjusted net asset value per share against external benchmarks, have now been achieved.
For options granted from 1998 to 2001 under the 1998 scheme, the target requires the companys adjusted net asset value per share to outperform either the Retail Price Index by 3% per annum, or the average of the increases in the FTSE 250 and the FT Investment Companies indices, over a consecutive three year period prior to exercise.
For options granted in 2002 and 2003, the performance target is as above, except that the FTSE All-Share index is used as the reference index rather than the FTSE 250 and FT Investment Companies indices.
Since the year end, the Remuneration Committee has resolved to apply more demanding performance targets for future option grants under the 1998 scheme.
These will require that 50% of the shares comprised in an option will vest if the companys net asset value per share outperforms the Retail Price Index by 3% per annum over the relevant measurement period, with the other 50% vesting if the companys net asset value per share outperforms the FTSE All-Share index over the relevant measurement period.
The performance measure has to be achieved either over the first three years, or over the first four years, after the date of grant.
If the performance measure is not achieved four years after the date of grant, the options will lapse.
The performance targets have been met for all options granted under the 1998 scheme from 1998 to 2001.
The Remuneration Committee has selected the targets referred to above because it believes they provide an appropriate benchmark of the companys longer term performance.
Included in Mr Ingrams options granted on 5 July 2002 are options over 83,000 shares granted outside the 1998 scheme and on the following special performance-related terms.
As in the case of options granted under the 1998 scheme, only one third of the shares under these special options are exercisable three years after grant, with the remaining two thirds becoming exercisable six years after grant.
The special options are subject to a stretching performance condition requiring Caledonias total shareholder return share price growth plus the value of reinvested dividends TSR to outperform the FTSE All-Share Total Return index Index over the measurement period, which commenced on the date of grant.
A tranche will vest in full if Caledonias TSR exceeds that of the Index by an average of at least 2% per annum over the relevant measurement period.
If Caledonias TSR equals that of the Index, none of that tranche will be exercisable and there will be proportionate vesting of a tranche if Caledonias TSR exceeds that of the Index by an average of between zero and 2% per annum.
For the one third tranche, the performance measure will be first applied three years after grant, with two re-test opportunities four and five years after grant.
For the two thirds tranche, the performance measure will be first applied five years after grant, with two re-test opportunities six and seven years after grant.
If Mr Ingram remains in service until retirement at age 62, the option will remain exercisable until ten years from grant if the performance conditions are met.
Otherwise, Mr Ingram must normally be in employment to be able to exercise the options.
The shares required to satisfy Mr Ingrams special options will be transferred from the Caledonia Investments plc Employee Share Trust.
The remaining terms of the special options are based on the rules of the 1998 scheme, and include provisions that any benefits obtained from the special options will not be pensionable and that the terms of the special options will not normally be capable of amendment to the advantage of the option holder without the prior approval of shareholders in general meeting.
Mr May joined the company on 1 September 2003.
In accordance with the terms of his recruitment, there are included in Mr Mays options granted on 20 November 2003 options over 28,000 shares granted outside the 1998 scheme.
The performance conditions and other terms of these options are the same as those set out above for Mr Ingram save that Mr Mays options are not subject to preservation on retirement in the manner described above for Mr Ingram.
These options were in addition to options over 28,000 shares granted to Mr May on the same date under the 1998 scheme.
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that this special option arrangement, which is subject to more stringent performance conditions than those which apply to the 1998 scheme, is appropriate and aligns Mr Mays interests with those of shareholders.
As this was a special arrangement to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, Mr Mays recruitment as an executive director, shareholders approval was not required by virtue of paragraph 13.13A of the Listing Rules.
The circumstances were unusual because the Remuneration Committee considered it essential to secure Mr Mays services by providing him with a performance-related option package on these special terms.
The Remuneration Committee also considered it appropriate that Mr Ingram and Mr May should be subject to similar long-term incentive arrangements.
At 31 March 2004, the market price of the companys shares was 1017.0p 2003 642.5p and the range during the year was 642.5p to 1081.0p.
Caledonia Investments plc 41 Annual report 2004 Statement on directors service contracts and non-executive directors letters of appointment Executive directors have service contracts with Caledonia Group Services Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, details of which are summarised below: Name Date of contract Notice period Unexpired term P N Buckley 11.06.02 12 months Rolling 12 months T C W Ingram 11.06.02 12 months Rolling 12 months J H Cartwright 11.06.02 12 months Rolling 12 months The Hon C W Cayzer 11.06.02 12 months Rolling 12 months J M May 01.09.03 12 months Rolling 12 months During the year, Sir David Kinloch was also employed by Caledonia Group Services Ltd under a service contract dated 11 June 2002, which terminated on his retirement from full time employment on 31 January 2004.
Directors service contracts contain provisions whereby the company may in its discretion terminate the contract without notice and make a payment in lieu of notice to the director and whereby a liquidated sum is payable by the company in the event of termination within one year following a change of control.
Any such payment in lieu of notice or liquidated sum would be equivalent to no more than one years total emoluments.
The service contracts of the directors, other than Mr Ingrams and Mr Mays, also contain provisions whereby, in the event of a payment in lieu of notice or payment of a liquidated sum on termination, the director concerned would also be entitled to an increase in his pensionable service equivalent to the unexpired period of notice under his contract.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts, but are appointed under letters of appointment which provide for termination without notice or compensation.
The directors remuneration report was approved by the board on 19 May 2004 and signed on its behalf by: M E T Davies Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
