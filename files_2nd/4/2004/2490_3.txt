For illustrative purposes only, the share price on 25 February 2005, being the latest practicable date prior to publication, was 958.5p, valuing the vesting awards as follows: Award Award Awards lapsing vesting vesting number number illustrative of shares of shares value P N Adams 27,922 54,199 519,497 P A Rayner 22,337 43,359 415,599 A Monteiro fide Castro 22,335 43,356 415,562 Total 72,594 140,914 1,350,658 4 The performance conditions applicable to the awards that vested on 12 March 2004 and will vest on 20 March 2005 relate to an apportionment between measures relating to Total Shareholder Return TSR and eps based criteria with reference to a three year performance period.
TSR combines both the share price and dividend performance of the Company as set against two comparator groups: a the FTSE 100 Index at the beginning of the performance period: and b a peer group of FMCG companies.
A total of 50 per cent of the total award is based upon each of two separate measures 25 per cent for each measure.
25 per cent of the total award vests in full in the event of upper quartile performance by the Company relative to one of the comparator groups, 7.5 per cent of the total award will vest in the event of median performance and then pro rata between these two points.
The eps measure applies to 50 per cent of the award.
50 per cent of the award will vest if eps growth over the three year performance period is an average of at least 9 per cent per annum in excess of ination: 10 per cent will vest if the same gure is at least 3 per cent in excess of ination and an award will vest pro rata between these two points.
Similar criteria attach to the awards made on 20 March 2002, 19 March 2003 and 12 March 2004, except that eps growth of at least 8 per cent per annum in excess of ination is required for 50 per cent of the award to vest.
5 There have been no variations in the terms and conditions of the LTIP interests during the year.
6 The awards made in March 2003 and March 2004 are due to vest in March 2006 and March 2007 respectively.
At 31 December 2004, the performance percentage reecting performance to date was 47.6 per cent for the March 2003 award and 61.3 per cent for the March 2004 award.

During the year, his outstanding awards under the LTIP vested to the extent and on the dates shown below in accordance with the LTIP rules.
The closing mid-market price of ordinary shares in British American Tobacco p. l. c. on the exercise dates of 12 March 2004 and 18 August 2004 were 803.5p and 817.0p respectively.
Executive Directors pension entitlements audited The following Directors were members of dened benefit schemes provided by the Group during the year.
Pension entitlements and corresponding transfer values increased as follows during the year: Total Gross Increase Transfer value Transfer value Transfer value accrued increase in in accrued of net increase of accrued of accrued Total change in pension at accrued pension net in accrual pension at pension at transfer value 1 2 3 3 3 Normal 31 Dec 2004 pension of ination over period 31 Dec 2003 31 Dec 2004 during period retirement age P N Adams 60 285,311 44,201 35,762 463,093 2,691,442 3,694,562 1,003,120 P A Rayner 60 39,723 15,523 14,676 181,555 256,990 491,421 234,431 A Monteiro fide Castro 60 229,972 56,810 50,749 933,310 2,820,526 4,229,326 1,408,800 Director retired in 2004 5 M F Broughton 59 689,925 27,522 4,338 89,348 10,744,786 11,660,520 915,734 Notes: 1 The amount of total accrued pension is the pension that would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year, excluding any increases granted under statute before retirement.
2 The value of net increase in accrued pension represents the incremental value to the Director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption that service is terminated at the year end.
3 Changes in the transfer values reect both individual Directors circumstances such as the date of joining the Pension Fund and changes in salary during the year together with the application of market value adjustments in accordance with actuarial and legislative requirements.
Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with section 1.5 of version 9.1 of Actuarial Guidance Note GN11 issued by the actuarial profession.
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the Pension Fund would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the Pension Funds liability in respect of Directors pension benets.
They do not represent sums payable to individual Directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
Further, although Antonio Monteiro fide Castro is not a member of the Pension Fund, the transfer values calculated above have been calculated in accordance with Guidance Note GN11.
4 The Pension Fund is non-contributory: voluntary contributions paid by Directors and resulting benets are not shown.
No excess retirement benets have been paid to or are receivable by any Director or past Director of the Company.
5 Martin Broughton retired on 30 June 2004, aged 57, and became entitled to a pension in accordance with the rules of the Pension Fund.
At this time he was entitled to exchange part of his pension for a cash lump sum.
The gure shown above for Martin Broughtons total accrued pension at 31 December 2004 is stated on the assumption that he did not commute any of his pension for cash thereby giving a disclosure consistent with the accrued pension gure for the comparative year ended 31 December 2003.
The increase in the accrued pension and the transfer value of the net increase over the period is based on the pre-commutation pension.
The actual benets paid to Martin Broughton following his retirement and the associated values are set out below: Pension entitlement as at 30 June 2004 689,925 per annum Tax free lump sum elected 1,643,129 Residual pension payable effective 1 July 2004 566,072 per annum The value of Martin Broughtons pension entitlement of 689,925 per annum calculated as at 31 December 2004 using the same basis as that used in Table 5 amounted to 14,211,746, which would have been an increase of 3,466,959 over the year.
Although the overall pension entitlement increased by only 27,522 per annum, the increase in the transfer value of 3,466,959 results mainly from the employing companys agreement to permit the pension to be paid early without actuarial reduction.
This practice applies to all members of the BAT Section of the Pension Fund retiring with the Companys consent within five years of normal retirement date.
