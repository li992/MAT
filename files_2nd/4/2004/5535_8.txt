Directors Remuneration Report INFORMATION NOT SUBJECT TO AUDIT: Remuneration Committee and advisers The Companys Remuneration Committee is chaired by Mr A J Stewart: its other members comprise Mr M F Garner, Mr D A Harding and Mrs S E Murray.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, on an overall remuneration package for executive directors and other senior managers.
The Remuneration Committee complies with the Combined Code for Corporate Governance of the Financial Services Authority.
This report also complies with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985, which incorporates the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
During the year the Committee and the Company received specific advice on remuneration matters relating to share schemes and the Enterprise Inns Incentive Plans from Ernst & Young LLP E&Y.
E&Y are the Groups auditors and also provide advisory services in respect of non-audit matters and taxation.
The Committee and the Company have also received specific advice on the Enterprise Inns Incentive Plans from CMS Cameron McKenna, the Companys solicitors.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee has appointed New Bridge Street Consultants LLP who provide no other services to the Company save in respect of advice in connection with the operation of the Companys incentive schemes who have undertaken a comprehensive review of and advised on the remuneration packages of the executive team.
Remuneration policy executive directors The Remuneration Committees policy is to ensure that remuneration arrangements at Enterprise allow the Company to attract and retain the exceptional individuals required to continue to enhance shareholder value.
Base salaries will be set accordingly, with a significant proportion of executives remuneration performance related so that appropriate levels of reward are available for outstanding performance.
The Committee will, at all times, be mindful of remuneration practices in other relevant companies.
To achieve this, the remuneration package consists of basic salary and benefits, pensions, performance related cash bonuses and long-term and short-term incentive arrangements under which incentives earned are satisfied by the award of shares.
Consequently, a significant proportion of the executive directors remuneration is linked to performance.
The details of individual components of the remuneration package and service contracts are as follows: Basic salary and benefits: Basic salary is a fixed cash sum payable monthly.
The basic salary and benefits are reviewed annually.
Benefits principally comprise car allowances or the use of a motor car, fuel and private medical insurances.
Pensions: The pension contributions are amounts paid to the directors individual defined contribution schemes.
Current Enterprise Inns Incentive Plans At the Annual General Meeting held on 21 January 1997 an ordinary resolution was passed adopting the Enterprise Inns Incentive Plan the 1997 Plan, which provides for participants to earn non-pensionable cash bonuses and short-term and long-term incentives.
The 1997 Plan rules recite the Companys intention to satisfy all share incentives awarded under the 1997 Plan using ordinary shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust.
At the Annual General Meeting held on 24 January 2002 an ordinary resolution was passed adopting the Enterprise Inns Incentive Plan 2002 the 2002 Plan.
The 2002 Plan has replaced the 1997 Plan and no further awards are to be made under the 1997 Plan.
The 2002 Plan also provides for participants to earn nonpensionable cash bonuses and short-term and long-term share incentives will be satisfied using shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust.
The Company established an Employee Benefit Trust on 26 September 1996.
As at 1 October 2003 the trust, which has been funded by a combination of loans and gifts from the Company, held an unutilised balance of 1,944,006 shares restated to take account of the sub-division of shares from 10 pence to 5 pence per share on 23 January 2004.
The trust has purchased ordinary shares during the year as follows: on 5 July 2004 1,000,000 ordinary shares: on 16 July 2004 1,000,000 ordinary shares: on 9 August 2004 1,000,000 ordinary shares: on 10 August 2004 500,000 ordinary shares: on 2 September 2004 320,000 ordinary shares: and on 9 September 2004 585,000 ordinary shares.
The total cost of these purchases was 24,139,100 net of expenses and was funded by a loan from the Company.
Options over 333,524 shares were exercised on 25 November 2003 and further options over 189,638 shares Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2004 23 Directors Remuneration Report were exercised on 16 September 2004.
It is intended that the remaining 5,825,844 shares held by the Trust will be used to satisfy other awards made under the Enterprise Inns Incentive Plans and other share option schemes.
Under the terms of the current Enterprise Inns Incentive Plans, executive directors can participate in long-term and short-term incentives dependent upon achievement of compound growth in adjusted Earnings Per Share EPS.
The Committee believes that these arrangements provide rewards which reflect an appropriate balance between individual and Group performance and align rewards of directors with the long-term interests of shareholders.
These awards are satisfied by the issue of shares.
Further details are set out below.
Performance related bonuses: Under the terms of the 2002 Plan, executive directors are eligible to participate in an annual cash bonus scheme as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The annual cash bonus is expressed as a percentage of salary calculated by reference to the growth in adjusted EPS growth.
To qualify for any award, the growth of adjusted EPS must exceed the RPI by 2.5% and to qualify for the maximum award of 30% of salary, adjusted EPS growth must exceed the RPI by 15% in the relevant financial year.
Awards between the minimum and maximum limits are calculated on a straight-line basis pro rata to the growth in adjusted EPS growth between the minimum and maximum targets.
The cash bonus awards for the year are shown in the remuneration table on page 27.
Short-term incentive: Under the terms of the 2002 Plan the short-term incentive depends upon achievement of annual growth in adjusted EPS measured against RPI.
There is a one-year performance period for awards.
No short-term award is made unless adjusted EPS growth exceeds RPI by at least 2.5% over the performance period.
To achieve the maximum award of 20% of salary, adjusted EPS growth must exceed RPI by 15%.
Awards between the minimum and maximum limits are calculated on a straight-line basis pro rata to the growth in adjusted EPS between the minimum and maximum targets.
Short-term incentives may not ordinarily be exercised for 36 months after the end of the performance criteria period.
Long-term incentive: Under the 1997 Plan, the long-term incentive awards ordinary shares to participants upon achievement of compound growth in adjusted EPS measured against RPI over 3 years.
To qualify for any award adjusted EPS growth must exceed RPI over a three-year period by 5% compound 15.8% simple, and to qualify for the maximum award of 50% of salary averaged over a three-year period, adjusted EPS growth must exceed RPI over a three-year period by 15% compound 52.1% simple.
Long-term incentives may not ordinarily be exercised until 24 months after the end of the performance criteria period.
Under the 2002 Plan, the long-term incentive awards ordinary shares to participants upon achievement of compound growth in adjusted EPS measured against RPI over 3 years.
To qualify for any award adjusted EPS growth must exceed RPI over a three-year period by 5% compound 15.8% simple, and to qualify for the maximum award of 100% of salary averaged over a three-year period, adjusted EPS growth must exceed RPI over a three year period by 20% compound 72.8% simple.
The participants of the 2002 Plan will bear the cost of any income tax and any primary class 1 or secondary class 1 national insurance contributions for which the Company must account to the Inland Revenue.
Proposed new incentive arrangements As set out in the Chairman of the Remuneration Committees letter, following a comprehensive review of the remuneration packages of the executive team, the Committee proposes that the 2002 Plan be replaced by a new annual bonus plan the Bonus Plan and a new long-term incentive plan the LTIP, shareholder approval for the establishment of which is being sought at the forthcoming AGM.
Summaries of the principal terms of the Bonus Plan and LTIP are set out in the appendix to the Chairman of the Remuneration Committees letter with the relevant sections deemed incorporated into this report.
These new incentive arrangements share many of the features of the existing 2002 Plan.
For example, the Bonus Plan contains a requirement to defer an element of any bonus earned into shares as is the case with the short-term element of the 2002 Plan, with the basic structure of the LTIP broadly similar to the long-term incentive element of the 2002 Plan in that awards over shares may be made that are subject to a sliding scale of targets and which do not vest in full until five years after grant.
24 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2004 Directors Remuneration Report More particularly, the maximum award level under the Bonus Plan for the Chief Executive will be 100% of salary.
For the other executive directors the maximum will be 75% of salary.
The Committee considers this increased annual bonus opportunity appropriate as it ensures that the executive team are fully incentivised to continue to enhance shareholder value.
In addition, it should be noted that awards under the Bonus Plan will be subject to even more demanding targets than those applied to awards under the short-term element of the 2002 Plan taking account of the circumstances prevailing at the relevant time.
No less than 75% of an executives bonus will be subject to a sliding scale of challenging annual adjusted EPS growth targets, with no more than 25% subject to challenging personal targets.
Sixty per cent of any bonus earned will be paid in cash, with the remaining 40% deferred into shares for three years.
The LTIP will have two elements, an award of Performance Shares worth up to 150% of salary each year and an award of Matching Shares linked to the investment of up to 25% of salary worth of Company shares, which are then matched on a 2:1 basis.
Awards vest subject to the satisfaction of a sliding scale of average compound annual adjusted EPS growth targets and the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR performance against the FTSE 100.
More specifically, awards only vest in full if the Companys average compound annual adjusted EPS growth over a three-year performance period following grant is at least 15% and the Companys TSR ranking against the FTSE 100 is in the upper quintile.
Awards vest in three equal tranches on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant.
The Committee believes that it is appropriate for a mixture of adjusted EPS growth and TSR targets to apply to awards made under the LTIP for the following reasons: The adjusted EPS growth targets will encourage the executive team to deliver substantial annual adjusted EPS growth over the three-year performance period.
The TSR targets will require the Company to deliver returns to shareholders in excess of its FTSE 100 peers.
The Committee will seek independent advice to determine the extent to which the adjusted EPS growth and TSR targets are met.
Shareholder approval is also being sought at the forthcoming AGM for the establishment of the Enterprise Inns 2005 Employee Share Option Scheme the ESOS, the Enterprise Inns 2005 Savings Related Share Option Scheme the SAYE scheme and the Enterprise Inns Share Incentive Plan the SIP.
All employees of the Company including executive directors will be eligible to participate in the SAYE scheme and the SIP.
However, it is not the Committees intention to grant options under the ESOS to executives who participate in the LTIP.
Remuneration policy non-executive directors Fees: The fees for non-executive directors are determined by the Board within the limits in the Articles of Association.
The non-executive directors are not involved in any discussions or decision about their own remuneration.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors takes the form solely of fees, which are set by the Board having taken advice on appropriate levels.
Service contracts: The Companys policy is for all executive directors to have a service contract of no fixed term under which they are entitled to receive twelve months notice of termination.
There are no special provisions in the executive directors contracts for compensation in the event of loss of office.
The Committee would consider the circumstances of any individual case of early termination and would determine compensation payments accordingly.
A fair but robust principle of mitigation would be applied to the payment of compensation in the context of professional advice received as to contractual entitlement.
The service contracts of the executive directors include the following terms: Executive Directors Date of Agreement Effective Date Notice Period G E Tuppen 25 October 1995 1 October 1995 12 months D C George 25 October 1995 1 October 1995 12 months G W Harrison 25 October 1995 1 October 1995 12 months W S Townsend 31 October 2000 1 October 2000 12 months Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2004 25 Directors Remuneration report The terms of appointment for Mr H V Reid, Mr M F Garner, Mr A J Stewart, Mr D A Harding and Mrs S E Murray reflect best practice.
Their respective appointments shall continue on an annual basis from AGM to AGM, subject to re-election, when applicable.
In respect of the Chairman and non-executive directors, the dates on which their appointments took effect and the current expiry dates are as follows: Chairman and non-executive directors Date of Appointment Expiry Date H V Reid 21 January 1997 Terminable on 12 months notice M F Garner 29 September 1995 Terminable on 6 months notice A J Stewart 29 May 2001 Terminable on 6 months notice D A Harding 6 November 2003 Terminable on 6 months notice S E Murray 3 November 2004 Terminable on 6 months notice Biographical details of all directors can be found on pages 2 and 3.
Forward-looking statement The Committee will keep the existing remuneration arrangements, as detailed in this report, under review during the next year to ensure that the Companys reward programmes remain competitive and provide appropriate incentives.
