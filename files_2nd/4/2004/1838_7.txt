"Remuneration Report Introduction This years remuneration report is presented to shareholders in accordance with the requirements of the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the ""Regulations""."
In preparing the report the Remuneration Committee has reviewed remuneration policy for executive directors and in so doing has reaffirmed its commitment to ensure that overall remuneration continues to be linked to organisational and individual performance and has a clear alignment with the interests of shareholders.
Remuneration Committee The Committee operates within terms of reference and governance policies approved by the Board and is responsible on behalf of the Board for: determining the service conditions and remuneration of all executive directors: executive remuneration policy: the evaluation of executive director performance with regard to the award of share options, deferred bonus and other performance based remuneration: obtaining independent professional advice in relation to executive director remuneration.
During the year under review the Remuneration Committee has met on five occasions.
Membership and Proceedings of the Remuneration Committee The members of the Remuneration Committee are all non-executive directors and during the year have comprised Mr A E Kilburn Chairman, Mr C G Toner, Mr M Pescod and Mr R J Davies with effect from 5th May 2004.
All Committee members are considered to be wholly independent with no financial interest, other than as shareholders of the Company, in the Committees decisions.
The Group Chief Executive attends meetings of the Committee as required but he is not present when matters affecting his own remuneration are considered.
Other than as expressly identified in this report the Remuneration Committee has complied with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued in June 1998.
The Committee recognises its accountability on executive remuneration to shareholders through this report and in determining future remuneration policy it will consider both the shareholders vote on the report and views expressed by shareholders on the detail of the report.
Advice Advice is provided to the Remuneration Committee by the Company Secretary, Mr L Dent, a practising solicitor.
Mr Dent also acts as secretary to the Committee.
In addition, Watson Wyatt LLP were appointed by the Committee to advise on a range of issues, including the current market positioning of the Groups executive remuneration having regard to a comparator group of other housebuilding companies, including Persimmon, Wimpey, Taylor Woodrow and Bellway.
Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited have advised the Company in relation to various pensions issues and, with effect from 10th July 2004, were appointed to provide actuarial services to the Barratt Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
Remuneration Policy This report details the companys remuneration policy both for 2004 05, and so far as practicable, for subsequent years.
Any changes made to the policy will be identified in subsequent Remuneration Reports to shareholders.
Central to the Group remuneration policy is recognition that the sustained growth and profitability of our business is determined in no short measure by the skill and commitment of the executive team.
The reward policy for executive directors seeks to provide remuneration and other service conditions which will attract, retain, motivate and reward executive directors of the highest calibre within the industrys highly competitive employment market.
Within these broad objectives the executive remuneration package is based on the following principles: the greater part of remuneration paid to executives should be linked to the achievement of demanding performance targets, currently over 50% of the total executive remuneration package is performance based: performance related remuneration should align the interests of executives with those of shareholders by setting performance targets based on measures of shareholder return: total remuneration for outstanding performance should be competitive with that available elsewhere in the sector: executive director remuneration should be determined with due consideration to the rewards and conditions of all Group employees, particularly in relation to the annual review of basic salary.
31 Remuneration Report The Remuneration Package for Executive Directors The remuneration package for executive directors comprises: basic salary: annual profit related bonus: Long-Term Performance Plan: share option scheme: pension and other benefits.
Typically the performance related element of executive remuneration makes up more than 50% of the total package excluding pension benefits.
The performance conditions which apply to the performance related element of executive remuneration are the same for all executive directors and are set out in the following sections of this report.
Basic Salary Basic salaries for executive directors are a fixed annual sum payable monthly in cash.
Salaries are set having regard to individual responsibilities, skills and experience and are currently based on the market median for similar positions in large national housebuilding companies.
Salaries are reviewed each year by the Remuneration Committee and the following were set with effect from 1st July 2004: D A Pretty 416,500 2003 : 400,400 H Walker 300,000 with effect from 1st April 2004 2003 : 250,000 S J Boyes 250,000 2003 : 220,000 C A Dearlove 235,000 2003 : 225,000 C Fenton 250,000 2003 : 175,000 P R Gieron 250,000 2003 : 239,000 G K Hester 250,000 2003 : 239,000 Annual Profit Related Bonus Each executive director also participates in an annual profit related bonus scheme based on the annual level of the Groups pre-tax profit with awards made at 0.1333% of the Groups pre-tax profit for the Group Chief Executive, 0.1165% for the Group Deputy Chief Executive and 0.1% for all other executive directors.
A similar annual bonus scheme is operated for senior management in all Group Regions and Divisions based on a percentage of pre-tax profit for each Region and Division.
As reported in the 2003 Report the annual profit related bonus has been reviewed by the Remuneration Committee.
As a result of this review a minimum profit hurdle must now be achieved before payouts to executive directors commence.
Although this has not been an issue for the business given the sustained profit growth over the last twelve years, this ensures that in the event the profit hurdle is not met in the future for any reason bonus payments will not be made.
Above the minimum profit hurdle bonus payments will be made under a vesting arrangement linked to predetermined profit targets approved by the Remuneration Committee.
"Share Option Schemes In November 1997 the Company adopted the current Executive Share Option Plan the ""Plan""."
The grant of share options under the Plan is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance of the Group.
Options must be held for a minimum of three years from the date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years of grant.
The exercise of options granted under the Plan is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee namely that the growth in the earnings per share of the Company over a period of three consecutive financial years should exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index by at least 6% for options granted in 1997 and 1998 and by at least 9% for those options granted in and since 1999.
In accordance with best practice the Remuneration Committee has reviewed the performance condition and for options granted after 1st July 2004 the three consecutive financial years over which the earnings per share growth target must be met will commence with the financial year during which the options are granted.
If the target is not met over this fixed three-year period then options will lapse.
There will be no retesting of performance.
Pension Benefits All executive directors are members of the Groups defined benefit pension scheme, which is now closed to new entrants.
The scheme entitles the executive directors with the exceptions of Mr D A Pretty, Mr G K Hester and Mr C Fenton to a pension on retirement at age 65 of two thirds of final pensionable salary after 40 years membership of the scheme.
The executive directors are also eligible for dependents pension and an insured lump sum of four times pensionable salary on death in service.
The final pension is calculated from the highest yearly average pensionable salary over three consecutive years during the last ten years of service.
32 Remuneration Report The entitlements of Mr D A Pretty, Mr G K Hester and Mr C Fenton are restricted by the earnings cap imposed under the Finance Act 1989.
Under a contractual arrangement entered into in 1992 Mr D A Prettys pension accrues at the rate of 1 30th but it remains restricted to the earnings cap.
As reported to shareholders in previous remuneration reports, annual profit related bonus is included in the calculation of final pensionable salary.
The Remuneration Committee recognises that for executive directors the inclusion of profit related bonus in the calculation of final pensionable salary requires explanation under the Combined Code for Corporate Governance issued in June 1998.
In this regard the inclusion of profit related bonus in the calculation of pensionable salary is a contractual arrangement of some 25 years standing, which clearly pre-dates the introduction of the Combined Code.
Furthermore, it is an arrangement, which applies equally to all Group management and staff as well as to executive directors.
The Committee is also mindful that apart from the arrangement restricted to the earnings cap provided to Mr D A Pretty no pension enhancements are offered to Group executive directors whereas such executive pension enhancements are commonplace elsewhere in the sector and in the majority of listed companies.
An initial review of the existing pension arrangements has been conducted by the Committee, taking into account the Inland Revenue proposal on the introduction of a lifetime allowance on pensions.
It was anticipated that the Inland Revenue proposal would take effect from 2005.
However this has now been delayed until 2006, reflecting the significant impact that the proposals will have and the process which companies need to go through to assess the impact and then to make and implement decisions addressing the issue.
As a result of the delay in issuing final regulations, and the impact which they will have on Group employees beyond the executive director level, the Remuneration Committee does not intend to implement material changes to the structure of executive pensions, except in relation to Mr D A Pretty, until next year when the final regulations are issued.
This is in accordance with independent advice, which the Committee has taken.
The intention is to deal with the Inland Revenue proposals and the issue relating to the definition of pensionable salary together, so that changes to pension entitlement are only made once.
The Committee believes however, that the particular situation of Mr D A Pretty justifies immediate action.
Mr D A Prettys pension has been subject to the earnings cap since 1990.
Although an individual contractual arrangement was entered into in 1992 under which pension accrues at the rate of 1 30th of the earnings cap, it does not address the significant differential which exists between Mr D A Prettys pension entitlement and that of his peers elsewhere in the sector, as well as between Mr D A Pretty and other Group executive directors with similar service who are not subject to the earnings cap.
Upon his appointment, as Group Chief Executive in October 2002 the Remuneration Committee agreed to review Mr D A Prettys pension arrangements having regard to the extent of this differential.
As the earnings cap is to be replaced for future service under Inland Revenue proposals to introduce a lifetime allowance on pensions, it was anticipated that the new arrangements would have presented alternative options for dealing with the situation, but as stated above implementation of these arrangements has now been delayed.
The Remuneration Committee believes it is important to address the issue in order to secure Mr D A Prettys continued services until his retirement.
There is no intention to compensate for past service, only to put Mr D A Pretty on an equitable footing with the other uncapped executive directors in respect of current and future service.
Based on calculations carried out by the actuary to the Group scheme Mr D A Pretty will receive with effect from 1st July 2003, a supplement equal to 50% of basic salary, as disclosed in the emoluments table below.
This aims to replicate, for future service only as from 1st July 2003, the pension he would be entitled to on an uncapped basis, i. e. 1 60th of pensionable salary.
The pension entitlements for other executive directors will be reviewed over the next year.
Service Contracts All executive directors are engaged on identical terms on the basis of one year rolling contracts which can be terminated by 12 months notice given by the Company or by 12 months notice given by the executive at any time.
There are no specific provisions for compensation on early termination.
The contracts entitle executive directors to the provision of a Company car and membership of a private health care scheme.

The Board has chosen this comparator index as the Group is a constituent of the index along with its major competitors and it is also the index which is used to measure performance under the Long-Term Performance Plan.
Total Shareholder Return - Rebased to 100 01 07 99 - 30 06 04 200 180 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 Barratt Developments FTSE Construction and Building Materials Sector Index 34 Remuneration Report Long-Term Performance Plan As detailed in last years Remuneration Report and in a separate circular to shareholders, a 3 year rolling Long-Term Performance Plan was approved by shareholders at last years Annual General Meeting held in November 2003 to take effect from 1st July 2003.
Awards under the new scheme are based on an annual allocation of notional ordinary shares equivalent to a maximum of 100% of basic salary with vesting taking place at the expiry of the three year performance period of the plan, subject to attainment of the agreed performance targets.
50% of the award will vest on attainment of a performance target based on Basic Earnings Per Share EPS growth and 50% based on Total Shareholder Return TSR.
A vesting schedule has been established so that in terms of EPS growth, the full 50% will vest if EPS growth exceeds the Retail Price Index RPI plus 15% and 10% will vest if EPS growth exceeds RPI plus 10%, with straight line vesting between these two points.
The remaining 50% will vest subject to TSR performance measured against the constituents of the FTSE Construction and Building Materials Sector Index.
Again a vesting schedule has been established so that the full 50% will vest if TSR growth is in the upper quartile of the comparative index and 10% vesting if TSR growth is at the median of the index, with straight line vesting between the two points.
Before any share award vests, independent advice will be taken by the Remuneration Committee to assess whether the performance criteria have been met.
Notional share awards were made under the Scheme on 27th November 2003 at a share price of 510p.

35 Remuneration Report The auditors are required to report on the information detailed in the following part of this report.
The fee in respect of Mr R J Davies was paid directly to Arriva plc.
The executive directors receive taxable benefits in kind covering the provision of a motor vehicle, private medical insurance and some telephone costs.
The increase in the accrued entitlement is the difference between the accrued benefit at the end of the year and that at the previous year end.
The Listing Rules require this to be disclosed excluding inflation.
All transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of the directors pension benefits.
They do not represent sums payable to individual directors and, therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The mid-market high and low share prices of the company during the year were 643.00p and 431.25p respectively.
No options of directors in office at 30th June 2004 lapsed unexercised during the year.
There were no changes in the interests of the directors shown above between 1st July 2004 and the 22nd September 2004.
