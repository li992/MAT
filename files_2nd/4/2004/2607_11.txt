REPORT ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION AND RELATED MATTERS The Board presents its Report on directors remuneration and related matters including details of Total Shareholder Return, Remuneration Policy and of Directors Remuneration.
Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Guy Peyrelongue.
During the financial year to 31 March 2004 the other members were Philip Bowman, Caroline Marland and John Peace.
The Remuneration Committee decides both the level and structure of executive directors pay.
The remuneration of the Chairman and non-executive directors is a matter reserved for the Board as a whole.
The Committee meets at least twice a year and holds additional meetings where necessary.
During the year under review, the committee held three scheduled meetings at which all members were in attendance.
Pay decisions are made on the basis of advice or proposals prepared by the Chairman, the Chief Executive and the Director of Human Resources as appropriate.
In making its decisions, the Remuneration Committee has access to any relevant external adviser appointed on behalf of the Company.
For the year to 31 March 2004, the Companys principal remuneration advisers were Kepler Associates, who were appointed by the Remuneration Committee, and Watson Wyatt.
No other services were provided to the Company by either of these organisations.
Where appropriate, the Remuneration Committee will instigate consultation with major institutional shareholders on remuneration matters.
The constitution and operation of the Remuneration Committee are in compliance with the principles of good governance and Code of Best Practice, set out in the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Total Shareholder Return The following graph shows the total shareholder return for Burberry Group plc compared to the companies in the FTSE 100 Index assuming 100 was invested on 12 July 2002, the date of the IPO.
Although Burberry is a global group, the FTSE 100 Index was selected because Burberrys market capitalisation is close to that of companies at the lower end of the FTSE 100 Index.

The requirements remain the same: to attract, motivate and retain exceptional talent to allow us to compete with the worlds leading luxury brands.
The success of Burberry has drawn attention to the quality of our senior management and recent departures have highlighted the need for strong retention tools.
Furthermore, the majority of our management is from outside the UK.
The four tenets on which our remuneration structure is founded are as follows: 1 Base pay levels and bonuses are established on a market competitive basis.
2 Benefits are based on local market practice for each executive.
3 Performance-related incentives provide the opportunity to deliver substantial rewards for high performance.
4 Pay is closely aligned to shareholders interests and a substantial proportion of remuneration is delivered in Burberry Group plc shares.
Relative importance of elements of remuneration The relative importance of the elements of each of the executive directors remuneration is shown below based on base salaries, target annual bonuses and present fair values of long term incentives for the year to 31 March 2004.
Proportion of total compensation Rose Marie Bravo Michael Metcalf Thomas ONeill Stacey Cartwright Base salary Base salary Base salary Base salary Annual bonus Annual bonus Annual bonus Annual bonus Long term incentives Long term incentives Long term incentives Stacey Cartwrights compensation is based on the month of March 2004.
Implementation of policy Burberry implements its remuneration policy as follows: Base salary To help determine salaries, external remuneration consultants provide data about market salary levels, and advise the Remuneration Committee accordingly.
The Remuneration Committee also takes into account each directors contribution to the business during the year.
Annual bonus Executive directors are eligible for an annual incentive of 50% of base salary for achieving targets and a maximum of 100% of base salary for substantially exceeding targets.
Bonus entitlement, subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, is calculated on a straight line basis from target through to maximum.
The Remuneration Committee sets bonus targets by reference to agreed budgets and external expectations.
Bonuses are currently based on growth in profit before tax, goodwill amortisation and exceptional items.
26 Burberry Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 04 REPORT ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION AND RELATED MATTERS CONTINUED Share incentives The current share incentive awards to the executive directors other than Stacey Cartwright were determined prior to the IPO and reflected the requirements with regard to the incentivisation of the executive team in the context of the IPO and the retention of the executive team prior to and following the IPO.
During this financial year, Burberry introduced a Co-investment Scheme as indicated in last years Remuneration Report, to further align the interests of executives and shareholders and to support retention.
Under this scheme executive directors if invited by the Remuneration Committee and selected senior managers are given the opportunity to defer receipt of their bonus and invest it in Burberry shares.
The number of shares acquired by the individual will be matched on a sliding scale depending on achievement against the annual bonus performance targets for the relevant financial year.
The matching is triggered once the Company has hit its financial target.
The number of matching shares varies from half a share to one 0.5:1, to a maximum of one to one 1:1 in the year to 31 March 2004.
The release of the invested and matching shares is deferred for three years.
Upon the release of the matching shares the individual will receive an amount equal to the dividends that would have been paid on the matching shares during the deferral period.
The amount of annual bonus eligible for co-investment as well as the co-investment match are both dependent upon annual performance.
The value of the deferred award is then dependent upon share price performance.
The Committee considered a further performance condition on vesting but felt that as the primary purpose of the co-investment plan is to encourage investment in Burberry shares, the use of further conditionality might reduce the plans effectiveness.
If an individual resigns during the three-year period he she will forfeit his her rights in respect of the matching shares.
To increase the incentive and retention effect of this scheme, the number of matching shares will vary from one to one 1:1, to a maximum of two to one 2:1 in the year to 31 March 2005 should targets be substantially exceeded.
The Company is intending to introduce a new senior executive restricted share plan which, unlike the plans put in place for the IPO, will include performance conditions on vesting.
Full details are set out in the circular relating to the 2004 AGM.
Service agreements Attracting and retaining the top talent in the global luxury brand business may require fixed term contracts and notice periods in excess of one year.
However, Burberry will not offer notice periods of more than one year unless it is necessary.
Termination payments reflect the circumstances of termination.
Where the director voluntarily resigns, the director will be entitled to his her base salary and bonus to the extent earned.
In circumstances where the Company dismisses the director for cause, no further payments will be made whether of salary or otherwise.
Where a director is dismissed without cause the director will be protected against the financial consequences of such dismissal.
Save as described below, there are no service contracts with any director containing a notice or contract period of more than one year or provisions for pre-determining compensation on termination of any amount which exceeds one years salary and benefits in kind.
The main terms on which each of the directors is employed by a member of the Group are set out below.
Rose Marie Bravo The terms of Rose Marie Bravos service agreement were negotiated in preparation for the IPO having regard to the need to incentivise her and, in particular, retain her services following the IPO a matter of considerable concern to potential investors.
Rose Marie Bravo is employed by Burberry as Chief Executive under a service agreement dated 28 May 2002.
This is for an initial fixed period until 30 June 2005.
Burberry may terminate the service agreement with or without cause at any time without a notice period during and after the initial fixed period.
If the service agreement is terminated by Burberry without cause an example of cause is gross misconduct then it will continue to pay to Ms Bravo her base salary for the balance of the fixed period or one year if longer : in lieu of an annual bonus, it will pay 50% of base salary for each full year and a pro rata portion thereof for each part year payable when such bonus would otherwise be paid.
If Ms Bravo terminates the service agreement with good reason the termination is deemed to be termination by Burberry without cause.
On termination of Ms Bravos employment she will be reimbursed for reasonable relocation costs to the US.
If any person acquires control of Burberry, including by acquiring 25% or more of the voting rights in Burberry, Ms Bravo can terminate her employment and such termination would be deemed to be by Burberry without cause.
If payments due to Ms Bravo are deemed of a level that would subject her to US federal excise tax under Section 280G b 2 of the US Internal Revenue Code 1986, Burberry Limited US will pay Ms Bravo an additional amount so that she will be in the same net after-tax position had the excise tax not been applied.
Pursuant to the service agreement entered into at the time of the IPO, Ms Bravo was granted an award and options over Ordinary Shares in the Company as set out on pages 30 and 31.
Ms Bravo is also entitled to be granted two options, each over 833,333 Ordinary Shares, under the Burberry Non-Approved Executive Share Option Scheme 2002, in 2004 and 2005.
The exercise price of each option is the market value of an Ordinary Share at the time of grant.
If the service agreement is terminated, Ms Bravos rights in respect of her award and options will be determined by the rules of the relevant share scheme except that her award and options will vest and become exercisable if the service agreement is terminated on or after 30 June 2005 in any circumstances, unless for cause.
Burberry Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2003 04 27 REPORT ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION AND RELATED MATTERS CONTINUED Under the service agreement, and to strengthen the retention effect of the arrangements with Ms Bravo, a right was granted to her which operates as a deferred bonus and which is not payable for at least three years.
In other words, instead of her share incentives, Ms Bravo can receive a cash payment of US$15m.
Ms Bravo can exercise this right on or after 30 June 2005 but this cash payment is reduced or may be extinguished by an amount equal to the value already received on the vesting and exercise of her share incentives.
In addition, she can receive this cash payment before 30 June 2005 if either her employment is terminated by Burberry without cause or by Ms Bravo for good reason or if there is a Change in Control and she elects to terminate her employment.
Michael Metcalf Michael Metcalf was employed by Burberry as Chief Operating and Financial Officer under a service agreement dated 14 August 1998.

In fact, Mr Metcalf gave the Company eight months notice and during his notice period he continued to devote his full time and attention to the business of Burberry and ensured an orderly handover to the new Chief Financial Officer.
Upon his resignation on 31 March 2004, all his rights which had not vested in respect of the Restricted Share Plan, the IPO Option Scheme and the 2002 Share Option Scheme lapsed.
However, the Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion under the rules of the relevant schemes to permit Mr Metcalf to retain 11% of the value of his unvested share incentives to recognise his contribution in the year to 31 March 2004.
Thomas ONeill Thomas ONeill has given notice that he will resign as a director of Burberry Group plc with effect from 1 July 2004 and will cease to be an employee with effect from 31 July 2004.
