report by the board on remuneration Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, the Regulations.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles and complied with the provisions of the revised Combined Code the Code on Corporate Governance relating to directors remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, an advisory resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the AGM of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The auditors are required to report on the auditable part of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
The report is therefore divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Part 2 of the Regulations - unaudited information Remuneration Committee The directors who were members of the committee during the year are shown on page 31 in the section on Corporate Governance.
The responsibility for the establishment of a remuneration policy and its cost is a matter for the full Board, on the advice of the Remuneration Committee.
The recommendations of the Remuneration Committee have been approved without amendment by the Board for submission to shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing policy on remuneration for executive directors and senior management and for determining specific remuneration packages for each of the executive directors.
The Remuneration Committee members have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interests arising from cross directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
During the period under review, the Committee sought the assistance of the Chairman and Chief Executive on matters relating to directors performance and remuneration.
The Chairman, Chief Executive and Peter McGrath, Group Human Resources director, attend meetings by invitation except when their individual remuneration arrangements are discussed.
No director takes part in discussions relating to their own remuneration and benefits.
The Committee received independent market information and remuneration advice from Mercer Human Resource Consulting during the year in question to June 2004.
Mercer also provides actuarial and consulting services to the Company.
For the balance of the year the Remuneration Committee received wholly independent advice on executive compensation and incentives from Halliwell Consulting.
No other services were provided to the Company by Halliwell Consulting during the year.
The Remuneration Committee is formally constituted with written terms of reference with the full remit of the committee role described.
A copy of the terms of reference is available to shareholders on request by writing to the Company Secretary whose contact details are set out on page 84 of the Annual Report and on the Companys website, www.
Andrew Flanagan, in his capacity as non-executive director of Scottish Rugby Union, received an annual payment of 15,000 which he retained.
He resigned from Scottish Rugby Union on 11 January 2005.
The Company did not comply with the requirement to have at least three independent non-executive directors on the Remuneration Committee albeit that the Board does view Allan Shiach as independent in character and judgment.
However, the Board felt it imperative that Allan Shiach remain on the Remuneration Committee in order to provide a degree of continuity in light of the significant changes in the Committee membership in 2003 and 2004 and due to the review of remuneration as discussed in this report.
In all other respects it is the opinion of the Board that the Company complied with all remuneration related aspects of the Code during the year.
38 report by the board on remuneration Remuneration policy overview The Policy applied by the Remuneration Committee during 2004 is set out in this report.
The policy for 2005 is set out in the Shareholders Circular so that the proposed new Long-Term Incentive Plan can be seen in the context of the Companys new policy on executive remuneration.
Proposed policy: 2005 As stated in the 2003 report by the Board on remuneration, the committee recognised the need to review in 2004 its policy on executive remuneration and the Companys incentive schemes in light of changing market practice and new accounting standards.
The following factors underlined the requirement for the policy to change: the need in the current climate to more directly align executives interests with those of shareholders: the requirement to ensure greater transparency on how the Company sets each element of the compensation package and associated performance hurdles: a desire by the Company to change the emphasis within total short-term remuneration from salary to the performance based annual bonus: a desire by the Company to better target its long-term share incentives to the strategy of the Company and the factors affecting the market in which the Company operates: the accounting changes for options resulting in a P&L charge: and the need for executives to build up meaningful shareholdings.
As such the Remuneration Committee appointed Halliwell Consulting to assist it in its review and has consequently established a new policy, upon which it has consulted with the Companys major shareholders.
Full details of the new policy adopted by the Remuneration Committee are to be found in the Shareholders Circular that accompanies this Annual Report.
Policy: 2004 SMGs remuneration policy for 2004 was to set pay and incentives to attract and retain senior executives who can manage the Company for the benefit of shareholders, taking into account the needs of employees, viewers, listeners and advertisers.
SMG believes there should be a strong relationship between performance and reward, and that executive directors remuneration should be linked with shareholders interests by incentive and bonus schemes that promote demonstrably better performance, which in turn creates value.
The Remuneration Committees policy during the year was to set the main elements of the remuneration package at the following quartiles in comparison to comparable companies in the media sector: Potential total Potential share Potential total Annual bonus short-term Base salary Pension Benefits in kind incentive compensation potential remuneration grants value available Median to Median to Median to Median to Median Market practice Upper quartile upper quartile upper quartile upper quartile upper quartile The structure of the package is such that in order to receive upper quartile short-term remuneration full bonus potential has to be earned.
Equally to achieve an upper quartile total compensation value full bonus would have to be earned and maximum payout achieved under the share incentives.
The substantial percentage of the total potential compensation value made up from annual bonus and share incentives means that if executives do not perform their total short-term remuneration and total compensation value will comparatively be nearer the lower quartile.
The committee felt that this is appropriate in light of its desire to see the majority of the package based on both short and long-term performance.
Following the review of the policy in 2004 and the adoption of a new policy for 2005, it is the Remuneration Committees intention to continue to review policy on an annual basis to ensure that it is in line with the Companys objectives and shareholders interests.
39 The charts below demonstrate the balance between fixed and variable performance based pay for each executive director for the year ended 31 December 2004: Andrew Flanagan Key 36% Fixed compensation Fixed compensation is calculated as: Salary Benefits Potential performance compensation is calculated as: Bonus available Fair market value of LTIP and share option awards on grant 64% Performance compensation George Watt Donald Emslie 45% Fixed compensation 36% Fixed compensation 55% Performance compensation 64% Performance compensation The main elements of these packages and the performance conditions are described in this report.
40 report by the board on remuneration Elements of executive directors remuneration Basic salary Policy: Median to upper quartile The Remuneration Committee reviewed the executive directors salaries in 2004 and decided not to increase base salaries.
Median of rises made for comparable Name Salary 2004 Percentage increase roles in this sector in the year Andrew Flanagan Chief Executive 440,000 0% 5% Upper quartile 468,000 N A Median 341,000 George Watt Group Finance Director 170,000 0% 6% Upper quartile 305,000 N A Median 223,000 Donald Emslie Chief Executive Television 240,000 0% 5% Upper quartile 254,000 N A Median 156,000 When determining the salary of the executive directors the committee took into consideration: the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills, in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity, in particular the median and upper quartile salary levels of those comparable companies within the media sector: the performance of the individual executive director: the individual executive directors experience and responsibilities: and pay and conditions throughout the Company.
Annual performance related bonus Policy: Median to upper quartile bonus potential The Remuneration Committees policy was to set the maximum annual bonus potential between the median and the upper quartile in relation to comparable media companies.
The following table shows how this level of maximum bonus compares to the comparator companies: Donald Emslie Andrew Flanagan George Watt Chief Executive Chief Executive Group Finance Director Television Maximum bonus as a 100% 60% 100% percentage of salary Comparator group Upper quartile 100% 100% 100% Median 100% 75% 75% The maximum bonus potential has remained unchanged from 2003.
41 In accordance with the terms of the bonus schedules for 2004, the executive directors have earned the following bonus payments: Donald Emslie Andrew Flanagan George Watt %age of salary Chief Executive Chief Executive Group Finance Director Television Maximum bonus potential 100% 60% 100% 2004 bonus paid %age of salary 16.8% 10% 30% 2004 bonus paid 73,923 17,137 72,009 Median bonus payments for 139,000 73,770 63,792 comparable companies All bonus payments have been made in cash.
The committee determined to adopt early the element of the new policy for 2005 relating to the method of payment of bonus and therefore there was no deferred share element for Donald Emslies 2004 bonus.
The rationale behind the change in policy is set out in the Shareholders Circular.
The bonus targets for 2004, in respect of the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director, were split equally between Group PBT, Group operating profit, individual targets and Remuneration Committee discretion.
Instead of Group PBT, the Television division Chief Executive had the divisions operating profit as a performance target.
The Groups PBT and operating profit budgets, together with the Television divisions operating profit targets were met, triggering bonus payments.
Individual targets were also satisfied.
The Remuneration Committee determined to base the bonus payable on the objective financial criteria.
The committee felt that this was the correct approach in light of the Companys overall performance and individual executives contribution in delivering that performance.
Further, the committee believes that this was the most transparent method of calculating bonus for the executive directors and shareholders.
The bonus plan for 2005 is set out in the Shareholders Circular.
The maximum bonus potential for 2005 remains the same as for both 2003 and 2004.
Bonus targets are reviewed and agreed by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of each financial year.
Bonus payments are not pensionable.
Share incentives Policy: Median to upper quartile Overview During the year the Company operated two share incentive plans for executive directors: a Company and Executive Share Option Plan and a Performance Share Plan.
Following the adoption of the new Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP detailed in the enclosed circular, it is proposed that there will be no further awards to executive directors under these plans.
All options granted after 2001 but prior to the Companys 2004 AGM have limited retesting, as well as more demanding performance conditions being attached to higher awards than was previously the case.
These options are measured from a fixed base for three years, with retesting at the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the award.
Options granted in 2004 prior to the Companys AGM were granted under these terms.
Market practice on retesting of options has moved on since these plans were first instituted and approved by shareholders.
The Company decided not to award any further options under these plans pending the full review of long-term incentive plans.
There is no retesting of awards under the proposed new LTIP.
1999 Long-Term Incentive Plan The SMG Performance Share Plan was originally established by Scottish Media Group plc in 1999 following approval by shareholders.
The Performance Share Plan is operated in conjunction with the SMG Employee Share Trust.
42 report by the board on remuneration The Performance Share Plans aims are to provide an incentive linked to the longer-term performance of the Company and to act as an effective retention for executive directors and other senior executives.
Under the Plan those eligible may be granted conditional performance-related awards, entitling them to a number of ordinary shares in the Company at the end of the performance period.
The performance period is the three consecutive financial years of the Company from the year of award.
Cash amounts may be gifted or lent by the Company to the Trustee to allow it to subscribe for, or acquire, ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange for the purpose of fulfiling the awards.
The shares, subject to award, will not normally vest unless the predetermined performance criteria set by the Remuneration Committee have been achieved.
The maximum annual award under the Performance Share Plan is 100% of salary.
The award limit has remained unchanged since the Plans inception.
Performance measures and reasons for selection There are two independent performance measures of equal weighting for awards made in 2004: Total Shareholder Return TSR and Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation EBITDA.
In terms of the EBITDA component of the award, the threshold for vesting is a Compound Annual Growth Rate CAGR of 4% at which point 15% of the total share award will vest.
Above 4% CAGR the award will vest on a straight-line basis with 50% of the full award vesting at a CAGR of 10%.
In terms of the TSR component, the minimum performance requirement is that the Companys TSR is at least equal to the median of the comparator group, at which level 15% of the total award will vest.
50% of the full award will vest if the TSR is greater than or equal to upper quartile.
Awards will vest on a straight-line basis in between.
The comparator group for the 2004 grant was: Aegis Group plc British Sky Broadcasting plc Capital Radio plc Chrysalis Group plc Daily Mail and General Trust plc EMAP plc EMI Group plc Future Network plc GWR Group plc Hit Entertainment plc ITV plc JC Decaux S. A. Johnston Press plc Maiden Group plc Pearson plc Scottish Radio Holdings plc Taylor Nelson Sofres plc The Television Corporation plc The Wireless Group plc Trinity Mirror Group plc Ulster Television plc WPP Group plc EBITDA was chosen since it is a measure accepted by the financial community, is understood internally as it looks at cash generation and provides better line of sight for managers than EPS.
The Remuneration Committee believes that comparative total shareholder return is one of the more appropriate measures to align shareholders and executives interests.
Comparative TSR was selected as the performance condition for part of the LTIP awards granted in 2004 by the Remuneration Committee as it ensures that the executives outperform their peers over the measurement period in delivering shareholder value irrespective of general market conditions, before being entitled to receive any of the shares subject to their LTIP awards.
As at 31 December 2004, the Trustee held 328,747 shares 2003: 328,747, which had a market value on that date of 350,937.
The dividends on these ordinary shares have been waived.
Details of all subsisting awards are set out on page 54.
Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The Company operated Inland Revenue approved and unapproved Share Option Schemes during 2004 to reward employees performance and to incentivise at all levels.
The maximum annual grant of options under the Scheme is 200% of salary.
43 Performance measures and reasons for selection Earnings per share EPS is the option schemes sole performance measure and is as reported in the Companys statutory accounts adjusted to avoid distortions arising from one off exceptional items included within FRS3 and goodwill amortisation under FRS10.
Options up to 100% of salary will only vest if minimum EPS growth is higher than the Retail Prices Index, plus 3% per annum, in the performance period.
Any share option grants in excess of 100% of salary and up to the maximum of 200% salary, in any one year, will vest on a sliding scale dependent on earnings per share growth of RPI plus 3-6% per annum.
Earnings Per Share EPS growth p. a.
%age of option vesting RPI 3% 100% of salary RPI 6% 101-200% of salary maximum Between 3-6% p. a. EPS growth the balance of an option greater than 100% of salary will vest on a straightline basis The Remuneration Committee felt that EPS growth as a key performance measure for the Company was an appropriate performance condition for the vesting of options.
Details of all subsisting options are set out on page 52.
Measurement of performance conditions The Remuneration Committee determines whether the performance conditions for share awards or options are satisfied.
Where performance requirements are based on EBITDA or EPS the Committee will use the principles behind the audited figures disclosed in the Companys financial statements, and may take advice from independent advisors as to whether any adjustments are required to ensure consistency in accordance with the terms of the performance conditions.
Where the performance measure is TSR, Halliwell Consulting, the Remuneration Committees advisors, will calculate the TSR in accordance with agreed principles.
Total grants made during 2004 to executive directors The awards of shares and options made to the executive directors during the year compared to the level of awards in comparable companies are shown below: Donald Emslie Andrew Flanagan George Watt Chief Executive Chief Executive Group Finance Director Television Expected value as a percentage of salary Share option award 59% 44% 59% LTIP share award 25% 25% 25% Total value of awards 84% 69% 84% Face value Share option award 100% 75% 100% LTIP share award 50% 50% 50% Total value of awards 150% 125% 150% Comparable companies face value of awards Upper quartile 228% 169% 128% Median 97% 62% 63% For LTIP awards the expected value was calculated by taking the face value of the shares on the date of award and discounting this value by the probability of the performance condition being satisfied at this date in accordance with the principles of International Financial Reporting Standard IFRS 2.
For options the expected value on the date of grant was calculated using an option valuation model in accordance with the principles of IFRS 2.
44 report by the board on remuneration Dilution The following table sets out the current level of dilution against the ABI limits for all share plans and discretionary plans principally executive plans and sets out the commitments to issue shares made during the financial year reported: Maximum Current dilution Decrease in dilution during the year 10% dilution in ten years 5.46% 0.31% 5% dilution in ten years 4.19% 0.42% In accordance with the ABI guidelines the Company can issue a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital in a rolling ten-year period to employees under all its share plans.
In addition, of this 10% the Company can only issue 5% to satisfy awards under discretionary or executive plans.
Pension Policy: Median Pensions Final salary scheme The executive directors are members of the Groups principal pension scheme, the Scottish and Grampian Television Retirement Benefits Scheme, which is an Inland Revenue approved defined benefit occupational pension scheme.
Annual bonus payments and awards under the long-term incentive plans are not pensionable.
In common with all members, the executive directors made contributions of 6% of salary to the scheme.
Subject to Inland Revenue limits the scheme provides members with a pension of two thirds of final basic salary upon reaching normal retirement at age 60.
The principal features of the pension benefit accrued by each executive director are noted below.
These are: the annual accrued pension payable from normal retirement age, calculated as if he had left service at the period end: the increase in the accrued pension attributable to service as a director during the year: the transfer value of the accrued benefit at the end of the period, calculated in accordance with the actuarial guidance note GN11: the transfer value of the accrued benefit at the end of the previous period, calculated in accordance with the actuarial guidance note GN11: and the increase in the transfer value over the period net of employee contributions.
Members of the scheme have the option of paying Additional Voluntary Contributions, but these and the resulting benefits are not included in the table: Accrued pension Increase in Transfer value at Transfer value Increase in at 31 December accrued pension 31 December at 31 December transfer value 2004 during year 2004 2003 000 000 000 000 000 Andrew Flanagan 21 2 260 200 54 Donald Emslie 91 5 1,078 874 190 George Watt 12 2 80 53 20 Pensions Money purchase scheme audited information Contributions during the year to the Companys Funded Unapproved Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme made by the Group on behalf of executive directors covered by the earnings cap were: 000 Andrew Flanagan 71 George Watt 14 45 Benefits in kind Policy: Market standard package The Company provides a cash benefits allowance in lieu of normal benefits in kind for executives of this level in a company of this size, such as company cars and healthcare.
The Company actively reviews the levels of benefit received to ensure that they remain market competitive.
Total compensation value of remuneration package for executive directors Policy: Median to upper quartile The following table shows the value of each of the main elements of the remuneration package provided to the executive directors during the year ended 31 December 2004.
It should be noted that the expected value of LTIP awards and option grants are based on a series of assumptions and may not equate to the actual value received by the executive directors on release.
In addition, shares awarded under the ESOS will only vest to an executive director if the attached performance conditions have been satisfied see above.
Any actual value of the award is also dependent on the share price in three years time.

Executive directors are entitled to participate in this scheme on the same terms as other employees.
Approximately 50% of eligible group employees currently participate in the Scheme.
Share Incentive Plan SIP The Company also operates a SIP for all eligible employees.

All executive directors will be expected to mitigate their loss in accordance with general legal principles in the event of their cessation of employment.
The Remuneration Committee will ensure that there have been no unjustified payments for failure on an executive directors termination of employment.
There are no special provisions in the contracts of employment extending notice periods on a change of control, liquidation of the Company or cessation of employment.
Non-executive directors The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board based upon recommendations from the Chairman and Chief Executive or, in the case of the Chairman, based on recommendations from the Senior Independent non-executive director and the Chief Executive and is within the limits set by the Articles of Association.
