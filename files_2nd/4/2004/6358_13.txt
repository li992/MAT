37 Remuneration Report This report provides details of the remuneration of each of the directors and sets out the companys remuneration policies for the current financial year and, subject to ongoing review, for subsequent financial years.
The report will be put to the Annual General Meeting for approval by the shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee met three times during the period under review.
The members of the committee, all of whom are considered to be independent, are Alf Duch Pedersen Chairman, Lord Condon, Thorleif Krarup and Bo Lerenius.
The committee is responsible for setting all aspects of the remuneration of the chairman, the executive directors and certain other of the most senior executives in the company.
It is also responsible for the operation of the companys share plans.
Its terms of reference are available on the companys website.
Advice was provided to the committee by New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, compensation consultants, who were appointed by the committee.
The terms of their appointment are available on the companys website.
New Bridge Street Consultants did not provide any other services to the company during the period under review.
Lars Nrby Johansen, chief executive, and Nick Buckles, deputy chief executive, provided guidance to the committee on remuneration packages for senior executives within the group.
Further guidance was received from the groups HR director, Irene Cowden.
The committees remit includes the chairman, the executive directors, the four other members of the groups executive committee and the company secretary.
Remuneration policy The policy for the remuneration of the executive directors and the executive management team aims to achieve: the ability to attract, retain and motivate high calibre executives: a strong link between executive reward and the groups performance: alignment of the interests of the executives and the shareholders: provision of incentive arrangements which focus on both annual and longer-term performance.
A significant proportion of total remuneration is related to performance, through participation in both short-term and long-term incentive schemes.
For base target performance, the performance-related element amounts to around 40% of the total package.
For stretch target performance, the performance-related element amounts to around 60% of the total package.
The committee believes that the current balance is appropriate, although it is kept under review.
Elements of remuneration a Base salary and benefits The salaries of the executive directors and the other members of the executive committee were set at 19 July 2004, on completion of the merger, and will be reviewed on 1 January each year, save that the first review will not take place until 1 January 2006.
Interim salary reviews may be carried out following significant changes in responsibility.
The salaries take account of an extensive benchmarking exercise which was undertaken at the time of the merger and also reflect responsibility, individual performance, internal relativities and salary and other market information supplied by New Bridge Street Consultants.
The overall objective is to achieve salary levels which provide a market competitive base salary, with the opportunity to earn above median remuneration through the companys incentive schemes.
Benefits include pension arrangements and the provision of company cars, health insurance and life assurance.
b Performance-related bonus schemes The executive directors participated in a performance-related bonus scheme for the six months to 31 December 2004 which broadly reflected the period from the merger in July 2004, payments under which were dependent on the attainment of defined PBITA profit targets of the group for that period, adjusted for the effect of any exceptional items and discontinued operations and using constant exchange rates.
The committees original intention was to use a range of performance measures but, after further consideration, it concluded that PBITA best reflected the various key drivers of business success within the group.
For achievement of profits slightly below the budgeted profit target, a bonus payment of 15% of base salary at 31 December 2004 was due.
For achievement of the budgeted target, a bonus payment of 25% of base salary at 31 December 2004 was due, increasing on a straight-line basis up to a bonus payment of 50% of base salary for achievement of a stretch profit target.
On an annualised basis, these bonus amounts were thus equivalent to, respectively, 30%, 50% and 100% of base salary.
The amounts of the bonuses paid to the executive directors under this scheme are set out in the table on page 39.
The bonuses were paid in cash for amounts up to 25% of base salary 50% on an annualised basis and in the form of deferred shares for the balance.
Any deferred shares will normally only be transferred to the executive director if he remains in employment otherwise than where he leaves in certain specified circumstances for a period of three years from the date of the award of the shares.
Given the successful financial results, a maximum bonus was earned in respect of the period.
For the current year, the executive directors participate in an annual performance-related bonus scheme, payments under which are dependent on the attainment of defined PBTA profit targets of the group, adjusted for the effect of any exceptional items and discontinued operations and using constant exchange rates.
For achievement of profits slightly below the budgeted profit target, a bonus payment of 25% of base salary at 31 December 2005 will be due.
For achievement of the budgeted target, a bonus payment of 50% of base salary at 31 December 2005 will be due, increasing on a straight-line basis up to a bonus payment of 100% of salary for achievement of a stretch profit target.
Any such bonus up to the value of 50% of the executive directors salary will be paid in cash with any excess balance being awarded in the form of deferred shares.
The PBITA and PBTA budgeted targets used for the above schemes are the same as the companys budgeted PBITA and PBTA for the corresponding period.
38 Group 4 Securicor ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004 Remuneration Report continued c Synergy bonus For an initial transitional period running from 1 July 2004 until 31 December 2005 and as explained in the Group 4 Securicor Listing Particulars, the executive directors participate in an additional bonus scheme, payment under which is dependent upon achievement of specified merger synergy savings.
For the six months to 31 December 2004, achievement of a specified target amount of savings entitled the executive directors to an award of deferred shares in the company equal in value to 12.5% of base salary, rising to 25% for achievement of a specified stretch target.
The synergy savings achieved by the end of December 2004 were ahead of initial expectations and a maximum payout was earned for that period.
For the 12 months to 31 December 2005, achievement of a specified target amount of savings will entitle the executive directors to an award of deferred shares in the company equal in value to 25% of base salary, rising to 50% for achievement of a specified stretch target.
Bonus payments do not form part of salary for pension purposes.
d Performance Share Plan Long-term incentive plan The Performance Share Plan was introduced in July 2004.
Under the plan, the executive directors and certain other senior executives receive conditional allocations of the companys shares which are released to them only on the achievement of demanding performance targets.
The maximum annual award of shares under the plan is one times base salary, save that, in exceptional circumstances, the Remuneration Committee may determine that an award of up to one and a half times salary may be made.
The extent to which allocations of shares under the plan vest will be determined, as to half of the award, by the companys normalised earnings per share growth relative to the RPI over a single three-year period and, as to the second half of the award, by the companys ranking by reference to TSR total shareholder return, being share price growth plus dividends paid using the FTSE-100 constituent companies as at the date of the award as a comparator group, again over a single three-year period.
There is no provision for retesting.
The following targets apply to the first half of awards granted in the year under review, with the three-year EPS earnings per share period ending on 31 December 2006: Average annual growth in EPS Proportion of allocation vesting RPI 10% per annum 30% over three years 25% RPI 20% per annum 60% over three years 100% RPI 10-20% per annum Pro rata between 25% and 100% Less than RPI 10% per annum Nil The following targets apply to the second half of each such award: Ranking of the company against the FTSE-100 constituent companies by reference to TSR Proportion of allocation vesting Upper quartile 100% Between median and upper quartile Pro rata between 25% and 100% Median 25% Below median Nil In addition, there will only be a transfer of shares if a the growth in EPS of the company has exceeded the growth in RPI by 10% over a performance period of three financial years, and b the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the companys TSR performance is reflective of the companys underlying performance.
The performance conditions will continue to apply pro rata to the time the allocation has been held if an employee leaves the group, or in the event of a change of control or restructuring of the company.
The companys current policy is to use market purchased shares to satisfy Performance Share Plan awards.
The committee believes that a combination of earnings per share growth and total shareholder return is the most appropriate performance measure for the Performance Share Plan, as it provides a transparent method of assessing the companys performance.
The company calculates whether the EPS performance targets have been achieved by reference to the companys audited accounts which provide an accessible and objective measure of the companys earnings per share, whilst TSR comparative data will be supplied by New Bridge Street Consultants.
The committee will also ensure that the EPS targets are measured on a consistent basis and are not artificially impacted, either to the benefit or to the detriment of participants, by the change in accounting standards to International Financial Reporting Standards.
The committee also believes that continued shareholding by senior executives will strengthen the alignment of their interests with shareholders interests.
Accordingly, executive directors of the company will be expected to retain shares to the value of 30% of the after-tax gains made on the vesting of performance share plan awards until they have built up a shareholding equivalent to one times base salary.
39 Remuneration Report continued Fees, service contracts and letters of appointment The chairmans annual fee is 160,000.
The annual fee for the non-executive directors, which is set by the chairman and the executive directors, is 40,000, with a further 40,000 for the role of deputy chairman, 10,000 for the chairmanship of each of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and 10,000 for the role of senior independent director.
No other fees are paid for membership of the board committees.
These fees are subject to periodic review which takes into account comparative fee levels in other groups of a similar size and the anticipated time commitment for the non-executive directors.
The service contracts of those who served as executive directors during the period are dated as follows: Nick Buckles 2 June 2004 Trevor Dighton 2 June 2004 Lars Nrby Johansen 3 June 2004 The contracts of Messrs Buckles and Dighton are terminable by the company on 12 months notice, whilst the contract of Mr Nrby Johansen was terminable by the company on 24 months notice until 19 July 2006 after which it would have been terminable on 12 months notice.
The contracts are terminable by the executive directors on twelve months notice.
There are no liquidated damages provisions for compensation payable upon early termination, but the company reserves the right to pay salary in lieu of notice.
It is the groups policy that, save for a limited period in respect of Mr Nrby Johansen, it should be able to terminate service contracts of executive directors on no more than 12 months notice and that payments for termination of contract are restricted to the value of salary and other contractual entitlements for the notice period.
The chairman and the other non-executive directors do not have service contracts but letters of appointment which provide for initial three-year terms which began on 19 May 2004.
All directors are required to stand for re-election by the shareholders at least once every three years.
It is the companys policy that executive directors may each hold not more than one external non-executive appointment and may retain any associated fees, save that Mr Nrby Johansen was permitted to retain the three non-executive appointments which he held prior to the merger.
None of the other executive directors currently holds an external non-executive appointment.
Mr Nrby Johansen received aggregate fees of DKK 585,000 53,342 for the year ended 31 December 2004 in respect of his three non-executive appointments.
Performance Graph The performance graph below shows the total cumulative shareholder return of the company from its first day of listing, 20 July 2004, until 31 December 2004, based on a hypothetical shareholding worth 100, compared with the return achieved by the FTSE-100 constituent companies over the same period.
The directors believe this to be a more appropriate form of broad equity market index against which to base a comparison than the support services sector, where there are no companies directly comparable to Group 4 Securicor.
The FTSE-100 index has also been selected for comparative total shareholder return purposes in the companys performance share plan.

No changes in these holdings have taken place since 31 December 2004.
Each of Nick Buckles and Trevor Dighton, who were previously employed within the Securicor plc group, has a deemed interest in 206,332 ordinary shares held in the Securicor Employee Benefit Trust.
Directors Pension Entitlements Nick Buckles and Trevor Dighton participate in the non-contributory category of the groups defined benefit pension scheme.
The normal retirement age for the category is 60 and members achieve the maximum of 2 3rds of their final pensionable salary at normal retirement age after 20 years service 10 years service for those who joined the company prior to 17 March 1987.
The pension of 2 3rds accrues uniformly between the date of joining the scheme and normal retirement age.
An actuarial reduction is applied to pensions payable before normal retirement age and an increase is applied where retirement is deferred beyond normal retirement age.
For death before retirement a capital sum equal to four times pensionable salary is payable, together with a spouses pension of 50% of the members prospective pension at the age of 60 plus a return of any contributions paid prior to the admission to the non-contributory category.
For death in retirement, a spouses pension of 50% of the members pre-commutation pension is payable.
Post retirement pension increases are payable at the rate of 5% per annum in respect of pension earned up to 31 December 1994 and in line with the increase in the Retail Prices Index subject to a maximum of 5% in respect of pension earned after that date.
The committee is reviewing pension arrangements in light of the UK tax changes due to come into force in April 2006.
It is intended that any measures taken will not increase the companys current pension liabilities as a result of the tax changes.
The company does not intend to compensate individuals for changes in personal tax liabilities arising from the legislation.
Pension entitlements and corresponding transfer values increased as follows during the 12 months ended 31 December 2004 all figures are in 000s.

ii Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with version 8.1 of guidance note GN11 issued by the actuarial profession.
iii The value of net increase 4 represents the incremental value to the director of his or her service during the year, calculated on the assumption that service terminated at the year-end.
It is based on the increase in accrued pension 2. iv The change in transfer value 5 includes the effect of fluctuations in such value due to factors beyond the control of the company and the directors, such as stock market movements.
v Mr Dighton is currently capped for pension purposes and therefore only accrues pension on benefits up to the statutory cap.
Securicor plc previously agreed to pay Mr Dighton a salary supplement equal to 30% of any salary in excess of the cap.
This payment was suspended from 6 April 2003, as it may be more tax efficient if such amounts are paid into the pension scheme after April 2006, although the structuring of such payment would not be determined until the companys ongoing pensions review has been concluded.
