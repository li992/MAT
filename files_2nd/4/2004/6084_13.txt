Remuneration report Information not subject to audit Composition and role of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is responsible for formulating executive remuneration policy and for determining the remuneration of the executive directors and certain senior executives.
Its members are the non-executive directors, as shown in Table 1, together with their attendance at meetings of the Remuneration Committee during 2003 04: Table 1.

All the non-executive directors are considered by the Company to be independent.
Mr Heiden attended meetings of the Committee ex officio.
He did not attend when matters relating to his own remuneration were being discussed.
The Committee received information from New Bridge Street Consultants, Mercer Human Resources Consulting and Deloitte & Touche.
None of these organisations provide any other services to the Company.
In accordance with the requirements of the revised Companies Act, an ordinary resolution seeking shareholders approval for the Remuneration report will be proposed at the annual general meeting.
Mr Heiden appointed Deloitte & Touche as advisers.
New Bridge Street Consultants and Mercer Human Resources Consulting were appointed by the Remuneration Committee.
Executive remuneration policy The Remuneration Committees objectives are to ensure that the Company is able to: attract, retain and motivate high calibre people: and align the interests of the executive directors and senior executives with those of shareholders by rewarding executive directors and certain senior executives according to the overall performance of the individual businesses and Group.
Variable pay under the annual bonus and long-term incentive schemes can form a higher proportion of total pay than is typical in the UK market.
Incentive opportunities are designed to deliver above median total rewards in the event of superior performance.
Any payments made to executive directors other than basic salary are not pensionable.
Basic salary and benefits Basic salary is reviewed annually having regard to market practices for similar executive positions in a comparator group of companies in the engineering sector and supported by advice from external independent consultants.
They are generally benchmarked at the lower quartile positioning against the comparator group.
Any increases reflect both individual and business performance.
Executive directors also receive additional taxable benefits, namely the provision of a fully expensed Company car or an allowance in lieu thereof, medical insurance and disability insurance.
33 FKI plc Annual report 2004 Annual performance related bonus scheme The Company operates an annual performance related bonus scheme for certain executive directors and senior executives, based on the budgeted pre-tax profits of the Group.
An annual performance related bonus scheme for the remaining executive directors and certain senior executives with operating group responsibilities also exists, based partly on the performance of the respective operating group for which they are responsible or individual business performance and, where appropriate, partly on the budgeted pre-tax profits of the Group as a whole.
Both bonus schemes have the potential to lift total remuneration above the median for the comparator group of companies in the event of superior performance.
At Board level, a performance related bonus of 25% of salary is payable for achieving 90% of the applicable pre-tax profit budget.
The bonus increases on a straight line pro rata basis from 25% to 50% of salary for achieving between 90% and 100% of the budgeted pre-tax profits.
The bonus increases on a straight line pro rata basis from 50% to 100% of salary for achieving between 100% and 110% of the budgeted pre-tax profits.
The Remuneration Committee has the right to exercise its discretion regarding the level of awards in exceptional circumstances.
In accordance with the rules of the scheme, the Remuneration Committee exercised its discretion with regard to the impact of exceptional cost items and foreign exchange movements on business performance.
It awarded bonuses for the year as shown in the Directors emoluments table on page 38.
Long-Term Incentives The Company operates two forms of share based incentive schemes for executive directors and senior executives.
Participants in the Long Term Incentives are encouraged to retain part of their vested awards, such that they will be expected to accumulate a minimum shareholding in the Company of one times basic salary over five years.
Executive Share Option Scheme The Company operates an Executive Share Option Scheme, approved by shareholders in 2001, designed to encourage long-term retention of key staff.
Executive directors are eligible to receive options on an annual basis.
In normal circumstances, the maximum level of grant each year to executive directors is limited to options over shares with a value of one times basic salary.
In accordance with his service contract, Mr Heiden was granted options over shares with a value of twice his annual salary for each of the first two years of his employment.
The Board considered this was appropriate in order to assist in the recruitment of a Chief Executive.
The normal practice is to grant options within a period of six weeks following the announcement of the Companys preliminary and interim results.
Options are granted at the mid-market price of FKI plc ordinary shares on the third dealing day before the grant date and normally are required to be held for a minimum of three years before they are capable of exercise.
They expire after ten years.
All executive options granted from July 1996 onwards may only be exercised subject to a performance condition that the Groups growth in earnings per share, as defined below, must exceed the UK retail price index by 9% or more over a three year period, subject to re-testing in subsequent years from a rolling base.
Earnings per share growth is considered to be the most appropriate measure of the Companys underlying performance, as it requires that there should be a demanding improvement in the Companys performance before scheme participants can benefit from an increase in the share price.
The assessment as to whether performance conditions have been met is calculated by the Secretary to the Remuneration Committee and independently verified by the Remuneration Committee and an external independent firm of Chartered Accountants.
Earnings per share are defined as the Companys headline earnings per share, as calculated in accordance with the principles set out in Statement of Investment Practice No.
1 The Definition of IIMR Headline Earnings issued by the Institute of Investment Management and Research.
IIMR Headline earnings are calculated by excluding from the reported FRS 3 results any profit or loss items of a non-trading or capital nature.
Withdrawal of re-testing The Remuneration Committee has taken account of current market practice with regard to the re-testing of options and has decided to withdraw re-testing for all future grants within the existing scheme.
A table giving full details of the directors options granted and exercised during the year under review is shown on page 40.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The Company operates a LTIP which was approved by shareholders in 2001 and under which participants receive annual conditional awards of shares in the Company of a value equal to up to 70% of basic salary per annum, which may vest only after the achievement of certain long-term performance conditions.
Participants may receive up to the maximum number of shares, three years after the award, provided the performance conditions are met.
Until then, the shares are held in a trust which is administered by a trustee Company.
34 FKI plc Annual report 2004 Remuneration report The level of vesting of awards under the LTIP is determined by the performance of the Companys total shareholder return against a comparator group of all companies which on the date of grant are constituent companies of the Engineering and Machinery Index as determined by the FTSE Actuaries Industry Classification Committee.
No awards vest for below median performance and 50% of an award will vest for median performance.
Full vesting occurs only at upper quartile performance, and 75% of an award will vest for performance above the median but below upper quartile.
Accrued dividends on vested awards are paid to the executives pending transfer of the shares into the name of the respective participant.
The performance condition is based upon total shareholder return see graph below as this is considered to be the best means of aligning the interests of directors with shareholders by requiring superior total shareholder return performance compared to competitor companies.
Table 2 below shows a list of competitor companies included during the period 2001-04.

35 FKI plc Annual report 2004 Remuneration report Review of executive remuneration Following development of new trends in executive remuneration a comprehensive review of the policies and mechanisms of remuneration will be undertaken in 2004 05.
Inland Revenue Approved Save-As-You-Earn share option scheme This scheme was approved by shareholders in 1997 and is open to all UK employees who have completed six months service and who enter into an approved savings contract for a term of three or five years.
The maximum amount which can be saved is 250 per month, and the total savings including interest at the end of the term are available to purchase shares at 80% of their market value shortly before the start of the savings contract.
Executive directors may participate in this scheme on the same terms as all other employees.
Service contracts It is the Companys policy that all executive directors have rolling service contracts with a one year notice period.
However, in order to attract high calibre recruits, the Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion to offer newly recruited executive directors an initial two year notice period which reduces to one year.
Save as listed below, there are no express provisions for compensation payable upon early termination of the executive directors contracts and at the date of termination, other than payments due during the notice period.
In the event of termination of a service agreement by the acquiring Company after a change of control of the Company, there is a provision in the service agreement of Messrs Jones and Biles for a payment of liquidated damages equivalent to two years salary, bonus and contractual benefits including contributions to the executive directors pension arrangements, without deduction for mitigation and or accelerated receipt.
An identical provision did exist in the service agreement of Mr Gott except that the payment related to one year instead of two.
Mr Gott is in the process of concluding discussions on a new service contract from which this provision is excluded.
Messrs Jones and Biles will leave on 30 July and 31 December 2004 respectively.
Summary details of their termination arrangements appear on pages 38 and 39.
Therefore, after 31 December 2004, no director will have a notice period greater than 12 months.
In the case of Mr Heiden, in the event of termination of his service contract by the acquiring Company after a change of control of FKI, there is a provision in his service contract for a payment of liquidated damages equivalent to one years pay and contractual benefits without deduction for mitigation and or accelerated receipt.
If a change of control occurs prior to the expiry of the second anniversary of 2 January 2003, a sum would be payable equivalent to the greater of that payable as above and 90% of the salary, bonus and contractual benefits which would have been paid between the date of termination and the expiry of the third anniversary of 2 January 2003.
The contract dates and notice periods for the executive directors during the year were as follows: Name of director Date of contract Notice period P Heiden 16 December 2002 One year J A Biles 14 January 1998 One year S D Jones 6 July 1998 One year R L Gott 8 April 2002 One year 36 FKI plc Annual report 2004 Remuneration report The non-executive directors do not have service contracts.
The dates of the current non-executive directors appointments are as follows: Date of Date of Non-executive director Appointment date last re-election next re-election K Orrell-Jones 29 July 1999 23 July 2003 23 July 2005 C R N Clark 1 January 2000 23 July 2003 23 July 2005 R P Edey 6 November 1996 23 July 2003 23 July 2006 Sir Michael Hodgkinson 1 April 2000 23 July 2003 21 July 2004 C Matthews 11 November 2003 21 July 2004 Pensions With the exception of Mr Heiden, executive directors are members of the FKI Group Pension Scheme, a defined benefit scheme with a normal retirement age for directors of 60 years.
Its main features, in respect of executive directors, are: a A cash benefit on death in service of four times annual rate of the highest average basic salary restricted to the earnings cap where it applies during any three consecutive years within the ten years before the members date of death.
b Pensions payable in the event of ill health.
c Pensions for dependants on a members death generally equal to half the members prospective retirement pension at 60 on death in service, or half the members pension entitlement on death in retirement.
d Member contributions were 5% of basic salary until 1 March 2004 when they increased to 7% restricted to the earnings cap where it applies.
Mr Biles paid no contributions to the FKI Group Pension Scheme.
There are funded and unfunded unapproved pension arrangements to increase the pension benefits where because of Inland Revenue limitations including those resulting from the earnings cap these cannot be paid in total from the Scheme.
Such arrangements apply to Messrs Biles and Gott.
In lieu of participation in the FKI Group Pension Scheme, Mr Heiden receives contributions into a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme equivalent to 50% of his basic salary.
Details of the directors pension benefits during the year under review are shown on page 39.
External appointments The Company believes that there are significant benefits to the individual and the Company from executive directors accepting non-executive directorships in other organisations.
Each executive director may accept one non-executive directorship provided that it does not conflict with the Companys interests and is approved by the Board.
Fees from an external directorship may be retained by the director concerned.
Messrs Heiden and Biles both fulfilled external roles as non executive directors.
Details of fees received in 2003 04 in respect of these external roles are show below: Mr P Heiden Non-executive director Bunzl plc 39,516 Mr J A Biles Non-executive director Amey plc 5,500 Fees for two months to 30 May 2003 when Mr Biles resigned following the takeover of Amey plc.

d Other represents payments to a director in lieu of payments into a pension fund.
e Contributions paid in respect of funded unapproved retirement benefit schemes.
f Mr Beeston retired in February 2003 but his total emoluments are included for comparison.
g On appointment, Mr Heidens service contract made provision for bonus for the first three months of service to be retrospectively calculated on the same basis as any bonus for his first full financial year with the Company.
The figure shown above, therefore, represents his bonus for 15 months.
The fees paid to non-executive directors and the Chairman are determined by the Board after reviewing fee payments for comparable positions within similar organisations, and are normally reviewed every three years.
The last review was in 2000 so fees would have normally been reviewed in 2003.
However, the Chairman and the non-executive directors unanimously decided not to accept an increase in fees at that time.
Board changes Mr Biles will leave FKI on 31 December 2004 as a consequence of restructuring of the Board.
For the period April to December 2004 Mr Biles will receive his normal remuneration and benefits.
During the period July to December 2004 it is not anticipated that Mr Biles will work full time but he will be available to FKI at the discretion of the Chief Executive.
He may be able to leave earlier than 31 December 2004 by mutual agreement.
On leaving in December he will receive a payment of 204,975 less accelerated benefit discount which equates to six months normal remuneration and benefits, and a bonus 64,125 determined on a discretionary basis.
He will continue to have use of his Company car until June 2005.
He may then purchase the car for a fair value at July 2005.
A sum of 26,464 will be withheld from the payment due to him in December or earlier in respect of the Company car and any adjustment made to the withholding based upon the agreed value.
The Company will pay to the FKI Group Pension Fund a sum of 21,000 as the cost of Mr Biles early pension not being subject to an actuarial reduction for benefits accrued up to his leaving date.
After leaving Mr Biles may receive benefits from the share options and LTIPs shown in the tables below, subject to the option and LTIPs plan rules.
38 FKI plc Annual report 2004 Remuneration report Mr Jones will leave FKI on 30 July 2004 as a consequence of restructuring of the Board.
He will receive his normal remuneration and benefits from April to July.
During this period he will continue in full time employment with FKI.
He will then receive a payment of 214,468 less accelerated benefit discount which equates to eight months contractual remuneration and benefits, and a discretionary bonus of 11,700 in respect of the period April to July 2004.
After leaving Mr Jones may receive benefits from the share options and LTIPs shown in the tables below, subject to the option and LTIPs plan rules.
Mr Neil Bamford joined the Board from 1 April 2004 as Finance Director with additional responsibilities for some business unit operations.
He was formerly the Divisional Managing Director, Lifting Products & Services.
The terms and conditions set out in his new service agreement reflect current best practice for directors service contracts and is a one year rolling contract with a salary of 200,000.
Directors pension benefits The under noted directors were members of a defined benefit scheme provided by the Group during the year.
Pension entitlements and corresponding transfer values were as follows: Transfer value of increase Increase Increase decrease decrease in decrease in in accrued Transfer Transfer transfer accrued benefit less Accrued Accrued value of value of value less pension contributions pension at pension at pension at pension at contributions excluding made by 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March made by inflation directors 2004 2003 2004 2003 directors Name of director 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 J A Biles 1.6 25.3 10.2 8.4 161.6 125.1 36.5 R L Gott 1.9 7.1 21.5 19.0 168.1 141.1 17.9 S D Jones 6.2 52.7 70.6 62.7 658.1 543.4 103.3 Note: Mr Gotts accrued pension and transfer value were quoted as 14,900 pa and 128,600 respectively as at 31 March 2003.
This has been revised to the amounts shown above to reflect benefit improvements which were not previously taken account of.
The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement, based on service to the end of the year or date of leaving the pension scheme or ceasing to accrue further benefit if earlier.
The increase in accrued pension during the year excludes any increase for inflation.
The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11, although no adjustment has been made for under funding of the Scheme.
The calculation of each transfer value includes an allowance for the cost of death before retirement benefits.
The change in the amount of the transfer value over the year is impacted by the following elements: a the transfer value of the increase in accrued pension net of inflation : b the transfer value of the increase in accrued pension due to inflation : c the increase in the transfer value of accrued pension at the beginning of the year due to ageing: d the impact of any change in the economic or mortality assumptions underlying the transfer value basis: e the effect of a to d less the directors own contributions over the year.
The change in the amount of the transfer value over the year includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and directors, such as stock market movements, which are reflected in d above.
The figures for Mr Biles and Mr Gott allow for the impact of the earnings cap.
This includes the period of service prior to Mr Gott becoming a director.
Directors have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions.
However, neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the table.
Mr Biles and Mr Gotts UK pension scheme benefits are subject to the Inland Revenues earnings cap.
Contributions equivalent to 30% of Mr Biles annual salary in excess of the earnings cap were made to a Funded Unapproved Retirements Benefits Scheme.
The total contributions were 51,719 in the year to 31 March 2004 49,451 to 31 March 2003.
The Company has agreed to provide benefits to Mr Gott by establishment of an Unfunded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme designed to bring his total benefits for service from 1 April 2001 to the levels which would have applied under the FKI Group Pension Scheme if the earnings cap had not applied.
All executive share options were granted at nil cost to the director concerned.
The market price of an ordinary share on 31 March 2004 was 111p 2003: 64p and the range during the year was 61p to 125.5p.
Executive share options granted prior to 1996 are not subject to a performance condition.
All executive share options granted since 1996 are exercisable from the dates stated above, subject to them satisfying the performance condition stated in the policy section.
The Companys total shareholder return performance for the three year performance period that ended in March 2004 ranked below median against its comparator group and under the terms of the rules applicable to the 2000 awards, 100% of the awards lapsed.
The price of an ordinary share on 9 June 2003, being the date that awards were made during the year was 83.75p.
The awards are subject to the performance conditions for LTIP awards, as outlined in the policy section.
The market value of shares as yet unvested is stated at 111p per share, being the closing mid-market price on 31 March 2004.
As at 31 March 2004, the Company was ranked below median in its comparator group for the awards granted in 2001 to 2002.
If the ranking positions for these two awards were to be maintained until the end of the respective performance periods, none of the awards granted in 2001 and 2002 would vest.
