Remuneration Report This report contains the information required by the Companies Act 1985 and the relevant parts of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and Schedule B to the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
The Board of Directors report that the Company has complied with these regulations throughout the year under review.
Information not subject to audit The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration of the Group's Chairman and executive directors: it also reviews that of senior executives.
The members of the Committee who served during the year are listed in this Annual Report.
They are independent non-executive directors of the Company and have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in the matters addressed by the Committee and have no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships.
Remuneration policy The remuneration packages of directors are reviewed by the Committee at least annually on the same basis as any other employee of the Group.
The review takes into account market practice and performance of the individual and of the business.
Other factors taken into account include the experience and responsibility of the individuals concerned.
The Committee receives information from various sources to provide independent advice on directors remuneration.
This includes Monks Partnership whose parent company, , has provided other services to the Group during the year, principally tax advice.
The components of the Group's remuneration packages are detailed below.
Salary Salaries of directors are set by reference to those prevailing in the market, particularly within other major retail companies, and according to individual performance, experience and responsibility.
Annual performance related bonus The executive directors, excluding the Chairman, participate in an annual performance related bonus scheme which is based on a formula measuring the performance of the business.
The performance measure is earnings per share before tax, which must increase by RPI and 2% prior to any bonus becoming payable.
The formula determined by the Committee includes an upper limit of 75% of salary and other constraints which may reduce the bonus percentage below that determined by the formula.
Long term incentive plan A long term incentive plan was introduced for executive directors and senior executives in 1997 following approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
It was renewed in 2002 at the time of the capital reconstruction.
Performance is measured over periods of three years, which commence annually, by comparing Total Shareholder Return against approximately 20 other UK listed retail companies.
The comparator group of companies for the three year performance period January 2001 to January 2004 was as follows: Arcadia Dixons Laura Ashley N. Brown Body Shop Findel Marks & Spencer New Look Boots G. U. S. Matalan Selfridges Debenhams J Sainsbury MFI Furniture Tesco DFS Furniture Kingfisher Mothercare W H Smith The Committee determines which companies are to be added to or removed from the comparator group.
JJB Sports has been added to the comparator group for periods ending January 2005 onwards.
Arcadia, Debenhams and Selfridges have been removed for periods ending January 2006 onwards following their delisting and have been replaced with Burberry, Signet and Woolworths.
The Committee considers that the comparator group consists of companies which are most comparable to NEXT plc in size or nature of their business.
The Committee believes that comparison against a group of retail companies is more likely to reflect the Companys relative performance against its peers, thereby resulting in appropriate awards being made.
17 Remuneration Report The graph below shows relative Total Shareholder Return of the Company over five years when compared to the FTSE All Share index and FTSE General Retailers index.
This illustrates the Companys performance against a wide all-share UK index and against other companies in the same sector.
NEXT plc Performance Chart 1999-2004 Total Shareholder Return 250 200.
150 100 50 Re-based to 31 January 1999 100 NEXT plc FTSE General Retailers FTSE All Share Under the rules of the plan the maximum award possible for each performance period is 100% of basic salary.
However, the Committee has restricted the maximum award possible to 70% of basic salary for all periods commencing prior to January 2004.
If Total Shareholder Return is more than one percentage point below the median ranking company there will be no entitlement to any of the award.
For performance within one percentage point of the median the entitlement will be 30% of the maximum 70% award.
For performance above the median the entitlement will rise, with the maximum award being earned for performance which places the Company in the upper quartile of the comparator group.
Irrespective of where Company performance ranks, no award will be made unless the earnings per share of the Company has increased by at least the increase in the Retail Price Index over the period.
Awards are granted provisionally at the start of a performance period and remain subject to performance conditions over the life of the plan before any entitlement is earned.
If no entitlement has been earned at the end of a three year performance period then the award for that period will lapse.
The Company has discretion as to whether entitlements earned are payable in NEXT plc shares or cash, to date it has allowed participants the choice.
Entitlements earned are not pensionable and are based on salary and share price at the start of the performance period.
Individuals included in the plan have not received grants under the management share option scheme in the same year.
Management share options The management share option scheme was approved by shareholders in 1995, was renewed in 2002 and is due for renewal in 2005.
The scheme provides for options over shares, exercisable between three and ten years following their grant, to be allocated to Group employees at the discretion of the Board.
The total number of options which can be granted is subject to shareholder approved limits.
Options are set at the prevailing market price at the time of grant.
The maximum value of Inland Revenue approved share options which may be granted to any employee is restricted to 30,000.
Unapproved options can also be granted under the scheme, the maximum number being determined by a formula which restricts the aggregate option exercise price to four times total remuneration of the employee less the value of any outstanding approved share options.
It is not the practice to grant the maximum number of options allowable to any employee in one year.
Grants are generally made annually.
The exercise of options is subject to a performance condition where the percentage growth in earnings per share of the Group over a three year period must exceed RPI and a further 3% per annum.
No options were granted to directors or changes made to existing entitlements in the year under review.
No employee has received option grants under the scheme and been included in the long term incentive plan in the same year.
18 Remuneration Report Sharesave options The sharesave option scheme was approved by shareholders in 2000.
It was renewed in 2002 at the time of the capital reconstruction and is due for renewal in 2010.
Invitations to participate are generally issued annually to all employees.
The scheme operates on a save-as-you-earn principle and is subject to a maximum contribution limit of 250 per month per employee.
Options are exercisable three, five or seven years from the date of grant.
Options are granted at the prevailing market rate less a discount of 20%.
A similar scheme is operated by the Company for its employees in the Republic of Ireland.
Sharesave options granted to directors in the year under review are detailed below.
Group pension scheme Executive directors are eligible for membership of the NEXT Group Pension Plan which has been approved by the Inland Revenue and which consists of defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The trustee of the scheme is a limited company, NEXT Pension Trustees Limited the 'Trustee'.
All the directors of the Trustee are appointed and can be removed by NEXT plc.
The Chairman of the Trustee is a non-executive director of NEXT plc and the Board of the Trustee includes members of the scheme, a pensioner member and an independent director.
All directors of the Trustee receive a fee for their services, including those directors who are also employees of NEXT plc.
The scheme's investments are kept entirely separate from the business affairs of the NEXT Group and the Trustee holds them in trust.
Responsibility for investment of the scheme's funds has been delegated by the Trustee to professional investment managers.
Defined contribution section Employees of the Group can join the defined contribution section of the scheme.
Members elect to pay either 3% or 5% of their pensionable earnings which is matched by the Company.
For death prior to retirement, a lump sum of three times the members basic salary at the previous 1 April is payable along with the current value of the members fund, subject to Inland Revenue limits.
Defined benefit section The defined benefit section of the scheme was closed to new members in 2000 but is being continued for the benefit of existing members.
The section provides members with a retirement benefit of one sixtieth or one eightieth depending on chosen member contribution rate of final pensionable earnings including bonus, but subject to the limitation and possible change detailed below for each year of pensionable service, payable from a normal retirement age of 60.
This section also provides a lump sum death in service benefit and dependents pensions on death in service or following retirement.
For death prior to retirement a spouse's pension of 60% of the member's prospective pension is payable.
A lump sum of up to three times the member's final pensionable earnings plus a return of the member's contributions with interest is also payable.
For death after retirement a spouse's pension of 60% of the member's pre-commutation pension is payable.
A lump sum equivalent to the balance of five years pension is payable if death occurs within five years of retirement.
If death occurs after leaving service but before the pension becomes payable i. e. as a deferred pensioner, a spouse's pension of 60% of the accrued deferred pension is payable along with a lump sum equal to the members own contributions with interest.
Children's pensions are only payable on death in service.
In the case of illhealth retirement only the accrued pension is payable.
All benefits are subject to Inland Revenue limits.
Increases to pensions in payment are at the discretion of the Trustee although pensionable service post 1997 is subject to limited price indexation.
For all current scheme members basic pay, overtime and annual performance bonus are included in calculating pensionable earnings but no other items of remuneration are taken into account.
The inclusion of annual performance bonus in pensionable earnings is limited to a maximum of 35% of an employees annual salary in any year.
The inclusion of bonus in pensionable earnings has been the practice for many years and is appropriate for NEXT where a significant element of employee earnings is dependent on productivity or profit performance.
However, the Company has made a request to the Trustee that bonus is excluded from future defined benefit contributions and is replaced with an optional AVC alternative.
Members contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings.
The Company made contributions at the rate of 12.5% up to April 2003 and 13.4% thereafter.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit sections financial position was undertaken as at 31 March 2002 and updated as at 31 March 2003.
The update concluded that the scheme had a 32% deficit of assets compared to actuarial liabilities.
19 Remuneration Report Members who joined the scheme after May 1989 and before October 2000 are subject to the Inland Revenue salary cap for approved pension schemes which is set at 99,000 per annum for 2003 2004.
Members subject to the cap may be provided with appropriate benefits through an unfunded, unapproved arrangement in relation to that part of their earnings which exceeds the cap, where they so elect.
The relevant members contribute towards the additional cost of providing these benefits by paying 5% of pensionable earnings in excess of the cap.
Specific information in respect of executive directors pension entitlements is detailed below.
Notice periods Each of the executive directors now has a rolling service contract which is terminable by the Company on giving one years notice.
The executive directors service contracts were renewed on 28 November 2003.
The most significant change was the reduction in notice period from two years to one year, with the exception of termination by the Company in the event of a takeover of the Group.
No compensation was paid to any director in respect of this reduction.
The Committee will ensure that in the event of any termination payment being made to a director full account will be taken of that directors duty to mitigate any loss and where appropriate the Committee may seek independent professional advice prior to authorising such payment.
Apart from service contracts no director has had any material interest in any contract with the Company or its subsidiaries.
Other benefits Executive directors receive benefits which may include the provision of a fully expensed company car or cash alternative, private medical insurance, annual subscriptions to appropriate professional bodies and staff discount when purchasing the Group's merchandise.
Other employees are also eligible for certain of these benefits.
Non-executive directors Remuneration of the non-executive directors of the Company is determined by the executive directors.
Remuneration consists of fees for their services in connection with Board and Board Committee meetings.
Letters of appointment do not contain notice periods.
Nonexecutive directors do not participate in any of the Group's pension, bonus, share option or other incentive schemes.

Mr D W Keens benefits include an allowance chargeable to UK tax of 3,892 2003: 3,243.
Mr A J Varleys bonus includes 30,000 in respect of property transactions.

The Company paid a pension under the unfunded, unapproved arrangement to a former director of the Company of 30,015 2003: 29,597.
Long term incentive plan Estimated monetary values were included in the January 2003 Remuneration Report for the three year performance plan which matured at that date based on a share price of 822p on 24 March 2003.
Awards were made subsequent to the Report on 31 March 2003 when the share price was 849p.
Adjustments to the estimated monetary value together with the final award have therefore been included in the table below.
A further three year performance period of the plan matured in January 2004.
The Total Shareholder Return of the Company over this period ranked between fifth and sixth when compared to the group of 20 other listed retail companies.
Accordingly an award of 92% of the maximum equivalent to 64% of basic salary is expected to be made to the participants in the plan, which is payable in NEXT plc shares or cash at the Companys discretion.
The awards will be made during 2004 and, based on the share price of 1362p on 22 March 2004, awards to directors would be as follows: January 2004 January 2003 Actual Estimated Adjustment Final no.

There have been no other changes to awards under the long term incentive plan during the year.
21 Remuneration Report Directors pension entitlements All executive directors, except the Chairman, are members of the NEXT Group Pension Plan.
Directors and some senior managers receive an enhancement from the Plan, increasing the accrual of their retirement benefit up to two thirds of their final pensionable earnings on completion of 20 years pensionable service at age 60 for members who joined before October 2000.
The lump sum payable on death in service for directors and some senior managers is enhanced to four times pensionable salary.
In the case of earnings over 100,000 per annum, final pensionable earnings are based on an average of the best consecutive 36 or more months earnings in the ten years prior to retirement.
Pension entitlements of the executive directors who held office during the year are as follows: Increase in Transfer value Increase in Age at Years of Accrued accrued of accrued transfer value January pensionable annual annual annual pension less directors 2004 service pension pension 2004 2003 contributions 000 000 000 000 000 S A Wolfson 36 9 105 26 546 420 110 C E Angelides 40 11 97 30 615 452 148 D W Keens 50 17 180 23 1,666 1,516 127 A J Varley 53 20 165 16 1,841 1,570 254 Years of pensionable service shown above may include bought in service from the transfer of other pension entitlements into the Plan.
Due to movements in bond yields, which underly the basis of calculation of transfer values, the increase in transfer values over the year can be significantly higher for members nearer to retirement than for younger members.
Mr S A Wolfson and Mr C E Angelides are both subject to the Inland Revenue salary cap and have elected to join the unfunded, unapproved pension arrangement.
The accrued annual pension set out above includes their membership of that arrangement.
Directors' interests Directors' beneficial interests in shares and share options at the beginning of the financial year, or date of appointment if later, and at the end of the year, were as follows: Ordinary shares of 10p each Options over ordinary shares of 10p each 2004 2003 2004 2004 2003 2003 No.
