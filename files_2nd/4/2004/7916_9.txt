ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004 REMUNERATION REPORT Directors interests in share options audited Grants during 2004 were made subject to a sliding scale performance condition that determines the number of shares that could vest.
The condition is set out on page 50.
No gains were realised on the exercise of share options during 2004 or 2003.
No performance conditions are attached to options granted under this scheme as it is an all-employee share option scheme.
1 No variations were made to Directors options or the terms and conditions of any Directors options during the year 2004 or the period ended 14 February 2005.
2 No amount was paid for the award of any options.
ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004 REMUNERATION REPORT Directors interests in share options continued audited 3 Grants under the Executive Share Option Plan in 2004 were made subject to the following sliding scale performance condition: Percentage of shares vesting Earnings Per Share for 2006 Nil less than 25.0p 33.3% 25.0p 66.7% 27.9p 100.0% 30.7p There is no retesting of the condition after the three year performance period.
The EPS figures that determine vesting, as laid out above in the Performance Condition, are quoted under current accounting standards and will require restatement when International Financial Reporting Standards are adopted in full.
The Remuneration Committee will ensure that the adjustments made are fair and 50 equitable.
4 Grants made under the share option scheme prior to 2004 were made subject to an EPS performance condition that over a threeyear period in the life of the option the growth in ICIs EPS excluding amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items must be equal to, or greater than, the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index plus 3% per annum.
Options granted in 2000, 2001 and 2002 have failed to meet their performance condition to date.
The performance conditions relating to these options will be retested in 2006.
The grant to Mr W H Powell in 1997 is an exception as it was made before he was appointed a Director and is not subject to a performance condition, in accordance with ICIs practice in the USA at that time.
5 The earliest date from which an option is exercisable is subject to any outstanding performance condition being met.
6 In accordance with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, the annual grant of share options made on 29 April 1999 to certain Executive Directors involved with the then proposed disposal of businesses to Huntsman ICI Holdings LLC was delayed.
As a result of this delay, those participants were granted fewer options at a higher exercise price than would have been the case had the grants been made to them at the same time as they were made to all other participants at an exercise price of 4.33 adjusted for the Rights Issue.
The Remuneration Committee decided that those individuals so affected should receive the same gross gain at the time they exercise their options as if the grant had not been delayed.
7 Following his appointment as Chief Executive in 2003, Dr J D G McAdam received a one-off option grant of two times salary in addition to his annual grant.
8 Awards made in the form of Stock Appreciation Rights, denominated in ADRs, that for the purpose of this table have been disclosed in terms of Ordinary Share option equivalents at the price of the ICI shares at the date of grant.
Any gain on exercise of these awards is delivered in the form of ADRs.
9 The grant to Mr C F Knott that was made in 2004 was prior to his date of appointment as an Executive Director.
10 The market price of the shares at 31 December 2004 was 2.41 and the range during 2004 was 1.93 to 2.47.
The Register of Directors Interests which is open to inspection by shareholders contains full details of Directors shareholdings and options to subscribe for shares.
11 The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for share option grants.
12 During the period 1 January 2005 to 14 February 2005 there were no changes in the interests of Directors in options.
13 The total number of options to be satisfied by the issue of new shares, which is relevant to dilution limits of the share capital in issue, is in respect of grants made under the UK all-employee Sharesave Scheme and the 2004 Executive Share Option Plan.
There are limits on the number of newly issued shares that can be used to satisfy awards under this scheme together with all of the Groups other share schemes in any 10 year period.
The limits and the Groups current position against those limits are set out below.
Limit Current Position 5% of Groups share capital can be 0.3% used used for discretionary share schemes 10% of Groups share capital can be 1.1% used used for all share schemes The total number of shares committed under all ICI share option schemes during the three years to 31 December 2004 is set out in note 23 to the Accounts on page 90.
Between 1994 and 2003 all discretionary share schemes have operated using shares purchased in the market by an employee benefit trust.
Details of shares held in this trust are on page 89.
ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004 REMUNERATION REPORT Retirement benefits Details of the accrued pension to which each Director is entitled on leaving service, and the transfer value of those accrued pensions are shown in the table below.
A transfer value is the present value lump sum equivalent of the accrued pension and is calculated in accordance with the Guidance Note published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries GN 11.
Directors pension benefits audited Defined benefit pension plans Defined contribution pension plans Additional Accrued Transfer value Transfer value Increase in Contributions Contributions pension pension at of accrued of accrued transfer value 2004 2003 accrued 31 December pension at pension at of accrued in 2004 2004 1 January 31 December pension note 1 note 2 2004 2004 during year note 3 notes 000 p. a.
2 The accrued annual pension at the end of the year, payable at normal retirement age.
3 The transfer value calculations take into account the combined effect of notional interest and the individuals age which will typically increase transfer values by 8%-9% year on year.
Additional factors that impact the transfer values which are net of contributions by Directors over the year reflect any changes in pensionable pay and the service of each Director as well as changes in actuarial assumptions, particularly for equity and bond returns.
For Dr J D G McAdam approximately 20% of the increase in transfer value reflects the increase in salary on his promotion to Chief Executive in 2003 and the effect of this on his 30 years accrued pensionable service.
This increase is in accordance with the rules of the ICI Specialty Chemicals Pension Fund.
4 Dr J D G McAdam, Mr T A Scott and Mr C F Knott participate in the ICI Specialty Chemicals Pension Fund.
Pensionable salary under this plan includes annual bonus, subject to a maximum of 20% of base salary for Dr McAdam and 15% of base salary for Mr Scott and Mr Knott.
The pensionable element of bonus is particular to these three Executive Directors and reflects their terms of employment and continuous pensionable service prior to their transfer from Unilever to ICI in 1997, on the acquisition of certain specialty chemicals businesses.
This pensionable bonus element entitlement has been frozen since the time of transfer and has not been increased in line with promotion or increases in ICIs bonus levels.
5 Mr D C M Hamill participates in the ICI UK Retirement Plan, a defined contribution plan, in respect of base salary up to the Inland Revenue earnings cap currently 102,000 for 2004 5.
He also receives a retirement benefits allowance, payable in cash and subject to income tax, in respect of base salary above this cap.
This allowance is reported in the Directors emoluments table on page 47 and for the 2004 period totalled 86,625 2003 5,073 for the period from date of his appointment on 8 December 2003.
6 The transfer value for Mr C F Knott shown in the column headed Transfer value of accrued pension at 1 January 2004 is for his accrued pension at his date of appointment on 1 September 2004.
7 Mr W H Powell participates in the National Starch and Chemical Company Pension Plan for Salaried Employees and the Supplementary Retirement and Savings Plan of National Starch and Chemical Company.
Under these Plans, pension is based on average pay, including annual bonus, during the previous five years, during which time Mr Powell was promoted to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of National Starch and Chemical Company.
He also participates in two defined contribution plans, for which the employers contributions are set out above.
Mr Powells figures reflect not only the change in value of benefits but also movements in exchange rates used for the translation to sterling 2004 1 US$1.832 : 2003 1 US$1.63.
The actual additional pension accrued in the year was US$31,779 and the actual transfer value increased over the year by US$455,009.
8 The Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority require disclosure above and beyond that set out in the Companies Act.
Specifically the following disclosures for defined benefit plans which are calculated on an alternative basis to those disclosed in the table above.
Additional annual pension accrued in 2004 net of inflation : Dr J D G McAdam 88,660: Mr T A Scott 11,280: Mr C F Knott 2,840: Mr W H Powell 6,480.
Transfer values at 31 December 2004 of the increase in accrued pension net of inflation and contributions by the Director : Dr McAdam 1,379,200: Mr Scott 63,800: Mr Knott 25,500: Mr Powell 75,659.
9 In 2003 there were three Directors for whom retirement benefits were accruing in respect of qualifying service under money purchase schemes defined contribution schemes and five Directors under defined benefit schemes.
Contributions made to money purchase schemes in 2003 in respect of Directors totalled 63,000.
UK Inland Revenue pensions simplification tax regime The Remuneration Committee has agreed ICIs approach in response to the UK pensions simplification legislation, which will become effective on 1 April 2006, for those Executive Directors who are members of UK pension plans.
Such Executive Directors will be given the option of either: maintaining the existing pension promise, in which case the executive would take personal responsibility for any additional taxation arising, or ceasing to accrue pension benefits in respect of future service and instead receiving a cash retirement benefit allowance, subject to income taxation.
