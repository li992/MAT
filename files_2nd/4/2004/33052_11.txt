Remuneration report Remuneration Committee membership and terms of reference The Remuneration Committee the Committee is comprised exclusively of Independent Non-executive Directors and its members are: The Rt Hon.
Lord Baker of Dorking CH Chairman, W F Blount and The Baroness Noakes DBE.
The role of the Committee is to consider and make recommendations on the framework of executive remuneration the policy for approval by the Board.
In accordance with the policy, the Committee will consider, recommend as appropriate and approve the conditions of service of the Chairman, the Executive Directors and the Company Secretary, including the duration of any service agreements, and the emoluments and other benets payable under such agreements, including pension entitlements and participation in incentive arrangements.
The Committee also recommends and monitors the level and structure of remuneration for senior management and oversees the Companys and Old Hansons long-term incentive plans and option schemes.
During the year under review, other than from its independent advisor, the Committee also sought the assistance of the Chairman, the Chief Executive and the Company Secretary on matters relating to remuneration.
There were two formal meetings held by the Committee during the year and all members attended each meeting.
The Committee also dealt with other matters under its terms of reference by written correspondence.
The Chairman, Chief Executive and the Company Secretary were present at meetings of the Committee but the Chief Executive and the Company Secretary were respectively excluded when their own performance and remuneration were being discussed.
Committee members receive fees as Non-executive Directors, including a fee for acting as a Committee member, but do not receive any pension entitlements nor any short and long-term performance related incentives.
No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest, other than as a shareholder in the Company, in the matters to be decided or for the day-to-day management of the business.
The fees payable to Non-executive Directors are determined by the Board as a whole within the limits set by the articles of association.
The Non-executive Directors do not participate in or vote on any discussion relating to their own remuneration.
The Committee has appointed Mercer Human Resource Consulting Mercer to act on behalf of the Committee in providing independent market information and remuneration advice on an ongoing basis.
Mercer also provides actuarial and consulting services to the Company.
Remuneration policy Hanson operates in competitive and international markets.
To continue to compete successfully it is essential that the Company attracts, develops, retains and motivates talented high-calibre Executive Directors and senior executives in the best interests of shareholders.
To ensure that its remuneration rates are competitive, whilst not being excessive, the Committee keeps remuneration under regular review in light of emerging best practice.
The remuneration policy is designed to provide packages, which take account of individual performance: i in the knowledge of what comparable, in terms of size and complexity, UK and international companies are paying: ii in the context of packages offered throughout the Hanson group: and iii to include short and long-term performance related elements, potentially a significant portion of total rewards, to motivate the highest performance and to align the interests of the Executive Directors and shareholders.
Share incentives are considered to be an important part of the incentive policy for Executive Directors.
While there is no specic shareholding requirement for Executive Directors, shares arising from share based incentive plans are expected to be retained.
As shareholder approval for conditional awards to be made under the Companys long-term incentive arrangements expires in 2006, the Company will undertake a review in 2005 of its long-term incentive arrangements with a view to submitting proposals to shareholders at the annual general meeting to be held in 2006.
Basic salary In setting the basic salary for each Executive Director, the Committee reviews relevant market data and considers the Directors experience, performance and responsibilities.
Basic salaries are generally reviewed on an annual basis or following a significant change in responsibilities.
Increases in basic salary of 4% have been granted to the Executive Directors for the year commencing January 1, 2005.
Annual bonus scheme The annual bonus scheme for the Executive Directors and other senior executives is aligned with changes in shareholder value through the economic value added methodology.
The main principle of economic value added is to recognise that over time a company should generate returns in excess of its operating costs and the cost of capital the return that lenders and shareholders expect of the Company each year.
The annual bonus scheme is calibrated by reference to target levels of bonus.
Each year the participant receives one-third of an accumulated bonus bank, which is updated for the years performance compared with target.
The bonus bank has two main functions: rstly it ensures that individuals do not make short-term decisions such as deferring essential expenditure from one year to the next and receive a bonus for doing so: and secondly, the bonus bank can act as a retention tool.
For 2004, the target level of bonus for A J Murray was 62.5% of basic salary, for J C Nicholls 50% of basic salary and for G Dranseld 37.5% of basic salary.
The groups overall economic value added performance determined the bonus bank addition for the Executive Directors in 2004 and will also determine the bonus bank addition or deduction for them in 2005.
The bonuses paid in respect of the year to December 31, 2004 to the Executive Directors are set out in the table of Directors remuneration on page 42.
Performance targets under the annual bonus scheme, based on improvements in economic value added, are set by the Committee, after taking advice from Mercer.
Bonuses payable to Executive Directors are not pensionable.
38 Remuneration report Remuneration report continued Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Executive Directors and certain senior executives and managers from the Companys worldwide operations participate in the LTIP.
Under this plan, participants are conditionally awarded shares in the Company at nil cost with the proportion of those shares which may vest subject to the achievement of performance targets over a performance period set by the Committee.
In 2004 a conditional award of shares was made to A J Murray of 150% of basic salary and to the other Executive Directors of 100% of basic salary.
The conditional awards made in 2004 are subject to performance criteria and the Committee determined that 50% of the conditional award should be subject to the attainment of an economic value added target and 50% to a total shareholder return TSR target.
TSR is the aggregate of share price growth and dividends paid, on the assumption that such dividends are reinvested in Hanson shares during the performance period.
The Committee selected these performance measurements as it believes they correlate clearly with the creation of shareholder value.
For the conditional award made in 2004, the economic value added target requires an improvement in economic value added over a period of three years based on the results for the year to December 31, 2003.
For this measurement, a linear vesting schedule applies in order that only a small proportion of the award will vest at the minimum performance level with the maximum award vesting only on the achievement of substantial performance improvement.
A similar economic value added target is in place for the awards made in 2002 and 2003.
On attaining the minimum economic value added improvements of 8.8m for the 2002 award, 13.4m for the 2003 award and 14.0m for the 2004 award, 25% of the respective awards, subject to the economic value added measurement criteria, will vest.
100% of the awards subject to this measurement will vest on the attainment of economic value added improvements of 23.4m, 35.6m and 37.2m for the 2002, 2003 and 2004 awards, respectively.
For the TSR measurement in 2004 and similarly for the awards made in 2002 and 2003, the conditional awards made will vest only if Hanson achieves a TSR over the three-year performance period, from the date of the award in March 2004, which is greater than the TSR achieved by at least 50% of the members of a comparator group of international building materials companies at the date of the award the comparator group over the same period.
If so, 30% of the award will vest.
All of the award will vest if the Company achieves a TSR over the performance period which is greater than that achieved by 80% of the comparator group.
Between these two points the award will vest in the proportion of 2.33% of the award for each 1% improvement in the Companys ranking.
In 2001, the comparator group consisted of 22 companies, including Hanson.
These included 10 UK building materials companies in the FTSE350 Index Aggregate Industries, BPB, Hanson, Hepworth, Novar, Pilkington, RMC, Travis Perkins, Ultraframe and Wolseley, six European building materials companies in the Euro Top 300 Index CRH, Dyckerhoff, Heidelberger, Holcim, Lafarge and Wienerberger, four US businesses Florida Rock, Martin Marietta, Texas Industries and Vulcan and two Australian building materials companies Boral and CSR.
In 2002, 2003 and 2004, Hepworth was removed from the comparator group following its takeover.
Additionally, following the demerger of Rinker Group Limited from CSR in March 2003, the performance measurement of the comparator group for the 2002 and 2003 awards has been modied to substitute Rinker for CSR using the methodology of re-investing a notional holding of CSR shares in Rinker from April 1, 2003 onwards.
Rinker replaced CSR in the comparator group for the 2004 award.
There is no retesting of performance under either the economic value added measurement or the TSR measurement.
The table below shows the conditional interests in shares of Executive Directors relating to awards made under the LTIP in 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004.
For the conditional award made in 2001 to Executive Directors, 53.34% of the award subject to a TSR performance measurement criteria and 25% of the award subject to an EVA performance measurement criteria vested following the end of the three-year performance period.
This resulted in a total vesting of 39.17% of the maximum number of shares under the conditional awards.
For the conditional award made in 2002, it is anticipated that none of the award subject to a TSR performance measurement and 50% of the award subject to an EVA performance measurement criteria will vest following the end of the three year performance period.
This would result in a total vesting of 25% of the maximum number of shares under the conditional awards.
A J Murray retained 39,800 shares and G Dranseld and J C Nicholls both retained 14,160 shares.
2 J C Nicholls conditional interest in shares under the LTIP increased by 44,004 shares, in total, following his marriage on May 22, 2004 due to his wife being a participant in the LTIP.
3 A J H Dougal and S N Vivian, former Executive Directors of the Company, left on May 14, 2002 and June 30, 2003, respectively.
They retained certain entitlements to the conditional shares awarded to them under the LTIP.
Under the 2001 Award, which vested on May 15, 2004 as detailed above, 33,103 ordinary shares and 22,344 ordinary shares vested to A J H Dougal and S N Vivian, respectively.
4 The relevant market prices at the time of the conditional awards in 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 were 473.3p, 461.75p, 290.4p and 439.6p, respectively.
5 During the period January 1, 2005 to February 24, 2005 there was no change in the interests of Executive Directors in the LTIP.
Remuneration report 39 Remuneration report continued Conditional awards under the LTIP will usually be made annually.
In 2005 it is proposed that the conditional award to A J Murray will not exceed 150% of basic salary and for the other Executive Directors will not exceed 100% of basic salary.
Awards vesting under the LTIP are not pensionable.
Share Option Plan Executive Directors and a selected number of senior executives from the Companys worldwide operations participate in the Share Option Plan.
Under this Plan, participants are granted options over a number of shares but the proportion of those shares under option which may be exercised is subject to the achievement of performance targets over a three-year performance period set by the Committee.
To the extent an option or part of an option becomes capable of being exercised at the end of the three-year performance period it will ordinarily remain exercisable at any time up to 10 years from the date of grant.
The economic value added and TSR performance targets for the conditional options granted to Executive Directors in the years ending December 31, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 were the same as for the awards made in 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 under the LTIP, as detailed above, with no retesting.
Consequently for the grant made in 2002, it is anticipated that 25% of the number of shares under option will become exercisable following the end of the three year performance period.
2 A J H Dougal and S N Vivian, former Executive Directors of the Company, left Hanson on May 14, 2002 and June 30, 2003, respectively.
The option grants made to them and outstanding at the date of leaving remained subject to the performance criteria as outlined above.
Following the end of the three year performance period 39.17% of the shares under the conditional options granted on May 15, 2001 became capable of being exercised.
In respect of the grant on May 15, 2001, A J H Dougal and S N Vivian hold exercisable options over 33,103 and 22,344 shares, respectively, at an exercise price of 473.3p per share.
These options must be exercised by close of business on May 14, 2005 or they will lapse.
3 During the period January 1, 2005 to February 24, 2005 there were no changes in the interests of Executive Directors in options under the Share Option Plan.
Under the Black-Scholes option valuation model, on the basis of the Companys three-year share price performance, the value of an option over a share at the date of grant was equal to approximately 35% of the shares current market value.
On this basis, with no discount to the Black-Scholes value because of the application of performance conditions on exercise, the conditional options granted during 2002, 2003 and 2004 at 100% of basic salary had a value, at the date of grant, of about 35% of basic salary in each case.
The market price at December 31, 2004 was 447.25p per share, which compares to the exercise prices of the conditional options granted in 2002, 2003 and 2004 at prices of 461.75p, 290.4p and 439.6p per share, respectively.
Grants of conditional options under the Share Option Plan are considered annually in conjunction with the awards to be made under the LTIP.
In 2005 it is proposed that the conditional option grant to A J Murray will not exceed 125% of basic salary and to the other Executive Directors will not exceed 100% of basic salary.
Any gains made under the Share Option Plan are not pensionable.
Executive Share Option Schemes Options to subscribe for Hanson ordinary shares granted to Directors under the Executive Share Option Schemes are shown below.
No performance conditions apply to the right to exercise the options granted.
No grants have been made under these schemes since 1998 and no further grants will be made under these schemes.
2 During the period January 1, 2005 to February 24, 2005 there were no changes in the interests of Directors in options under the Executive Share Option Schemes.
Any gains made under the Executive Share Option Schemes are not pensionable.
Sharesave Scheme Many Hanson employees in the UK have built up an equity interest in the Company through the UK Inland Revenue approved savings related Sharesave Scheme.
Options may be granted at a discount of up to 20% to the market price at the date of grant.
The term of options granted could be from three to seven years and any option is conditional on a commitment by the participant to make regular savings from pay.
The savings are held by an independent Sharesave provider to buy shares at the end of the option period.
The exercise of options under the Sharesave Scheme can be satisfied by the issue of new shares or the transfer of existing shares.
At December 31, 2004, there were approximately 3,000 participants in the Sharesave Scheme.
The number of shares under options granted to Executive Directors under the Sharesave Scheme are shown in the table below: Gain on Balance at Granted Exercised Balance at Exercise Range of exercise during Jan 1, 2004 during year during year Dec 31, 2004 price p exercise dates the year A J Murray 2,971 2,971 318 12 05-05 06 G Dranseld 3,099 3,099 318 12 05-05 06 1,993 1,993 328 12 07-05 08 J C Nicholls note 1 2,263 2,263 428 12 04-05 05 1,188 318 12 05-05 06 Notes 1 J C Nicholls interest in shares under the Sharesave Scheme increased by 1,188 shares following his marriage on May 22, 2004.
2 Options granted under the Sharesave Scheme during the year were at an exercise price of 328p per share, being a 20% discount to the market price on March 18, 2004.
3 During the period January 1, 2005 to February 24, 2005 there were no changes in the interests of Executive Directors in options under the Sharesave Scheme.
Any gains made under the Sharesave Scheme are not pensionable.
The range of the market quotations for Hanson shares, as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Ofcial List, during the period January 1 to December 31, 2004 was 360p to 451.5p.
Gains on exercise The total gains made by Directors on options exercised or exercised for cash under the Share Option Plan, the Executive Share Option Schemes, and the Sharesave Scheme was 94,063 3,680.
Performance review The following graph shows the TSR performance of the Company and that of the FTSE Construction & Building Materials Index over the five-year period to December 31, 2004.
This index has been selected as it is a broad equity index of which Hanson is a constituent company.
Total shareholder return 2000-2004 Hanson FTSE CBM Index 200 150 100 50 Jan 01 Jan 02 Jan 03 Jan 04 Jan 05 Service contracts The Chairman has been employed on a service contract which will terminate on his retirement following the AGM on April 20, 2005.
The Executive Directors are all employed on rolling service contracts which are terminable at any time by Hanson on giving 52 weeks notice or by the Director giving twenty-six weeks notice.
Termination payments are limited to the Directors normal compensation, including basic salary, annual incentives and benets, for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
Pensionable service will also accrue for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
In the event that Hanson terminates a service contract without notice the unexpired portion of the notice period will count towards the calculation of entitlements under the Companys LTIP and Share Option Plan: these awards would still remain subject to their respective performance conditions.
Apart from the Chairman, no Non-executive Director has a service contract with Hanson.
Each is appointed at the will of the Company and the Non-executive Director concerned under the terms of an appointment letter.
The terms and conditions of employment of the Non-executive Directors are available on request from the Company Secretary.
Remuneration report 41 Remuneration report continued External appointments The Company acknowledges that its Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-executive Directors of other leading companies and that such non-executive duties can broaden experience and knowledge to the benefit of Hanson.
Executive Directors are limited to one such non-executive position and the policy is that fees may be retained.
J C Nicholls was appointed a Non-executive Director of Man Group plc on March 24, 2004, in respect of which he received fees of 56,250 in 2004.
No other such positions are held by any of the other Executive Directors.
Pensions The Chairman and the Executive Directors are members of a dened benefit plan the pension plan which, in accordance with Inland Revenue limits, provides them with a maximum pension of two-thirds of basic salary on retirement.
The pension plan is contributory until such time as the Director has completed the maximum pensionable service allowed under the pension plan.
Along with other members of the pension plan, for service accruing after July 1, 2004, the Executive Directors had a choice to retain the same accrual rate in the pension plan by paying an increased contribution of 7.5%, previously 5%, of pensionable salary which does not include bonuses.
The Executive Directors have a normal retirement age of 60, with the right to receive early retirement pensions to be paid from age 55 in certain circumstances.
The following table gives details for each Executive Director of: the increase in the accrued pension attributable to service since December 31, 2003. the increase in the accrued pension net of ination attributable to service since December 31, 2003. the annual accrued pension payable from normal retirement age, calculated as if he had left service at December 31, 2004. the transfer value of the increase of the accrued pension net of ination and the Directors contributions calculated in accordance with actuarial guidance note GN11.

2 Executive Directors and employees who joined the pension plan after May 1989 are subject to the earnings cap currently 102,000 on Inland Revenue approved pension plans.
It is Hansons current policy to provide executives with appropriate benets outside the pension plan in relation to that part of their salary which exceeds the cap.
The contributions made during the year were subject to income tax as a benefit in kind and the Executive Director concerned J C Nicholls was liable to settle the tax liability himself.
3 G Dranseld has completed the maximum pensionable service allowed under the pension plan and did not accrue any further pension over the year.
4 In anticipation of the implementation of the UK Governments proposed simplication of the taxation of pensions, the Committee has reviewed the impact of the proposals on all employees, including the Executive Directors.
The approach to be adopted, following recommendations from the independent advisor to the Committee, is for solutions which are essentially cost neutral to the Company with no compensation for changes in tax legislation.
All affected individuals will be given the opportunity to receive independent financial advice at the Companys cost.
