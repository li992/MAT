Policy on remuneration of executive directors and senior executives a Total level of remuneration The committee aims to ensure that remuneration packages offered are competitive and designed to attract, retain and motivate executive directors and senior executives.
b The main components The companys policy is to structure remuneration packages so that an appropriate element comprises the grant of share options which enables the company to align the interests of employees with those of shareholders.
The main components of remuneration payable are: i Salary Salary for each executive is determined by the remuneration committee taking into account the performance and responsibilities of the individual.
Electronic and electrical engineering is an international industry within which there is a clear market in executive talent.
The overriding factor in determining executive remuneration is market forces.
Salaries are normally reviewed on 1 July each year.
No bonuses are paid to any of the companys executive directors.
ii Share options The directors believe that the opportunity to participate in the companys shareholding is a key factor in attracting and retaining executives of the right calibre and that share ownership by executive directors and senior executives strengthens the link between their personal interests and those of the shareholders.
The companys policy is to grant options at the point of recruitment or promotion.
All grants of options are determined by the committee.
The committee takes account of guidelines issued by the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds when making awards of options.
Pursuant to resolutions of the shareholders passed at the extraordinary general meeting held on 17 February 1999, the committee is authorised in exceptional cases to grant options to a value of up to eight times an executives salary.
The remuneration committee has determined that the vesting of options granted under the Approved, Unapproved and 1997 Schemes will be conditional upon adjusted operating profit targets for the five financial years following the grant of options being achieved.
These targets will be determined by the remuneration committee annually, principally by reference to the budget set for the relevant year, and will be set at a level which the remuneration committee determines will be challenging to those concerned.
Adjusted operating profit for this purpose is dened as operating profit before goodwill amortisation and share compensation.
The adjusted operating profit target for the financial year ended 31 May 2004 was not achieved and accordingly no options vested.
