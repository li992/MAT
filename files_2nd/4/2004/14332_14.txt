2004 SkyePharma Annual Report 27 Remuneration Report Introduction This report sets out the remuneration policy operated by the Company in respect of the Executive Directors, together with disclosures on Directors remuneration required by The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations.
The auditors are required to report on the auditable part of this Report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the Report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
The Report is therefore divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
The Board have reviewed the Groups compliance with the Combined Code the Code on remuneration related matters.
"Following the amendments to the operation of the SkyePharma PLC Deferred Share Bonus Plan the ""DSB"" approved by shareholders at the 2004 AGM, it is the opinion of the Board that the group complied with all remuneration related aspects of the Code during the year."
Part 2 of the Regulations Unaudited Information Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing policy on remuneration for Executive Directors and Key Executives below Board level and for determining specific remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Sir Michael Beavis and its other members are Dr D R Ebsworth, Mr R S Harris and Dr K R Mansford.
The Remuneration Committee members have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interests arising from cross directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
When the Remuneration Committee is considering matters concerning key executives below Board level advice is sought from Mr M Ashton Chief Executive and Mr D Nicholson Finance Director.
Where Executive Directors have attended a Remuneration Committee meeting there was no discussion relating to their own remuneration and benefits.
The Remuneration Committee received wholly independent advice on executive compensation and incentives from Halliwell Consulting during the year.
No other services were provided to the Company by Halliwell Consulting during the year.
The Remuneration Committee is formally constituted with written Terms of Reference.
The terms of reference are available on the Companys website www.
com and are also available on request from the Company Secretary.
The Committee met three times during 2004 with each member attending all the meetings.
Remuneration Policy Overview The Remuneration Committees policy is to set the main elements of the remuneration package at the following quartiles in comparison to the Companys Comparator Group: Base salary Annual bonus potential Share incentives Total compensation Between median and upper quartile Upper quartile Lower quartile Lower quartile-median The international nature of some of the companies in the Comparator Group means that the Company cannot provide comparative levels of share incentives under current UK corporate governance best practice.
As such, the policy of setting the share incentives at the lower quartile is slightly misleading as the grant level would be considered median in a wholly UK context.
In order to remain attractive to the type of executive talent required to grow the Company, the Remuneration Committee has determined to set the base salaries between the median and upper quartile.
However, in calculating the level of potential annual rises in base salary the Remuneration Committee looks at the median on median rise in the Comparator Group to ensure that over a period of time the level of base salary does not rise towards the upper quartile.
The objective of the remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages that will: motivate and encourage superior performance: allow the Company to retain the talent needed to execute its business strategy: enable the Company to be competitive when recruiting appropriate skilled and experienced newcomers: and align rewards with the interests of shareholders.
28 SkyePharma Annual Report 2004 Remuneration Report continued It is the aim of the Remuneration Committee to encourage and reward superior performance by Executives with that performance being based on the measurable delivery of good financial performance and the delivery of strong returns to shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the current policy continues to retain and motivate the Executives appropriately while enforcing a strong pay for performance culture within the Company.
It should be noted that the real value received by the Executives under the share incentive arrangements will be dependent upon the degree to which the associated performance conditions have been satisfied at the end of the three year performance period and the share price of the Company at this time.
The Remuneration Committee will continue to review the policy on an annual basis to ensure that it is in line with the Companys objectives and shareholders interests.
The Executive Directors do not hold any executive outside appointments nor do they retain any earnings in respect of any non-executive appointments on behalf of the Company.
Benchmarking The Companys Comparator Group for 2004 for the purposes of benchmarking total remuneration consists of the following 20 international companies which the Company considers to be appropriate given the Companys current stages of development and other market factors: Acambis Plc AstraZeneca Plc Cephalon Inc Galen Holdings Plc Alizyme Plc Aradigm Corporation Inc CIMA Laboratories Inc Nektar Therapeutics Inc Alkermes Inc Atrix Laborotories Inc Elan Corporation Plc Noven Pharmaceuticals Inc Amersham Plc CAT Group Plc Emisphere Technologies Inc Sepracor Inc Andrx Corporation Inc Celltech Group Plc Enzon Pharmaceuticals Inc Shire Pharmaceuticals Group Plc Total remuneration incorporates base salary, annual bonus, benefits and long-term incentives.
On an ongoing basis the Remuneration Committee, with input from the Executive Directors, will continue to review the Comparator Group to ensure that it continues to be appropriate.
Due to corporate activity amongst the Comparator Group during the year there will be some minor changes to the members of the Group used for 2005.
These changes will not materially affect the nature of the Group as a whole Fixed v Performance Pay The charts below demonstrate the balance between fixed and variable performance based pay for each Executive Director for the year ended 31 December 2004: Michael Ashton Chief Executive Officer Donald Nicholson Finance Director Fixed Compensation [32%] Fixed Compensation [32%] Performance Compensation [68%] Performance Compensation [68%] Fixed Compensation: Fixed Compensation: Salary and Benefits Salary and Benefits Performance Compensation: Performance Compensation: Maximum Bonus Payable and Face value of LTIP on grant Maximum Bonus Payable and Face value of LTIP on grant The main elements of these packages and the performance conditions are described below.
2004 SkyePharma Annual Report 29 Basic Salary Policy: Between Median and Upper Quartile Base salaries are set by reference to being between the Median and Upper Quartile compared to the Companys international Comparator Group.
A number of constituents of this Comparator Group provide share awards and options of many multiples greater than would be accepted by UK institutional shareholders.
Therefore, while the Remuneration Committee firmly sets the balance of the Executives packages in favour of performance, salaries are set at above median to ensure a competitive overall position particularly as the incentives are based on a multiple of this salary.
When determining the salary of the Executive Directors the Remuneration Committee also takes into consideration: levels of annual increases in pay for companies within the Comparator Group: the performance of the individual Executive Director: the individual Executive Directors experience and responsibilities: and pay and conditions throughout the Company.
The following table shows the salary quartiles for members of the Comparator Group and the Company for the year ended 31 December 2004: Michael Ashton Donald Nicholson Quartile in Comparator Group Chief Executive Officer Finance Director Upper Quartile 475,410 326,211 Median 329,489 192,322 Lower Quartile 293,069 170,554 Actual Salary 419,760 235,400 The rise in salaries in the Comparator Group for the year ended 31 December 2004 were: Michael Ashton Donald Nicholson Quartile in Comparator Group Chief Executive Officer Finance Director Upper Quartile 11% 17% Median 7% 9% Lower Quartile 5% 7% Actual Rise for 2005 4.8% 6.2% The salaries of the Chief Executive Officer and Finance Director will be 440,000 and 250,000 respectively effective from 1 January 2005.
This equates to an increase of 4.8% for the Chief Executive Officer and 6.2% for the Finance Director.
These increases are below the lower quartile year on year rises for the appropriate positions within the Comparator Group.
The Remuneration Committee has determined to provide lower quartile rises over the last two financial years in line with its focus on performance based pay.
Annual Performance Related Bonus Policy: Upper Quartile Bonus Potential The Committees policy is to set the maximum annual bonus potential at the upper quartile in relation to the Comparator Group.
The maximum bonus potential available for the Executive Directors is 100% of salary.
This bonus is provided for the Executive Directors and other Key Executives below Board level through the SkyePharma PLC Deferred Share Bonus Plan which was approved by shareholders at the 2001 AGM.
Shareholders approved an amendment to the operation of the Plan at the 2004 AGM.
The amendment provided that future awards of matching shares would be subject to a total shareholder return performance condition.
The DSB is designed to align the interests of participants with those of shareholders by encouraging Executives to build up and maintain shareholdings which are meaningful in the context of their remuneration.
"The DSB currently requires a minimum deferral of 50% of each annual net bonus in the form of Company shares ""Executive Shares""."
The Company currently provides one Matching Share for each Executive Share acquired calculated on the gross bonus deferred.
The Matching Shares will be released after three years provided the Executive has retained his Executive Shares, remains employed and satisfies the attached performance conditions.
For the bonus paid for the financial year ending 31 December 2004, the performance condition is that the total shareholder return TSR of the Company is at or above the median of the Comparator Group.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee will be required to ensure that the underlying financial performance of the Company is consistent with its TSR performance against financial measures such as profitability and cash flow.
For example, no Matching Shares will be provided at the end of the three year holding period unless the Company is in profit.
Total Shareholder Return TSR is a measure showing the return on investing in one share of the Company over the three year performance period capital growth and reinvested dividends.
It is normally used comparatively with the company achieving the best return ranked number 1.
30 SkyePharma Annual Report 2004 Remuneration Report continued The Executives have voluntarily, as they did in respect of bonuses earned for the year ending 31 December 2003, decided to receive all 2004 bonus payments in Executive Shares to demonstrate their ongoing commitment to, and confidence in, the Company.
The targets for the year ending 31 December 2004, their level of achievement and the corresponding bonus earned for the Executive Directors are set out in the following tables: Michael Ashton Donald Nicholson Element Chief Executive Officer Finance Director Maximum Total Annual Bonus Potential 100% 100% Cash Element 50% 50% Executive Shares 50% 50% Maximum Performance Matching Share Award Matching Shares 50% 50% In accordance with the terms of the bonus schedules for 2004, the Chief Executive Officer and Finance Director are entitled to a bonus of 15% and 25% of salary respectively.

The following table shows the level of performance achieved against the budgeted targets set at the beginning of the year ending 31 December 2004 and the bonus earned for achieving that level of performance: Michael Ashton Donald Nicholson Budget target Chief Executive Officer Finance Director Performance Measure maximum % bonus earned %age of salary bonus earned %age of salary Budgeted Profit and Financial Targets for 2004 80% 10% 20% Operational Targets 10% 5% 5% Companys share price being greater than the average appreciation for the companies constituting the Comparator Group 10% 0% 0% Total as %age of Salary 100% 15% 25% Bonus targets are reviewed and agreed by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of each financial year.
The performance measures for the bonus are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and position of the Company, so that they continue to remain challenging.
The structure of the bonus targets for the year ending 31 December 2005 will be similar to those operated for 2004.
The maximum bonus potential available for the Executive Directors for the year ending 31 December 2005 remains the same.
2004 SkyePharma Annual Report 31 Share Incentives Policy: Lower Quartile Overview During the year the Remuneration Committee reviewed its share incentive policy and concluded that the interests of shareholders and Executives would be better aligned through awarding whole shares under the long term incentive element of the DSB which was approved by shareholders at the 2001 AGM rather than using options.
This change in policy was approved by shareholders at the 2004 AGM.
No further options will be granted to Executives under the new policy.
Old Policy Prior to the change of policy the Remuneration Committee granted options to the Executives under the SkyePharma PLC 1999 Share Option Scheme.
The maximum annual grant under this Scheme was 200% of salary.
With the change of policy no further options will be granted to the Executives under this Scheme.
The performance condition on option grants to Executives is that vesting is dependent upon total shareholder return against the Comparator Group.
No options will vest for below median performance.
50% of options will vest for median comparative performance with 100% of options vesting for upper quartile comparative performance straight line vesting between the two points.
There is no retesting of performance conditions.
Details of all subsisting options are set out in Note 23: Called up share capital.
New Policy The Remuneration Committee aims to provide annual awards to Executive Directors at the lower quartile level compared to the international Comparator Group.
The Remuneration Committee believes that this level is competitive having due consideration to the level of grants in the UK Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Sector but is relatively low in comparison to the US components of the Comparator Group.
All Executives are entitled to be considered for the grant of awards under the LTIP.
Under the rules, the maximum annual award that can be made to an individual is 100% of salary.
"Eligible Executives are awarded a conditional right over a whole number of shares ""LTIP Award"" with the release being dependent on the extent to which if at all the challenging performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the time the LTIP Award is made are satisfied."
Grants during the Year ending 31 December 2004 Michael Ashton Donald Nicholson Chief Executive Officer Finance Director LTIP Award Face Value %age of Salary 100% 100% Expected Value of LTIP Award 209,880 117,700 Expected Value of LTIP Award as a %age of Salary 50% 50% The expected value was calculated by taking the face value of the shares on the date of award and discounting this value by the probability of the performance condition being satisfied at this date in accordance with the principles of IFRS 2.
The performance conditions for the grant of awards under the LTIP are set out in the following table: TSR Position Against the Comparator Group Long-Term Incentive Plan % of LTIP released Below Median 0% Median 30% Upper Quartile 100% There is straight line vesting between points In addition the Remuneration Committee will be required to ensure that the underlying financial performance of the Company is consistent with its TSR performance, by considering the Companys performance against financial measures such as turnover, profitability and cash flow.
For example, the LTIP Awards made in 2004 will not be released at the end of the three year holding period unless the Company is in profit.
The Remuneration Committee believes that comparative total shareholder return is the most appropriate measure to align shareholders and Executives interests.
Comparative TSR was selected as the performance condition for LTIP Awards by the Remuneration Committee as it ensures that, before being entitled to receive any of their LTIP Awards, the Executives outperform their international peers over the measurement period in delivering shareholder value irrespective of general market conditions.
32 SkyePharma Annual Report 2004 Remuneration Report continued Performance Measurement Halliwell Consulting, the Remuneration Committees advisors will calculate the TSR in accordance with the rules of the LTIP and sign-off these figures prior to the release of any award.
Performance conditions under the LTIP are not subject to re-testing.
Dilution The following table sets out the current level of dilution against the ABI limits for all share plans as at 31 December 2004: Current dilution Additional dilution over rolling in the Year Ended Maximum ten year period 31 December 2004 10% dilution in ten years for all share schemes 8.3% 0.6% 5% dilution in ten years for all executive share schemes 4.1% 0.5% Pension The Company makes contributions into individual personal pension schemes for the Executives at a defined percentage of salary, excluding bonus and other forms of remuneration.
The Executive Directors do not participate in any Company sponsored pension plans and are expected to make their own pension arrangements: Michael Ashton Donald Nicholson Chief Executive Officer Finance Director Actual Contribution 62,964 35,310 %age of Salary 15% 15% It has been determined by the Remuneration Committee to increase the level of Company pension contribution to 17.5% from 1 January 2005 to ensure that the Companys pension contribution moves towards a competitive level over a period of time median contribution in the Comparator Group is 20% of salary.
Benefits in Kind Benefits comprise a company car or allowance, private medical insurance and a living allowance for the Chief Executive Officer Michael Ashton.
Total Value of Remuneration Package for Executive Directors Policy: Lower Quartile to Median The following table shows the value of each of the main elements of the remuneration package provided to the Executive Directors during the year ended 31 December 2004.
It should be noted that the largest elements of the package the expected value of LTIP grants and Matching Share awards are based on a series of assumptions and may not equate to the actual value received by the Executive Directors on release.
In addition, all share incentives will only be provided to an Executive Director if the attached performance conditions have been satisfied see above and are also dependent on the share price in three years time.

"Accordingly, the Company introduced the SkyePharma PLC International Share Purchase Plan the ""Plan"" which was launched in February 2002."
All employees including the Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Plan under the arrangements introduced in their respective countries.
The Plan complements the LTIP and Matching Share awards as it is more focused on employee retention.
Under the Plan, employees are given the opportunity of purchasing Company shares up to a maximum of 1,500 per year or local currency equivalent.
The Company will then match each share purchased with an award of Matching Shares.
The maximum ratio of Matching Shares to employee purchased shares is two to one although the current ratio adopted by the Company is one matching share for each share purchased.
The Matching Shares are subject to a three year holding period.
Normally, the Matching Shares will only be released at the end of this holding period if the corresponding employee purchased shares have not been sold and the employee is still in employment at that time.
The release of Matching Shares is not subject to additional performance criteria in line with UK Inland Revenue rules and normal UK practice.
As at 31 December 2004, 34% 140 of eligible employees have elected to participate in the Plan and have purchased 347,288 shares.
The Company has also provisionally awarded 347,288 Matching Shares.
