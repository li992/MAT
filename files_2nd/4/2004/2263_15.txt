REPORT ON REMUNERATION The remuneration committee The remuneration committee comprises all the independent non-executive directors namely Julie Baddeley chairman, Andrew Bonfield, Guy Dawson appointed 1 March 2004, Matthew Miau, Iain Napier appointed 1 May 2004, Sir Christopher ODonnell and Anne Quinn appointed 1 May 2004.
Whilst neither the Group chairman nor the chief executive are members of the remuneration committee they both attend the meetings by invitation but are not present when their personal remuneration is discussed and reviewed.
The human resources director acts as secretary to the committee and provides it with information and data from national and international surveys.
He is assisted by the Group compensation and benefits director.
In addition the remuneration committee has appointed Towers Perrin to advise on the remuneration arrangements for senior executives.
Towers Perrin also provided advice on the design of the proposed share matching plan.
The remuneration committee sets the overall remuneration policy of the Group and makes recommendations to the board on the framework of executive remuneration.
Individual member attendance at the meetings is shown on page 57.
The terms of reference are reviewed annually to ensure that they conform with best practice.
Specifically, the remuneration committee determines, on behalf of the board, the detailed terms of service of the executive directors and other members of the executive management team including basic salary, performance related bonus arrangements, benefits in kind, long-term incentives and pension benefits.
The remuneration committee also reviews the remuneration of the chairman, following a recommendation from the chief executive and the senior independent director.
The board as a whole determines the non-executive directors fees.
Remuneration policy BOCs remuneration policy for executive directors and other executive management is designed to attract and Current expected value chart 1 retain executives of the highest calibre so that the Group is managed successfully to the benefit of its stakeholders.
1 In setting remuneration levels the remuneration committee takes into account the remuneration practices found in other UK listed companies of similar size, internationality and complexity.
The policy is to pay salaries and total remuneration around mid-market levels for on target performance and to provide the opportunity, via annual and long-term incentives, for executives to be rewarded at the 75th percentile if this is justified by the achievement of 3 top of the range performance goals.
It is the view of the remuneration committee that performance-related 2 remuneration should form a substantial element of total remuneration.
Based on assumptions about expected values for awards from the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP and Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS, the 1 Fixed 38% proportion of performance-related remuneration to fixed remuneration excluding pensions and benefits in kind 2 Annual variable 27% for current arrangements is approximately 60 per cent see chart 1.
3 Long-term incentives 35% Remuneration components Basic salary Salaries for executive directors and executive management board members are based on median market rates drawn from market data provided by Towers Perrin and take account of an executives experience, responsibilities and performance.
Performance is assessed both from an individual and business perspective.
Executive salaries are reviewed annually by the remuneration committee.
Remuneration for those executives of businesses outside the UK is denominated in the local currency.
Benefits in kind Benefits in kind comprise company car benefits and membership of BOCs healthcare insurance scheme.
Where appropriate directors on international assignment receive overseas allowances such as housing and childrens education fees.
These allowances are on similar terms to those applying to other employees on the international programme.
Such benefits are in line with those offered by peer group companies.
Benefits in kind do not form part of pensionable earnings.
Variable compensation plan VCP The executive directors and senior management participate in the variable compensation bonus plan.
The plan focuses on annual objectives and links individual performance with business plans.
The financial targets for the executive directors and other executive management board members are set on an annual basis by the remuneration committee and performance against these targets is reviewed by the remuneration committee on a six monthly basis.
The remuneration committee considers that a six monthly review acts as a significant incentive and is conducive to sustaining performance throughout the year.
The financial targets are based equally on adjusted earnings per share EPS and adjusted return on capital employed ROCE at Group level.
Adjusted means excluding exceptional items.
Bonuses are assessed two-thirds on these financial targets with the remaining third based on personal objectives.
These are based on BOCs strategic priorities and include safety, growth, people and change management and productivity.
Performance is measured against key performance indicators determined during formal appraisals.
There is a threshold performance level below which no bonus is paid.
For 2004 the financial targets set by the remuneration committee were EPS 56.2p and ROCE 13.3 per cent and the achievement against these targets was EPS 63.2p and ROCE 15.4 per cent.
The remuneration committee agreed that the maximum bonus payable would be 100 per cent of salary.
The bonuses for the executive directors and other members of the executive management board are paid half yearly following the remuneration committee review.
Details of the payments to directors are included in the directors remuneration for the year on page 70.
64 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Report on remuneration Current long-term incentive arrangements Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP Executive directors, members of the executive management board and a number of other key executives selected from the companys global operations participate in the LTIP.
The remuneration committee has the discretion to grant awards up to a maximum of two times salary.
The award made in February 2004 to the chief executive was based on 1.9 times salary and for other board directors 1.5 times salary.
There are three performance conditions: total shareholder return TSR, adjusted earnings per share EPS and adjusted return on capital employed ROCE.
Up to one third of the award could vest in respect of each performance condition.
The TSR performance condition compares BOCs TSR performance with two separate comparator groups, a UK comparator group comprising 31 industrial and manufacturing companies and a global industrial gases group of six leading companies as follows: UK group Aggregate Industries BPB Invensys Scottish & Southern Energy AMEC Centrica Johnson Matthey Scottish Power Anglo American Corus Group Kelda Group Severn Trent AWG FKI National Grid Transco Shell Transport & Trading BAE Systems Hanson Pilkington Smiths Group BG Group IMI Rio Tinto Tomkins BHP Billiton ICI RMC Group United Utilities BP International Power Rolls-Royce Global gases group Airgas US S&P 500 Index Air Liquide France CAC 40 Index Air Products & Chemicals US S&P 500 Index Linde Germany DAX 30 Index Nippon Sanso Japan NIKKEI 225 Index Praxair US S&P 500 Index The BOC Group UK FTSE100 Index When determining BOCs performance relative to the global gases group, the TSR for BOC and the comparator companies will be adjusted adjusted TSR so that it reflects the excess or shortfall in returns relative to the local stockmarket index where each company has its primary listing.
The nationality and the local stockmarket index that will be used to calculate the adjusted TSR for each company is shown in the parentheses.
For the awards made in February 2004 which will vest in February 2007 the target set by the remuneration committee is such that if the companys TSR position measured over a three year period is median in respect of both comparator groups, then 40 per cent of the shares in respect of the TSR part of the award will vest.
If the companys TSR position is upper quartile all of the shares in respect of the TSR part of the award will vest.
If the TSR performance is between the median and upper quartile a proportion of between 40 per cent and all of the shares in respect of the TSR part of the award will vest.
If the companys TSR position is below the median for both comparator groups the TSR part of the award will lapse.
The same TSR performance criteria was used for the awards made in February 2003.
The adjusted EPS performance condition is based on the companys EPS relative to three year targets on a sliding performance scale.
For the award made in February 2004 which will vest in February 2007 the target set by the remuneration committee is 60.3p at the end of the three year performance period for minimum vesting.
If this is achieved 40 per cent of the shares in respect of the EPS part of the award will vest.
All of the shares in respect of the EPS part of the award will vest if the company achieves 69.3p at the end of the three year performance period.
If the EPS performance is between 60.3p and 69.3p a proportion of between 40 per cent and all of the shares in respect of the EPS part of the award will vest.
If EPS is less than 60.3p over the three year period the EPS part of the award will lapse.
The EPS targets for the award made in February 2003 were 64.75p for minimum vesting and 74.45p for full vesting.
The adjusted ROCE performance condition is based on the companys ROCE relative to three year targets on a sliding performance scale.
The minimum target set by the remuneration committee for the award made in February 2004 which will vest in February 2007 is 13.5 per cent at the end of the three year performance period.
If this is achieved 40 per cent of the shares in respect of the ROCE part of the award will vest.
All of the shares in respect of the ROCE part of the award will vest if the company achieves a ROCE of 15 per cent.
If the ROCE performance is between 13.5 per cent and 15 per cent a proportion of between 40 per cent and all of the shares in respect of the ROCE part of the award will vest.
If the ROCE is less than 13.5 per cent the ROCE part of the award will lapse.
The ROCE targets for the award made in February 2003 were 13.0 per cent for minimum vesting and 14.5 per cent for full vesting.
In setting three performance conditions for the LTIP award, the remuneration committee took the view that these were the most important measures that drive or measure sustainable improvements in shareholder value: the TSR performance condition measures comparative performance while EPS and ROCE reflect a core part of the companys business strategy, which is to improve both earnings growth and capital efficiency.
65 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Report on remuneration Executive Share Option Scheme 2003 ESOS 2003 Executive directors, members of the executive management board and other selected middle and senior management throughout the companys global operations currently participate in the ESOS 2003.
The awards made in November 2003 to the chief executive and other members of the board were based on one times salary.
The performance condition set for the ESOS 2003 by the remuneration committee is that the growth in the adjusted EPS over a three year performance period must be equal to or greater than the growth in the UK retail prices index RPI plus three per cent per annum over the three year performance period.
The performance is assessed on the companys published results.
If the performance condition is satisfied at the end of the performance period then the awards would be exercisable in full.
In line with current corporate governance best practice there is no rolling re-testing of performance.
In the event that the performance condition is not satisfied over the original three year period then the remuneration committee has the discretion to re-test performance after five years, but only where the remuneration committee believes the Current measures and their weights for variable incentives using on extension to be a fair and reasonable basis for assessing the sustained underlying performance of the company.
target VCP awards and the expected The remuneration committee considers this performance condition to be a challenging performance hurdle when values of long-term incentives chart 2 compared to the companys adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate before exceptional items over the last ten years of around four per cent.
1 Awards under the LTIP and ESOS 2003 may be satisfied in cash or other assets, for example, where it is 2 necessary for legal or tax reasons.
The amount to be paid will, in the case of share options, be equal to the participants gain on the exercise of the share option.
Also, the remuneration committee may decide, prior to grant, that an award shall be expressed to be a right to acquire a cash sum rather than shares.
This type of award, 3 4 known as a phantom award, will normally only be granted to participants in jurisdictions where, because of local security laws or exchange control provisions, it is difficult to issue or transfer shares to employees.
The LTIP and ESOS 2003 awards may be satisfied by using existing shares purchased in the market through The BOC Group plc 1 Personal 15% 2 TSR 16% Employee Share Trust or by issuing new shares.
3 EPS 30% Awards under the LTIP and ESOS 2003 are not pensionable.
4 ROCE 39% The current performance measures as a percentage of salary for on target performance are shown in chart 2.
Savings Related Share Option Schemes These are operated in the UK, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland and are open to all employees including executive directors with one years service or more.
The UK scheme is approved by the Inland Revenue.
The current schemes are due to expire in 2005 and a proposal to adopt new schemes is to be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in January 2005.
TSR performance Percentage The graph to the left has been included to meet the requirement set out in the Directors Remuneration Report 20 Regulations 2002.
It shows BOCs TSR performance, assuming dividends are reinvested, compared with all 10 FTSE100 companies.
This has been chosen because it provides a basis for comparison against companies in a 0 relevant, broad based equity index of which BOC is a constituent member.
The remuneration committee -10 decided that other comparator groups were more appropriate as performance measurement for the LTIP.
-20 A graph showing BOCs TSR performance compared with the six major gases companies relative to respective -30 local indices, which is one of the comparator groups chosen for the LTIP, is shown in the chairmans statement -40 on page 4.
The October 1999 position reflects the premium arising from the pre-conditional cash offer of -50 14.60 per share made jointly by Air Liquide and Air Products.

No further awards will be made under this scheme.
The options vest when the companys adjusted EPS growth is equal to, or exceeds, the growth in the retail prices index RPI by three per cent per annum over any three year performance period.
Senior Executive Share Option Scheme The last grant under this scheme took place in November 1994.
In line with market practice at the time when this scheme was introduced the vesting of these awards was not subject to performance conditions.
66 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Report on remuneration Retirement benefits Pension arrangements for executive directors are in line with those of comparable executives in the countries in which the directors are located.
In the UK, the BOC senior executive pension scheme is a funded, tax-approved, defined benefit pension arrangement.
Where necessary, the directors pensionable pay is limited by the earnings cap provisions of the Finance Act 1989.
In such cases, the company pays the director a salary supplement on earnings above the earnings cap to reflect the loss of pension coverage.
This supplement is recorded in the directors emoluments and is not taken into account in calculating bonuses or any other form of remuneration.
BOC closed its UK defined benefit pension arrangements to all new employees on 30 June 2003.
Pension arrangements for new employees are provided under a defined contribution Retirement Savings Plan.
The company makes contributions to the plan equal to two times the employees core contributions which can be three, four or five per cent of salary.
In the US, the Cash Balance Retirement Plan is a funded, tax-qualified, defined benefit arrangement.
In the US, the BOC Top-Hat Pension Plan is an un-funded, non-tax-qualified, defined benefit arrangement which tops up the benefits provided under the Cash Balance Retirement Plan.
In Australia, the BOC Gases Superannuation Fund is a funded, defined contribution arrangement underpinned by a defined benefit guarantee for long-serving employees who were members under a prior benefit structure.
Details of directors individual remuneration, share options, LTIP awards and share holdings are given on pages 70 to 75.
Outside appointments The remuneration committees view is that non-executive directorships are a significant benefit in broadening executives experience.
Any such appointments are subject to review by the nominations committee and the approval of the board.
Remuneration proposals During the year the remuneration committee reviewed the performance-related elements of the executive remuneration package and decided that it was necessary to make a number of changes.
In considering the current package and possible changes, the remuneration committee was concerned more with the effectiveness of some of the arrangements rather than their level.
As stated the policy is to pay salaries and total remuneration around mid-market levels for on target performance and to provide the opportunity, via annual and long-term incentives, to reward executives at the 75th percentile if this is justified by the achievement of stretching performance goals.
There is no intention to change this policy.
The proposed changes are intended to make the reward package more effective.
It will increase the expected value of the total package for the achievement of stretching performance goals.
The proposed changes also enhance the retention value of our remuneration arrangements.
The remuneration committee believes that the annual bonus plan VCP and the LTIP are effective and do focus attention on the main drivers of BOCs performance, particularly ROCE and earnings growth.
There is also alignment with shareholder interests via the TSR element of the LTIP and the fact that awards under the LTIP are delivered in shares.
However, the remuneration committee has become concerned about the efficiency and effectiveness of the Executive Share Option Scheme.
Being totally dependent upon stockmarket movements, share options can generate a range of rewards from large to zero with variable motivational or retention value.
The remuneration committee is also concerned that the dilution impact of options is inefficient from a shareholder standpoint.
For the reasons outlined above the remuneration committee proposes: to cease making option awards under the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS to the executive directors and other executives covered by the VCP.
However, the ESOS will be kept in place for the time being for employees below this level until an alternative scheme can be developed in the near future.
The facility will also be kept to make option awards to executives who are covered by VCP on an exceptional basis, for example as part of a hiring package.
There is however no intention to make any further awards to existing executive directors: to increase the target and maximum value of the VCP to 110 per cent and 160 per cent respectively of salary and at the same time introduce a deferred, share-matching plan, compulsorily deferring one-third of the VCP bonus see details below.
The current target value of the VCP is 73.4 per cent and the plan is capped at 100 per cent: to seek approval to increase the maximum award levels to be made under the LTIP from 200 per cent to 250 per cent of salary.
The remuneration committees purpose in seeking approval for a higher maximum is simply to give flexibility to remain fully competitive in the event that a higher level of award is required for an appointment to an executive role.
In the immediate term, however, this change would have little practical impact as the intention next year is simply to increase the chief executives conditional share award from 1.9 times salary to 2.0 times and to make no increase to the 1.5 times salary award received by other directors last year.
67 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Report on remuneration Current expected value chart 3 Share Matching Plan The main features of the proposed Share Matching Plan are as follows: at the same time that the VCP opportunity is increased, one-third of any VCP award an amount equivalent 1 to the increase will be compulsorily applied to the acquisition of BOC shares: the executives will become entitled to these shares only if they are still in service with BOC three years after the award is made: 3 executives will then receive an additional number of shares equal to the value of dividends paid during the 2 deferral period on these shares: executives may also receive a matching share award of up to 100 per cent of the number of shares originally 1 Fixed 38% allotted.
The percentage award will depend on BOCs performance over the deferral period.
Adjusted EPS 2 Annual variable 27% will account for 75 per cent of the performance weighting with TSR accounting for the remaining 25 per cent: 3 Long-term incentives 35% the adjusted EPS performance condition is based upon the companys EPS relative to three year targets.
These targets will be on a sliding scale, where a five per cent per annum growth rate over three years is Proposed expected value chart 4 required for the minimum award of 25 per cent of that portion.
The maximum award will be achieved if EPS 1 growth is 12 per cent per annum over the three year period: the TSR performance condition compares BOCs TSR performance against the same UK comparator group as used for the LTIP.
Awards will vest for this portion where BOCs TSR position is at median, measured over three years.
At this point 25 per cent of this portion of the award will vest.
A maximum award of 25 per cent overall will vest if the company is ranked at or above the upper quartile.
2 3 As previously stated, it is the view of the remuneration committee that performance-related remuneration should form a substantial element of total remuneration.
The effect of these proposals would lead to a shift in the balance 1 Fixed 33% of variable performance-related remuneration to fixed remuneration see charts 3 and 4.
2 Annual variable 24% 3 Long-term incentives 43% The weightings for the performance measures as a percentage of salary for on target performance would also change see charts 5 and 6.
Non-executive directors Non-executive directors are initially appointed for a three year term after which, whilst not automatic, their Current measures and their weights appointment may be extended for a second term subject to mutual agreement and shareholder approval.
for variable incentives using on The fees are set at a level which will attract individuals with the necessary experience and ability to make a target VCP awards and the expected values of long-term incentives chart 5 significant contribution to The BOC Groups affairs and are benchmarked with those fees paid by other UK listed companies.
The basic fees for the non-executive directors are 40,000 per annum, 10,000 of which, less tax, 1 is invested in BOC shares.
In addition, the fees for chairing a committee are 10,000 per annum, 5,000 of which, less tax, is invested in BOC shares.
The fees were last reviewed in November 2003.
The next review will be in 2 November 2005.
The fee for Rob Margetts, company chairman, which was set at 225,000 in 2001 will be increased to 260,000.

In order to mitigate its liability on early termination, the companys policy is that it should be able to terminate such contracts on no more than 12 months notice, and that payments on termination are restricted to the value of salary, car benefit and bonus entitlement calculated on the basis of the average of actual payments over the preceding two years for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
Pension provisions on termination are detailed in the individual service contracts below.
Individual service contracts Mr Bevan has a contract dated 5 December 2002 that can be terminated by the company on 12 months notice.
In the event of early termination, the contract provides for the payment of compensation based on the value of salary, car benefit and bonus entitlement calculated on the basis of the average of actual payments over the preceding two years for the unexpired portion of the notice period.
Mr Bevan would also be entitled to his deferred pension, with the unexpired portion of the notice period being added to his pensionable service in the calculation of his pension entitlement.
Mr Isaac has a contract dated 19 November 2002, varied by letter dated 1 June 2004, which expires upon the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting in 2007 subject to possible extension by mutual agreement.
The contract can be terminated by the company on 12 months notice.
Mr Isaac would also be entitled to a contribution to his funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme amounting to the sum of 40 per cent of his pay above the pension cap imposed by the Finance Act 1989 and 58.33 per cent 50 per cent prior to 6 April 2003 of his pay up to the cap for the unexpired portion of his notice period.
Mr Mdori has a contract dated 19 November 2002 that can be terminated by the company on 12 months notice.
Mr Mdori would also be entitled a to have his deferred pension from the UK senior executive pension scheme paid without actuarial reduction from age 55: and b to an immediate payment representing the discounted value of the difference in the capital values of a pension calculated as in a and a pension calculated as in a but with the addition of the unexpired portion of his notice period in the calculation of pensionable service.
Dr Rajagopal has a contract dated 1 May 1999, amended 22 November 2002, that can be terminated by the company on 12 months notice.
Dr Rajagopal would also be entitled to have his deferred pension from the UK senior executive pension scheme a calculated with the inclusion of the unexpired portion of his notice period in the calculation of pensionable service: and b paid without actuarial reduction from age 55.
Mr Walsh has a contract dated 21 November 2002 that can be terminated by the company on 12 months notice.
Additionally, the unexpired portion of Mr Walshs notice period would be added to his pensionable service in the calculation of his pension entitlement from the US Top-Hat Pension Plan.
All the above contracts can be terminated by the individual director on six months notice.
Shareholding guidelines The remuneration committee encourages the executive management group to grow personal shareholding in the business over time.
It is anticipated that each executive would build towards a shareholding of one times salary.
The remuneration committee believes that the vehicle of the long-term incentive arrangements will facilitate the building of such a shareholding over a period of time.
