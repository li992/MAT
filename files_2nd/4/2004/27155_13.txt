Directors Remuneration Report The Board has prepared this report, in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.
An ordinary resolution for the approval of this report will be put to the members at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The law requires the Companys Auditors to audit certain of the disclosures provided.
Where disclosures have been audited, they are indicated as such.
The Auditors opinion is included in their report on page 37.
Remuneration Committee The Company has six non-executive Directors, whose details are set out on pages 3 to 5.
The whole Board fulfils the function of a Remuneration Committee.
The Board has not been provided with advice or services by any person in respect of its consideration of the Directors remuneration although the Directors expect, from time to time, to review the fees paid to the boards of directors of other investment trust companies.
Policy on Directors Remuneration The Boards policy is that the remuneration of the Directors, all of whom are non-executive Directors, should reflect the experience of the Board as a whole, be fair and comparable to that of other investment trusts in the same AITC UK Growth and Income Sector, which also have a similar capital structure, and investment objectives.
It is intended that this policy will continue for the year ending 30 June 2005 and subsequent years.
The Companys policy is for the Directors to be remunerated in the form of fees, payable quarterly in arrears, to the Director personally or to a third party specified by him.
The fees for the non-executive Directors are determined within the limits set out in the Companys Articles of Association, which limit the aggregate of the fees payable to the Directors to 100,000 per annum.
The Companys policy is that fees payable to the Directors should reflect the time spent by them on the Companys affairs and should be sufficient to enable candidates of a high quality to be recruited.
Non-executive Directors are normally not eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share options, long-term incentive schemes or other benefits.
The policy is to review these rates from time to time.
Following the review carried out during the year ended 30 June 2003 and the approval by Shareholders of the increase to the threshold for the maximum aggregate annual fees to 100,000, the level of fees was increased to 18,000 for the Chairman and 13,000 for each Director and a further 2,000 for the Chairman of the Audit Committee, with effect from 1 July 2003.
Directors and officers liability insurance cover is held by the Company in respect of the Directors.
This insurance is neither a benefit in kind nor does it form part of the Directors Remuneration.
Directors service contracts None of the Directors has a contract of service or contract for services and a Director may resign by notice in writing to the Board at any time: there are no set notice periods.
All Directors are appointed for an initial period of three years: this period may be varied by mutual consent.
The Articles of Association provide that, at the Annual General Meeting each year, one third of the Directors for the time being or if their number is not a multiple of three, the number nearest to one third shall be subject to retirement by rotation.
Directors, therefore, shall retire and be subject to re-election at the first Annual General Meeting following their appointment and thereafter shall be obliged to retire by rotation, and offer themselves for re-election, at least every three years.
Any Director who attains the age of 70 is subject to annual reelection.
No compensation is payable for loss of office, save any arrears of fees which may be due.
Company performance The graph below compares the total return assuming all dividends are reinvested to Ordinary Shareholders, assuming the notional investment of 100 into the Company on 30 June 1999, compared with the total Shareholder return on a notional investment made up of shares of the same kinds and number as those by reference to which the FTSE 350 Higher Yield Index and the FTSE All-Share Index are calculated.
These indices were chosen for comparison purposes, as the FTSE Higher Yield Index was the Companys benchmark until 30 June 2004 and the FTSE All-Share Index has been adopted as the benchmark of the Company with effect from 1 July 2004.
Both of these indices are the benchmarks used for performance measurement purposes by Murray Incomes peer group.
