GOVERNANCE Remuneration Committee and Advisors The Remuneration Committee comprises three independent non-executive directors, David Godwin Chairman, John Edgcumbe and Kathleen ODonovan, who have responsibility for determining the remuneration, contract terms and other benefits of the executive directors and the Chairman of the Company.
It reviews the remuneration framework for all other employees including long-term incentive arrangements for certain senior personnel.
Remuneration Policy The Remuneration Committee establishes policy on the remuneration of executive directors.
In determining the policy for 2004 it considered and is likely to continue to consider for subsequent financial years a number of factors, including: the importance of attracting, retaining and motivating executives of appropriate calibre and experience: and the size and long-term nature of the Groups business.
The Committee is advised by New Bridge Street Consultants, a firm of independent remuneration consultants, who were appointed in October 2003.
New Bridge Street Consultants advised the Committee on a number of remuneration matters during the year including a review for the restructuring of the executive directors annual bonus plan the Bonus Plan and a bonus plan for all other employees.
During the year, New Bridge Street Consultants also advised the executive directors on non-executive director fee levels.
Nabarro Nathanson assisted the Committee on procedural matters relating to the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP and contractual matters relating to the executive directors.
Nabarro Nathanson were appointed by the Company.
Toby Courtauld, the Chief Executive, was consulted in relation to discretionary bonuses for other senior executives.
The remuneration policy for executive directors has been designed to address the interests of both directors and shareholders: a potentially significant proportion of remuneration is based on performance and is dependant upon the achievement of demanding targets.
Remuneration currently comprises: basic salary and benefits, performance-related bonuses, LTIP and pension.
The Companys policy on termination payments is to consider the circumstances on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the relevant contractual terms, the circumstances of the termination and any applicable duty to mitigate.
It is the Committees policy not to reward for poor performance.
Basic Salary and Benefits Basic salaries and the level and nature of benefits provided to executive directors are reviewed by the Committee annually or on promotion, and are assessed having regard to Company and individual performance and salary levels in comparable organisations, particularly within the listed property sector.
Basic salary is the only element of executive directors remuneration which attracts pension contributions.
Benefits principally comprise life insurance, private health care, car and travel concessions and membership subscriptions.
The taxable value of these benefits is included in the table on page 43.
Bonus Plan Each year the Committee considers the appropriateness of short-term and long-term incentive plans in assessing the overall remuneration of executive directors.
For the year ended 2004 the Bonus Plan for executive directors was an annual, company performance-related plan based on total shareholder return received by a holder of the Companys shares compared with that of a comparator group of five major property companies, which comprised Benchmark Group PLC, The British Land Company PLC, Derwent Valley Holdings PLC, Land Securities Group PLC and Shaftesbury PLC.
Total shareholder return for the purpose of the Bonus Plan was calculated by reference to the increase in the value of the Companys shares between 1 April 2003 and 31 March 2004, and all dividends paid in that period.
The Bonus Plan could have generated a maximum award of 100% of salary.
No bonus was payable for 2004 under the Bonus Plan.
Based on his individual performance during the year, the Remuneration Committee awarded Mr Noel a bonus of 75,000.
DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT GREAT PORTLAND ESTATES Annual Report 2004 39 GOVERNANCE Following consultation with shareholders and discussions with New Bridge Street Consultants, the Bonus Plan for executive directors for 2005 has been amended so that the maximum award of 100% of salary is to be based one-third on the out-performance of earnings per share against the retail price index, one-third on the out-performance of the capital growth of the Companys property portfolio against Investment Property Databanks relevant Capital Growth Index, and one-third on the individuals performance.
Provided he has not given notice or indicated his intention to leave or the Company has not terminated his employment summarily in accordance with the terms of his contract, under the terms of his contract, agreed in 2002, Toby Courtauld received a loyalty bonus of 250,000 on 31 March 2004, and is entitled to a final loyalty bonus payable in cash of 350,000 on 31 March 2005.
Long-Term Incentive Plan Following shareholder approval at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 11 December 2002, the Company introduced the LTIP for executive directors and other senior employees.
In designing the LTIP, the Remuneration Committee followed the provisions in Schedule A of the Combined Code operative at that time.
The number of shares made the subject of awards under the LTIP is subject to an annual limit of 125% of a participants basic salary.
In the case of executive directors, as notified in the circular to shareholders proposing the establishment of the LTIP, it is the intention of the Remuneration Committee to make an award annually of 125% of the relevant executive directors basic salary.
Each year, contingent awards of shares are made which vest after three years provided performance conditions are met.
The conditions are based on: the growth in the Groups net assets per share exceeding the rate of inflation over the same period by an average of at least two percentage points per annum: and if this hurdle is met total shareholder return measured using share price and the reinvestment of dividends over the three years relative to a bespoke comparator group of 20 companies including the Company selected from the FTSE Real Estate Index.
Net assets per share is calculated as the fully diluted net asset value of the Great Portland Estates group as published in the Companys Annual Report, adjusted, as appropriate: to exclude the effect of deferred tax relating to capital allowances exceeding depreciation: to include the effect of marking debt to market: to include the effect of contingent corporation tax on chargeable gains: to ensure a consistent basis of calculation following any changes in accounting standards: and to take account of certain variations in share capital.
They were selected by the Remuneration Committee on the advice of the Companys remuneration consultants, and following discussion with the Association of British Insurers and institutional investors.
In order to ensure that the assessment of performance is independent, New Bridge Street Consultants and the Companys auditors will report to the Remuneration Committee as to whether the performance criteria have been met.
Total Shareholder Return The following graph shows the total shareholder returns for the Company for each of the last five financial years compared to the FTSE All-Share Real Estate Index.
The Company is a constituent of the FTSE All-Share Real Estate Index, and the Committee considers this to be the most appropriate broad market equity index for illustrating the Companys performance.

Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors The fees of the non-executive directors are reviewed annually by the executive directors, who make recommendations to the Board.
The total of non-executive directors fees is limited by the Articles of Association.
Remuneration of the non-executive directors comprises a basic fee, together with a fee for serving on each Board Committee.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for the Bonus Plan or LTIP, nor are contributions made to any pension arrangements.
Service Agreements In accordance with the Companys policy, service agreements for the executive directors are on a one-year rolling basis and, therefore, may normally be terminated by either party giving one years notice.
Toby Courtaulds compensation in lieu of notice, payable at the Companys discretion, is twelve months basic salary and any loyalty bonus payable which falls due during such notice period.
In the event of a change in control of the Company, Mr Courtauld is entitled to any unpaid balance in relation to a loyalty bonus of 350,000 due on 31 March 2005.
Compensation in lieu of notice of Robert Noel and John Whiteley, payable at the Companys discretion, is twelve months basic salary, pension allowance and the value of benefits in kind provided in the previous year, or the actual provision of those benefits.
On a change of control, under the terms of each of the Bonus Plan and the LTIP, all the executive directors would also be entitled to pro rata bonuses and outstanding awards subject to the meeting of the appropriate performance conditions for the period concerned.
Non-executive directors do not have service agreements but are subject to the provisions of the Articles of Association dealing with appointment and rotation every three years, and are subject to a notice period of three months.
The following table sets out the dates of each of the executive directors service agreements and their unexpired term, the dates of the non-executive directors letters of appointment and the date on which the non-executive director is next subject to reappointment or re-election.
