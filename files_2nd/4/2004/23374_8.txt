Remuneration report Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee operates within specic terms of reference in order to review matters of general policy in relation to the remuneration and terms and conditions of service of executive directors of the Group, and other senior managers, and to make recommendations to the Board as considered appropriate.
The members of the Committee are the non-executive directors, namely Roberto Mendoza Chairman, Jonathan Bloomer, Sir Derek Higgs, Leslie Priestley, Juan Rada, Pascal Cagni and Ronnie Baird.
The Committee has appointed Watson Wyatt LLP Actuaries and 1 Consultants to review and provide independent advice to the Committee on the remuneration of its executive directors and other senior managers.
Throughout the year Watson Wyatt LLP also provide the Group with market data for use in benchmarking the Groups salary structure, together with other remuneration related advice.
In addition, the Committee is advised by the HR Director on matters concerning the overall pay structure and the balance of the different elements of total remuneration and benets.
The Committee meets at least three times a year and the Chief Executive officer is also in attendance.
The Chief Executive officer advises the Committee specically on the performance and reward recommendations for his executive team, and leaves the meeting when his own compensation is discussed.
Remuneration policy It is the policy of the Committee to provide remuneration packages for the executive directors that are sufciently competitive to attract and retain scarce executive talent, and which align the interests of executive directors with those of shareholders.
Base pay, bonus and share plans are each designed to provide an overall package that provides significant scope for linking reward to individual performance.
Consequently, variable elements provide a relatively high proportion of total reward.
For all executive directors, assuming target performance, base salary represents approximately one-third of the target value of the total remuneration package taking into account the value of long-term incentives as explained later in the report.
Performance underpins the reward strategy so that base salary is positioned approximately at median against the relevant comparator group with variable pay taking total cash into upper quartile levels, based on meeting stretching individual and Group targets.
The structure of the remuneration package is reviewed as necessary with the above factors in mind.
Comparator group As a successful internet oriented retail financial services business, Egg does not have a natural comparator group of companies.
The Committee has accordingly chosen a set of appropriate comparator groups against which to measure different aspects of executive reward.
Base pay and total cash use a comparator group of companies suitably comparable to Egg, which provides roles that are similar in size when applying benchmark gradings.
The companies and roles are chosen to provide appropriate comparators for Egg based on a combination of size, similarity of operations and industry sector, and similarity of roles.
The different comparator groups include over 40 companies in total and the group used varies by role.
Two further comparator groups are used for the purposes of long-term incentive awards.
The Remuneration Committee has selected a comparator group of retail banks in the FTSE 350 for the purpose of determining the level of awards and a further comparator group of the FTSE 350 excluding investment trusts for measuring company performance when applying performance conditions on long-term share plans.
The basis for long-term incentive awards is outlined later in this section.
The comparator group of retail banks in the FTSE 350 is listed below: Abbey Alliance & Leicester Barclays Bradford & Bingley HBOS HSBC Holdings Lloyds TSB Group Northern Rock Royal Bank of Scotland Standard Chartered Salary The Remuneration Committee reviews annually the salaries of the executive directors, taking into account individual accountabilities and contribution, in addition to business results and market data on remuneration in comparator companies.
The target positioning for fully competent performance is market median of the relevant comparator group, with actual positioning being dependent on individual skills, experience and performance.

46-47 Egg plc Annual Report 2004 Remuneration report Annual bonus The annual bonus scheme is focused on the key strategic aims of the Group for the period.
It provides executive directors with an incentive based on meeting annual quantitative and qualitative financial and business targets.
These include profit, sales and revenue targets.
The achievement of qualitative targets is decided by the Committee, and this is based on evidence provided by the Chief Executive officer.
Executive directors participate at a level of up to 100% of base salary, based on both Group and individual achievement.
Of the overall bonus, 60% is based on corporate targets and 40% on individual targets.
For the coming year 80% will be based on corporate targets and 20% on individual targets.
On target achievement against stretching objectives would lead to a bonus of 75% of base salary and is designed to achieve upper quartile market total cash positioning.
For 2004, the overall achievement of corporate targets was 75%.
Any annual bonus payment is receivable in the form of a taxable, non-pensionable cash payment following the announcement of the annual results for the relevant year.
Due to the lengthy period of uncertainty during 2004 when Prudential was considering the possible sale of its stake in Egg, the Committee chose to implement a retention incentive arrangement for executive directors and a small number of senior managers.
This arrangement provided for an extra years bonus opportunity between 2004 and 2005.
This has to date enabled the Group to retain its key executives whilst also ensuring that this additional element of reward remains linked to performance.
This element is shown in the retention bonus column.
Benets in kind Each executive director is provided with a company car or cash alternative, medical and life assurance, none of which is pensionable.

3 Mike Harris elected to sacrifice his entitlement under the Egg Annual Bonus Scheme and under the retention arrangement.
The Group has made a contribution to the M Harris Executive Pension Plan in place of these bonuses.
4 Payment to a former director, Stacey Cartwright.
The highest paid director for 2004 was Paul Gratton whose emoluments for 2004 were 896,590.
Additionally in 2004 the Group made pension contributions of 32,568 on his behalf to a dened benefit pension scheme.
The highest paid director in 2003 was Paul Gratton whose emoluments for 2003 were 675,317, in addition to a pension contribution of 32,568 to a dened benefit pension scheme.
Pensions All of the executive directors have pension arrangements to which the Group makes contributions.
Paul Gratton participates in an individual dened benefit scheme whilst Mike Harris and Mark Nancarrow have individual dened contribution schemes.
David Doyle is a member of the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme, a dened benefit scheme.
The normal retirement age for all the executive directors is 60 years.
In the event of Paul Grattons early retirement, he will be entitled to an early retirement pension, which shall be at an annual accrual rate of one thirtieth of his final pensionable remuneration, up to a maximum of two-thirds of his final pensionable remuneration.
This will be reduced by an early retirement factor calculated by an actuary.
Upon Pauls death after retirement a pension will be paid to his spouse equal to two-thirds of the pension he was in receipt of on the day of his death.
The pension payable to Paul will be increased in line with the Retail Price Index.

Remuneration of non-executive directors The fees of the non-executive directors are determined by the Board, and are set at a level that, historically, has been sufficient to attract and retain individuals of the appropriate calibre.
Jonathan Bloomer was remunerated by Prudential plc.
His services to the Group were of a non-executive nature and his emoluments were deemed to be wholly attributable to his services to Prudential plc for the period.
The fees shown are for services as directors of Egg plc and its subsidiaries from 1 January 2004.

The service contracts for Mike Harris and Paul Gratton are dated 22 May 2000.
The service contracts for Mark Nancarrow and David Doyle are dated 26 September 2003 and 10 October 2003 respectively.
Each of the executive directors contracts is terminable by either side giving 12 months written notice of termination.
In either case, the Group will not require the individual to carry out their normal duties under the contract for more than six months.
The Committee has discretion over any compensation for any unvested long-term incentives in the case of loss of ofce by an executive.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts but are appointed pursuant to letters of appointment.
These are for an initial term of three years, and the directors are expected to serve two such three-year terms.
There is no liability for compensation arising under these letters of appointment.
Long-term incentives The Group operates a restricted share plan the Restricted Share Plan and an employee share option plan the Share Option Plan.
Awards were granted to executive directors under both plans at the time of the Initial Public Offering in June 2000.
These awards were designed to take into account the inherent value accumulated under a previous cash based long-term incentive arrangement Long-term Incentive Plan in the 18 months prior to otation.
For this reason performance conditions were not applied to these grants.
This plan terminated upon otation.
It has been the policy of the Remuneration Committee to grant awards of long-term incentives annually, under either or both the Restricted Share Plan and the Share Option Plan.
It is intended that the level of awards will be maintained in 2005, with awards being delivered in restricted shares.
Performance conditions apply to the grant of awards under both plans.
Performance conditions on grant are based on the delivery of Eggs business plan for the year, and the individual responsibilities necessary to deliver the plan.
The targets for the Egg business plan were achieving profit, sales and revenue targets: individual responsibilities were in support of that plan.
For executive directors, the key individual responsibilities are: Paul Gratton ensuring delivery of the Groups operating plan and achieving the optimal positioning of information technology, brand and cost base necessary for both the year and for Eggs future plans: David Doyle ensuring business strategies are value creative and deliver the financial targets incorporated in the Groups operating plan, and ensuring the integrity of financial results: Mike Harris supporting the development of Eggs future strategic plans: Mark Nancarrow delivery of the customer proposition, customer service and long-term customer value, oversight of the Treasury function and delivery of information technology.
The conditions are subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Performance conditions have applied to the vesting of awards granted under the Restricted Share Plan after 2001.
No awards have been made under the Share Option Plan since 2002, and the Committee has no current intention of making awards under this plan without performance conditions on vesting.
Total Shareholder Return TSR against the FTSE 350 was felt to be most appropriate performance measure for restricted shares in the absence of specic comparators for Eggs stage of growth.
This is a general index and outperforming this is a reasonable measure of providing return to shareholders.
The proportion of the initial award that vests will be determined by the Committees assessment of Eggs TSR ranked against the FTSE 350 at the end of the measurement period.
The measurement period begins on the date of the award and ends on the third anniversary thereof.
Depending on positioning against this group, the actual number of restricted shares received will be based on a multiplier of between 0 and 4 times the basic award shown in Table 5.
The basic award will normally be given at median ranking against the TSR results for the FTSE 350, with straight-line interpolation rising to twice the basic award if performance is at upper quartile ranking, and quadruple the basic award if performance is at top ranking illustrated Figure 1 below.
Eggs performance against the FTSE 350 is shown in Figure 2 below.

Actual awards in 2004 had a Present Economic Value of 514,500 for Paul Gratton, 385,875 for Mike Harris, 431,375 for Mark Nancarrow and 262,500 for David Doyle.
The positioning for on target achievement against stretching objectives is validated with reference to the total direct compensation for the comparator group of retail banks in the FTSE 350, outlined earlier.
In previous years, this validation has been done against the median of the market data.
For 2005 the Committee chose to use the more conservative comparison of the upper quartile scaled back using base salary as the scaling factor to take account of the relative size of roles at Egg.
This produces a lower comparator than the unadjusted median and is judged to be more appropriate.
From 2002 Watson Wyatts Present Economic Value PEV methodology has been applied to arrive at long-term incentive award levels.
This builds on the mathematical and economic principles underlying the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The advantage of this methodology is that it allows the Remuneration Committee to value consistently all types of long-term incentives taking into account features relating to the expected future share price volatility and dividends, performance and exercise conditions.
A minimum shareholding requirement was introduced from 2003, whereby executive directors are required to hold shares to the value of twice their annual salary after seven years, with an interim requirement to hold shares to the value of their annual salary after three years.
50-51 Egg plc Annual Report 2004 Remuneration report Egg Restricted Share Plan On 25 April 2000, the Group adopted the Restricted Share Plan, under which executive directors of the Group may be awarded shares in Egg plc.
The awards are conditional until the vesting date, and normally require continued service until that date.
Details of the conditional awards of shares in Egg plc under the Restricted Share Plan are shown below.
These shares represent the conditional awards out of which allocations will be made.
2 The shares conditionally awarded in 2004 are subject to the performance conditions outlined in the previous section.
3 The price of shares conditionally awarded is based on the market price of the shares on the day of the award.
4 There were no performance conditions attaching to the awards vested in 2004.
As a result rights were granted over 100% of the shares conditionally awarded.
In order to cover the tax liability arising upon vesting, 41% of the total shares were vested in the form of cash.
This was due to the vesting occurring immediately following the announcement that Prudential was to retain its share in Egg, with the consequent risk that it may not have been possible to sell sufficient shares in the market to cover the tax liability.
This was an isolated event in exceptional circumstances and there is no current intention for this to be repeated.
5 The market price of shares vested in 2004 is based on the market price of the shares on the day of vesting.
Egg Employee Share Option Plan On 25 April 2000, the Group adopted the Share Option Plan, under which executive directors of the Group may be granted options over shares.
The grants are conditional until the vesting date.
Details of the option grants under the plan are shown below.
2 Figures shown for Paul Gratton include options held by his wife, who is a senior manager at Egg.
3 No share options were exercised during 2004.
The market price of Egg plc shares at 31 December 2004 was 100p.
The highest price during the year was 194p and the lowest price during the year was 89.75p.
52-53 Egg plc Annual Report 2004 Remuneration report Egg Savings-Related Share Option Scheme An invitation was issued under the Egg Savings-Related Share Option Scheme Sharesave in September 2004.
This is open to permanent employees of Egg and its subsidiaries.
Options up to the Inland Revenue limits are granted at a 20% discount and cannot normally be exercised until a minimum of three years has elapsed.

The executive directors of Egg plc ceased to be eligible to receive new awards under this scheme on 1 January 1999.
Prudential Restricted Share Plan At the end of each three-year performance period executive directors and certain other senior managers of Prudential plc may be granted a right to receive shares at no cost to the individual, dependent on Prudentials performance.
For RSP awards prior to 2004, no rights are granted if the Companys TSR performance as ranked against the comparator group is at the 60th percentile or below.
The maximum grant is made only if the TSR ranking of the Company is 20th percentile or above.
Between these points, the size of the grant made is calculated on a straight-line sliding scale.
In normal circumstances, directors may take up their right to receive shares at any time during the following seven years.
The 2001 conditional RSP award lapsed and no rights were granted after the performance period ending on 31 December 2003.
In respect of awards made in 2001 under the Restricted Share Plan, the Companys TSR was ranked at 69th percentile at the end of the three year performance period on 31 December 2003 and as a result the 2001 awards lapsed.
The 2002 conditional RSP award lapsed and no rights were granted after the performance period ending on 31 December 2004.
In respect of awards made in 2002 under the Restricted Share Plan, the Companys TSR was ranked at 89th percentile at the end of the three year performance period on 31 December 2004.
As Prudentials position was lower than 60th percentile, the 2002 awards lapsed and rights will not be granted over any of the shares conditionally awarded to executive directors.
The awards made in respect of 2003 and 2004 under the Restricted Share Plan run to 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2006 respectively.
As at 31 December 2004, TSR performance under these plans was ranked respectively at percentile positions 82 and 79.
In determining the 2004 conditional awards the shares were valued at their average share price during the preceding calendar year, and the price used to determine the number of shares was 389.3p 2003: 570.3p.

Prudential Executive and Savings Related Share Option Schemes The Prudential Restricted Share Plan replaced the Executive Share Option Scheme in 1995 as Prudentials long-term incentive plan.
Outstanding options under the Executive Share Option Scheme remain in force and are set out below together with options under the Savings-Related Share Option Scheme.
The latter scheme is open to all Prudential employees and options up to the Inland Revenue limits are granted at a 20% discount and cannot normally be exercised until a minimum of three years has elapsed.
