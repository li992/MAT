0.4 1.9 2.6 4.9 Southern holds a franchise agreement with the SRA to operate commuter rail services on the Southern Network.
This is expected to expire in December 2009 and goodwill is being amortised over the period from acquisition to this date.
At 3 July 2004 3.3 0.6 98.6 62.3 164.8 Net book value The annual impairment test of the carrying value of goodwill associated with aviance was undertaken in accordance with FRS11.
In At 3 July 2004 50.8 1.8 139.2 46.2 238.0 performing this impairment test at 3 July 2004 future cash flows were forecast applying a long-term growth rate of 2.25% and a pre tax discount rate of 14%.
This represents a 3.6% premium 2003 2.8% on the groups estimated pre tax weighted average cost of At 28 June 2003 39.9 2.0 120.8 43.9 206.6 capital.
As a result of the impairment test, the goodwill of 67m has been fully written down in these financial statements.
A review has been performed which confirmed that there has been no impairment to the remaining goodwill during the financial year.
The combination of sustainable market growth, high barriers to entry, competitive advantage together with the in-house experience, skills and resources to exploit opportunities, leads the board to the current conclusion that the useful life of the goodwill arising on the acquisitions of Meteor Parking, Metrobus, Wilts & Dorset and Chauffeured Parking Services is indefinite.
Accordingly the board is of the opinion that amortisation of this goodwill would not show a true and fair view.
Had the goodwill been amortised in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 over the FRS 10 rebutable assumption period of 20 years, an additional 1.5m would have been charged to the profit and loss account in the year to 3 July 2004 2003 - 4.4m.
