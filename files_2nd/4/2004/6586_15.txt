Total shareholder return performance The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the disclosure regulations require GKNs TSR performance to be displayed in chart form against the TSR of a readily available broad equity market index.
The Committee considers that it is appropriate and consistent to continue to show the FTSE 100 Indexto fulfil this requirement.
The chart below left therefore illustrates the TSR performance based on an initial investment of 100 of GKN plc Ordinary Shares over the period from the Industrial Services demerger in 2001 until the end of 2004 compared to the TSR that would have been obtained over the same period from a hypothetical investment in the companies constituting the FTSE 100 Index.
The interim points show the cumulative TSR at each calendar half year-end date.
As GKN plc was incorporated during the course of 2001, the disclosure regulations only require the comparative TSR performance of the Companys shares to be shown since 1 August 2001 when the Company became the listed parent company of the GKN Group just prior to the demerger.
However, for the purposes of the LTIP and ESOS different comparator companies are used see pages 80 and 81.
In addition, the TSR calculation methodology required by the LTIP and ESOS is different from that required by the regulations for the broad equity market index graph.
We therefore show in the table above right GKNs TSR and rank against the TSR of the relevant comparator group, together with the percentage of the conditional award converted into a deferred award, for the five most recently completed measurement periods as computed under the terms of the LTIP.

The remuneration of the executive Directors in 2004, excluding pension benefits and long-term incentives, was as follows: Date of PerformanceCar Other Termination Total Total a service Salary related allowance benefits costs 2004 2003 agreement 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 b K Smith 24.1.

b Payments of supplementary allowances to certain executive Directors to assist them towards securing retirement benefits are included in the money-purchase contributions and allowances for pension benefit purposes disclosed in the first table on page 87.
The allowances, detailed below, have therefore been excluded from the total remuneration shown in the table above although they are part of the Directors aggregate emoluments for the purpose of disclosure under the Companies Act 1985: Mr K Smith 133,000 2003 135,000 : Mr R J Clowes 99,000 2003 95,000 : Mr R W Etches 26,000 2003 74,000 : Mr I R Griffiths 128,000 2003 118,000 : Mr N M Stein 103,000 2003 97,000. c Retired 30 June 2004. d Left service 30 June 2004.
Mr Keating was paid in US$ for the purpose of this report his in-service emoluments have been translated at US$1.82 1 and his termination costs at US$1.84 1 being respectively the average exchange rates for the first and second halves of 2004.
The 2004 performance-related payments were triggered by the achievement of a number of individual strategic objectives and operational targets.
For all executive Directors, a proportion of such payments was dependent upon the achieved levelofGKNs 2004 earnings before tax, goodwill amortisation and exceptional items including goodwill impairment against budget.
For those Directors with responsibility for business operations, payments were also dependent upon the achieved level of operating profit of their respective portfolio in 2004.
Profit performance equal to target would have resulted in payments of 30% of salary.
The maximum amount that an individual could receive under the profit element was 90% of salary.
In addition, cash flow targets were set for the Group as a whole or, where appropriate, the cash flow performance of the Directors portfolio for each half of the year.
A total of 10% of salary was payable on achievement of all cash flow targets.
In addition, for 2004 strategic objectives were set for each Director which would have resulted in payment of 10% of salary for full achievement: however, this element wasonly payable if 90% of the Group or portfolio profit target as appropriate for the Director was met.
Actual total payments to current executive Directors under the 2004 short-term variable remuneration scheme varied between 11% and 59.5% of salary.
The service agreements of Dick Etches and Neal Keating came to an end on 1 July 2004.
Under Mr Etches early retirement arrangements, a payment equivalent to six months basic salary 138,000 and six months pension contributions equal to 40% of basic salary, or 55,000, totalling 193,000, was payable in six equal monthly instalments, subject to mitigation.
Other related costs were comprised principally of settlement of car leasing arrangements 28,000 and repatriation expenses 13,000.
Upon cessation of employment, one years basic salary US$468,000 payable in 24 twice-monthly payments, together with one years family healthcare cover US$10,000, was receivable by Mr Keating.
GKN also paid for outplacement services to assist him in obtaining suitable alternative employment US$42,000.
Under the Groups performance-related short-term variable remuneration scheme, Mr Etches and Mr Keating are each entitled to receive 4% of basic salary being the amount payable in relation to the achievement of the Groups and GKN Aerospace Services respective cash flow targets for the first half of 2004.
Under the rules of the ESOS and LTIP they will also be entitled in due course to exercise their outstanding awards and options disclosed on pages 85 and 86 subject to the usual performance conditionsdescribed elsewhere in this report.
Under these rules, no retesting of any ESOS options which do not vest at the first potential vesting date will be permitted, and the number of any shares which vest under the LTIP would be pro rated according to their length of service during the relevant three-year measurement period.
