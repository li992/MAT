259 7408 MF Paladin AR TP 7 4 05 5:45 pm Page 30 Directors Remuneration Report Remuneration policy The remuneration policy for the Chairman, the Executive Directors and senior managers of the Company is determined by the Remuneration Committee, which is comprised solely of independent Non-executive Directors.
The members of the Committee are Messrs. Paterson Chairman, Turcan and Watkins, as noted in the Directors Report on page 24.
Mr J M Gourlay and Mr R A Franklin are not members of the Committee but usually attend meetings by invitation, except when their own remuneration is being discussed, as Paladin considers it important that the Chairman and Chief Executive of the Company are fully aware of discussions concerning remuneration policy and the remuneration packages of its most senior employees.
The Committee acts within its agreed written terms of reference and complies with the relevant provisions of the 2003 FRC Code in implementing its remuneration policy.
The terms of reference are available on the Companys website.
Within the framework of the agreed remuneration policy, the Committee determines the fees of the Chairman and the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and other senior managers, including the size of, and the performance conditions applying to, awards made under the Companys cash bonus, long-term incentive and share option schemes, and the extent of those executives pension arrangements.
The Committee also advises the Board on employee benefit structure throughout the Group.
The Chief Executive and the Company Secretary who is also the secretary of the Committee provide advice to the Remuneration Committee as necessary save in respect of their own remuneration.
New Bridge Street Consultants continued to advise the Committee during 2004, in particular in relation to the structure, operation and implementation of incentive schemes.
They report directly to the Committee and do not advise the Company in any other respect.
A statement describing New Bridge Street Consultants relationship with the Company is available on the Companys website.
No other advisory bodies were engaged by the Committee during 2004.
In preparation for the annual salary review on 1 July, the Committee commissioned a report from New Bridge Street Consultants on all aspects of the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and on the fees of the Non-executive Directors, benchmarked against eight companies from the oil and gas sector and 21 companies from different but related sectors with a broadly similar market capitalisation to that of the Company.
The main conclusion of the report, namely that the total remuneration of the Executive Directors is at the median compared with its sector peer group, was taken into account by the Committee when conducting the salary review.
The Committees policy on Executive Directors remuneration will continue to apply for the year to 31 December 2005 and, so far as is practicable, for subsequent years.
The Committee considers that an effective remuneration policy needs to be sufficiently flexible to take account of future changes in the Companys business environment and remuneration practice.
Any changes in policy for subsequent years will be described in future reports, which will be subject to the advisory vote by shareholders.
The Committee aims to provide Executive Directors and senior managers with packages which are sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the quality required to achieve the Groups business objectives and thereby enhance shareholder value.
Broad account is taken of the level of remuneration paid to executive directors and senior management of comparable public companies see for example the reference above to the report prepared by New Bridge Street Consultants and consideration is given to pay levels and benefit policies throughout the Group.
Each package consists of basic salary, benefits, non-contributory pension arrangements, awards under a long-term incentive plan, share options and a nonpensionable cash bonus.
A significant proportion of the value of each package, in particular vesting under the long-term incentive plan, the ability to exercise share options and payment of the cash bonus, is based on the performance of the Group and is dependent on the achievement of demanding targets, thus aligning the rewards obtained by the Executive Directors and senior managers with the returns gained by shareholders.
Details of each element of the package are given below.
Mr R A Franklin is a non-executive director of International Energy Group Limited and receives fees of 20,000 per annum 2003: 20,000 for such services.
None of the other Executive Directors or any senior managers of the Company currently hold any non-executive directorships in other companies.
The Remuneration Committees policy in respect of Executive Directors accepting appointments on external boards or committees is that such appointments are permitted, provided that they do not interfere or conflict with the business of the Group, and that any fees received by the Executive Directors in respect of the appointments may be retained by them.
Paladin Resources plc Annual report and accounts 2004 30 259 7408 MF Paladin AR TP 7 4 05 5:45 pm Page 31 Directors Remuneration Report Directors service contracts Save for automatic termination when each Executive Director becomes 60 years of age, the Executive Directors have rolling service contracts, subject to re-election by shareholders under the Companys Articles of Association and the provisions of the 2003 FRC Code.
The service contract of each Executive Director may be terminated on 12 months notice in writing by either side, in accordance with current market practice.
There are provisions for earlier termination by the Company in certain specified circumstances.
If such a circumstance were to arise, the Executive Director concerned would have no claim against the Company for damages or any other remedy in respect of the termination.
An Executive Director is not entitled to claim compensation on termination in any circumstances in respect of any lost rights or benefits under any of the incentive schemes described below.
There are no other provisions, such as liquidated damages clauses, which expressly provide for compensation in the event of early termination.
The Remuneration Committee would apply general principles of mitigation to any payment made to a departing Executive Director and would consider each case on an individual basis.
The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts.
Letters of appointment provide for initial periods of three years, subject to review and to re-election by shareholders.
Details of the contract and appointment dates are set out below: Executive Director Date of service contract P Davison 3 September 1997 R A Franklin 3 September 1997 C J McDowell 3 September 1997 Non-executive Director Date of initial appointment letter latest renewal J M Gourlay 3 September 1997 28 September 2004 I S Paterson 2 November 1998 15 November 2004 W J Turcan 20 March 2001 19 March 2004 G E Watkins 21 February 2003 Copies of the Executive Directors service contracts and the Non-executive Directors letters of appointment are available for inspection as set out in Note 2 to the Notice of Annual General Meeting.

Paladin Resources plc Annual report and accounts 2004 31 259 7408 MF Paladin AR TP 7 4 05 5:45 pm Page 32 Directors Remuneration Report continued As potential beneficiaries of shares held in the trust established in connection with the Long Term Incentive Plan 2000 described in detail below, each of the Executive Directors is technically deemed to be interested in the ordinary shares held in the trust.
At 31 December 2004, the trust held 1,251,923 ordinary shares in the share capital of the Company.
Despite the technical interest, an Executive Director will only be entitled to receive from the trust the number of ordinary shares to which he becomes entitled under the rules of the Long Term Incentive Plan 2000.
Directors remuneration The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is agreed at their date of appointment and increases are, in the case of the Chairman, the responsibility of the Remuneration Committee and, in the case of the independent Non-executive Directors, subject to the approval of the Board as a whole.
The increases in the remuneration of the Non-executive Directors of 10%, in the case of the Chairman, and 5%, in the case of the independent Non-executive Directors, and the continuation of a separate fee of 3,000 per annum for the Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees, were agreed with effect from 1 July 2004.
This followed consideration of the size and complexity of the business and the responsibility and workload borne by the Non-executive Directors in relation to corporate governance matters: the Board Remuneration Committee, as applicable, also made reference to the review conducted by New Bridge Street Consultants referred to above.
The Non-executive Directors, including the Chairman, do not participate in the cash bonus scheme, the long-term incentive plan, the share option schemes or the Groups pension arrangements.
The salaries of the Executive Directors are determined after a review of the performance of the individual and are reviewed annually with effect from 1 July.
In the light of the conclusions of the review conducted by New Bridge Street Consultants and given the increasing size and complexity of the business of the Group, the basic salary of each of the Executive Directors was increased by 5% on 1 July 2004.
As a result, Mr R A Franklins base salary is currently 348,000 and Mr P Davisons and Mr C J McDowells base salaries are each 210,000.
The remuneration of each Director during 2004 excluding pension contributions, share options and long term incentive arrangements, which are dealt with separately is set out below: Other Performance salary related Basic salary payments bonus Other benefits 2004 2003 and fees note i note ii note iii total total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Executive P Davison note iv 205 25 94 4 328 254 R A Franklin note v 340 80 157 7 584 454 C J McDowell note vi 205 35 94 3 337 260 D J B Stewart-Roberts note vii 260 Non-executive J M Gourlay Chairman 68 68 59 I S Paterson 31 31 26 W J Turcan 31 31 26 G E Watkins 28 28 21 908 140 345 14 1,407 1,360 Paladin Resources plc Annual report and accounts 2004 32 259 7408 MF Paladin AR TP 7 4 05 5:45 pm Page 33 Directors Remuneration Report Notes: i Includes a non-pensionable payment in lieu of the provision of a fully-expensed company car of 10% of salary, capped at 21,000, and the payments referred to in notes iv, v and vi below.
ii Payment under the cash bonus scheme based on 45% 2003: 25.3% of basic salary as at 31 December.
iii Other benefits comprise annual medical, medical insurance, life assurance, permanent health insurance and fitness club fees.
iv Includes 5,000 2003: 2,000 to compensate Mr P Davison for the costs of funding pension benefits in excess of the Inland Revenue ceiling.
v Includes 59,000 2003: 47,000 to compensate Mr R A Franklin for the costs of funding pension benefits in excess of the Inland Revenue ceiling.
vi Includes 15,000 2003: 9,000 to compensate Mr C J McDowell for the costs of funding pension benefits in excess of the Inland Revenue ceiling.
vii The total remuneration for 2003 for Mr Stewart-Roberts is based on 11 months employment only, and includes a termination payment of 120,000 and a payment of 6,000 for holiday accrued but not taken at 30 November 2003.
Pension contributions The Company has a commitment to make payments of 20% of the basic annual salary of each Executive Director in respect of pension contributions.
The Company satisfies this commitment by making payments into a small private self-administered scheme up to the limits permitted by the Inland Revenue.
The Directors are compensated for any shortfall by the payments referred to in notes iv, v and vi above.
The Company has no further obligations relating to the pension arrangements of the Executive Directors.
Amounts paid into the scheme were as follows: 2004 2003 000 000 P Davison 38 35 R A Franklin 29 28 C J McDowell 31 30 D J B Stewart-Roberts 24 98 117 The Company will review its pensions policy prior to the Finance Act 2004 coming into force in April 2006.
Long-Term Incentive Plan 2000 LTIP The LTIP for Executive Directors and other professional staff was established during 2000 and approved by shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting in November 2000.
In designing the LTIP, the Remuneration Committee followed the provisions set out in Schedule A of the Combined Code and market practice current at the time.
Under the LTIP, employees of the Company are eligible to receive awards of a number of shares, the vesting of which is contingent on a specified performance target and continued employment with the Group.
At present, only the Executive Directors and six other senior managers of the Group have received awards under the LTIP.
Paladin Resources plc Annual report and accounts 2004 33 259 7408 MF Paladin AR TP 7 4 05 5:45 pm Page 34 Directors Remuneration Report continued The performance target for the awards made under the LTIP in March 2001 and March 2002 further details of which are set out in the table below is the Companys total shareholder return measured, over the three year period following the making of each award, against that of a group of comparator companies selected by the Remuneration Committee.
The comparator group selected in respect of the awards made in March 2001 and 2002 comprised Cairn Energy plc, Dana Petroleum plc, Energy Africa Limited, Enterprise Oil plc, JKX Oil & Gas plc, Melrose Resources plc, Premier Oil plc, SOCO International PLC and Tullow Oil plc.
Where a company in the comparator group has been taken over, its total shareholder return at the date of the takeover including any bid premium is increased for the remainder of the performance period by the percentage change in the Retail Prices Index RPI, plus 3% per annum.
The total shareholder return performances of the Company and the companies in the comparator group are tested and averaged over the month leading up to an award and over the month immediately prior to the vesting date.
There is no re-testing of the performance target.
Vesting will depend on the Companys ranking against the comparator group companies: first position will give rise to 100% of the shares vesting, second position to 80% and so on down to fifth position 20%.
If the Company is placed lower than fifth position, no shares will vest.
As part of its overall discretion under the terms of the LTIP, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to vest an award by up to 20% more than would have been the case by applying the above ranking test if the Companys total shareholder return is exceptionally close to the next higher ranked company.
For the awards made in April 2003 and 2004 and for future awards, a maximum of 50% of an award will vest in accordance with the comparative total shareholder return performance condition described above.
A comparator group comprising Cairn Energy plc, Dana Petroleum plc, Energy Africa Limited, JKX Oil & Gas plc, Melrose Resources plc, Premier Oil plc, SOCO International PLC, Tullow Oil plc and Venture Production PLC was selected for the April 2003 awards.
For the awards made in April 2004, Burren Energy PLC replaced Energy Africa Limited and the remainder of the comparator group was the same as for the April 2003 award.
Vesting of the remaining 50% of an award will be determined by the extent to which the Companys return on equity ROE post-tax earnings divided by shareholder funds, calculated annually and then averaged over three years beginning with the year in which the award is made, falls within an absolute target range of 10-20% per annum.
No shares will vest if the ROE achieved is below 10%, between 5% and 37.5% of an award will vest on a straightline basis if the ROE attained is between 10% and 15%, and the remaining 12.5% of an award will vest again on a straightline basis if the ROE achieved is between 15% and 20%.
There will be no additional vesting for an ROE achieved of more than 20%.
These new performance conditions were chosen in order to align the extent to which the awards vest with the generation of shareholder value and were selected by the Remuneration Committee after consultation with the Companys remuneration consultants.
They involve a transparent financial measure which may be calculated from published accounting information.
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the new conditions, taken as a whole, are genuinely challenging and intends, therefore, to apply the same conditions to awards made in the financial year ending 31 December 2005.
The total shareholder return calculations have been and will continue to be undertaken by a third party and approved by the Remuneration Committee.
The same will apply to the calculations to determine the extent to which the absolute financial targets have been met.
In this way, the Committee will ensure that the required level of independent verification is achieved.

The performance period for the LTIP awards made on 29 March 2001 was completed on 29 March 2004.
Following an analysis by an independent third party of the total shareholder return performance of the Company and the companies in the comparator group, the Remuneration Committee determined that 50% of the awards should vest.
The Company was ranked in fourth position in the comparator group, giving rise to a vesting of 40%, but the Remuneration Committee agreed that the close proximity of the Company to the third ranked company, and the fact that the total shareholder return achieved by the Company was 188% during the performance period, meant that it would be fair and reasonable to use part of its discretion referred to above to increase the amount of each participants award from 40% to 50%.
The entries in the above table for Messrs. Davison, Franklin and McDowell record this vesting and the lapsing of the remaining 50% of the March 2001 awards.
The market price of the Companys ordinary shares on the vesting date, 29 March 2004, was 103p.
The Paladin Resources plc Employee Share Trust will from time to time on instructions from the Remuneration Committee purchase shares in the market to cover the anticipated entitlement under the LTIP, with the requisite funds being provided to it by the Company.
Awards are made annually by the Remuneration Committee and, while there is no maximum laid down in the rules of the LTIP, the awards have historically approximated in value to between 75% and 100% of basic salary.
The Remuneration Committee intends that these levels of award will continue.
Share options a The Paladin Resources plc Inland Revenue Approved Share Option Scheme and the Paladin Resources plc Unapproved Share Option Scheme The Company operates share option schemes for all employees.
Options granted in November 2000, March 2001 and March 2002 respectively under both the Inland Revenue approved and unapproved share option schemes may be exercised between three and six years after the date of grant, provided that the total shareholder return of the Company increases during the initial three year period following grant by a percentage amount that is equal to or greater than the percentage change in the RPI plus 3% per annum over the same period.
Paladin Resources plc Annual report and accounts 2004 35 259 7408 MF Paladin AR TP 7 4 05 5:45 pm Page 36 Directors Remuneration Report continued For the options granted in April 2003 and 2004 and for future option awards, only 50% of the options awarded will become exercisable in the event of a total shareholder return increase of RPI plus 3% per annum over the three years following grant.
Options will become exercisable in full only if the total shareholder return of the Company increases during the initial three year period following grant by a percentage amount that is equal to or greater than the percentage change in the RPI plus 5% per annum over the same period, with a sliding scale between the 3% and 5% points.
The adoption of a sliding scale of total shareholder return growth is felt to provide a better link between performance and reward.
To ensure that the required level of independent verification is achieved, the total shareholder return calculations will be undertaken by a third party and approved by the Remuneration Committee.
The performance conditions applying to all options are reviewed at the end of the performance period and are not re-tested.
During 2004, certain options granted in November 2000 were exercised as noted in the above table, the total shareholder return of the Company having increased during the three year period following grant by a percentage amount that was greater than the percentage change in the RPI plus 3% over the same period.
On 29 March 2004, Mr P Davison exercised and immediately sold the options under the unapproved scheme at a price of 104p per share, giving a pre-tax gain of 52,600.
Neither of the other Executive Directors exercised any share options during 2004.
Aggregate pre-tax gains of 168,000 under the approved scheme and 695,000 under the unapproved scheme were made by the Executive Directors in 2003.
Paladin Resources plc Annual report and accounts 2004 36 259 7408 MF Paladin AR TP 7 4 05 5:45 pm Page 37 Directors Remuneration Report Share options are awarded annually by the Remuneration Committee and have historically approximated in value to around 50% of basic annual salary for those employees also receiving awards under the LTIP and around 75% of basic annual salary for those employees not receiving awards under the LTIP.
It is the Companys policy not to distinguish between employees in terms of the percentage of salary over which options are granted in any given year, save as noted above in relation to those employees who also receive awards under the LTIP.
The Remuneration Committee regards share options as an important incentive for all employees and intends to retain the all employee nature of the approved and unapproved schemes for the foreseeable future.
The exercise prices of the options granted during the year were determined, in accordance with the rules of the relevant schemes, by reference to the average of the mid-market prices of the Companys ordinary shares on the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of invitation to apply for the grant of the options.
b The Paladin Resources plc Savings-Related Share Option Scheme the SAYE Scheme The Company also operates the SAYE Scheme for all UK employees.
The outstanding share options of the Executive Directors under the SAYE Scheme, which is administered by Yorkshire Building Society, are as follows: Options Options Options Options held granted exercised lapsed Options Date from Name of at 1 Jan during during during held at Exercise which Expiry Director 2004 the year the year the year 31 Dec 2004 price exercisable date P Davison 10,134 10,134 93p 1 Jun 2007 1 Dec 2007 R A Franklin 17,580 17,580 93p 1 Jun 2009 1 Dec 2009 C J McDowell 17,580 17,580 93p 1 Jun 2009 1 Dec 2009 There have been no changes in the outstanding share options of the Executive Directors under the SAYE Scheme between 31 December 2004 and the date of this report.
As an all-employee scheme approved by the Inland Revenue, there are no performance conditions attaching to the exercise of options under the SAYE Scheme.
The exercise prices were determined, in accordance with the rules of the SAYE Scheme, by discounting by 20% the average of the market prices of the Companys ordinary shares over the three days immediately preceding the issue of invitations to participate in the SAYE Scheme.
The market price of the Companys ordinary shares at 31 December 2004 was 175p and the range during the year was 85.75p to 189.50p.
The range from the date of the options granted to Executive Directors under the unapproved share option scheme during the year 16 April 2004 to the year-end was 117p to 189.50p.
The range from the date of the options granted to Executive Directors under the SAYE Scheme during the year 12 May 2004 to the year-end was 117.25p to 189.50p.
All the options were granted for nil consideration.
As at 14 March 2005, 18,582,759 options had been granted during the preceding ten years under the approved and unapproved share option schemes and the SAYE Scheme, giving remaining dilution headroom of 15,187,873 under the 10% of shares in issue rule contained in the various scheme rules.
Awards under the LTIP are not included in this calculation, as the awards are satisfied using shares purchased in the market.
Paladin Resources plc Annual report and accounts 2004 37 259 7408 MF Paladin AR TP 7 4 05 5:45 pm Page 38 Directors Remuneration Report continued Cash bonus scheme The non-pensionable cash bonus scheme for 2004 for all head office staff was driven by six performance targets: production of the Group during the year, unit lifting costs, achievement and outcome of the capital investment programme for 2004, reserves replacement and profit after tax all corporate targets and the personal performance of the individual employee.
Employees in the Groups Aberdeen and Stavanger offices were subject to production, unit lifting costs and capital investment targets relating to the UK and Scandinavian businesses respectively: the other targets were identical to those applying to staff in head office.
The maximum available bonus was for the Executive Committee, the members of which are noted in the Directors Report on page 23, 50% and for other staff 35% of basic annual pensionable salary as at 31 December 2004.
As noted in the Directors remuneration table on pages 32 and 33, a cash bonus of 45% is payable to each of the Executive Directors in respect of 2004.
Revised targets appropriate for the Groups performance for 2005 have been put in place.
The maximum available bonus for members of the LTIP, including the Executive Directors, will be 100% of basic annual pensionable salary as at 31 December 2005, while for other staff the maximum available will be 50% or 35% of basic annual pensionable salary as at 31 December 2005, depending on seniority.
The three corporate targets applicable to the Executive Directors are production of the Group during the year, reserves replacement and profit after tax: the other measures are based on personal performance and corporate reputation and are paid out at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Employees in the Groups Aberdeen and Stavanger offices and in the international business unit based in London are subject to production, unit lifting costs and capital investment targets relating to their respective businesses, in addition to the Group reserves replacement and profit after tax measures.
The corporate targets were chosen after consideration of the factors affecting overall financial performance of companies in the oil and gas sector.
The decision to increase the maximum available bonus for Executive Directors and other members of the senior management team to 100% of basic annual pensionable salary was taken by the Remuneration Committee after a review of the bonus schemes of companies in the Companys sector peer group and with the intention of increasing the proportion of remuneration that is performance-related.
The performance conditions are more challenging than those applicable to other employees.
Performance graph The graph on page 39 shows the total shareholder return value, with dividends reinvested, for each of the last five financial years of a holding in the Companys shares against the corresponding value in a hypothetical holding of shares in the FTSE All Share Index.
As may be seen from the graph, an investment in the Company of 100 at the end of 1999 would have been worth 554 at 31 December 2004, compared with 86 if the investment had been made in the FTSE All Share Index.
