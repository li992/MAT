Report on directors remuneration continued Salary Executive director salaries are reviewed annually on 1 July taking into account the total remuneration package at the time of the review.
External directorships Executive directors may, if so authorised by the Board, accept appointments as non-executive directors of suitable companies and organisations outside the Group.
Earnings arising from such external directorships are payable directly to the Company.
Performance bonus Executive directors are able to earn a performance bonus up to a maximum of 100% of basic annual salary prevailing at the date of the Remuneration Committee meeting to determine bonuses.
It is considered that such maximum performance bonus levels create an appropriate level of short term incentive, and align suitably with the performance bonus entitlements of other companies in the housebuilding sector as well as other publicly listed companies of a similar size to the Company.
The bonuses payable to executive directors have been determined by the Remuneration Committee by reference to challenging performance criteria including exceeding the previous years profit before taxation by a specified percentage and the achievement of other strategic targets.
The bonuses of the executive directors are paid from a bonus pool which is generated from increases in profits over the previous year.
All office based employees share in this bonus pool.
The rules governing the generation of the bonus pool remain consistent with prior years.
Site employees are incentivised through direct site bonus schemes based on measurable site performance.
The bonus pool remains at zero until profits before taxation and bonus charge increase over the prior year by 2% above the increase in the Retail Price Index RPI.
Thereafter, for every 1% increase in profits before taxation and bonus charge over the prior year, a value equal to 0.5% of the Groups profit before taxation and bonus charge is allocated to the bonus pool.
This applies until the increase in profits before taxation and bonus charge reaches 12% over the increase in RPI at which point the total value allocated to the bonus pool is capped.
At this maximum value the bonus pool will equal 5% of the Groups profit before taxation and bonus charge.
Bonus payments in aggregate are restricted to a maximum equal to the value allocated to the bonus pool.
The bonus pool is applied in settling individual employee bonuses subject to individual performance, corporate performance and set bonus caps.
Any surplus bonus pool remaining after settling employee bonuses reverts to the Group and is included in the profits for that financial year.
Executive directors have a bonus cap equal to 100% of basic salary.
In addition to the requirement for the bonus pool to have sufficient value to pay employee bonuses, the Remuneration Committee has established challenging performance criteria for executive directors to determine bonus levels.
For bonuses equal to 100% of basic salary to be considered for payment, specific financial criteria have to be met, including: achievement of an increase in Group profits before taxation and bonus of 12% over and above the increase in RPI: and achievement of return on average capital employed in excess of 20% for the year: and achievement of the Groups budgeted profit before taxation for the year.
Performance bonus payments in 2004 The bonuses paid to executive directors in 2004 were approved by the Remuneration Committee after considering the achievement or otherwise of the performance criteria set for the financial year 2003.
The actual performance compared to these specific financial performance criteria can be summarised: Criteria Performance criteria Actual performance Growth in Group profits before taxation and bonus 14.8% 12% RPI 16.8% Return on average capital employed 20.0% 25.5% The Group exceeded its budgeted pre tax profit for 2003.
Bovis Homes Group PLC Page 57 Report on directors remuneration continued Pension All the executive directors are senior executive members of the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme.
This is a contributory funded, defined benefit scheme approved by the Inland Revenue.
Pensionable earnings are basic pay.
As a result of joining the Company after the implementation of the 1989 earnings cap rules, Mr David Ritchie is subject to the statutory earnings cap.
During his period of office during 2004, Mr Stephen Brazier was also subject to the earnings cap.
Mr Malcolm Harris is not subject to the earnings cap.
Normal retirement age for senior executive members under the scheme is 60, and the accrual rate is 1 45th of final pensionable earnings for each year of service as a senior executive.
Share schemes The Company employs a standard set of performance conditions for all executive directors in respect of the Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme and the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan.
These performance conditions are described under specific headings in this report.
Granting of share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The performance conditions are designed to challenge and motivate executive directors to improve profitability and enhance shareholder return.
The conditions are designed to require strong collective and individual performance from the executive directors before options and awards vest, whilst at the same time offering a credible opportunity for success.
For share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan to vest an independent view provided by the Companys auditors, as independent experts, is required certifying achievement of the relevant performance conditions.
This independent view is evidenced by the completion of formal certificates signed by the auditors.
The performance conditions attaching to share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan are selected intentionally to be derived from readily available information which is straightforward and transparent.
This ensures that the auditors can make objective assessments of achievement against the performance conditions.
Although there exist outstanding share options granted to executive directors and senior management which remain unexercised at the date of this report, the Remuneration Committee has resolved, effective of 5 May 2004, to suspend the grant of future awards of share options.
The rules of the Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme relating to vesting and exercising outstanding share options remain unaltered.
Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme The Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme was established in 1997.
The Remuneration Committee suspended the issuing of new share options on 5 May 2004.
It is an Inland Revenue approved scheme and has historically granted share options on an approved basis within Inland Revenue limits and on an unapproved basis outside Inland Revenue limits.
The scheme is operated by the Remuneration Committee with participants selected at the sole discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
For outstanding share options, the performance criteria require that any share option held under the Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme can only normally be exercised if the auditors have certified that the cumulative increase in annualised earnings per share exceeds the percentage increase in RPI by at least 4% per annum 2% per annum for share options granted before 2001 over three consecutive years.
The exercise price of a share option has been determined by the Board at the date of grant and has not been less than the higher of the market value and nominal value of an Ordinary Share in the Company at the date of grant.
Assuming the performance criteria are satisfied, share options may, under normal circumstances, be exercised between the third and tenth anniversary from the date of grant.

uk Report on directors remuneration continued Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan A Long Term Incentive Plan for executive directors and senior executives was approved by shareholders at the 2000 Annual General Meeting and established on 10 May 2000.
An amendment to the rules of the Long Term Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders at the 2004 Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2004.
Under the amended rules of the scheme at the date of this report a participant may receive in respect of any year a maximum award of shares with a market value, when the award was made, not exceeding 100% of basic salary.
Each award is made subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria and awards may only be exercised at the end of three years.
There is no cost to the participants in the scheme to exercise the awards.
The extent to which the awards may be exercised is determined by two measures of performance: total shareholder return TSR and earnings per share EPS growth, each measured over a three year performance period and each relating to half of the shares awarded.
The TSR measure requires the comparison of the growth in the Companys TSR over a three year period to that of a group of comparator companies in the housebuilding industry specified by the Remuneration Committee at the start of the performance period.
TSR is the aggregate of share price growth and dividends paid during the three year period assuming that such dividends are reinvested in ordinary shares.
The Companys ranking amongst the comparator companies will determine the percentage of the shares under the award which will vest, as follows: TSR ranking % of total award which can be realised 1st position 50% of the shares in the award 2nd position 45% of the shares in the award 3rd position 37.5% of the shares in the award 4th position 30% of the shares in the award 5th position 20% of the shares in the award 6th position 15% of the shares in the award The group of comparator companies is as follows: Comparator companies Barratt Developments PLC Bellway p. l. c. The Berkeley Group plc Crest Nicholson PLC Persimmon plc Redrow Group plc Taylor Woodrow plc Westbury plc Wilson Bowden plc George Wimpey PLC The EPS growth measure is based on the extent to which the Companys average annual EPS growth over the three year performance period falls between minimum and maximum EPS growth targets set by the Remuneration Committee as follows: EPS growth % of total award which can be realised Maximum EPS growth 50% of the shares in the award Minimum EPS growth 20% of the shares in the award For the current outstanding awards, the minimum and maximum EPS growth targets are 4% and 10% above RPI respectively.
Where EPS growth falls between the minimum and maximum EPS growth targets, the number of shares which can be realised will be determined on a straight line sliding scale.
Where EPS growth falls below 4% above RPI, none of the shares in the award judged by reference to EPS growth can be realised.
The shares required to satisfy the awards have been purchased by the Bovis Homes Group Employee Trust.
The grant price of the awards is set as the market value of the shares at the date the shares are purchased by the Trustee.
The cost of these shares is amortised through the profit and loss account over the three year performance period.
The market value of the shares attributable to each director will be included in remuneration in the year in which the awards are exercised.
An award may only be exercised within six months of the realisation date, the realisation date being the date of notification from the Trustee of the Bovis Homes Group Employee Trust that the award is realisable in whole or in part.
Bovis Homes Group PLC Page 59 Report on directors remuneration continued Performance graph As required by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, the following table includes a performance graph comparing, over the last five financial years, the Total Shareholder Return of an ordinary share held in Bovis Homes Group PLC against the Total Shareholder Return of the FTSE Construction and Building Materials index.
This comparable index is appropriate given that the Remuneration Committee has considered an appropriate comparator group of companies for benchmarking performance.
This comparator group is currently made up of ten UK listed housebuilders, all of which are included in the FTSE Construction and Building Materials index.
The ordinary shares of Bovis Homes Group PLC are included within the FTSE Building Materials and Construction Index.
As such, the FTSE Construction and Building Materials Index is considered by the Remuneration Committee to be a representative comparator for Total Shareholder Return performance.

This guideline is expected to be applied until such time as the executive director holds shares with a market value equal to current basic annual salary.

In preparing those accounts, the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the accounts: and prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985.
