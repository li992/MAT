e. To agree Group-wide health and safety improvement targets on lost time from workplace accidents.
Collective targets are 15% reductions of lost working time incidents and rate by the end of 2005, compared with 2003. f. To develop baseline health and safety policies and procedures to minimise the impact on the business of occupational health and safety issues.
g. To conduct an environmental impact assessment programme during 2005 covering major production sites.
In addition to Group targets, our businesses set targets and undertake initiatives appropriate to their specific opportunities for improvement.
For example in the USA, National Electrical Carbon Products has a programme to replace its boiler incinerator which will improve efficiency and reduce consumption of natural gas.
Also in the USA, Technical Ceramics and Carbon have been focusing on reducing lost time incidents, whilst Crucibles have been working to minimise manual handling.
Further case studies and examples are included in the Groups EHS report covering 2004, which will be published on the Groups website.
Ethical trading Appropriate employees across the Group have completed anti-trust compliance training.
In addition, for those employees who received training during 2002 2003, annual independent audits have shown that such procedures have been strictly followed within those businesses.
In addition, the standard terms and conditions of purchase are being amended to ensure that major suppliers are aware of and agree to abide by Morgans own core values.
Community involvement The Groups substantial restructuring affected the extent of support to community projects in 2004, but Morgans commitment has remained unchanged, and as the business worldwide improves and grows, it is envisaged that community initiatives will increase.
During 2004, the Group continued to support and fund the joint Barnardos Outward Bound initiative in the UK, and has increased its financial commitment to the project so that more under-privileged children can benefit from the life-enhancing experience provided by Outward Bound.
Amongst initiatives at operating company level: In Thermal Ceramics, Murugappa MTC in India has taken an active supporting role in the anti-polio campaign, has been administering the vaccination programme for children under five and has undertaken the alteration and modification of the local primary Health Care facility.
Carbon in South Africa has been involved in holding education classes for adults within the community focusing upon improving reading and writing skills.
In Technical Ceramics, the Stourport UK facility continues to sponsor the local football team.
In the USA the Hudson facility provides volunteers for a number of activities for United Way, the national movement which helps local communities address their most critical issues.
Within Magnetics, a choir formed by employees at VAC in Hanau has given concerts during the year in support of local community care programmes.
In addition to the time given for charitable purposes by many Morgan employees throughout the world, in 2004 Morgan also provided 168,882 in charitable donations 2003: 113,562.
CSR verification The Board has considered the potential for external verification of the Groups CSR performance, but in 2004 has limited this to external professional advice on specific health and safety and environmental matters as required.
By Order of the Board David Coker Secretary 22 February 2005 24 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Corporate responsibility Remuneration report: Composition of the Remuneration Committee The present members of the Committee are Mr M Flower and Mr J MacHale, both of whom are independent, under the Chairmanship of Mr D Godwin who is the senior independent non-executive Director.
The biographies of the Committee members are listed on pages 16 and 17.
Sir Clive Whitmore, who was also the senior independent non-executive Director, was Chairman of the Committee throughout the year prior to his retirement on 31 December 2004.
Compliance The principles applied by the Remuneration Committee in forming their policy for 2004 were consistent with the best practice provisions of the Principles of Good Governance and Code of Best Practice issued by the Financial Services Authority the Combined Code and the Company has throughout the year under review complied with the provisions set out in The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and with the Listing Rules.
Policy on remuneration of executive Directors and senior executives a Total Level of Remuneration The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that remuneration packages offered are competitive and designed to attract, retain and motivate executive Directors and senior executives of the right calibre in order to run the Company successfully.
This approach is considered to be vital during the present climate of change through which the Group is progressing.
The Committee consults with the Chief Executive, the Director of Group Personnel and external remuneration consultants, which enables appropriate comparisons to be made.
The intention is to ensure rewards are linked to corporate and individual performance.
This policy takes account of the decentralised and differing nature of the Morgan businesses in addition to reflecting the technical challenges which the Company faces in a global market place.
Performance is assessed against the performance of the relevant global business in respect of the remuneration of senior Global Business Presidents and against the performance of the Group for the remainder of the Executive Committee.
b The Main Components The Committee has agreed that going forward greater emphasis should be placed on performance related reward policies with measurable targets.
These are designed to reduce the proportion of fixed remuneration and provide for a growing element of at risk pay, which is only available when good results are achieved.
In this way, there is a strong link between reward and performance which should be beneficial to shareholders, employees and the Company.
The targets are set on the basis of being challenging performance criteria reflecting the objectives of the Company.
The main components are: i Basic Salary Basic salary for each executive Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the performance of the individual and information taken from independent sources covering 330 of the FTSE 350 companies and some 2,000 directors on the rates of salary for similar jobs in a selected group of comparable companies.
The Committee relies on specific comparator information taken from a relevant Towers Perrin Executive pay review and also from the Incomes Data Services Directors Pay Reports.
A salary review for Directors and senior executives was carried out in July 2004. ii Annual Bonus The targets for annual bonus are set by the Remuneration Committee balancing the short-and long-term requirements.
Challenging goals are set, which must be met before any bonus is paid.
Significant stretch targets must be achieved before maximum bonus is paid.
A percentage of the bonus is related to the achievement of personal objectives.
The annual bonus is not pensionable.
For 2005, a scheme has been designed to reward the achievement of significantly stretched targets and foster the continued development of inter-divisional co-operation and collaboration.
It is focused upon achieving excellent performance in operating profit and operating cash flow.
It provides the opportunity of earning a bonus of up to 90% of basic salary, with 60% being provided through the operating profit performance and 30% deriving from operating cash flow.
Operating profit EBITA is defined as earnings before interest, tax and amortisation costs.
For these purposes, operating profit will exclude all exceptional costs e. g. restructuring costs, corporate disposals of businesses and property and significant one-off litigation costs relating to prior year and any major one-off non-operating charges e. g. special one-off pension contributions.
Operating cash is defined as the EBITA adjusted for depreciation charge non-cash item movements in working capital, provisions, capital expenditure, profit and loss on sale of plant and machinery, operating tax charges and net finance charges.
For these purposes operating cash flow will exclude any exceptional one-off cash costs as defined above plus, major one-off tax claims, dividends or any corporate cash flow such as Rights Issues or purchase of shares.
No bonus is payable until 90% of budget is achieved, which in 2005 will be a considerable stretch when compared with last years actual.
The mechanism for payment of up to 90% of basic salary will be based as follows: Operating profit % of basic salary payable 90% of Budget 12 110% of Budget 35 122% of Budget 60 Operating cash % of basic salary payable 90% of Budget 5 110% of Budget 15 122% of Budget 30 In addition up to 10% of salary is available for the achievement of personal objectives.
The same scheme is available to the members of the Executive Committee.
The Group Chief Executive has the opportunity to earn up to 100% of basic salary.
The above is considered to be appropriate because it will align executive reward with shareholder return.
25 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Remuneration report A similar scheme existed in 2004.
The mechanism for payment of the 2004 bonus was as follows: Operating profit % of basic salary 120% of 2003 actual 7.50 2004 budget 37.50 Free cash flow 3 x 2003 actual 2.50 2004 budget 12.50 As the budgets for 2004 were exceeded, the scheme for 2004 provided a payout of 50% of basic salary based on the sliding scale above plus a further 10% for achievement of personal objectives making a total of 60%.
The figures for the executive directors are shown in the table on page 28.
The bonus for Mr W Knowlton was 100%.
iii Share Schemes The Company believes that share ownership by the executive Directors and senior executives strengthens the link between their personal interests and those of the shareholders.
In 2003, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the operation of the existing long-term incentive plan and the Companys other share schemes in conjunction with remuneration advisers Inbucon Consulting.
As a result, at the AGM in 2004, shareholders approved the introduction of a new long-term incentive plan the 2004 LTIP and a new executive share option scheme the 2004 ESOS.
The Company also renewed its all-employee Sharesave Scheme and took the opportunity to extend a similar scheme to employees in Germany.
Participation in the 2004 LTIP is offered to the executive Directors and other key executives.
In 2004, awards were made to 59 employees around the world, including the executive Directors.
Participation in the 2004 ESOS is generally offered to other senior executives.
In 2004, options were granted to 113 employees around the world.
Mr M Robertshaw received grants under both plans shortly after joining the Company, as is common market practice.
The details are shown on page 28.
Awards under both the 2004 LTIP and the 2004 ESOS will vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, but only to the extent that the Companys total shareholder return TSR can be viewed favourably when compared with the TSR of a group of comparator companies.
For the grants made in 2004, the comparator group is the companies which made up the FTSE 350 Index at the date of grant.
If the Companys TSR over the three financial years 2004-2006 places it at the median of the comparator group, 30% of an award will vest and an award will only vest in full if the Companys TSR places it in the upper quartile of the comparator group.
In addition, awards will only vest if the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the Companys underlying financial performance over the period justifies vesting.
The Committee with the assistance of Inbucon, consulted with shareholder representatives to determine the criteria and much appreciate their advice.
Full details of all options in issue are shown on page 28.
The Committee have agreed to a request from Mr W D Knowlton that the options originally intended to be granted to him in January 2005 and January 2006 be put back into the available pool for other executives within the Group.
Those Directors who received options under the Company employee Sharesave scheme are shown in the table below.
No performance conditions apply to those options.
The Morgan General Employee Trust holds a total of 5,084,031 shares.
The Committee has sought advice from Inbucon on its share schemes and on the LTIP.
c Companies used for Comparison In assessing all aspects of pay and benefits, Morgan compares the packages offered by similar companies.
These companies are chosen having regard to: i the size of the company its turnover, profits and number of people employed: ii the diversity and complexity of its businesses: iii the geographical spread of its businesses: and iv its growth and expansion profile.
d Company Policy on Contracts of Service Mr W D Knowlton, who joined the Company in December 2002, was appointed Chief Executive Officer on 6 January 2003 and had a two-year notice period in his service contract which reduced to one year with effect from the AGM held in 2003.
Mr M Robertshaw was appointed Chief Financial Officer on 20 October 2004, and has a one-year notice period.
All executive Directors are now on a one-year notice period.
Morgan will apply the principle of mitigation to any payment of compensation on termination.
The following table shows details of the contracts currently in place for Directors who have served during the year: Name Date of Unexpired Notice Provision for contract term period compensation Mr W Knowlton 09.12.02 1 yr 5 mths 1 yr Notice period Mr M Robertshaw 01.10.04 23 yrs 2 mths 1 yr Notice period Mr N Young 08.04.02 resigned 1 yr See schedule of Directors benefits on page 28 e Company Pensions Policy regarding Executive Directors Morgans executive Directors, with the exception of Mr W Knowlton, participate in The Morgan Group Senior Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme which is a contributory, Inland Revenue approved, final salary, funded occupational pension scheme.
Its main features are: i a normal pension age of 60: ii pension at normal pension age of two thirds of final pensionable salary, subject to completion of 15 years service for those who commenced their employment with the Group on or before 17 March 1987 and 20 years in respect of post March 1987 employment: iii life assurance cover of four times basic salary: and 26 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Remuneration report iv dependants pension on death.
Pensionable salary is the members basic salary averaged over the three years prior to retirement.
All plan benefits are subject to Inland Revenue limits.
In addition, where an executive Directors benefits in the approved scheme are limited by the Earnings Cap imposed by the Finance Act 1989, the Director may participate in the Morgan Additional Retirement Scheme which is a non-contributory, Inland Revenue unapproved, defined contribution, occupational pension scheme.
This scheme provides a tax-free lump sum retirement benefit at a normal pension age of 60, derived from employer contributions based on the pensionable salary under the applied scheme.
However, as the scheme is unapproved by the Inland Revenue, employer contributions are treated as benefits-in-kind for income tax purposes.
The Director may also elect to receive life assurance cover of four times basic salary in excess of the Earnings Cap, the cost being deducted from the employer contribution.
Mr W Knowlton, who is not a member of the above schemes, receives a pension allowance derived from employer contributions based notionally on the approved scheme pensionable salary.
