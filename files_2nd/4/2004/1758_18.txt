The Committee is of the opinion that to give a full statement of directors share options and long-term incentive scheme interests would result in a statement of excessive length.
Therefore disclosure is in accordance with paragraph 9 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.
The companys register of directors interests which is open to inspection contains full details of directors shares interests.
Details of directors interests in the share option schemes and long-term incentive plans are shown in tables B, C and D. The figures in the tables that form part of this report have been calculated by reference to a mid-market price for the company's ordinary shares at 31 December 2004 of 230.5p 2003 168.25p.
Awards made under the rules of the Restricted Share Plan are not subject to performance conditions.
The aggregate net value of assets received by directors in 2004 from long-term incentive plans, as calculated at date of release from trust, was 250,729.
The mid market price for the company's ordinary shares at 31 December 2004 was 230.5p 2003 168.25p.
The performance conditions for the Executive Share Option Plan and the Performance Share Plan are as follows: Executive Share Option Plan The BAE Systems Executive Share Option Plan has been used to grant options to the executive directors since 2001.
The performance conditions applying to the grants of options made in 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 are the same as for grants to be made in 2005, as set out on page 45 of this report, with the exception of the re-testing provision: for grants made between 2001- 2003, where the original three year performance target is not met, performance is re-tested at the end of years four and five against the full period from grant: for grants made in 2004, where the original three year performance target is not met, performance is re-tested at the end of year five.
In all these cases the option will lapse in year five if the targets have not been achieved.
There will be no re-testing of performance for grants to be made in 2005.
Before 1996, and also on the completion of the BAE MES merger in 1999, options were granted to executive directors under the predecessor Executive Share Option Scheme.
Options granted in 1995 could only be exercised if growth in the pre-exceptional EPS for any three-year period exceeded the sum of inflation for that period and a real growth requirement of 7.5% was achieved.
Options granted to the former GEC directors in 1999 were made on a similar basis but the real growth requirement is 9% for any three-year period.
Options granted to the other executive directors in 1999 were conditional on the satisfaction of a special performance condition based on achievement of cost savings of the merger integration process over the three-year performance period commencing on 1 January 2000: 57.7% of these options became exercisable in 2004 and the remaining 42.3% lapsed.
Performance Share Plan Performance conditions for the awards made in 2003 and 2004 are the same as for awards to be made in 2005 as set out on page 45 of this report.

For UK-based directors the assumptions are the same as those used for the calculation of cash equivalents from the groups UK pension schemes.
In 2004, the actuary has changed the assumptions used to calculate cash equivalents from the UK pension schemes, subject to a minimum of the cash equivalent calculated on the statutory MFR basis.
This assumption change has, for the majority of the UK-based directors, resulted in a higher transfer value than that calculated using the assumptions in force at the start of the year.
The amount of the increase in change in transfer value arising from the change in assumptions is: Chris Geoghegan 452,530: Steve Mogford 437,109: George Rose 283,210: Mike Turner 29,631.
For directors with pensions in payment, the corresponding increase is Sir Richard Evans nil and Michael Lester 100,110.
This assumption change does not apply to Mark Ronald.
2 George Roses unapproved retirement arrangement is partly funded and partly unfunded.
The companys pension contribution to the funded unapproved retirement arrangement for George Rose in 2004 was 515,089 2003 1,237,697.
Of this amount, approximately 339,000 2003 331,000 relates to the cost of benefits accruing during the year and approximately 176,000 2003 172,000 relates to dealing with investment under-performance prior to 2003.
In 2003, the company decided to deal with the under-performance of the underlying investments over a three-year period, 2003-2005: the third of these three payments is due to be made in 2005.
This treatment reflects company policy for employees with unapproved arrangements in the same position.
The 2003 contribution also included a one-off payment of approximately 735,000 to cover a change in actuarial basis underlying the calculations: the revised basis is consistent with the funding basis used for the approved pension schemes with adjustments to take account of the different tax treatment.
