Report on directors remuneration This report has been prepared in accordance with the directors remuneration report regulations 2002 the Regulations, which introduced new statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors remuneration.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Companys members on the audited information within the directors remuneration report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
As a result, the report has been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
This report sets out the Companys policy on directors remuneration for the forthcoming year and, so far as practicable, for subsequent years as well as information on remuneration paid to directors in the financial year.
Unaudited information Membership and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee comprises three independent non-executive directors, Tony Illsley, the Chairman, Colin Day and Dawn Airey.
During the year, Nick Hartley also sat on the Committee.
During the financial year, the Committee has met five times, in addition to meetings to allot shares under the Companys share option schemes.
The Committee has responsibility for making recommendations to the Board on the compensation of senior executives and determining, within agreed terms of reference, the specific remuneration packages for each of the executive directors.
The Board has delegated to the Remuneration Committee responsibility to: l Make recommendations to the Board in respect of the remuneration policy for executive directors and the Groups other senior management: l Approve any new service agreement entered into between the Group and any executive director: and l Make recommendations to the Board on the implementation of the Groups performance bonus scheme, share option schemes and the Management Combination Incentive Plan.
The Company appointed and the Committee took advice from KPMG in respect of the operation of the easyJet Management Combination Incentive Plan.
KPMG are also the Company auditors.
The Company appointed and the Committee took advice from the Monks Partnership in determining executive remuneration during the year.
The Committee has appointed New Bridge Street Consultants, LLP as remuneration advisers with effect from 30 June 2004.
Apart from advice regarding the design, establishment and operation of remuneration arrangements, New Bridge Street Consultants provides no other services to the Company.
The Committees terms of reference, together with an explanation of New Bridge Street Consultants connection with the Company, will be available on the Companys website www.

Policy The objective of the Committees remuneration policy is to reward the Companys executives competitively having regard to the comparative marketplace in order to ensure that they are properly motivated to perform in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
The Company aims to provide competitive Total pay for on target performance, with superior awards for exceptional performance.
The remuneration package provides an appropriate balance of short and long-term rewards consisting of: l Market mid-level base salaries l Material annual bonus opportunity for high performance against stretching performance targets l Competitive levels of long-term incentives which deliver rewards if stretching performance targets are met l Lean benefits provision.
easyJet has a no frills approach and does not include, for example, company cars, final salary pensions or private medical insurance as part of the package.
Service contracts The Company has service contracts with all its executive directors of no fixed term.
It is Company policy that, for executive directors, such contracts should contain notice periods of not more than six months.
There is no provision for compensation for loss of office other than the notice period of six months.
In the event of such Annual report and accounts 2004 43 Report on directors remuneration continued termination, when determining the amount of compensation that is paid, the Committee will take into account the departing directors duty to mitigate his loss.
The Committee believes that this approach provides an appropriate balance between the interests of the Company and the executives, and also reflects best practice.
Non-executive directors do not have service contracts but are appointed for a period not exceeding three years.
Their appointment may be terminated without compensation.
Details of contracts currently in place for directors who have served during the year are as follows: Provision for Date of contract Unexpired term Notice period compensation Non-executive Sir Colin Chandler 26 February 2004 2 years 3 months 3 year fixed term None Amir Eilon 22 October 2003 2 years 3 year fixed term None Dawn Airey 5 April 2004 2 years 5 months 3 year fixed term None Anthony Illsley 22 October 2003 1 year 10 months 3 year fixed term None Colin Day 22 October 2003 1 year 10 months 3 year fixed term None Diederik Karsten 11 May 2004 2 years 6 months 3 year fixed term None Executive Ray Webster 18 June 2002 n a 6 months 6 months Chris Walton 18 June 2002 n a 6 months 6 months Copies of all the service contracts for both executive and non-executive directors will be available within the investor relations section of the easyJet website, www.
Remuneration packages The remuneration packages of the executive directors comprise a combination of basic salary, annual bonus, pension contributions and participation in long-term incentive schemes.
The Committee has concluded that performance related elements form a significant proportion of the remuneration of the executive directors.
Full details of the executive directors remuneration are set out on page 46 below for their remuneration and page 48 below for their share options.
In addition, the Committee has, with the assistance of New Bridge Street Consultants, recently carried out a review of all aspects of remuneration of its senior executives, with particular emphasis on long-term incentive provision.
The main conclusion of this review was that the Executive Share Option Schemes should, in the future, cease to be the sole share-based long-term incentive arrangement for these senior executives.
Instead, the Committee believes that a new Long Term Incentive Plan should be established, further details of which are set out below and in the Notice of Annual General Meeting AGM.
The Company is also looking to extend share ownership throughout the Company by commencing operation of its Share Incentive Plan the establishment of which has been previously authorised and the introduction of a new Save As You Earn Plan further details of which are also set out in the Notice of AGM.
The Board as a whole determines the remuneration of the Companys non-executive directors with non-executive directors exempting themselves from voting as appropriate.
When determining the remuneration of non-executive directors, account is taken of practice adopted in other similar organisations.
Basic salary Salaries are reviewed annually for directors and are considered in light of: independent market comparisons against similar positions, Retail Price Index movements and a formal appraisal of their contribution to the business.
Salary increases for Ray Webster and Chris Walton in October 2003 reflected the increase in Company size since last formal review and the competitive environment, where senior executives from easyJet were potential targets for other low cost start-ups and other companies in the airline sector.
Pension contributions The Group pays into a defined contribution pension scheme for executive directors at 7% of their base salaries.
Executive directors are in the same pension plan as all eligible UK staff.
44 Annual report and accounts 2004 Annual bonus scheme An annual bonus scheme exists for all executive directors.
The annual bonus opportunity of the Chief Executive and other senior executives of 200% and 100% of salary respectively remains unchanged.
Annual bonuses are subject to achieving very demanding financial profit before tax and personal performance targets.
These elements are felt to be challenging, aligned to shareholder interests and appropriate.
Actual payments reported reflect performance in 2003 and represent 30% of basic salary for Ray Webster and 9% for Chris Walton.
Long Term Incentive Plans Share-based long-term incentives are currently provided to executive directors and other staff members under an Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS.
Under the ESOS, options over shares worth up to one times remuneration may be granted each year.
Options vest subject to a sliding scale of real EPS growth targets that are measured over the three-year period following grant.
As set out above, shareholder approval is being sought at the forthcoming AGM for the establishment of a new Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, which it is intended will become the main share-based incentive arrangement for senior executives.
The ESOS will be retained for flexibility following the establishment of the LTIP, although it is the Committees current intention that, following the establishment of the new LTIP, further grants under the ESOS will only be made in exceptional circumstances.
The main features of the new LTIP arrangements are set out in the appendix to the shareholder circulars attached and are deemed to be included in this annual report.
The option grants that it is intended to be made in this financial year will be subject to a performance condition that requires the Companys diluted normalised EPS being that before goodwill and exceptional items to grow between RPI plus 5% and 20% p. a. over the three-year period following grant.
30% of options become exercisable for achieving the lower EPS growth hurdle, with straight-line vesting up to the higher EPS growth hurdle where options become exercisable in full.
Total shareholder return The following graphs show the Companys performance, measured by total shareholder return, compared with the performance of the FTSE Mid 250 and the European Airlines & Airports indices.
The FTSE 250 index has been chosen since it is an index of companies of similar size to easyJet and the European Airlines and Airports index as it comprises companies in a similar sector.
The total shareholder return index has been set to 100 as at 14 November 2000.
Any fees received in respect of these appointments are retained directly by the relevant executive director.
