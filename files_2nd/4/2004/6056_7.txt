25 Directors remuneration report This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations.
It also meets the requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the main and supporting principles of the revised Combined Code on Corporate Governance the new Code relating to Directors remuneration.
The Company complies with all of the provisions of section 1 of the new Code, except as may be explained below.
A resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the Companys Annual General Meeting to be held on 8 July 2004.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Companys members on the auditable part of the Directors remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
This report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee is chaired by Jim Forbes.
The other current members of the Committee are David Dunn and John Sievwright.
The Board considers each of the members of the Committee to be independent in accordance with the definition in the new Code.
None of the members of the Committee has any personal financial interest other than as a shareholder in the matters to be decided, conflict of interest arising from cross-directorships or any involvement in the day-to-day running of the business.
They do not hold any share options nor do they participate in any Group share or pension schemes.
Martyn Williams, the Non-Executive Employee Director, was a member of the Committee until 3 July 2003, when he stepped down.
He retains the right to attend meetings of the Committee, at the request of the Committee Chairman, and may address Committee meetings.
The Committee considers it especially important that employees views are taken into consideration, in particular when the remuneration of the Executive Directors is determined.
The Board reviewed the remit of the Committee during the year in light of the new Code and adopted revised written terms of reference in March 2004, which are available on request and are published on the Companys website.
The revised terms of reference did not introduce significant changes but clarified and set out more fully the existing responsibilities of the Committee.
The Committee generally meets at least once a year and also as required to consider matters related to the remuneration of Executive Directors and senior management below Board level.
In the year under review, it met six times and all its members attended each meeting.
In determining the Executive Directors remuneration for the year, the Committee considered publicly available information, including the remuneration packages of those holding equivalent posts at the Companys peers within the transport industry and the FTSE 250 generally.
In addition, the Committee has also received advice in relation to certain specific remuneration and pension-related matters from Watson Wyatt, a firm of independent remuneration consultants.
Watson Wyatt also provided advice to the Company during the year on remuneration and pension-related matters in respect of staff below main Board level.
Remuneration policy Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain individuals of the high calibre needed to maintain the Groups position as a leader in the public transportation sector.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors and senior management, namely basic salary, annual cash and deferred share bonus, share option incentives and pension arrangements.
The remuneration package for each Executive Director is viewed as a whole and the individual elements making up the package are balanced to ensure that overall, the remuneration received by an executive is not excessive, is competitive with the remuneration received by the individuals equivalents in other similar quoted companies, contains an appropriate balance of fixed and variable performance-related compensation and provides longer-term share incentives designed to align his interests with those of shareholders.
A high proportion of the total remuneration package is performance-related.
The Committee intends to review the total remuneration packages for Executive Directors in the 2004 05 financial year with a view to applying any new arrangements with effect from the beginning of the 2005 06 financial year.
Major shareholders will be consulted in advance of any material change in remuneration policy which results from this review.
Basic salary and other benefits in kind The basic salary and benefits in kind for each Executive Director are determined by the Committee prior to the beginning of each financial year and when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a whole and also the packages received by similar individuals at the Companys peers in the public transport sector and the FTSE 250.
Details of the salaries and benefits in kind paid to each of the Executive Directors in the year are shown on page 28.
26 Directors remuneration report continued FirstGroup plc Executive Annual Bonus Plan Payment of bonuses under this plan is linked to achievement of budgeted Group operating profit targets and personal objectives including certain safety-linked targets.
Where an Executive Director also has responsibility for one or more operating division, payment of a proportion of the bonus is also linked to the profitability of those divisions.
The Committee considers and agrees the Group and divisional objectives that must be met for each financial year for a bonus to become payable.
The personal objectives for the Executive Directors are agreed with the Chief Executive.
Bonus payments comprise a mixture of cash and deferred share awards.
Share awards are deferred for three years and will lapse if the Director leaves the Group during that period for reasons other than redundancy, retirement or ill-health.
The Committee considers that it is appropriate for part of the annual bonus to be paid in the form of deferred shares as this more closely aligns Directors interests with those of shareholders and provides an incentive for the relevant executive to remain with the Group.
As the award of any bonus is already dependent upon the achievement of performance targets in a particular year, the Committee does not consider it appropriate to impose any further performance criteria on vesting of the deferred share element of any bonus award other than that the relevant Executive Director remains employed by the Group and has not tendered his resignation at the end of that three-year period.
The Board sets yearly budget targets for the Group as a whole and for each business unit within the Group.
These targets are, of necessity, extremely challenging.
The Committee has determined that bonuses would be payable for Group performance against budget between 90% and 110%.
The level of bonus payable is heavily skewed towards performance in excess of 100% of budget.
However, even if the budgetary targets are met, a proportion of the bonus which would otherwise be payable is dependent on personal performance.
The maximum level of bonus payable to an Executive Director is 80% of basic salary, although awards for the year ended 31 March 2004 were calculated at a lower percentage for each Executive Director, between 61.0% and 67.9%.
The Committee has determined that awards for the 2004 05 financial year should be calculated on the same basis.
As mentioned above, during the 2004 05 financial year, the Committee intends to undertake a complete review of executive remuneration packages, including the existing bonus scheme.
Going forward, the Committee will review on a yearly basis what bonus arrangements, including performance criteria, are appropriate for future years.
Share Option Schemes Executive Share Option Scheme The Company operates an Executive Share Option Scheme for Executive Directors and other senior management.
Under this scheme, options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company may be awarded at the discretion of the Committee at levels of up to 200% of basic salary.
The exercise price of the options granted under the scheme is based on the average of the middle market quotations for shares in the Company for the three dealing days prior to the date of grant.
For grants made in 2001 02, 2002 03 and 2003 04, options will be exercisable if the growth in the Companys annualised earnings per share EPS for the three-year period following the financial year ending before the date of grant exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index RPI over the same period by an average of at least 3% per annum.
If at the end of the three-year period the performance target has not been met, EPS growth will be measured over an additional year and must show an average growth of 3% in excess of RPI over the full four year period.
Grants for the 2003 04 financial year were set at 1.33 times basic salary for Moir Lockhead and 1 times salary for other Executive Directors.
The Committee has agreed that the following performance targets should apply for option grants made in the 2004 05 financial year.
Both targets must be met for options to vest and be exercisable.
Options will be exercisable if the growth in the Companys annualised EPS for the three-year period following the financial year ending before the date of grant exceeds the growth in the RPI over the same period by an average of at least 2% per annum.
In addition, for the maximum number of options granted to vest, the Companys total shareholder return TSR over the three-year performance period must be such to place the performance relative to the returns earned by the companies in the top 25% of companies in a group of the Companys listed transport peers.
Performance between the 25th and 50th percentile of that group will result in a proportion of the options vesting in accordance with a sliding scale.
Options will lapse if the Companys TSR performance would place the Company below the 50th percentile of that group.
Grants for the 2004 05 financial year will be set at 1.33 times basic salary for Moir Lockhead and 1 times salary for other Executive Directors.
If the performance targets are met, an option may be exercised at any time during the rest of its ten-year life, without any further condition.
If the holder leaves the Group before the end of the performance period by reason of injury, ill-health, disability, redundancy or retirement, an option may be exercised within 12 months if the performance target has been satisfied at the date of such cessation.
Early exercise of options may also be permitted within specific periods in the event of a change of control of the Company resulting from a takeover, reconstruction, amalgamation or voluntary winding-up of the Company but only to the extent that any performance targets have then been achieved on a pro rata basis.
The executive remuneration review to be carried out by the Committee in the 2004 05 financial year will include a review of the current share option scheme, in particular as to whether it continues to support the Companys aim of attracting and retaining key individuals in 27 the face of competition for talented and effective staff, whilst continuing to align the interests of the individuals concerned with the longerterm interests of shareholders.
In future, the Committee will continue to focus on this objective when determining what share-related remuneration should be offered within the overall remuneration package.
The Company no longer operates any long-term incentive schemes other than the share option schemes described in this report.
Save As You Earn SAYE Scheme The Company also operates a SAYE Scheme for eligible employees under which options may be granted on an annual basis at a discount of up to 20% of market value.
The Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the SAYE Scheme.
Buy As You Earn BAYE Scheme The Company operates a Share Incentive Plan under the title Buy as You Earn.
This scheme, which is open to all UK employees of the Group including the Executive Directors, enables employees to purchase partnership shares from their gross income before income tax and National Insurance deductions.
The Company initially provided one matching share for every two partnership shares bought by employees, subject to a maximum Company contribution of shares to the value of 15 a month.
With effect from February 2004, the matching share ratio was increased to two matching shares for every three partnership shares, subject to a maximum Company contribution of shares to the value of 20 a month.
The shares are held in trust for up to five years, in which case no income tax and National Insurance will be payable.
The matching shares will be forfeited if the corresponding partnership shares are removed from trust within three years of award.
Retirement benefits Executive Directors are members of a number of defined benefit Group pension schemes.
Their dependants are eligible for dependants pensions and the payment of a lump sum in the event of death in service.
Further details are set out on page 30.
Service contracts It is the Companys policy to restrict notice periods for Executive Directors to a maximum of 12 months.
In line with this policy, all of the Executive Directors have service contracts with an undefined term but which provide for a notice period of 12 months.
The contracts contain a provision, exercisable at the discretion of the Company, to pay an amount in lieu of notice on early termination of the contract.
Such payments are limited to one years basic salary.
There are no contractual provisions governing payment of compensation on early termination of the contracts.
If it becomes necessary to consider early termination of a service contract, the Company will have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including mitigation, when determining any compensation to be paid.
Details of the Executive Directors contracts are set out below: Date of Service Contract Moir Lockhead 5 March 2001 Dean Finch 24 January 2002 Iain Lanaghan 29 November 2002 Mike Mitchell 2 July 1997 Where Board approval is given for an Executive Director to accept an outside non-executive directorship, unless the appointment is in connection with Group business, the individual Director is entitled to retain any fees received.
Non-Executive Directors All Non-Executive Directors have a letter of appointment and their fees are determined by the Board based on surveys of fees paid to Non-Executive directors of comparable companies.
These letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Companys registered office during normal business hours and will be made available at the Annual General Meeting.
Non-Executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Companys share option schemes and are not eligible to join the Companys pension scheme.
Each of the Non-Executive Directors, other than Martyn Williams, has elected to receive 40% of his fees in the form of shares in order to ensure that their interests are more closely aligned to those of the Companys shareholders.
The shares are purchased on a monthly basis in the market.
The appointment of each of the Non-Executive Directors is subject to early termination without compensation if he is not reappointed at a meeting of shareholders when he is up for re-election.
