Salaries have been averaged over three years where necessary in order to compare with Inland Revenue regulations.
The increase in accrued pension excludes any increase for inflation.
2 The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries Guidance Note GN11.
No director elected to pay additional voluntary contributions.
The transfer values disclosed above do not represent a sum paid or payable to the individual director.
Instead they represent a potential liability of the pension scheme.

In accordance with the standard Rules of the Scheme he received an immediate pension based on his accrued benefit without actuarial reduction or any enhancement.

The 2004 figure reflects an additional year of service, an updated pensionable salary, changes in annuity values and immediate payment.
