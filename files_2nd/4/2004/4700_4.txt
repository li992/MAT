66 Diageo Annual Report 2004  report Dear shareholder During recent months the remuneration committee of Diageo plc has conducted a review of the remuneration policy for our senior executives.
During this review we have taken note of the comments made by shareholders prior to our last AGM.
As a result of this review we are proposing to make some changes.
These changes, which are outlined in this letter, are intended to ensure that we continue, within a framework of good corporate governance, to be able to attract and retain the best global talent to ensure we deliver Diageos strategy.
We trust that these changes will receive your support at our Annual General Meeting in October 2004.
Summary of changes The main changes are to rebalance total remuneration away from short term and towards long term performance-related incentives, as follows: Annual cash bonuses will be capped at no more than 200% of base salary per annum.
This is a reduction in our previous maximum annual bonus.
We will be seeking shareholder approval to increase the maximum level of annual awards under our long term performance-related share plan the TSR plan to 250% of base salary in order to allow us to continue to compete for top global talent.
This is an increase from the current maximum award of 150% of base salary.
We have changed the comparator group against which we will measure total shareholder return performance for future awards in order to better reflect the current product and geographic mix of Diageos business.
The ability to retest the earnings per share performance condition under our senior executive share option plan will be removed for future grants of share options.
Notice periods in the senior executive contracts will remain 12 months and the mitigation of payments on termination is under review.
Summary remuneration policy Our revised remuneration policy will be as follows: Our senior executive remuneration arrangements are intended to attract and retain the best global talent.
We believe that pay should vary significantly with performance over both the short and long term.
Our base salaries are set at the median of the relevant market for each role.
Annual bonuses are paid in cash after the end of each financial year and are determined by performance in the year against pre-set stretching business targets.
Our long term incentives comprise a combination of share option grants and share awards in each year, and vary with three year EPS and TSR performance respectively.
Our senior executives are required to hold shares in Diageo to participate fully in our share option and share award plans.
Detailed changes Annual bonuses Before the start of each financial year and in light of the strategic plan for that year, the remuneration committee will determine annual performance targets.
One of these targets will be profit performance and the other measure may vary from year to year, depending upon the particular area of focus for the business.
The effect of foreign exchange movements will be eliminated in assessing the performance delivered.
The bonus payable for on target performance will be 100% of base salary and the maximum bonus payable will be 200% of base salary.
This is a reduction from the current levels.
Senior executive share option plan SESOP Currently, under our share option plan, options vest on a sliding scale depending upon our earnings per share performance after grant, as follows: If EPS growth exceeds RPI growth by less than 12 percentage points over three years then none of the options can be exercised.
If EPS growth is at least 12 percentage points greater than that of RPI, but less than 15 percentage points, then one half of the options may be exercised.
If EPS growth exceeds RPI growth by 15 percentage points or more over three years then all of the options may be exercised.
We intend to cancel the ability to retest whether the performance criterion has been met for future grants of options.
The performance criterion itself will remain unchanged as it continues to provide a challenging level of performance expectation in the current economic environment.
67 Diageo Annual Report 2004  report Share awards under the TSR plan Under this plan, senior executives are granted a conditional right to receive shares.
The shares vest on a sliding scale depending on the total shareholder return performance of Diageo plc over a three year period relative to a peer group of companies.
We will be seeking shareholder approval at our AGM to increase the maximum level of conditional share awards that may be made in any one year to 250% of base salary.
The current maximum is 150% of base salary.
We should emphasise that these conditional awards of shares only vest if challenging performance conditions are met.
At least median TSR performance against our peer group must be achieved before any shares vest.
Maximum vesting of 150% of the shares only occurs if we are placed in first or second position against a peer group of 17 other relevant comparators.
The vesting profile is as follows: Relative TSR performance Above upper quartile Upper quartile to median Median Below median Ranking in peer group 1-23456789 10-18 % of award released 150 142 114 94 83 72 61 50 Nil For example, if a conditional award is made at the new maximum level of 250% of salary and if Diageo achieves a median ranking of position 9, 50% of the shares will be released, i. e. 125% of salary.
This can be illustrated graphically: TSR Plan vesting levels 160 140 120 100% is value of initial award 100 80 60 40 20 0 18th 17th 16th 15th 14th 13th 12th 11th 10th 9th 8th 7th 6th 5th 4th 3rd 2nd 1st Ranking in Peer Group In setting this level of award the remuneration committee has considered the total remuneration packages paid in the top 30 companies in the FTSE100 by market capitalisation, excluding those in the financial services sector.
We believe it is appropriate to position remuneration in Diageo between the median and upper quartile of this group, given the size and complexity of Diageos business globally.
TSR plan comparator group We have also reviewed the relevance of the comparator companies against which we measure the TSR performance of Diageo.
Following the re-shaping of our business, we intend to amend the comparator group, introducing more drinks companies and removing some smaller food companies, as follows: Companies removed: Allied Domecq Colgate-Palmolive PepsiCo Altria formerly Philip Morris Anheuser-Busch Gillette Pernod Ricard new Campbell Soup Brown-Forman new Heineken Procter & Gamble Kelloggs Cadbury Schweppes new Heinz SABMiller new McDonalds Carlsberg Interbrew new Unilever Yum!
Brands formerly Tricon Coca-Cola Nestl TSR plan measurement period Currently TSR performance is measured over the calendar year.
We will align the measurement period with our financial year by making a half sized award in February 2005 with the performance period for this award running from January 2005 to December 2007, and then resuming full sized awards from July 2005 with the performance period running from July 2005 to June 2008.
Executive contracts We have noted the recent shift in corporate governance sentiment amongst UK institutional shareholders.
Our contracts currently provide for a rolling 12 month notice period.
Terms of executive contracts and the mitigation of compensation payable on termination are under review.
Lord Hollick of Notting Hill Non-executive director % of shares released 68 Diageo Annual Report 2004  report What this report covers This report to shareholders for the year ended 30 June 2004 covers: the policy under which executive and non-executive directors were remunerated: and tables of information showing details of the remuneration and share interests of all the directors.

As required by The  Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations, this report will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the Annual General Meeting.
The board has followed and complied with section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued in 1998 and the Regulations in preparing this report and in designing performance-related remuneration for senior executives.
KPMG Audit Plc have audited the report to the extent required by the Regulations, being the sections headed  for the year ended 30 June 2004, Long term incentive plansand Executive directorspension benefits.
The remuneration committee The remuneration committee is responsible for making recommendations to the board on remuneration policy as applied to Diageos senior executives, being the executive directors and the executive committee.
It consists wholly of independent non-executive directors: RF Chase, Lord Hollick, M Lilja, JK Oates, WS Shanahan, HT Stitzer from 23 June 2004, JR Symonds from 1 May 2004 and PA Walker.
The chairman and the chief executive may, by invitation, attend remuneration committee meetings, except when their own remuneration is discussed.
No director is involved in determining his or her own remuneration.
The committee met five times during the year.
The meetings were fully attended, except that M Lilja, WS Shanahan and PA Walker were each unable to attend one meeting.
The committee reviewed its own effectiveness through a self-assessment in December.
The committees terms of reference are available at www.
com and on request from the company secretary.
Advice During the year ended 30 June 2004, Diageos human resources director and director of performance and reward were invited by the remuneration committee to provide their views and advice.
The remuneration committee also appointed the following independent and expert consultants: Deloitte & Touche LLP who provided external market data on levels of senior executive remuneration.
They also provide accountancy and tax services to Diageo, including services to support the process for assessing risk management and control systems and processes.

They provided no other services to Diageo during the year.
Additional remuneration survey data published by Monks Partnership, Mercer Human Resource Consulting and Towers Perrin was presented to the committee.
Remuneration philosophy Diageos remuneration philosophy for senior executives is based on a belief in: performance-related compensation.
It influences and supports performance and the creation of a high performing organisation: rewarding sustainable performance.
It is at the heart of Diageos corporate strategy and is vital to meeting investorsgoals: measuring performance over three years.
It aligns with the time cycle over which management decisions are reflected in the creation of value in this business: a mix of base salary, cash incentives, options and shares.
It provides a balanced portfolio of incentives and rewards: paying competitive total remuneration.
It helps Diageo compete for the best talent among companies with global operations and global consumers: simplicity and transparency.
The board of directors continues to set stretching performance targets for the business and its leaders in the context of the prevailing economic climate.
To achieve these stretch targets requires exceptional business management and strategic execution to deliver performance well above sectoral norms.
This approach to target setting reflects the aspirational performance environment which Diageo wishes to create.
In Diageo, annual incentive plans aim to reward good performance with commensurate levels of remuneration.
Long term incentive plans aim to reward long term sustained performance.
Under both sets of plans, if stretch targets are achieved, high levels of reward may be earned.
All incentives are capped to ensure that inappropriate business risk taking is neither encouraged nor rewarded.

The remuneration policy delivers a mix of fixed and variable, cash and share based, short and long term performance-related remuneration.
Broadly, if the incentive plan performance targets are achieved, for every 100 of remuneration earned, 29 is fixed and 71 is performancerelated.
29 of the performance-related remuneration is based on annual performance and the remainder on at least three year performance.
Sustained achievement of stretch performance targets can result in the incentive plans paying out at the maximum level, and delivering an additional 68 of remuneration.
Share ownership Senior executives are required to hold shares in Diageo to participate fully in the share option and share award plans.
This policy extends to the top 100 senior leaders and reflects Diageos belief that its most senior leaders should also be shareholders.
The executive directors were required to hold shares equivalent to 150% of their basic salary by 1 January 2003, rising to 225% by 1 January 2005.
The senior executives are eligible to participate in the broad-based share and option plans Diageo operates for its employees.
These are the tax approved share incentive plan and savings related share option scheme in the United Kingdom and the share value plan in the United States.

72 Diageo Annual Report 2004  report Long term incentive plans TSR plan Under this plan, participants are granted a conditional right to receive shares.
The rights are currently awarded with effect from 1 January each year, and vest after a three year period the performance cycle subject to achievement of two performance tests.
The primary performance test is a comparison of Diageos three year total shareholder return the percentage growth in Diageos share price assuming all dividends and capital distributions are reinvested with the TSR of a peer group of 17 other companies.
For all current performance cycles, the peer group consists of Diageo and Allied Domecq, Altria formerly Philip Morris, Anheuser-Busch, Campbell Soup, Carlsberg, Coca-Cola, Colgate-Palmolive, Gillette, Heineken, Heinz, Kelloggs, McDonalds, Nestl, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble, Yum!
Brands formerly Tricon and Unilever.
In addition, the remuneration committee will not recommend the release of awards if it considers that there has not been an underlying improvement in Diageos three year financial performance, typically measured by improvements in earnings per share.
The number of shares conditionally awarded to executive directors for the January 2004 December 2006 performance cycle was equivalent to 150% of their base salaries.
TSR calculations for the performance cycle January 2001 December 2003 were made in local currencies: calculations for all cycles commencing on or after January 2002 are converted to a common currency US dollars.
The following table shows the percentage of each award that will normally be released at the end of the performance cycle: Ranking in peer group 1-23456789 10-18 % of award released 150 142 114 94 83 72 61 50 nil Changes to the peer group and to the timing of the TSR measurement period for future awards are set out in the letter from Lord Hollick prefacing this report.
Directors interests in TSR plan awards The following table shows the directorsinterests in the TSR plan.
Details of executive share options are shown separately below.
Only half this number of shares would be released for achieving position nine in the peer group and no shares would be released for achieving a position of 10 or below.
b This number reflects that 1.5 times the number of shares initially awarded would be released for achieving position one or two in the peer group.
c The market price on 20 February 2004, the award date, was 728 pence.
d The three year performance cycle for the 2001 TSR award ended on 31 December 2003.
Diageos EPS over the performance cycle exceeded the rise in the RPI.
The remuneration committee determined this represented an underlying improvement in financial performance which permitted release of the awards.
The number of shares released was 72% of the initial target award based on a ranking at position seven in the peer group at the end of the performance cycle.
This ranking was independently confirmed by Kepler Associates.
e The market price on 23 February 2004, the release date.
The market price when the award was made on 23 February 2001 was 698 pence.
f The directorsinterests at 16 August 2004 are the same as at 30 June 2004. g The period over which the TSR performance is measured.
The remuneration committee will normally approve the release of awards in the February following the end of the performance cycle.
73 Diageo Annual Report 2004  report Senior executive share option plan SESOP Options granted under SESOP cannot normally be exercised unless a performance condition is satisfied.
The current performance condition is based on the increase in Diageos basic earnings per share before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items EPS and is initially applied over a three year period.
If the increase in EPS is at least 15 percentage points greater than the increase in the RPI over the same period, then all the options can be exercised.
If the EPS increase is at least 12 percentage points greater than that of the RPI but less than 15 percentage points, half of the options can be exercised.
If all or half of the options fail the initial performance condition, the three year assessment period will be rolled forward by a year and a retest carried out at that time.
However, the performance condition can only be rolled forward a maximum of three times.
There will be no retest of the performance condition for any options granted from October 2004 onwards.
The following table shows, for the directors who held office during the year, the number of options held under all executive share option schemes and savings-related schemes.
US options were granted over ADSs at dollar prices one ADS is equivalent to four ordinary shares : the option holdings and prices in the table are stated as ordinary share equivalents in pence.
The mid-market price of the ordinary shares at 30 June 2004 was 744 pence 30 June 2003 647 pence: 16 August 2004 657.5 pence.
The highest mid-market price during the year was 780 pence and the lowest mid-market price was 625 pence.
Exercisableoptions are those that have vested and can be exercised in the option period:not exercisableare those options where the minimum holding period is not completed or the performance conditions have not yet been met.
The option period starts from the earliest month in which the options may be exercised and ends with the month in which the last options lapse.
Growth in Diageos EPS before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items EPS, after adjusting to exclude Burger King and one-off restructuring costs, over the three years ended 30 June 2004 was 25.1% compared with an RPI increase over the same period of 7.1%.
This exceeded the performance condition RPI plus 15 percentage points and these options will become exercisable in full in September 2004. b Options granted under the savings related share option scheme.
c On 14 November 2003, PS Walsh exercised US options over 20,000 ordinary shares at an option price of 436 pence.
The market price at the date of exercise was 767 pence.
On 19 December 2003, PS Walsh exercised US options over a further 20,000 ordinary shares at an option price of 416 pence.
The market price at the date of exercise was 702 pence.
74 Diageo Annual Report 2004  report Pre-merger long term incentive plans Diageos current incentive plans have replaced the previous incentive arrangements within GrandMet and Guinness, which were approved by their respective shareholders and were described in previous annual reports.
Whilst awards and options granted under some of these plans none of which are performance-related continue to be held and exercised by Diageo executives, no further grants will be made under them.
Under various GrandMet and Guinness plans, executives were granted market value share options generally exercisable between a minimum of three or five years, and a maximum of 10 years, after grant.
The last grants were made in 1997.
A small number of GrandMet senior executives participated in the Senior Executive Phantom Share Option Scheme SEPSOS, a share price related bonus scheme.
The last grants were made in 1996 and all payments will have been made within 10 years from the date of grant.
During the year PS Walsh exercised his outstanding options under the GrandMet US executive share option scheme.
At 30 June 2004 he held 30,000 phantom options under SEPSOS that are fully exercisable until January 2006 at an exercise price of 459 pence.
Pension provision Scheme details NC Rose and PS Walsh are members of the Diageo pension scheme.
They accrue pension rights at the rate of one-thirtieth of basic salary per annum subject only to Inland Revenue limits.
Bonus payments and other benefits are not included in pensionable pay.
No actuarial reduction is applied to pensions payable from the age of 57, subject to company consent.
Their pensions are guaranteed to increase in line with inflation up to a level of 5% per annum, and they have guarantees that such increases will not be lower than 3% per annum and that their pensions at normal pension age of 62 will not be less than two-thirds of basic salary in the 12 months prior to retirement.
On death in service, a lump sum of four times pensionable salary is paid, along with a spouses pension of two-thirds of the members prospective pension.
When an executive director dies after retirement, a spouses pension of two-thirds of the members pension is paid.
The executive directors are not required to make pension contributions.
For executives who entered service after 31 May 1989, the benefits which can be provided from the Diageo pension scheme are restricted by the operation of the Inland Revenue earnings cap.
Such executives, including any directors, receive total pension benefits of the same value as if the earnings cap did not apply.
All benefits earned during the year in respect of earnings above the cap will be provided by the company on an unfunded basis.
Executive directorspension benefits Details of the accrued pension to which each director is entitled had they left service on 30 June 2004 and the transfer value of those accrued pensions are shown in the following table.
The accrued pensions shown represent the annual pension to which each executive director would be entitled at normal retirement age of 62.
The transfer value is broadly the cost to Diageo if it had to provide the equivalent pension benefit.
The transfer values shown in the following table have been calculated in accordance with the Guidance Note published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries GN 11.

Performance graph The graph below shows the total shareholder return for Diageo and the FTSE 100 Index since 30 June 1999.
The FTSE 100 Index reflects the 100 largest UK quoted companies by market capitalisation and has been chosen because it is a widely recognised performance benchmark for large UK companies.
The graph shows that Diageo outperformed the FTSE 100 Index over this five year period.
This is not linked to the TSR plan which measures three year TSR against a defined peer group of 17 other companies.
