Executive directors pension schemes All of the present executive directors are entitled to a pension from the Whitbread Group Pension Fund, which is a defined benefit pension scheme.
On retirement from service at the normal pension age of 60 the directors will receive an annual pension of two-thirds of their last 12 monthsbasic salary, subject to Inland Revenue limits.
As a result of his earnings being restricted by the earnings cap, Alan Parker is also a member of the Whitbread Unapproved Pension Scheme, an unfunded, unapproved pension scheme.
His total pension from the Whitbread Group Pension Fund and the Whitbread Unapproved Pension Scheme combined on retirement at age 60 will be two-thirds of his last 12 monthsbasic salary.
A director retiring early between the ages of 50 and 60 may draw his or her accrued pension without any actuarial reduction.
In the event of death in service before normal pension age a lump sum benefit of four times basic salary is paid, together with a spouses pension and childrens pensions.
On death after retirement, the directors spouse will receive a pension equal to 60% of the directors pension.
In addition, if death occurs within five years after retirement, a lump sum equal to the unpaid balance of five yearspension will be payable.
All pensions are increased annually in line with the RPI up to a maximum of 5%.
The final salary section of the pension scheme was closed to new entrants on 31 December 2001.
All new recruits after that date are offered participation in the defined contribution section of the scheme.
For executive directors, the company will contribute at the rate of 25% of the directors basic salary.
To the extent that basic salary exceeds the earnings cap, the executive director has the option of an equivalent non-consolidated salary supplement as an alternative.
In the event of death in service, a lump sum benefit of ten times basic salary is payable, although no additional spousesand childrens pensions are paid.
Where required by law, part of this lump sum is used to purchase pensions for dependants.
Executive directors do not contribute to the above pension schemes.
None of the executive directors are accruing benefits under any other company-sponsored pension arrangements.
No elements of executive directorspay packages are pensionable other than basic salary.
Non-executive directors are not entitled to participate in any of these pension arrangements.
The Remuneration Committee is aware of the Treasurys proposals to reform pension provision and will be reviewing the companys pension provision during 2004 5. page 43 Remuneration report Pension entitlements audited information The pension entitlements of the executive directors are as follows: Transfer value Increase, before of increase, Accumulated Increase in inflation, in before inflation, accrued benefits accrued benefits accrued benefits less any directors 4 March 2004 during the year during the year contributions Stewart Miller 138,003 14,650 11,566 122,026 Alan Parker 113,972 19,047 16,674 251,138 David Richardson 165,377 20,088 16,456 337,334 Bill Shannon 192,605 17,602 13,227 264,668 David Thomas 377,074 41,578 33,191 600,652 The transfer value of each directors accrued benefits at the end of the financial year is as follows: Movement less any directors 4 March 2004 1 March 2003 contributions Stewart Miller 1,458,650 1,235,695 222,955 Alan Parker 1,717,355 1,349,188 368,167 David Richardson 3,390,466 2,971,221 419,245 Bill Shannon 3,853,762 3,501,135 352,627 David Thomas 6,820,822 6,076,418 744,404 transfer values represent a liability of the pension fund, not a sum paid or due to the individual In addition to the above benefit, Alan Parker has an entitlement in respect of a transfer value received from a previous employers pension scheme.

The share option schemes are designed to incentivise executives to achieve stretch performance targets.
Under the schemes a fixed number of options were granted to directors and senior executives annually in line with market practice.
Executive options are granted at the average market price on the five dealing days preceeding the date of grant.
Executives may not, under normal circumstances, exercise options earlier than three years nor more than ten years after the grant.
Options granted since 1996 were performance-related.
Options granted between 1996 and 2000 cannot be exercised unless either adjusted EPS growth exceeds the Retail Prices Index RPI 2% per annum over any three consecutive years during the life of the option or TSR exceeds the average of the FTSE 100 index over the same period.
In order to align these objectives with shareholder value, the Remuneration Committee specified that options granted since June 2000 may only be exercised if the growth in the companys adjusted earnings per share has exceeded the RPI by more than 4% per annum measured over any three consecutive years out of the ten year performance period.
See Share options on page 41 for the current policy and performance criteria.
Executive directors may also participate in the companys Savings-related Share Option Scheme which is open to all employees on the same terms.
At 4 March 2004 the directors held the following share options under the executive share option schemes and the Savings-related Share Option Scheme.
The earliest date on which any of the executive options could have been exercised was June 1997, with the latest being June 2013.
Savings-related share options have a six-month exercise period.
The director retained the shares on exercise, but had he sold the shares this is the gain that he would have made.
2 The shares awarded under the 2001 LTIP vested on 1 March 2004, at which point the directors nil-cost options over the shares became exercisable, subject to the end of the closed period.
These options may now be exercised at any time before 1 March 2011.
3 The market price at vesting is the mid-market price on 1 March 2004.
4 The monetary value of the vested award is the value at the date of vesting.
This may be different from the value at the time the director chooses to exercise his nil-cost option.
Details of the value of the award on exercise will be reported in the year of exercise.
The information below refers to any awards made up to the date of the 2004 AGM.
Please refer to page 41 for details of the Plan after that date.
Participation in the Plan is available to executive directors and a small number of other senior executives.
The Plan aligns the long-term interests of participants with those of the company and its shareholders and is designed to deliver superior performance from participants and to improve shareholder value.
The Plan rewards executives with shares rather than cash benefits.
Awards are based on three-year performance periods and are calculated by taking half of the executives salary at the start of the period and dividing it by the Whitbread share price averaged over the five business days preceeding the start of the performance period.
The measure of performance is TSR.
Awards vest in part if the company performs at median, increasing to full vesting for top quartile performance relative to the comparator group of companies.
This means that at the 50th percentile, 50% of the award will be paid and at the 75th percentile, 100% of the award will be paid, with a straight line operating in between.
For the 2001 award the comparator group of companies was as follows: BAA, Boots, British Airways, Cadbury Schweppes, Compass, Dixons, Gallaher, Hilton Group, Imperial Tobacco, J Sainsbury, Kingfisher, Marks & Spencer, Rank, Reckitt Benckiser, Safeway, Scottish & Newcastle, Tate & Lyle, Tesco, Uniq and WHSmith.
Six Continents were originally part of this group but their shares are no longer traded.
For the 2002 award the comparator group of companies consisted of: Allied Domecq, BAA, Boots, Cadbury Schweppes, Compass, Dixons, Gallaher, Hilton Group, Imperial Tobacco, J Sainsbury, Marks & Spencer, Rank, Reckitt Benckiser, Scottish & Newcastle, Tate & Lyle, Tesco, Uniq and WHSmith.
Albert Fisher, Arcadia and Six Continents were originally part of this group but their shares are no longer traded.
The comparator group for the 2003 award was the constituents of the FTSE All-Share Hotels & Leisure index as at 1 March 2003. page 47 Remuneration report Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust ESOP audited information The company funds an ESOP to enable it to acquire and hold shares for the LTIP and executive share option schemes.
The ESOP currently holds 1,415,307 shares: the executive directors each have a technical interest in these shares as potential beneficiaries of the trust.
All dividends on shares in the ESOP are waived by the Trustee.
During the period from 4 March 2004 to 4 May 2004 no director has exercised his option to call for the transfer of his shares out of the ESOP.
Share price information The mid-market price of Whitbread ordinary shares on 4 March 2004 was 740p 1 March 2003 521p.
The highest and lowest price paid between these dates was 782.5p and 515p respectively.
Changes since 4 March 2004 audited information As a result of the reinvestment of income arising from personal equity plans, Stewart Miller acquired 2 shares, David Richardson acquired 7 shares, and David Thomas acquired 34 shares.
There have been no other changes in directors interests in ordinary shares since 4 March 2004.
No director had an interest at any time during the year in the secured or unsecured loan stock or the loan notes of the company, or in the shares or loan stock of any subsidiary company.
Performance Graphs The graphs below show the percentage change in TSR with dividends reinvested of a holding of the companys shares against the corresponding change in a hypothetical holding of shares in the FTSE Leisure & Hotels sector index, for each of the last five financial years ending 4 March 2004 and for the period October 2000 being the date of the decision to demerge Pubs & Bars to March 2004 respectively.
The FTSE Leisure & Hotels sector index has been chosen because from March 2003 it has been the comparator group for the measurement of the performance of the long term incentive plan and it is deemed to represent an appropriate market index in which the company is a constituent member.
