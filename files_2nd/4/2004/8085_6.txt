Directors Remuneration Report Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the Report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Companys members on certain parts of the Directors Remuneration Report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the Report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
The Report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited Information Remuneration Committee The Company has established a Remuneration Committee which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code.
The membership of the Committee during 2004 was as follows: R Hooper D Mapp appointed 17 May 2004 D Cruickshank appointed 17 May 2004 E Barton resigned 10 May 2004 S Watson resigned 10 May 2004 Mr D Cruickshank resigned on 24 January 2005.
Mr R Hooper served as the Chairman of the Committee throughout the period.
When necessary, non-Committee members were invited to attend.
None of the members who served on the Committee during the period had any personal financial interest other than as a shareholder of the Company, conflicts of interests arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
In determining the Directors remuneration the Committee consulted Mr D Smith, Chairman, and Mr P Rigby, Chief Executive, about its proposals, although no Director played a part in any decision about his or her own remuneration.
The Committee also appointed New Bridge Street Consultants to provide advice on structuring Directors remuneration packages during 2004.
New Bridge Street Consultants also provided the Company with advice on employee share incentive arrangements.
Remuneration Policy The remuneration of the Executive Directors is designed to provide for a competitive compensation package which reflects the Companys performance against financial objectives and personal performance criteria.
It rewards above-average performance and is designed to attract, motivate and retain high-calibre executives.
The performance measurement of the Executive Directors and the determination of their annual remuneration packages are undertaken by the Committee.
There are five elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors as follows: basic annual salary: benefits: annual bonus: share incentives: and retirement and life assurance benefits.
The Companys policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the Executive Directors should be performance related.
As described further below, Executive Directors may earn annual bonus payments of up to 100% of their basic salaries, together with the benefits of participation in share incentive schemes.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside of the Company provided that the Chairmans consent is obtained.
During 2004 Mr P Rigby served as Non-Executive Chairman of Electric Word plc, for which the fees of 4,000 were paid to the Company, and as a Non-Executive Director of What Doctors Dont Tell You Ltd. for which no fees were paid.
Basic Salary The basic salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed by the Committee prior to the beginning of each year and upon a change of position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a whole and makes reference to objective research which gives current information on appropriate comparator groups of companies.
Following the Companys merger in May 2004, the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors were reviewed, including basic salaries, which were increased with effect from 1 June 2004 to reflect the additional responsibility associated with the enlarged Group.
The basic salaries were again reviewed in December 2004 and, with effect from 1 January 2005, increased by 3%.
26 T&F Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 Benefits From 1 June 2004 each of the Executive Directors receives a benefit allowance of 25,000 per annum, private medical insurance cover and in addition Messrs Rigby and Gilbertson receive permanent health insurance cover.
Prior to this they each received private medical insurance cover and in addition Messrs Rigby and Gilbertson each received permanent health insurance cover and a car allowance of 24,000 per annum.
Annual Bonus Each of the Executive Directors has the opportunity to earn a bonus of up to 100% of actual basic salary, subject to the achievement of performance criteria set by the Committee.
In respect of the year ended 31 December 2004, a bonus of up to 80% of actual basic salary could be earned based on achievement of diluted adjusted earnings per share targets and up to 20% based on achievement of personal objectives.
In respect of the bonus element related to adjusted diluted earnings per share EPS, the target range for 2004 was from 19.5p for which no bonus would be payable to 22.5p or more for which 100% of the adjusted diluted EPS element of the bonus would be payable and pro rata on a straight line basis between those two points.
The actual 2004 adjusted diluted EPS was 24.5p.
The Committee considers adjusted diluted EPS to be the most suitable measurement to determine performance and align the interests of the Executive Directors with those of the Companys shareholders since this measurement of performance can be directly influenced by the performance of the Executive Directors.
The personal objectives of the Executive Directors for 2004 covered a range of matters covering strategic, financial and operational areas.
In early 2005 the Remuneration Committee assessed the achievement of the personal objectives for 2004 and determined that in each case the Executive Directors had achieved them.
For 2004 the actual bonuses payable for achievement of the targets, expressed as a percentage of basic salary, were as follows: Actual bonus awarded in respect of 2004 Adjusted Total diluted Personal bonus EPS objectives awarded %%% D Smith 80 20 100 P Rigby 80 20 100 D Gilbertson 80 20 100 A Foye 80 20 100 Mr P Rigby waived his contractual right to 50% of his bonus.
An equivalent sum is being paid as an additional employer pension contribution.
Share Incentives Share Matching Plan In 2001 the Companys shareholders approved the establishment of a Share Matching Plan under which, if invited to do so by the Remuneration Committee, eligible employees and Executive Directors could invest up to 30% of their annual cash bonuses, net of tax, in the purchase of the Companys shares, with the Company granting a matching award of the same number of shares.
The matching award vests on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the participant having retained the shares originally purchased with the annual bonus and the participant still being employed on the anniversary date.
Awards were granted under this plan in April 2004 as shown on page 30.
Following approval at the last Annual General Meeting, the Share Matching Plan was amended to introduce a requirement for the Executive Directors to use 50% or more as determined by the Remuneration Committee from time to time of their annual bonuses net of tax and any other deductions, where such bonus exceeds half of annual basic salary, to invest in the Companys shares.
The award of free matching shares will now also be subject to the achievement of performance criteria set by the Committee.
The first award under the amended Share Matching Plan is expected to be made in 2005 in respect of the 2004 financial year.
The performance targets will be based on the achievement of sustained growth in adjusted earnings per share over three financial years, on a sliding scale.
The number of matching shares which will vest, subject to forfeiture or early exercise, for each share purchased with the participants gross bonus before tax, employees National Insurance contributions and any other deduction is expected to be as follows: 1 2 share where compound annual adjusted earnings per share growth exceeds the growth in RPI plus 5%: 2 shares where compound annual adjusted earnings per share growth exceeds the growth in RPI plus 12% or more: and pro rata on a straight line basis between these two points.
Share Options Prior to the merger, each of Taylor & Francis Group plc and Informa Group plc operated discretionary share option schemes under which annual grants of options were considered for the Executive Directors, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee taking into account individual performance, up to a maximum of 1.5 times annual basic salary under the Informa scheme and up to one times annual basic salary under the T&F Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 27 Directors Remuneration Report continued Taylor & Francis scheme.
In recent years options granted under each scheme have been subject to the achievement of performance criteria based on adjusted earnings per share growth over a three-year period.
Share options granted to the Executive Directors during 2004 under the respective schemes are shown on pages 31 and 32, including the associated performance criteria.
The exercise price of options granted under both schemes is equal to the market value of the Companys shares at the date of grant.
In light of changes to the accounting treatment for share options, changing market and corporate governance best practice and the views of the Company's shareholders, the Remuneration Committee is reviewing the Company's existing share incentive arrangements to ensure that they remain appropriate.
Subject to the findings of this review, shareholder approval will be sought for any proposed changes to the operation of existing share incentive arrangements or for the introduction of any new arrangements in line with best practice.
Retirement and Life Assurance Benefits The Executive Directors are entitled to receive a contribution of 25% of annual basic salary toward their retirement arrangements.
Messrs D Smith and A Foye became eligible to the 25% retirement benefit entitlement on 1 June 2004, following the merger.
Mr D Smith did not participate in any Company pension scheme or receive life assurance cover and instead received payment in lieu of pension, at 10% of annual basic salary up to 1 June 2004 and 25% of annual basic salary thereafter.
Mr P Rigby receives a Company contribution of 25% of annual basic salary to his personal pension plan.
He received an additional employer contribution in respect of 2004 of 199,000 2003: 326,000 above the Companys annual contribution stated above.
The Company also provides life assurance cover providing for the payment of a lump sum in the event of the insureds death in service.
Mr D Gilbertson was a member of the Informa Final Salary Pension and Life Assurance Scheme throughout the year.
This is a defined benefit scheme which provides for a pension on retirement of up to two thirds of final basic salary excluding benefits at the age of 60.
Dependants are eligible for dependants pension and the payment of a lump sum in the event of the members death in service.
Further details of the benefits accrued under the scheme are shown on page 32.
Mr Gilbertson also has a personal money purchase pension scheme funding his pension above the earnings cap and to which the Company contributes to bring its total contribution up to the 25% of basic salary entitlement level.
Mr A Foye was a member of the Taylor & Francis Limited Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme throughout the year.
This is a defined benefit scheme which provides for a pension on retirement of up to two thirds of final basic salary excluding benefits at the age of 63.
