Remuneration report Remuneration Committee The members of the Remuneration Committee during the year were Mr J W Leng Chairman of the committee, Mr T M Gateley and Mr B L Staples retired 14 May 2004.
Mr L Browne and Mr K S Beeston joined the committee in 2005.
All of the foregoing were regarded by the Board as independent non-executive directors.
The committee consulted the Companys Chairman, Mr G J Allen, on various matters and the Chief Executive, Mr M J Lamb, regarding the remuneration of the other executive directors and senior managers.
It also received the advice and services of the Finance Director, Mr T J Slack, and the Company Secretary, Mr J OShea, who acted as secretary to the committee.
Deloitte & Touche LLP was engaged by the committee to provide advice on directors remuneration to the committee and played a central advisory role in relation to a review of remuneration carried out by the committee.
During the year Deloitte & Touche LLP also provided financial and tax consulting services to the Company.
Watson Wyatt LLP were engaged by the committee to report on the impact of the governments proposed changes to the tax regime for occupational pensions.
Watson Wyatt LLP are the actuaries and administrators to the Companys main UK pension fund and also provide pensions advice to the Company.
Non-executive directors remuneration and terms of appointment The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined, after reference to external benchmarks, by the Chairman and the executive directors.
The policy on non-executive remuneration is to pay an appropriate level on a comparative basis for their time and work on the Board and its committees.
They do not participate in any bonus or employee share schemes of the Company and no part of their remuneration is conditional upon the performance of the Company.
In December 2004 the Board established a shareholding guideline for non-executive directors, each of whom is expected to build up a holding of at least 7500 shares within twelve months.
All of the persons who were non-executive directors during the year held at least 3000 shares.
The normal period for initial appointment and first renewal is three years.
The appointment of the Chairman is normally renewable on an annual basis.
Appointments are made under a letter of agreement subject to retirement by rotation and removal under the Companys articles of association.
There are no provisions for the Company to give notice or pay compensation in relation to the early termination of the appointment of the Chairman or any non-executive director.
There is a provision in non-executive appointment letters to the effect that a non-executive director is normally expected to give one months prior notice of termination to the Company.
The dates and unexpired terms of the letters of appointment for the non-executive directors, which are available for inspection at the annual general meeting and to the Companys registered office, are as follows: Date of letter of appointment Unexpired term as at 31 December 2004 Mr G J Allen 04.05.04 4 months but retired with effect from 31 December 2004 Mr L Browne 16.12.04 3 years Appointed with effect from 1 January 2005 Mr T M Gateley 16.12.04 1 year 10 months Mr J W Leng 16.12.04 4 months Executive directors remuneration and terms of appointment Statement of policy The Company aims to ensure that remuneration generally and incentives in particular provide strong links between individual performance, Company performance and shareholder interests.
The remuneration policy also recognises that the Company operates in global and highly competitive markets with over two-thirds of its activities outside the UK.
The policy is to provide competitive remuneration packages to attract, motivate, reward and retain executives of the calibre required, and to align their interests with those of shareholders by relating a significant element of the remuneration package to specific performance measures.
The Remuneration Committee considers it to be important to maintain the flexibility to respond to individual circumstances.
However, its normal approach has been to pay salaries within appropriate market competitive ranges, combined with realistic potentials for above market total compensation if performance is outstanding.
Remuneration comprises basic salaries, annual performance bonuses and benefits in kind, pension arrangements and participation in an executive share option scheme and a long term incentive plan.
36 Remuneration report Remuneration report The aggregate performance based remuneration under the annual bonus arrangements and long-term incentive plan represents a maximum level of 117.5% of basic salary on an annual basis.
In addition, executive share options were granted in the year subject to performance conditions and represent a potentially significant element of total remuneration.
As the Company completes a period of repositioning and enters its growth phase the committee has undertaken a review of remuneration policy and proposals for new long term incentive arrangements will be put to shareholders at the forthcoming annual general meeting.
The proposals include a long term incentive plan and a deferred bonus plan to be introduced in conjunction with an increase in annual bonus potential to 100% of salary, with half subject to mandatory deferral into shares through a matching share plan, from a current maximum of 60% all payable in cash.
The committee believes that these new incentive proposals provide stronger alignment with the long term business strategy and shareholders interests.
Participants in the proposed new plans would not be granted executive share options or awards under the existing long term incentive plan but final awards under the latter plan will be made in 2005.
The performance measures for the annual bonus will be similar to those currently used, in particular annual profit and cash generation for the 2005 bonus.
The policy of the committee is to set performance conditions which are both stretching and challenging but also attainable in the environment in which the Company is then operating.
Appropriate details of performance targets will be disclosed in future Remuneration Reports and the long term incentive plan targets for the proposed 2005 awards are described in the separate circular outlining the new plans which will be sent to shareholders with this Annual Report.
In setting the remuneration of each executive director, the Remuneration Committee takes into account their role and responsibilities, skills and individual performance and has reference to market rates as evidenced by published studies and comparisons with international UK-based groups of a similar size and complexity.
In this connection the committee engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP to undertake appropriate comparative studies.
The committee uses such comparative studies with caution in view of the risk of an upward ratchet of remuneration levels.
Consistent with the policy on service contracts, the executive directors, Mr M J Lamb, Mr T J Slack, Mr D C Nicholas and Mr W R Whitney, have rolling service contracts subject to termination on one years notice by the Company or the executive.
All such contracts allow the Company to elect to make payment in lieu of notice but do not include any other specific provision for compensation payable upon early termination.
It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee to limit any compensation which might be paid in the event of early termination of an executive directors contract to the legal minima, taking into account mitigation and other relevant factors.
On 31 March 2004 Mr R B Pointon retired early as an executive director at his own initiative and with the agreement of the Board.
No compensation for loss of office or termination was paid to Mr Pointon.
The dates of the contracts and period to normal retirement age for those serving as executive directors during the year are as follows: Date of service contract Notice period Period to normal retirement age as at 31 December 2004 Mr M J Lamb 1 February 1999 12 months 16 years Mr T J Slack 1 February 1999 12 months 1 year 7 months Mr D C Nicholas 8 March 2004 12 months 5 years Mr W R Whitney 1 March 2004 12 months 4 years 10 months Mr R B Pointon 1 February 1999 12 months 2 years 2 months but retired early on 31 March 2004 Annual bonus Executive directors are awarded annual performance bonuses.
Maximum bonus is only payable if the challenging targets set by the Remuneration Committee are met.
The policy is for annual bonus targets to relate to corporate financial measures, including profit, cash generation and relative share price performance against the FTSE Engineering Sector Index, with a small discretionary element to reflect personal contribution and the achievement of strategic objectives.
The bonus maximum for 2004 was 60% 2003: 60% of salary for each executive director to each of whom bonuses of 57.5% 2003: 60% were paid pro rata from date of appointment in the case of Messrs Nicholas and Whitney.
Annual bonus arrangements for 2004 were structured and targeted in a similar manner to those applicable in relation to 2003.
Annual bonuses are non-pensionable in the case of all continuing executive directors.
37 IMI plc Annual Report 2004 Remuneration report Share options Each executive director is eligible for the grant of executive share options under the Executive Share Option 1995 Scheme.
Options granted under this scheme are subject to stretching tiered performance conditions related to growth in earnings per share above inflation over a fixed period of three financial years.
Earnings per share is well recognised and understood as a performance measure for executive share options.
For options granted over shares representing one times salary, vesting requires growth in earnings per share of at least 6% above the rate of increase in the UK Retail Price Index RPI over a three year performance period.
This hurdle doubles to 12% growth above RPI for awards representing between one and two times salary, and rises to 24% for awards of between two and three times salary.
The Remuneration Committee has a policy of awarding annual share option grants to executive directors up to two years prior to normal retirement age, with the level of grant individually determined for each executive director.
The policy is to make awards, where appropriate, of up to two times salary to executive directors and up to three times salary for the Chief Executive.
Details of share options granted to directors in the year are set out on page 45.
The Executive Share Option 1995 Scheme is also available to other selected senior executives of the Group.
Options are priced at full market value without discount.
There is no retesting of performance conditions and options will therefore lapse if applicable performance conditions are not met in the relevant three year performance period.
The first options were granted under this policy in 2001 and lapsed because the performance conditions for the three year performance period ending 31 December 2003 were not satisfied.
The first and second tier options granted in 2002 will be exercisable given the improvement in earnings per share achieved over the three year performance period ending 31 December 2004.
No options between two and three times salary were awarded in 2002, but, had such options been granted, they would lapse because the performance conditions attached to them would not have been met.
Inland Revenue Approved and Unapproved options granted under the Executive Share Option 1995 Scheme before September 2001 and outstanding at the year-end are subject to performance related conditions and only become exercisable if growth in earnings per share during any three consecutive financial years over a period of ten years seven years for the unapproved options granted between September 1996 and March 1998 exceeds growth in RPI by at least 6%.
This was chosen as the appropriate measure at a time when grants were limited to an aggregate level of shares for all outstanding share options of four times salary based on the option price.
The performance condition was satisfied with respect to the three year performance period ending 31 December 2004.
The method adopted to assess whether performance conditions attached to options under the Executive Share Option 1995 Scheme were satisfied by reference to earnings per share for the three years ended 31 December 2004, involved adjusting basic earnings per share for goodwill amortisation and exceptional items and, because of the significant Group wide rationalisation and restructuring measures, the costs of that programme.
The auditor reviewed the reported adjusted earnings per share and confirmed that the adjustments made were fair and reasonable.
This approach is consistent with the prior year.
Options granted under the Executive Share Option 1985 Scheme, which operated between 1985 and 1995 and was the forerunner to the current share option scheme, were not subject to performance conditions.
This was in line with comparable share option schemes set up in the 1980s when the Companys shareholders approved the scheme.
Long term incentive plan LTIP The LTIP allows cash awards to senior executives, including executive directors, up to a maximum potential value of 50% of salary for each year of participation.
The policy is to make an annual LTIP award to each executive director up to one year prior to normal retirement age.
LTIP awards to executive directors are subject to performance conditions related to the economic profit of the Group as a whole.
The performance measurement period is normally three years.
Again, as with executive share options, there is no retesting against performance conditions after the relevant period of measurement.
Economic profit was chosen as the LTIP performance measure because it combines profitability with return on capital in a single measure and is being used across the Group as a management decision-making tool.
Economic profit is based on the net operating profit after tax of the Group derived from the audited financial statements and adjusted for goodwill.
A capital charge relating to the weighted average cost of capital for the Group is applied to invested capital including all goodwill.
At the end of the performance period, the net of tax value of any LTIP payments earned by the executive directors must normally be invested in market purchases of the Companys ordinary shares pursuant to a deferred share plan.
Such share purchases are to be made through an employee trust and held for a further three year period.
After that period, an executive director will receive a matching award of one additional share for every four with no further performance conditions.
38 Remuneration report Remuneration report The LTIP performance targets set by the Remuneration Committee are based on challenging internal goals for profitable growth.
It is intended to disclose further details in relation to the performance conditions for each award after its maturity.
All of the LTIP awards to executive directors, which have matured to date have lapsed without any payments to the executive directors.
However, Mr W R Whitney was paid in respect of accrued performance in 2004 against local targets in Retail Dispense during his employment with the Group prior to his joining the Board.
The first LTIP awards to mature lapsed in 2003 because economic profit in the performance period was 13m below the level required for any vesting to occur.
The LTIP awards maturing in 2004 will also lapse because economic profit during the three year performance period was 4m below the minimum required for any vesting to occur.
SAYE plan The Company operates an Inland Revenue approved savings-related share option scheme which is open to the majority of the Groups UK employees, including the executive directors, and allows the grant of options to all participants at a discount of up to 20 per cent below the market price.
Such schemes are not subject to performance conditions and offer tax incentives to encourage employees to use their own money to purchase shares in their employers business or group.
All Employee Share Ownership Plan The UK-based executive directors also participate in an All Employee Share Ownership Plan.
In May 2005 shares to a value equal to the lesser of 3,000 and 1.2% of each participants basic salary will be acquired at market value by the trustee of the plan in respect of their participation during 2004.
The plan is not operated subject to specific performance conditions but the level of shares awarded to participating employees is set taking into account performance, in particular that of the UK operations of the Group.
Each of the UK-based executive directors also participates in the plan by making the maximum contribution from their salary towards partnership shares under the plan.
Up to two matching shares may be awarded for every one partnership share acquired under the plan although the policy to date has been not to award any matching shares.
Save as indicated below, the remainder of this report has been audited.
Pension entitlement UK-based executive directors participate in the IMI Pension Fund.
Their normal retirement age under the Fund is 60, although they may elect to retire and receive a pension at any time after age 57 without a discount.
On death a dependants pension is provided equal to two-thirds of the members pension.
If death occurs in the first five years of retirement a lump sum is also paid equal to the balance of five years pension payments.
Pensions in payment, in excess of any guaranteed minimum pension, are increased each year in line with price inflation up to a maximum of 5%.
Mr Nicholas is also a member of an unfunded unapproved defined contribution arrangement.
During the period 1 March 2004, when Mr Nicholas was appointed as an executive director, to 31 December 2004, notional contributions of 37,147 were credited to Mr Nicholas and the notional value of the accumulated contributions as at 31 December 2004 was 37,819.
The government has announced plans to change the taxation of pension benefits in 2006 which are expected to impact UK executives in the IMI Pension Fund.
As a result, the position is under review by the Remuneration Committee which is yet to decide what modification and or alternatives to existing pension provision would be appropriate.
Mr Whitney is a USA-based executive director and is currently a member of two arrangements in the USA.
The first is a defined contribution arrangement, the Savings Investment Plan.
In the period from 1 March 2004, when Mr Whitney was appointed as an executive director, to 31 December 2004, contributions of 4,030 were made to this plan.
The second is a defined benefit arrangement, the IMI Americas Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.
His pension is payable from age 60, without further increase.
No dependants pensions are payable on death after retirement.
On death prior to retirement a dependants pension, equal to the members pension, is payable.
39 IMI plc Annual Report 2004 Remuneration report Details of the pension benefits earned in the IMI Pension Fund or the IMI Americas Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan are summarised in the following table.

2 Mr Pointon retired on 31 March 2004, his accrued pension and transfer value as at 31 December 2004 therefore reflect the benefits paid to him on retirement.
The accrued pension benefits at the end of the year represent the annual deferred pension to which each executive director would have been entitled had he left service at the end of the year, with the exception of Mr Pointon, as set out in note 2 above.
This is based on completed pensionable service and pensionable earnings at the relevant date.
The increase in the accrued pension during the year reflects the completion of a further years pensionable service and the increase in pensionable earnings, both before and after inflation.
During 2004 there have been no changes to pension benefit arrangements in place at the start of the year or, if later, on appointment.
The above figures exclude any benefits from the executive directors voluntary contributions.
Transfer values calculated in accordance with the guidance note GN11 published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries are also shown in the table.
A transfer value is the estimated capital value of the future pension payments in retirement.
Non-executive directors are not members of any Group pension scheme.
Mr G J Allen, who retired as an executive director on 11 May 2001, is a pensioner member of the IMI Pension Fund.
Mr Allen retired as a non-executive director with effect from 31 December 2004.

Remuneration shown above as salaries for non-executive directors includes fees of 72,000 2003: 70,000.
No compensation for loss of office was paid to or receivable by any director in 2004.
Benefits in kind provided to executive directors consist of the provision of a fully expensed motor car for all except Mr M J Lamb and Mr D C Nicholas, who elected for a cash alternative scheme, and private health care arrangements.
41 IMI plc Annual Report 2004 Remuneration report External appointments Executive directors may accept one external appointment with the consent of the Board, and are normally allowed to retain fees from external non-executive directorships.
Currently, Mr M J Lamb is a non-executive director of Spectris plc, which paid him remuneration of 35,000 in 2004.
Performance conditions for Options I to L are based on earnings per share eps growth of 6% above the UK Retail Price Index RPI and the same for options M to O as regards shares representing one times salary at the option price but options M to O require 12% and 24% eps growth above RPI, respectively, for shares representing between one and two times salary and two and three times salary.
No options representing above two times salary were granted in 2002.
Options M to O do not allow retesting and will lapse if the applicable performance conditions are not satisfied in the relevant three year performance period.

LTIP awards marked b were made in 2002 subject to a three year performance period and lapse without payment in March 2005 because the minimum performance condition was not met.
LTIP awards made to Mr R B Pointon lapsed on his voluntary, early retirement.
No variations to the terms and conditions of the LTIP awards shown above were made during the year except that LTIP awards made to Mr W R Whitney prior to his appointment as an executive director in March 2004, which were dependent upon the economic profit performance of the operations for which he was responsible at the time, were made dependent upon the economic profit of the Group for performance periods from and including 2004.
The amount payable to him in respect of that service is shown in the remuneration table on page 41 and, net of taxes, will be invested in IMI shares within the deferred share plan.
Awards potentially vest in March of the year following the performance period end date shown above.
References in the above table to salary are to annual salary for the final year of the relevant performance period.
If and when any award vests in future years, the net of income tax amount will be used in respect of the linked deferred share plan to purchase shares at the market prices that then apply.
Directors' interests and shareholding guidelines All of the executive directors hold interests in the ordinary shares of the Company as detailed below and any amounts earned by the executive directors under the long term incentive plan will be invested in shares through an employee trust for a three year holding period.
The Remuneration Committee intends to introduce a minimum shareholding guideline with the proposed new incentive plans which are to be put to shareholders for approval at the annual general meeting.
All of the persons who were nonexecutive directors at the year end held shares in the Company and the Board has set a shareholding guideline which it expects non-executive directors to meet within twelve months.
"The interests all being beneficial of the directors and their families in the share capital of the Company are shown below, together with their interests in options granted to them pursuant to the rules of the IMI Savings-Related Share Option Schemes marked ""a"" and the rules of the IMI Executive Share Option 1985 Scheme marked ""b"" and the rules of the IMI Executive Share Option 1995 Scheme marked ""c""."
The notional gains calculated as at the date of exercise of share options shown in the table on page 45 by reference to the middle market price in the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List were: Mr T J Slack 4,101 and Mr R B Pointon 62,246.
During the period 31 December 2004 to 7 March 2005 there were no changes in the interests of any current director from those shown save for: purchases within the IMI All Employee Share Ownership Plan on 11 January 2005 of 32 shares on behalf of each of Mr M J Lamb, Mr D C Nicholas and Mr T J Slack, in each case at 391.58p per share, and on 8 February 2005 of 30 shares on behalf of each of Mr M J Lamb, Mr D C Nicholas and Mr T J Slack at 416.75p per share.
The closing price of the Company's ordinary shares at 31 December 2004 was 393.75p per share and the price range during the year was 336.5p to 393.75p.
Total shareholder return performance graph This section of this report is not required to be audited.
The graph below compares the Companys total shareholder return over the five years ended 31 December 2004 with that for the FTSE All Share Index and the FTSE Engineering and Machinery Sector Index.
The FTSE Engineering and Machinery Sector Index was chosen as a comparator index because it offered a reasonable reflection upon the relative performance of the Company and is used as one of the performance measures for the purpose of annual bonuses.
The FTSE All Share Index was chosen as it is a relevant broad equity market index.
Over the past five years the IMI share price has outperformed the FTSE Engineering and Machinery index by 79% and the FTSE All Share Index by 98%.
Over the same period total shareholder return has outperformed the FTSE Engineering and Machinery Index by 90% and the FTSE All Share Index by 126%.
