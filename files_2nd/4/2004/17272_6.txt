Directors Remuneration Report for the financial year ended 31January 2004 The following is a report by the Remuneration Committee which has been approved by the Board for submission to shareholders.
Composition and Terms of Reference The Remuneration Committee consists of the independent Non-Executive Directors who are Andrew Beeson Chairman, Prue Leith OBE and Roger Jones.
Its composition and terms of reference are in line with the Combined Code.
The Company complies with Section B of the Combined Code provisions on Directors remuneration and in respect of the Remuneration Report content.
The Committees aim is to ensure that the Executive Directors are rewarded for their contribution to the Group and are motivated to enhance the return to shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible, on behalf of the Board, for setting the remuneration policy for Executive Directors.
In addition, they have regard to pay and conditions for other employees in the Group especially the arrangements for Directors of subsidiaries who are not Directors of the Company.
The Committee is advised internally by the Director of Group Human Resources and the Head of Group Reward.
External advice was provided during the year by Towers Perrin in relation to salary benchmarking and the overall levels of remuneration packages in comparative companies.
Towers Perrin was appointed by the Head of Group Reward on behalf of the Remuneration Committee.
In addition to data provided by Towers Perrin, the Committee also took into account information from other remuneration surveys.
A review of incentive plans has also been conducted during the year and Deloitte and Touche LLP were appointed on behalf of the Remuneration Committee to advise on these matters.
Remuneration Policy The Committee continues to maintain a policy consistent with Group Reward Principles applied for all employees throughout the Group and in line with the Companys business objectives which: attracts, retains and motivates high calibre Directors: is appropriate to the Company, taking into account information from independent sources and from within the retail sector as well as other companies of a comparable size: aligns the interests of Directors and shareholders by linking share and cash incentives to performance: complies with best practice and comprises a mix of xed and variable pay with longer-term incentives.
When comparing remuneration packages with those in other companies, particular regard is taken of companies in the FTSE 250 and other retailers.
The reward principles applied throughout the Group provide for basic salaries to be set at the median for a range of comparative companies with reward for performance aimed at delivering an overall package that is competitive.
For the two Executive Directors the variable, performance related remuneration share options and Woolworths Group Incentive Plan, currently represents 40 per cent of the total package for on target performance.
Components of Remuneration Basic Salary Basic salary for each Director is reviewed annually in the context of market conditions affecting executive remuneration, affordability and the level of increases awarded to staff throughout the Group.
Basic salary levels are generally set at not more than the median for a range of comparative companies.
Benets In addition to salaries and the items described below, the Company provides a range of competitive benets including pension, a fully-expensed car or non-pensionable cash allowance and private medical insurance.
Service Contract The policy of the Committee is that notice periods should be set at not more than 12 months.
No Executive Director has a service contract with a notice period longer than 12 months.
Bonus For Executive Directors and directors of subsidiaries, the Woolworths Group Incentive Plan WIP applied during the year see page 21.
Gerald Corbett, the Chairman, is not entitled to participate in the WIP.
Share Options Executive Share Option Schemes The Company currently operates the Woolworths Group plc 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme the 2002 Executive Scheme for Executive Directors and Senior Executives.
Options were granted in March 2003 and September 2003 under the 2002 Executive Scheme.
Half-yearly grants were generally set at 35 per cent of salary for Senior Executives, 42.5 per cent of salary for Directors of subsidiary companies and at 50 per cent of salary for Executive Directors of the Company.
20 Woolworths Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 Directors Remuneration Report continued for the financial year ended 31January 2004 Share Options Executive Share Option Schemes continued For options granted during the year under the 2002 Executive Scheme, performance targets declared in the 2003 Directors Remuneration Report apply.
Under these grants, fully diluted, adjusted Earnings Per Share EPS must increase by six per cent per annum commencing with the Companys financial year immediately prior to the date of grant plus RPI over a three-year period in order for the option to be exercised in full.
If this is not achieved, growth in EPS of five per cent per annum plus RPI over the same period is required in order for up to 50 per cent of the option to be exercised.
If either of these targets is not met after the first three-year period there will be a retest one year later over a four-year period, from the same base, and the same proportion of the option will be available for exercise.
If neither of the targets has been achieved after four years the option will lapse.
The Committee believes that using EPS as the performance measure is consistent with the Companys strategy to grow profits at this stage in its development.
EPS is a measure used by the majority of companies of similar size and provides a simple calculation which is clear to all interested parties.
In the event of a change of control of the Company the performance conditions will not be automatically waived.
A minimum target of an increase in EPS of two per cent per annum plus RPI will normally have to be met.
The option will normally be exercisable only in proportion to the number of months that have elapsed from grant to the date of early exercise against a total of 36 months.
Options are designed to align the interests of Directors and Senior Executives with those of shareholders and to enable them to share in the success of the Group.
The granting of options on a regular basis ensures any reward is spread over a number of years, is allied to the growth in share value over the long-term, and avoids substantial fortuitous one-off gains.
The Committee intends to cease the grant of further share options under the 2002 Executive Scheme if the proposed new incentive plans described below are adopted.
A limit of five per cent of the total issued share capital on the number of new shares that can be issued to satisfy executive options granted under Executive Share Schemes applies over a ten-year period.
At the year end outstanding share options represented 4.8 per cent of the total share capital.
Savings-Related Share Options A savings-related share option scheme ShareSave is open to all eligible employees in the UK.
The third grant of options under ShareSave was made in May 2003 and it is intended that options will be granted annually under this arrangement provided the scheme continues to provide a cost effective method of enabling employees to share in the success of the Group.
The Committee is aware of the proposed changes to the accounting treatment of employee share options and will review the operation of the ShareSave during the next year.
Incentives and bonuses Woolworths Group Incentive Plan The Woolworths Group Incentive Plan WIP provides an integrated approach to variable pay through combining annual bonuses with long-term incentives.
Participation is for Executive Directors and Directors of subsidiaries, who will then not be eligible to participate in any other annual bonus plan for the same period as that in which they participate in the WIP.
For the year ended 31 January 2004 the award for Executive Directors of the Company was based on Group profit and personal objectives, whereas for Directors of subsidiaries the award was based on Group and subsidiary company financial performance and personal objectives.
Awards for on target performance achievement of budgeted profits and personal objectives are 45 per cent of basic salary for Executive Directors and 35 per cent of basic salary for other participants.
If the relevant profit target is not met, no award will be made for that portion of the award.
If profits exceed the relevant targets then a greater percentage of bonus will be paid up to an overall ceiling of 100 per cent of basic salary.
Penalties apply if stock and cash targets are not met.
For the year ended 31 January 2004 the majority of participants were entitled to declared bonuses of between 16 per cent and 56 per cent of basic salary and Executive Directors were entitled to a declared bonus of 44 per cent of basic salary.
The declared bonus may be deferred for three years, at the completion of which it is matched by up to 25 per cent in shares which are purchased in the market at the time of electing to defer.
The individual can request at any time to take part or all of the declared bonus immediately, but then forfeits the matching shares in proportion to the amount of bonus paid early.
As the matching share element is relatively small no further performance conditions apply.
If the individual leaves employment with the Group for any reason during the three year deferment the matched shares will be forfeited.
The Committee intends to cease operation of the WIP if the proposed new incentive plans described below are adopted.
New Incentive Plans The Remuneration Committee has reviewed incentive arrangements for Executive Directors and senior employees.
As a result, two new incentive plans are proposed, details of which are set out below.
In conducting the review the Committee took into account several factors including current market practice, the impact of the proposed new accounting rules for share-based remuneration, the use of newly issued shares for incentive plans and the most appropriate performance measure which will encourage participants to deliver value to shareholders.
The Committee decided that annual and long-term incentives should change with no further executive share options being granted.
Instead, share awards will be made with a vesting period of three years for each award.
The Company does not intend to issue any new shares for these plans.
21 Woolworths Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 Directors Remuneration Report continued for the financial year ended 31January 2004 The New Woolworths Group Annual Incentive Plan Participants under this Plan will be Executive Directors, Directors of subsidiaries and other senior employees.
The Plan will operate on an annual basis and participants will not be entitled to participate in any other annual bonus schemes.
The Plan provides for two types of Award: a Cash Award, which will be paid after the end of the financial year and which, for Executive Directors will be based on the achievement of financial targets and meeting personal objectives.
For Executive Directors the Cash Award for achieving target performance will be 20 per cent of salary rising to a maximum of 40 per cent for exceptional performance: a Share Award, which will be made after the end of the financial year and which will be based on the achievement of Group financial targets.
For Executive Directors the Share Award for achieving target performance will be 30 per cent of salary rising to a maximum of 60 per cent for exceptional performance.
Shares comprised in a Share Award will be held in an employee share trust for a vesting period of three years.
At the end of the vesting period a multiplier will be applied if a performance target is met.
For on target performance the multiplier for Executive Directors will be 1.3 rising to a maximum of two for exceptional performance.
If a participant leaves the Company during the vesting period no multiplier will apply.
On a change of control of the Company the Committee will determine whether the multiplier will apply taking into account the performance from the Award date to the date on which the change of control occurs.
The Committee considers it important that Directors and senior employees focus on delivering annual targets set at the beginning of each year.
Cash Awards and Share Awards will only be made if annual targets are met.
The performance measure for the multiplier will be the growth in fully diluted adjusted Earnings Per Share EPS for the Company.
Targets that will apply for the multiplier in respect of the Awards made after the end of the year to 29 January 2005 will be set at the time the Awards are made.
Further details on the Plan are contained in the Notice of Annual General Meeting sent to shareholders with this Report.
The New Woolworths Group Performance Share Plan Participants under this Plan will be Executive Directors and Directors of subsidiaries.
The Plan will provide for participants to receive an Award of Shares every six months, after the announcement of annual and half-yearly results.
For Executive Directors the value of the shares comprised in each Award will be equal in value to 20 per cent of basic salary at the date the Award is made.
The shares will be held in an employee trust for a vesting period of three years and the Award will only vest if performance targets are met or exceeded.
For exceptional performance the Award may increase to 50 per cent of salary.
The Committee has decided that fully diluted, adjusted Earnings Per Share EPS is the most appropriate performance measure.
It is a clearly understood, published gure, which strips out the effect of exceptional items.
By using a single consistent measure for annual and long-term incentives the participants will be focused on delivering forecast profit targets.
The growth in EPS will be calculated in addition to the increase in the Retail Prices Index and no Award will vest unless the growth in EPS is 6 per cent per annum or more.
At 6 per cent per annum growth the Award will be 10 per cent of salary, and the target Award of 20 per cent will vest if growth in EPS is 8 per cent per annum over three years.
There will be no retesting after the end of the vesting period.
Performance Graph The Committee is required to include a graph showing the Total Shareholder Return TSR for the Company against an appropriate index.
The Committee has decided that the Index of General Retailers is appropriate and for further comparison, the TSR for companies in the FTSE 250 is also shown.
