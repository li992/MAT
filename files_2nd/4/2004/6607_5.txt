Mr Coombe was excluded from the grant of options on 2nd December 2004, as he retires from the company within 12 months of the date of the grant.
An initial grant was made following completion of the merger in March 2001.
The measurement period for the options granted in March 2001 commenced on 1st January 2001.
The measurement periods for options granted in November 2001 and 2002 and December 2003 and 2004 commenced on 1st January 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively.
The Directors hold these options under the various share option plans referred to in Note 36 to the Financial statements, Employee share schemes.
None of the other Directors had an interest in any option over the companys shares.
Following the merger, each of the Directors above elected to exchange their outstanding options in the legacy share option plans for options over GlaxoSmithKline shares.
These Directors, and all other participants in those legacy schemes who made such an election, will receive an additional benefit of a cash sum equal to 10 per cent of the grant price of the original option.
This additional benefit will be given when the new option is exercised or lapses.
Prior to 2003 only those share options granted to Executive Directors were subject to a performance condition.
In order for the options to vest in full, business performance EPS growth, excluding currency and exceptional items, had on average to be at least three percentage points per annum more than the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index over any three-year performance period.
The options granted to Executive Directors in 2003 were subject to the performance conditions as described on pages 46 to 47.
Remuneration Report GlaxoSmithKline 55 In respect of the 2003 grant, if the performance condition is not met after the three-year measurement period, the performance will be measured again over the four financial years following the date of grant of the options.
If the performance condition is not met at the end of four years, the option will lapse.
The options granted to the Executive Directors in 2004 were subject to the same performance condition as set in 2003, but to the extent that the performance conditions have not been met at the end of the three-year performance period, the option will lapse with no retesting being permitted.

An EOI benefit of $335,730 183,459 was paid to Dr Garnier on exercise of these options, this benefit has been included in the table on page 50.
On 14th February 2005, Dr Garnier exercised 79,054 options with an exercise price of $22.07 giving rise to a gain of $2,029,561.
Dr Garnier also received $174,472 in respect of the Exchange Offer Incentive benefit arising on the exercise of these options.
Mr Coombe did not exercise any share options during 2004 or 2003.
Dr Yamada did not exercise any options during 2004.
The highest and lowest closing prices during the year ended 31st December 2004 for GlaxoSmithKline shares were 12.99 and 10.42, respectively.
The highest and lowest prices for GlaxoSmithKline ADSs during the year ended 31st December 2004 were $47.50 and $39.04, respectively.
The market price for a GlaxoSmithKline share on 31st December 2004 was 12.22 31st December 2003 12.80 and for a GlaxoSmithKline ADS was $47.39 31st December 2003 $46.62.
The prices on 25th February 2005 were 12.62 per GlaxoSmithKline share and $48.64 per GlaxoSmithKline ADS.
Mr Coombe was excluded from the grant of awards made on 2nd December 2004 as he retires from the company within 12 months of the date of the grant.
The Performance Share Plan PSP is a medium-term incentive scheme introduced during 2001.
The PSP replaces the Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Mid-Term Incentive Plan operated respectively by Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham.
Under the terms of the PSP the number of shares actually vesting is determined following the end of the relevant three-year measurement period and is dependent on GlaxoSmithKlines performance during that period as described on page 46.
The share awards are granted annually in November or December and the measurement period commences on the following 1st January, ending after three years on 31st December.
The three-year measurement period for the awards with a performance period commencing 1st January 2002, ended on 31st December 2004.
Based on the performance of GlaxoSmithKline during that period, 50 per cent of the award vested in February 2005.
Beginning with the award with a performance period beginning on 1st January 2004, dividends are reinvested on the PSPs awarded to members of the CET.
Under the terms of the PSP, US participants may defer receipt of all or part of their vested awards.
Dr Garnier elected to defer receipt of 34,492 of his awards that vested in 2004 until retirement.
Prior to the performance period beginning 1st January 2004, awards were in two parts: half can be earned by reference to GlaxoSmithKlines TSR performance compared to the FTSE 100, of which the company is a constituent, and the other half of the award is deliverable if the companys business performance EPS growth, excluding currency and exceptional items, is on average at least three percentage points per annum more than the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index over the three-year performance period.
For these awards, if GlaxoSmithKline is ranked in the top 20 of the FTSE 100 based on TSR performance, then all of the shares in this part of the award will vest.
For the 50th position in the FTSE 100, 40 per cent of the shares will vest.
If GlaxoSmithKline is ranked below 50th position, none of the shares, subject to this part of the award, will vest.
Between the 20th and 50th positions, vesting will occur on a sliding scale.
The following vesting table applies to the awards with a performance period from 1st January 2004 to 31st December 2006.
TSR rank with 14 companies & GlaxoSmithKline Percentage of award vesting The performance comparator group for these awards comprised 14 other companies 1 100% and GlaxoSmithKline.
Both Aventis and Sano-Synthelabo were in the comparator 2 100% group prior to their merger to form Sano-Aventis.
For the purposes of calculating TSR over the performance period for the awards granted in December 2003, the 3 90% starting price of the shares of the two individual companies will be compared to the 4 80% price of the merged company at the end of the performance period, adjusted by the 5 70% merger ratio.
Dividends will be treated as having been reinvested during the performance period.
6 60% 7 50% TSR is measured on a pro rata basis.
Where GlaxoSmithKlines performance falls between two of the comparators, the level of vesting will be determined by Median 35% the actual relative level of TSR rather than simple ranking.
Below median 0% Vested and Vested and deferred Dividends deferred participations reinvested participations Mid-Term Incentive Plan ADSs at 31.12.03 in 2004 at 31.12.04 Dr JP Garnier 157,424 5,714 163,138 The Mid-Term Incentive Plan MTIP was a share award scheme operated by SmithKline Beecham.
The plan closed to new entrants upon completion of the merger and no further participations have been granted.
Where a final award of ADSs is made, receipt of the award may be deferred by a Director.
Dr Garnier deferred receipt of the full amounts vested in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003.
The deferred awards, together with any additional ADSs subsequently received through dividend reinvestment, are not included in the Directors interests table on page 53 since they are retained in the MTIP until paid out.
Average Stock Appreciation Rights SARs ADSs At 31.12.03 At 31.12.04 grant price Dr L Shapiro 1,487 1,487 $50.34 All SARs held by Dr Shapiro have a grant price above the market price of a GlaxoSmithKline ADS at year end.
Dr Shapiro is a member of GlaxoSmithKlines scientific Advisory Board SAB.
Dr Shapiro was a member of SmithKline Beechams SAB from 1993 until the completion of the merger with Glaxo Wellcome.
Along with other members of the SAB, she received annual grants of SmithKline Beecham SARs which, in general, vested three years from the date of grant and will expire 10 years from the date of grant.
Grants of SARs to SAB members ceased in 1999.
SARs entitle the holder to a cash sum at a future date based on share price growth between the date of grant and the date of exercise.
Full provision is made in the financial statements for accrued gains on SARs from the date of grant.
In connection with the merger, all previously granted SARs became immediately exercisable.

Pensions for the Executive Directors have been disclosed in the currency in which the pension is payable.
Dr Garnier and Dr Yamada are members of the all employee US cash balance pension plan, under which GlaxoSmithKline makes annual contributions calculated as a percentage of the employees base salary and bonus.
The fund increases at an interest rate set annually in advance based on the 30-year treasury bond rate to provide a cash sum at retirement.
This cash sum is used to purchase a pension at retirement based on the annuity rates applicable at that time.
Neither has entitlement to a spouses pension or to pension increases, other than by reducing their own initial pension.
The normal retirement age under this plan is 65 years of age.
Dr Garniers pension arrangements have been brought into line with the terms of his service agreement and the assumed retirement age reduced to 60.
Similarly Dr Yamadas assumed retirement age has been reduced to 62.
The transfer value, or cash sum, of Dr Garniers plan has increased by $1,548,679 over the year as a result of phased transfers from a previous scheme, the further accumulation of interest and contributions paid by the company.
The transfer value, or cash sum, of Dr Yamadas plan has increased by $220,097 over the year as a result of the further accumulation of interest and contributions paid by the company.
Dr Garnier and Dr Yamada are also members of the US Retirement Savings Plan, a money purchase scheme open to all US employees.
Contributions are invested in a range of funds and the value of the accumulated funds are paid at retirement.
During 2004 contributions of 36,160 $66,173 were paid into this scheme by the company in respect of Dr Garnier, of which 2,240 $4,100 was invested in GlaxoSmithKline shares in a stock ownership account.
In respect of Dr Yamada, contributions of 44,840 $82,057 were paid into the scheme of which 2,240 $4,100 was invested in GlaxoSmithKline shares in a stock ownership account.
The shares held in this account are included within the Directors interests tables on page 53.
Mr Coombes transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The transfer value represents the present value of future payments to be made under the pension plan.
Whilst Mr Coombes annual accrued benefit has increased by 28,206 19,324 excluding the effects of ination, the transfer value has increased by 1,230,000 over the year.
This increase has arisen primarily as a result of the following factors: Mr Coombes pensionable salary increased by 14,850 in 2004.
This has accounted for 7,601 of the increase in his accrued benefit and 169,000 increase in the transfer value of his accrued benefit as at 31st December 2004 Annual increases to transfer values become larger the closer an individual is to retirement.
