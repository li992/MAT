POLICY ON NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS The purpose of the changes is more fully explained in the separate circular to shareholders.
The Non-executive Directors have letters of appointment.
Appointments are for a three year term, which changes will ensure that the Company continues to have available the range of plans it needs to may be extended by mutual agreement.
Non-executive Directors are paid a basic annual fee.
There meet the Companys strategic and commercial requirements at different levels.
The fundamental is the flexibility to pay additional fees for chairing Board Committees or for special duties.
The level executive remuneration policy has not changed.
The key points are: of fees was reviewed during the year and with effect from 1 December 2003 it was decided to the packages must be competitive within the software industry and in the markets in which introduce payments in recognition of the additional duties involved in chairing Board Committees.

In inviting shareholders to approve changes to the Companys share plans, the Committee has in mind the need to bring about a share incentive structure which is less dilutive but no less effective than that operated currently.
The changes will enable Misys to continue to operate within an overall 10% dilution limit.
Additionally, the Committee has introduced a policy under which executive Directors will be expected to build up and maintain a significant holding of shares in the Company equating to no less than 100% of basic salary.
