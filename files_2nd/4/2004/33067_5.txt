REMUNERATION REPORT The Remuneration Report is divided into two sections, audited and unaudited information, in accordance with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.
The audited information may be found on pages 63 to 65.
The Remuneration Committee The compensation of executive directors, members of the GEC and the broad policyfor executive remunerationis determined by the Remuneration Committee whose terms of reference are available on the Companys web site at www.
The Committee comprises Dr. Rolf Stomberg Chairman, Dr Pamela Kirby, Warren Knowlton and Richard fide Schutter.
On behalf of the Board of Directors, it determines the broad policy for executive remuneration.
It reviews: on an annual basis the remuneration, includingpension entitlements, of executive directors and members of the GEC and determines the operation of and the participants in the long-term incentive plans, share option schemes andthe executive bonusplan: the relationshipbetween the  directorsandthat ofotheremployees: the competitiveness of executive remuneration using data from independent consultants on companies of similarsize, :and plans .
The Committee is assisted by Sir Christopher ODonnell, Chief Executive and Paul Williams, Group Human Resources Director, both of whom have advised on all aspects of the Groups reward structures and policies but neither is present at any discussion concerning their own remuneration.
The terms of reference enable the Committeetoobtainits ownexternal adviceonanymatter, at the Companysexpense.
It received information from a number of independent consultants appointed by the Company: Watson Wyatt on a broad range of remuneration issues: Towers Perrin and Hay Group on salary data and  LLP on long-term incentive plan comparative performance.
Watson Wyatt also acts as one of the retirement benefit consultants to the Group and  LLP provided consultancy services to the Group includingproject andtaxation advice.
Remuneration Policy The remuneration policy for 2004 and future years, as approved by the Remuneration Committee, is designed to ensure that remuneration is sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate executive directors and GEC members of a calibre that meets the Groups needs to achieve its business objectives.
Remuneration includes base pay and benefits which are targeted at median competitive levels for acceptable performance and bonus schemes which are designed to motivate and reward for outperformance.
Individual remuneration levels are based on measurable performance against fair and open objectives and there are no automatic pay adjustments unless required by law or local protocol.
Major changes to the remuneration policy are discussed with the .
In 2004, a share based incentive plan, approved by shareholders, was introduced for executive directors, members of the GEC and the next level of senior executives.
The plan comprises a performance share plan, share option plan and co-investment plan and increases the proportion of executives variable reward that is wholly dependent on the Groups performance.
In 2004, excluding pension entitlements, the composition of remuneration for Sir Christopher ODonnell was: base pay fixed 41%, annual bonus variable 17% and long-term incentives variable 42% and for Peter Hooley was base pay fixed 40%, annual bonus variable 16% and long-term incentives variable 44%.
Variable long term incentive values are based on those awards vesting inthe year.
Variable rewards will continue to be provided through a mix of performance related elements: the annual bonus plan relates to achievement of financial objectives: the performance share plan rewards superior total shareholder return relative to the Groups competitors and FTSE-100 companies: and share options reward share pricegrowth.
Senior executives are expected to buildandmaintaina personalequitystake inthe Company.
Executive directors are required to accumulate a personal holding equivalent to 100% of basic salary within five years and members ofthe GEC are   to75% ofbasicsalary withinfive years.
57 The principal components of remuneration of executive directors and GEC members are: basic salary and benefits: performance-related bonus: long-termincentives consistingofa performanceshare plan, co-investment planandshare options:andpensions.
Basic Salary and Benefits Basic salary reflects the responsibility of the positionand .
The Group also provides certain benefits suchas private  .
Performance-Related Bonus For executive directors, the Group operates an annual bonus scheme, 75% of which is based on annual growth in EPSA and 25% of which is based on improvement in return on operating capital employed ROCE.
The scheme is designed to encourage outstanding performance.
In 2004, achievement of 14% EPSA growth and the budgeted improvement in ROCE would have produced a bonus of 30% of annual salary.
Achievement of 20% EPSA growth and ROCE 5.5% over budget would have produced a bonus of 100% of annual salary.
The actual bonus earned in 2004 represented 39.6% of annual salary as 15% EPSA growth, inclusive of an adjustment for the dilution arising on the disposal of AbilityOne, was achieved and the budgeted ROCE was exceeded.
For members of the GEC with corporate responsibilities, excluding executive directors, the annual bonus plan is linked to earnings per share, ROCE and personal objectives.
For those members with specific business unit responsibilities, targets are linkedtoEPSA andsales,  oftheirrespective business unit.
Long-Term Incentives New Plan approved by Shareholdersin May 2004 i Performance Share Plan Annual awards over shares are made under the 2004 Performance Share Plan after the announcement of the preliminary results and only vest if defined levels of total shareholder returns are attained over three years beginninginthe yearofaward.
The award shares are divided equally into two tranches so as to measure total shareholder return TSR relative to the FTSE-100 and the major companies in the medical devices industry.
TSR performance against both the FTSE-100 companies and the major companies in the medical devices industry was identified as the most suitable measure to encourage high levels of business performance and align the interests of the Group, its .

If, in relation to either tranche, the Group ranks at or above the median, 25% of the award of that tranche will vest and if the th th Group is at the 75 centile, then all of the shares of that tranche will vest.
Between the median and 75 centiles, th the shares will vest on a straight-line basis.
If the Group is above the 75 centile, then the number of shares increases above the award on a straight-line basis up to a maximum of 150% of the award if the Group is ranked th at orabove the 90 centile.
58 In relation to awards made to executive directors, the initial market value of the award shares is equivalent to their basic annual salary and in relation to awards made to other GEC members the initial market value of the awards isequivalent to75% .
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to reduce the number or percentage of shares which vest, if, notwithstanding the Group is ranked at or above the median level in respect of either tranche of award shares, the Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that the growth in the Groups TSR achieved is not a genuine reflection of the Groups underlying financial performance.

ii ExecutiveShare Options In 2004, share options were granted under the 2004 Executive Share Option Plan.
Under this plan, the maximum market value of options which may be granted each year is equivalent to the basic annual salary of the executive director or executive.
Options are exercisable up to ten years from the date of grant and are only exercisable if graduated target levels of growth in EPSA over the three-year performance period are achieved, beginning with that inwhichthe optionisgranted.
The target levels of performance are set by the  foreachgrant.
For2004theywere: 25% of the option shares will vest if growth in EPSA over the three-year period ending 31 December 2006 is or exceeds 26% i. e. 8% compounded annually with 50% vesting if such growth is at least 48% i. e. 14% compounded annually.
Only if growth in EPSA over that period exceeds 73% i. e. 20% compoundedannually will all of the option shares vest.
Option shares will vest pro rata on a straight-line basis if growth in EPSA is between these levels.
iii Co-investment Plan The 2004 Co-investment Plan enables selected executives to take part of their annual bonus in the form of shares.
The participant elects the level of bonus to be used for this purpose up to a maximum of one half of the annual gross bonus capped at 20% of basic annual salary for executive directors and members of GEC.
The net amountofthe gross amountelected willthenbe used topurchaseshares.
If such shares are held for three years, and the participant remains employed within Smith & Nephew, the participant will be entitled to matching shares if the Company achieves a target level of growth in EPSA over that three-year period of at least 48% i. e. 14% p. a. compounded annually.
At this level, the participant is entitled to one matchingshare for every share acquiredoutofthe gross equivalent amountofthe net bonusused toacquire shares.
If growth in EPSA is 60% or more i. e. 17% p. a. compounded annually the participant is entitled to two matching shares for each share acquired out of the gross equivalent amount of the net bonus applied to shares.
There is no sliding scale nor pro rata vesting of matching awards between these performance levels, nor is there anyretesting.
The performance criteria for all incentive schemes will be reviewed in 2005 to achieve a consistent measurement  .
In the event of a change of control of the Company, for the 2004 Plans, the Remuneration Committee will determine what proportion of the awards or options will vest and what proportion of the matching shares will be transferred to the executives having regard to both the proportion of the performance period and the performanceofthe Companyoverthat period.
59 The following table provides a comparison of variable remuneration of executive directors and GEC members and the next level down i. e. business unit management shown as a percentage of salary.
Except for the annual bonus, the componentsare measured overa three yearperiod.

The last award through the LTIP was in 2003 and will vest at the end of 2005.
Under the plan, shares are transferred to participants depending on the Groups performance relative to a group of 43 UK listed manufacturing companies with substantial international activities, using TSR over a three-year period as the prime measure.
The maximum value of shares awarded for executive directors has not exceeded the participants annual rate of basic salary at the date the award was granted, andformembers ofthe GEC ithas not exceeded 75% of their annual basic salary.
Shares will only be transferred to the participants if the Groups TSR performance is at or above the median performance of the comparator companies, and growth in the Groups EPSA exceeds growth in the United Kingdom Retail Price Index RPI in the same three-year period.
At the median level, 25% of the award shares will vest.
If the Groups performance is in the top quartile, all the shares will vest.
For performancebetween the medianandthe top quartile, the proportionofshares vesting willvaryona straight-line basis.
TSR subject to real EPSA growth was identified and selected as the performance conditionthat represented a fairmeasure ofthe  .
th For the three-year plan period commencing 2002, the Groups TSR of 58.79% was ranked 10 in the comparator group and the earnings per share performance criterion was met, enabling the plan participants to be eligible for 100% ofthe shares awarded conditionallyin2002.
Every encouragement is given to executive directors and senior managers to build up a significant shareholding in the Group.
Accordingly, participants in the LTIP who have not left the Group will, at the fifth and seventh anniversariesofthe date ofthe award, be  forevery five soretained.

60 ExecutiveShare Option Plans establishedpriorto the new 2004 Plan and for which executivesincluded in the New 2004 Plan are not eligible Prior to 2004, executive directors were last granted executive share options in 1996.
These were not subject to performance conditions of exercise.
Members of the GEC were last granted options in 2001.
Under the 2001 UK Approved Share Option Plan, the 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan and the 2001 US Share Plan, the Remuneration Committee each year determines the maximum value of options to be granted to executives by reference to multiples of salary.
In 2004, the maximum multiples applied were one times remuneration in the UK andoneanda half times remunerationinthe US.
With the exception of the 2001 US Share Plan, the exercise of options is subject to EPSA growth of not less than RPI plus 3% per annum, on average, in a period of three consecutive years.
From 2005, the retesting of the performance conditions will no longer apply.
Performance conditions were selected to be in line with market practice at the time.
Options granted under the 2001 US Share Plan, in line with US market practice, are not subject to performance targets but are exercisable cumulatively up to a maximum of 10% after one year, 30% after twoyears, 60% after three years andthe  fouryears.
Executive share options under all schemes are not offered at a discount to the market value at the time of grant.
Forthe 2001OptionPlans, all optionswillvest ona changeincontrol.
Share Save Schemes UK executive directors and members of the GEC are eligible to contribute to the Smith & Nephew Employee Share Option Scheme ShareSave and US members of the GEC are eligible to participate in the Employee Stock PurchasePlan.
Pensions Executive directors and the UK based members of GEC have a normal retirement age of 62.
Those in service pre- 2003 participate in the defined benefit Smith & Nephew UK Pension Fund and UK Executive Pension Scheme, under which pension has been accrued in the year at an annual rate of one-thirtieth of final pensionable salary up to a limit based on service of two-thirds of final pensionable salary, subject to Inland Revenue constraints.
Pensions in payment are guaranteed to increase by 5% per annum or the rate of inflation in the UK, if lower.
Death in service cover of four times salary and spouses pension at the rate of two thirds of the members pension are provided on death.
Those  2002participate inthe defined contribution plan.
Death in service cover of seven times salary of which four times is provided as a lump sum is provided on death.
A supplementary unfunded defined contribution arrangement partially compensates for the UK Inland Revenue .
The Remuneration Committee has considered the implications of the impending changes to UK pensions taxation.
At this stage, the Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that a non-pensionable non-bonusable salary supplement will be offered as an alternative where an executive does not wish to have further pension provision.
Sucha salary supplement wouldbe costneutraltothe Company.
The US based members of GEC participate in either the defined benefit Smith & Nephew US Pension Plan or the defined contribution US Savings Plan 401 k Plus.
Any new executives would enter the US Savings Plan 401 k Plus.
Under the US Pension Plan, pensions accrue at an annual rate of approximately one-sixty second of final pensionable salary up to a limit based on service of 60% of final pensionable salary.
The plan also provides for a spouses pension at the rate of one half of the members pension on death.
Normal retirement age under the plan is 65.
A supplementary defined benefit plan is used to enable defined benefits to be payable from age 62 without reduction for early retirement as for UK executives.
A supplementary defined contribution plan is used to compensate for the earnings cap imposed by the US Internal Revenue Code and to provide additional retirement benefits.
The Remuneration Committee considers pension consequences and costs to the Company when determining basicsalary  directorsandmembers ofGEC.
ServiceContracts Executive directors, in line with Group policy, are appointed on contracts terminable by the Group on not more than twelve months notice.
All new appointments of executive directors are intended to have twelve monthnotice periods, but it is recognised that for some appointments a longer periodmayinitiallybe necessary forcompetitive reasons, reducingtotwelve monthsthereafter.
61 Sir Christopher ODonnell, appointed to the Board of Directors in September 1992, has a service agreement with nd the Company dated January 1992 which expires on his 62 birthday in October 2008.
Peter Hooley, appointed to the Board of Directors in April 1991 has a service contract with the Company dated January 1992 which nd expires on his 62 birthday in June 2008.
Both service agreements are terminable by the Company on not more than twelve months notice and by the executive director on six months notice.
There is no enhancement of termination rights on a change of control of the Group.
Termination of the contract by the Group, except for cause, would entitle the executive directors to twelve months basic salary, bonus at target of 30%, a contribution of 30% of salary to reflect the loss of pension benefits, an amount to cover other benefits and a time apportionment of the performance share plan entitlement.
The Committee has determined not to amend the contracts of the current executive directors for mitigation but will review for the appointment of new executive directors.
External  Non-executive directorships provide executive directors with valuable experience beneficial to the Company.
Such appointments are subject to the approval of the Nominations Committee and are restricted to one  director.
All fees receivable bya directorare paid tothe Company.
 Non-executive directors do not have service contracts but instead have letters of appointment.
Non-executive directors are normally appointed for three terms of three years terminable at will, without notice by either the Group or the director and without compensation.
The Chairman has a three month notice period.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Nominations Committee who aim to set fees that are competitive with other companies of equivalent size and complexity.
Non-executive directors are expected to accumulate a personalholdinginthe Companyequivalent toonetimes annualbasicfee, withinthree years.
In 2004, the Nominations Committee recommended, and the Board confirmed, a payment structure comprising an additional 5,000 to the Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and 5,000 to the Senior Independent .
