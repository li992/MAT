These include performance-related elements to align the interests of directors and shareholders and to motivate the highest performance.
The policy requires the highest level of performance from executives, based on individual performance assessments by the Chief Executive and the Chairman, and by reference to pay levels in similar companies.
Independent professional advice is sought by the Remuneration Committee from time to time to ensure that the policy remains appropriate.
Such advice was last sought, from the Monks Partnership, in January 2003.
No other services have been obtained from these external advisers during the year.

The levels of bonus are determined by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account both the level of profit and other personal targets.
Executive directors were eligible to receive a maximum bonus of 70% of salary in 2004, payable on the achievement by the company of a demanding budget for profit for the year to 30th November 2004, and on the achievement of a number of personal targets, set individually for each executive director.
These include the achievement of a target net asset value per share, creation of a development programme for future years, support for the regional offices, and replacement of land used.
The Chairman makes recommendations to the Remuneration Committee for the levels of bonus payable to executive directors other than himself for the achievement of these personal targets, and the levels of bonus payable are set by the the Remuneration Committee.
Annual bonuses do not form part of pensionable pay.
For the year to 30th November 2004, the annual bonuses paid to directors as a percentage of annual salary were as follows:- Anthony Glossop 70%: Bill Oliver 70%: Richard Froggatt 65%: Tim Haywood 50% Deferred bonus In order to continue to attract and retain key executives, and to align their interests with those of shareholders, the board believes that long-term incentives should form an important part of a competitive benefits package.
Consequently a performance-related bonus scheme is in place for the executive directors, other than the Chairman.
Under the terms of the scheme, the annual performance bonus paid will be matched and this amount held for payment at the end of three years.
Payment of this deferred amount will be subject to the companys net asset value growth over the relevant three year period exceeding RPI plus 5% per annum and the continued employment by the company of the director concerned except in certain circumstances, such as death during the deferral period.
The amounts payable to directors in February 2008 in respect of the deferred bonus scheme are as follows:- Bill Oliver 175,000: Richard Froggatt 123,000: Tim Haywood 77,500.
Share options The Remuneration Committee is responsible for supervising the companys Executive Share Option and Savings Related Share Option schemes in accordance with rules previously approved by shareholders.
Executive directors as well as other senior employees are granted options over the companys shares.
For options granted in 2004 under the companys Executive Share Option Scheme, as in other recent awards the performance target set was 5% per annum real growth in net asset value per share over the three year period from the date of grant.
This target was selected to incentivise executives to aim for the continued long-term growth of the company, whilst delivering the shortand medium-term results which are the principal focus of the annual bonus schemes.
Performance against these targets is objectively assessed from the audited accounts of the company.
Executive directors may also participate in the companys savings-related share schemes on the same terms as all other employees.
The highest price during the year was 330p and the lowest price was 230p.
For executive share option schemes, the exercise price of options granted in the year is the market price at the date of grant.
For savings related schemes, the exercise price is 90% of the average market price for the three days prior to the grant.
