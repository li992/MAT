Directors remuneration report The directors remuneration report describes Candovers remuneration policy, the role of its remuneration committee and sets out the directors remuneration for the year ended 31st December, 2004.
It will be put to shareholders for approval by ordinary resolution at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 10th May, 2005.
Audited sections of the directors remuneration report are the tables of directors remuneration and pension contributions.
Remuneration committee Composition and operation The remuneration committee consists entirely of non-executive directors.
At 31st December, 2004 its members were Messrs Grimstone chairman, Hichens, West, Wilson, Lethbridge and Russell.
Mr Russell joined the remuneration committee on 28th June, 2004.
The remuneration committee, which usually meets twice a year and more often if necessary, supports the board by reviewing the remuneration policy and determining the level of remuneration of the executive directors of the Company, as well as the senior management of the Group.
Its written terms of reference are available on the Companys website.
In 2004, the remuneration committee met on two occasions with full attendance at each meeting.
No member of the remuneration committee has any personal financial interests or conflicts of interest other than as shareholders.
In this regard, the remuneration committee gives full consideration to the provisions of the Revised Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
Professional advice During the period, the remuneration committee received at the Companys expense professional advice from Grant Thornton, the Companys auditors and tax advisers, and Ashurst, the Companys lawyers.
Candover participates in the annual Towers Perrin remuneration survey of the private equity industry, the results of which are reviewed by the remuneration committee, to ensure that the Companys remuneration policy remains in line with market trends and practice.
Mr Curran also attends meetings at the committees invitation, except when the committee discusses his remuneration.
Remuneration policy The Companys policy in regard to directors remuneration is designed to ensure that the Company maintains competitive remuneration packages in order to recruit, retain and motivate executives of exceptional quality in the overall interest of shareholders.
The remuneration policy detailed below is that applied in the year ended 31st December, 2004 and is intended to remain the same for the next and subsequent financial years, but it will be kept under review by the remuneration committee.
The executive directors remuneration package comprises both fixed and variable elements and is set out under the following main headings: Base salary Performance related bonuses Directors share options Pension Employee benefit trust Base salary This is a fixed component of executive directors compensation.
Base salaries are reviewed annually by the committee after considering the relative salary levels within the industry, the estimated movement in net assets and the profits for the year.
The committee did not increase executive directors salaries for the year ended 31st December, 2004.
Candover Report and accounts 2004 29 Directors remuneration report continued Performance related bonus The policy is to offer the executive directors the opportunity to earn performance related bonuses.
These annual performance related bonuses, which are usually paid in two instalments, are determined by the remuneration committee after due consideration, at each half year stage, of the profit and net asset performance, operational achievements of the Company including progress on investments and realisations, and the external market.
The performance of each executive director is then determined under the appraisal system operated by the Company.
During the year ended 31st December, 2004, Messrs Curran and Fairservice received bonus payments.
These amounts are shown under performance related pay in the table of directors emoluments below.
2 It is Candovers policy to provide certain other benefits which form part of the usual employment package for the recruitment of employees.
These include death in service and health insurance arrangements which are complementary to the pension arrangements.
Executive directors are provided with a company car or equivalent cash benefit.
Other small benefits in kind may also be provided during the year to executive directors.
3 The non-executive directors receive fees which in one case is paid directly to their primary employing company and do not receive any other remuneration.
Amounts paid to third parties on behalf of non-executive directors are shown on page 33.
4 Mr Scott Plummer retired on 14th May, 2003 and therefore received his fee of 27,500 p. a. pro rated in accordance with time served on the board in 2003.
5 With effect from the Annual General Meeting on 12th May, 2004, Mr Grimstone became Deputy Chairman in place of Messrs Hichens and Fairservice.
6 Mr Russell became a director with effect from 12th May, 2004.
30 Candover Report and accounts 2004 Directors share options The Candover 1994 executive share option scheme, which was approved by shareholders on 3rd May, 1994 closed to new grants in July 2004.
In the year ended 31st December, 2004 no share options were granted to directors and no share options were exercised.
As at 31st December, 2004 none of the executive directors held any share options.
A schedule of directors interests in shares is shown on page 52.
Pension Candover operates a non-contributory money purchase pension scheme for its executives and there were no changes to this arrangement during the year.
Contributions in respect of members are payable as a percentage of base salary only and these are adjusted at the appropriate time to reflect increases in salary.
There is no pension promise under the Candover scheme.
Every three years the scheme is subject to actuarial review and a review was last completed on the executive pension scheme for the three years to 31st December, 2002 with the next review being due for the three years to 31st December, 2005.
The present contribution rates that were set in 1998 are related to the age of the individual.
Actual contributions paid during the year in respect of the directors are shown below.
2004 2003 S W Curran 138,000 138,000 G D Fairservice 106,000 106,000 Total 244,000 244,000 Both the executive directors, with the approval of the remuneration committee, operate funded unapproved retirement benefit schemes FURBS, although there have been no payments made into these FURBS during the year ended 31st December, 2004.
Employee Benefit Trust The 2001 Fund Employee Benefit Trust 2001 Fund EBT, which was established as part of the arrangements constituting the 2001 Fund, coinvests alongside the Company and the 2001 Fund under a co-investment agreement dated 13th June, 2001.
Messrs Curran and Fairservice together with Group executives are potential beneficiaries of the 2001 Fund EBT.
During the year ended 31st December, 2004, Candover paid 2,253,604 into the 2001 Fund EBT, and the trustees of the 2001 Fund EBT have invested a total of 3,625,327 in nine investments.
Other incentive arrangements The remuneration committee also periodically reviews other incentive arrangements that have been made available to directors and executives and that are customary in the private equity industry.
Details of these arrangements are also set out below.
Investors in third party funds managed by Candover Partners Limited expect executives who manage those funds to participate in various incentive arrangements that are accepted practice in the private equity industry.
These arrangements, commonly known as carried interest arrangements, are reviewed by the remuneration committee periodically but not on an annual basis.
Although Candover has received advice that these arrangements do not give rise to emolument of office or employment, they have been included in this report for the purpose of completeness.
Messrs Curran and Fairservice had, during the year, a beneficial interest in the carried interest arrangements in the Limited Partnerships comprising the 1991 Fund, the 1994 Fund, the 1997 Fund and the 2001 Fund the Funds.
In order to align the executive directors participation in the above carried interest with those of the third party investors in those Funds, certain performance conditions are applied, whereby any gains achieved through the carried interest associated with these Funds are conditional upon a certain minimum return being generated for investors.
The attainment of this minimum return is subject to independent verification by KPMG in their capacity as auditors to the Funds.
These carried interest gains are paid by the Funds out of profits made by those Funds and are not a charge on the profits of Candover.
Under a co-investment scheme Messrs Curran and Fairservice were permitted during the year to make an investment in the ordinary equity of companies in which Candover has also made an investment in the equity and loan capital.
Under the Listing Rules, these interests are covered by the rules governing Transactions with Related Parties.
In view of the insignificant level of these transactions by the above named directors, the fair and reasonable opinion of the Companys auditors is not required.

This is compared against the return performance achieved by the FTSE AllShare Total Return Index and the FTSE 250 Total Return Index.
As changes in the Companys market capitalisation may result in Candovers inclusion in either of these indices, it has been considered appropriate to measure the Companys performance against both.

These recommendations are then put to a meeting of the board for approval, with non-executive directors abstaining from any vote.
For the year ended 31st December, 2004, there was no increase in the level of fees paid to non-executive directors.
Any non-executive directors fees payable by investee companies of Candover for the services of Candover directors and executives who serve on these boards as official appointees of either Candover, or its managed funds, are always paid to the Company for its benefit or that of the fund investors, whichever is appropriate.
It is intended that these policies will remain the same for the next and subsequent financial years but will be kept under review by the Companys board.
Termination payments and payments to third parties No payments were made to a director of the Company for termination of employment.
A payment to a third party for directors services during the year was made in the case of Mr West, for whom 21,250 was paid to Jimmy West Associates Limited.
This amount is included in the directors fees shown in the directors emolument schedule on page 30.
