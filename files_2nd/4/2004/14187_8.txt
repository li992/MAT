Up to 100% Retail Price Index RPI plus 15% The Committee considers that this measure is a reliable and for executive Directors appropriate measure of the Companys performance and that the RPI plus 9% for all other employees FTSE 100 is an appropriate benchmark given that the Company 101% to 200% RPI plus 15% is a member of the Index.

The Remuneration Committee decided, and after consultation with some of the Companys major institutional shareholders in 2003, that for options granted under the scheme no shares vest if Shires TSR is below the median of the FTSE 100. from 2004 onwards, the performance condition should be retested once only, at five years after the grant.
The retest will be applied only where Shires EPS growth has not met the minimum performance test described above.
The annual average growth required over the first three years must be achieved over the extended performance period.
Hence the level of EPS growth in the next two years needs to be consequentially higher to meet the test.

278 4,676 Directors and employees have been granted options over ordinary shares under the Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme Parts A and B 2000 Executive Scheme, the Shire Holdings Limited Share Option Scheme SHL Scheme, the Pharmavene 1991 Stock Option Plan SLI Plan, the Shire Pharmaceuticals Executive Share Option Scheme Parts A and B Executive Scheme, the Shire Pharmaceuticals Sharesave Scheme Sharesave Scheme, the Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Employee Stock Purchase Plan Stock Purchase Plan, the Roberts Stock Option Plan Roberts Plan and the BioChem Stock Option Plan BioChem Plan.
For those options, which remained unexercised during the year, no payment was made by any Director in consideration of the grant award.
There have been no variations to the terms and conditions or performance criteria for share options during 2004, except as iii stated in Note below as regards retesting.
Notes i Options granted under the Executive Scheme are subject to performance criteria and cannot be exercised in full, unless the Companys share price increases at a compound rate of at least 20.5% per annum over a minimum three-year measurement period.
If the Companys share price increases at a compound rate of 14.5% per annum over a minimum three-year measurement period, 60% of the options may be exercised.
If these conditions are not met after the initial three years, they are thereafter tested quarterly by reference to share price growth over the extended period.
If the share price does not meet these conditions at any time, none of the options will become exercisable.
ii Options granted under the Sharesave Scheme are granted with an exercise price equal to 80% of the mid-market price on the day before invitations are issued to employees.
Employees may enter into three or five-year savings contracts.
The exercise of options under this Scheme is not subject to any performance criteria.
iii Options granted under the 2000 Executive Scheme vest six weeks prior to the expiry date.
Options granted under this scheme are subject to performance criteria.
In respect of any option granted prior to August 2002, if Shires share price increases at a compound rate of at least 20.5% per annum over a minimum three-year measurement period, the option will be exercisable in full.
If it increases by at least 14.5% per annum over the same three-year measurement period, the option may be exercised on 60% of the shares covered by the option.
If these conditions are not met after the initial three-year measurement period, they will thereafter be tested quarterly by reference to compound annual share price growth over an extended period.
The performance criteria were reviewed in 2002 to ensure the criteria reflected the market in which Shire operates.
Given Shires development it was considered appropriate that an EPS based measure should be adopted in place of share price growth targets.
Therefore, the performance criteria was amended so that an option would only become exercisable in full if Shires EPS growth over a three year period from the date of award exceeds the UK Retail Price Index RPI on average a year for the following tranches of grants: Options with a grant value of up to 100% of salary RPI plus 3% Directors, RPI plus 5% Between 101% and 200% of salary RPI plus 5% Between 201% and 300% of salary RPI plus 7% Over 301% of salary RPI plus 9% The new EPS performance criteria apply to options granted under the 2000 Executive Scheme from August 2002.
After consultation with some of its institutional shareholders, the Company has decided that for options granted under the scheme from 2004 onwards, the performance condition should be retested once only, at five years after the grant.
The retest will be applied only where Shires EPS growth has fallen short of the minimum annual average percentage increase over the three-year period from grant.
The EPS used will be the fully diluted EPS calculated under US GAAP reporting.
iv Following the acquisition of BioChem on 11 May 2001, the BioChem Plan was amended such that options over BioChems common stock became options over ordinary shares of the Company.
All BioChem options, which were not already exercisable, vested and became exercisable as a result of the acquisition and were not subject to any performance conditions.
