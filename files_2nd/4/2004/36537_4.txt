The information contained in paragraphs 3, 6 and 7 below is subject to audit in accordance with the Regulations.
1 The Remuneration Committee The Committee The Board has appointed a Remuneration Committee which meets no less than twice a year to consider, for recommendation to the Board, company policy on the remuneration of executive directors and to approve the composition and level of remuneration of executive directors and certain senior executives.
The Board has accepted, without amendment, the Committees recommendations relating to remuneration policy.
The Committee currently comprises R J O Barton Chairman, J C Clare, J F Nelson and G F Pimlott.
2 Remuneration Policy In determining an appropriate remuneration policy for recommendation to the Board, the Committees objective is to ensure that the Company continues to be able to attract, retain and motivate experienced individuals, capable of making a major contribution to Hammersons success.
Remuneration for executive directors and senior executives takes account of performance through an annual performance related bonus scheme and, for long term performance, by the award of shares under the Deferred Share Plan.
To assist the Committee in determining remuneration policy, the Committee has received advice from Hay Group who have been appointed by the Committee and who provide no other services to the Company.
In addition, although they are not members of the Committee, information and advice has been provided and recommendations have been made by R R Spinney, R J G Richards other than in respect of his own position and by the groups Director of Human Resources, E A Houlihan.
In implementing the policy, following its approval by the Board, the Committee takes into account remuneration packages available within other comparable companies, the Companys overall performance, achievement of corporate objectives, individual performance and published views of investors and their representatives.
3 Remuneration of Executive Directors and Senior Executives The remuneration packages for senior staff, including executive directors, consist of the following elements and are structured to relate reward to corporate and individual performance.
Details of all payments to executive directors, which are disclosed in the table in paragraph 6 on pages 15 and 16 show the relative values of basic and performance related elements of remuneration.
i Basic Salary and Benefits Basic salaries for executive directors and other senior executives are reviewed by the Committee, normally annually or otherwise on promotion, having regard to responsibility, competitive market practice, company and individual performance and independently compiled salary survey information.
Benefits include the use of a company car or the provision of a car allowance, medical insurance and life assurance cover.
Details of directors emoluments are given in paragraph 6 on pages 15 and 16. ii Annual Performance Related Bonus Scheme Full time staff throughout the Company, including executive directors, participate in a performance related bonus scheme.
Payments under the scheme are based on the achievement of profit, net asset value and operational targets, which are set such that they are both relevant to the specific circumstances of the Company and designed to enhance performance.
Such payments, which are not pensionable, are agreed by the Remuneration Committee and take account of individual performance, seniority and responsibilities.
The amount payable to executive directors in any one year could be up to 85% of their basic salary, with part of the payment receivable in shares in the Company of which half vest two years after the date of grant.
Between 1 January 2004 and 1 March 2005 the following shares were issued to executive directors under the bonus scheme: Number of shares 17 March 1 March 2004 2005 R J G Richards 5,036 3,939 J A Bywater 2,786 2,346 P W B Cole 3,221 2,489 G Devaux 2,379 1,575 S R Melliss 3,850 2,762 12 iii Pensions The UK resident executive directors are members of the Companys non-contributory pension scheme, details of which are set out in note 5 to the financial statements on pages 28 to 30. iv Deferred Share Plan Executive directors and selected senior executives may be awarded shares under the Hammerson plc Deferred Share Plan the Plan.
The Plan was established to align the rewards received by participants to the Companys financial performance and provide them with the opportunity to build a holding of shares in the Company.
The Committee approves awards under the Plan by way of nil cost options.
Under the terms of the Plan, the actual number of shares to be awarded to participants in respect of grants made between 2000 and 2002 has been determined by reference to the average annual return on equity achieved over a three year performance period on a straightline basis between 7.5% and 20%.
Following shareholder approval on 6 May 2004, the performance target is now based on the comparative total shareholder return performance of the Company against a peer group of the eight largest quoted UK property companies, including Hammerson.
There will be no vesting of shares unless the Companys performance is in the top half of the comparator group and there will be a progressive vesting schedule according to the Companys ranking within the top half of the comparator group as follows: Ranking % of shares awarded 1st 100.00 2nd 83.33 3rd 66.67 4th 50.00 The annual value of awards under the Plan are set to a maximum of 95% of salary.
The Plan is administered by a Trustee which has acquired 700,000 shares, financed by drawing down 3,191,381 of interest free loan facilities of 3,300,000 from the Company, to satisfy the issue of shares to participants under the Plan and under the Annual Performance Related Bonus Scheme referred to in paragraph 3 ii above.
Following earlier transfers of shares to participants the Trustee now holds 605,408 shares.
Under the terms of the Trust, the Trustee is obliged to waive dividends on this holding of shares, except for a nominal amount.
At 31 December 2004 the maximum number of shares which could be awarded to executive directors under all grants made under the Plan to date was as follows: Maximum number of shares Date of grant 3 April 2002 26 September 2003 11 May 2004 R J G Richards 55,618 55,822 55,165 J A Bywater 32,818 33,288 31,523 P W B Cole 32,818 33,288 33,672 G Devaux 36,272 36,702 32,956 S R Melliss 42,318 42,677 38,687 The average annual return on equity achieved during the three year performance period relating to the grant made on 3 April 2002 was 11.89%, resulting in 31.77% of the maximum number of shares vesting.
Accordingly, in respect of the grant made on 3 April 2002, the executive directors now have interests over nil cost options exercisable until 30 June 2005 as follows: Number of nil cost options R J G Richards 17,669 J A Bywater 10,426 P W B Cole 10,426 G Devaux 11,523 S R Melliss 13,444 Following the introduction of the Plan, participants are no longer eligible for grants of options under the Companys share option schemes which are described below.
13 Remuneration Report continued v Share Options Employees, including executive directors prior to the introduction of the Deferred Share Plan, have been granted share options under the Hammerson plc 1995 Approved and Unapproved Share Option Schemes.
No payment is made by participants in consideration for the grant of options.
The Unapproved Scheme was established to allow the grant of options where the cumulative value of subsisting options as at the date of their grant is in excess of 30,000.
The Committee approves grants, which are phased, of share options under the schemes.
Both schemes are subject to performance targets and restrictions which the Board considers to be a realistic test of management performance and which are designed with a view to securing the long term growth of the Company.
Options can be exercised only if the rate of increase in the Companys earnings per share over any three year period is at least 6% in excess of the rate of increase in the Retail Price Index during that period.
No variations have been made to the rules of the Scheme since it was implemented.
At the Annual General Meeting shareholders will be asked to approve the renewal of and alteration to the Scheme, which expires in 2005, together with the introduction of a Share Incentive Plan.
The proposals for both these schemes are explained in the circular to shareholders which accompanies the Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements.
4 Share Ownership Guidelines All directors are encouraged to own shares in the Company.
The Deferred Share Plan and the Annual Performance Related Bonus Scheme are designed to encourage executive directors, over a period of time, to acquire a shareholding of equal value to their salary.
5 Service Agreements R J G Richards, J A Bywater, P W B Cole and S R Melliss have service agreements which may be terminated by the Company on 12 months notice.
These agreements were entered into on 28 February 2002.

He is based in Paris and, in accordance with French employment legislation, has a service agreement as an employee and director with a French subsidiary of the Company with a notice period of three months, but under which any payment made in the event of termination at short notice is subject to a minimum of 12 months and a maximum of 21 months.
The Chairman and the non-executive directors do not have service contracts with the Company.
Their appointments are governed by letters of appointment which are available for inspection on request.
The Chairmans appointment, which is subject to 12 months notice, was initially for the period ending 30 September 2003, but following review by the executive directors and the non-executive directors was extended to 30 September 2005 when he will retire as a director and Chairman of the Company.

16 7 Pensions The UK resident executive directors all participate in the Companys pension scheme, more fully described in note 5 to the financial statements on pages 28 to 30, which provides pension and other benefits.
Pension entitlements, which are based on basic salary, are subject to restrictions imposed by the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.

In the case of J A Bywater and S R Melliss, pension arrangements to contractual retirement age of 60 are provided under the scheme.
In addition, in the case of J A Bywater, provision is made by way of an unfunded commitment to ensure a pension of 1 30th of final salary for each year of pensionable service and in the case of S R Melliss, provision in respect of pensionable salary above the restriction is paid to a money purchase arrangement.
G Devaux also participates in the unfunded pension scheme to obtain the same overall level of pension provision as other executive directors.
No pension arrangements are made by the Company for non-executive directors.
