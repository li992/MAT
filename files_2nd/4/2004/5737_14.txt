TSR is dened as share price growth plus reinvested dividends.
The FTSE 350 index excluding investment companies was selected as the appropriate broad equity market index for that period as Exel is a constituent member.

Base salary is the only element of remuneration which is pensionable.
5.3 Executive Incentive Plan The Remuneration Committee approves the maximum award levels under the annual EIP and the business and financial measures against which performance will be assessed.
The maximum level of award in 2004 was 75% of base salary.
The performance conditions were the growth in profit before tax of the business units and the Companys growth in EPS.
These two measures are key performance indicators for Exel and are used to manage the business.
Bonuses paid to executive Directors for 2004 ranged from 67% to 100% of maximum, reecting the differences in the level of yearon-year performance by the Company and, where applicable, each region.

The FURBS is currently being wound up.
David Riddle is not affected by the earnings cap.
Bruce Edwards is a participant in the qualied and non-qualied Exel Inc retirement programmes, which are dened contribution plans.
US legislation in respect of qualied retirement plans provides that, for 2004, a maximum of US$200,000 of salary can be used to calculate employer contributions towards the programme.
There are other applicable levels and limits that further restrict the amount of employer and employee contributions to qualied plans.
Bruce Edwards benets are accordingly provided through a qualied plan and also a non-qualied plan, to which contributions are paid in excess of the limits.
Bruce Edwards benets in the combined plans provide for an overall matched employer contribution of up to 5% of remuneration per annum.
In addition, he is eligible for an annual profit sharing contribution which is paid into his qualied plan account.
Further information on executive Directors pensions is shown in the table on page 46.
Executive Directors are provided with cars or car allowances and other benets in line with competitive practice.
These benets are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee from time to time.
5.6 Contracts and termination provisions Other than John Pattullo, all contracts with executive Directors are rolling and subject to a maximum of 12 months notice of termination if given by the Company and six months notice of termination if given by the executive Director.
John Pattullos contract is rolling and subject to a maximum of 12 months notice of termination if given by the Company and six months notice of termination if given by the executive Director.
However, a longer notice period will operate for the first two years of John Pattullos employment.
If his employment is terminated on or after 1 March 2005, then the Company shall be obliged to give John Pattullo 24 months notice of termination and he shall be obliged to give the Company six months notice.
If his employment is terminated on or after 1 March 2006, the 24 month notice period will be reduced by one month for each month of employment.
From 1 March 2007 onwards, the Company shall be obliged to give John Pattullo 12 months notice of termination and he shall be obliged to give the Company six months notice.
This longer notice period for a limited time was considered necessary and appropriate in relation to a candidate of such a high calibre.
The Company may elect to terminate the employment of any executive Director by making a payment to him calculated by reference to the value of salary and bonus entitlements, enhancing his pension and continuing to provide his other contractual benets or making payments in lieu thereof which he would have received during the unexpired proportion of the notice period the Compensation.
All contracts with executive Directors other than John Pattullo provide for the payment of liquidated damages calculated in the same manner as the Compensation in the event of a the early termination of the contract by the Company within 12 months of a change of control: or b the executive Director serving a 60 day counter notice on the Company within five months of the Company serving 12 months notice on him.
In addition, John Allan and David Riddle are both entitled to liquidated damages calculated in the same manner as the Compensation in the event that they are constructively dismissed, dismissed by the Company in breach of contract or terminate their contract within one month of a change of control.
In the event that the Company chooses to enforce restrictive covenants against an executive Director following termination of his contract, the Company will pay to the executive Director compensation calculated in the same manner as the Compensation for the duration of the period for which the Company chooses to enforce the restrictive covenants, up to a maximum of six months.
This provision does not apply to Bruce Edwards or John Pattullo.
