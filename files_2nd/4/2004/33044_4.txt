As taxation rates in the US are lower than in the UK, US nationals are protected from a higher tax burden by means of a tax equalisation programme funded by the Company.
Under this programme, the Company pays an amount equal to the incremental tax resulting from the assignment of the Director to the UK.
This ensures that they are not penalised financially by accepting roles of an international nature which would result in higher taxation costs than would have been the case if they had remained in their home country.
Due to the nature of taxation payments, some of the amounts shown are in respect of previous financial years.
b Other Benefits include flexible benefits, car allowances and, for expatriates, housing support and other allowances necessary to ensure that they are not penalised financially by accepting roles of an international nature which result in higher costs than would have been the case if they had remained in their home country.
