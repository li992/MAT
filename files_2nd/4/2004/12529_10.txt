Remuneration report Compliance This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
As required, this Remuneration Report is being put to shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting AGM for an advisory vote.
Throughout 2004 the company complied with Schedule A of the Combined Code regarding best practice on the design of performance related remuneration.
The remuneration, including pensions and compensation payments, of all executive directors is determined by the Remuneration Committee the Committee and ratified by the Board.
The Committee is composed entirely of non-executive directors, and comprises Mr J R W Orange, who chairs the Committee and is the companys senior independent director, Messrs R V Emerson, S J Dobbie and I Gray.
None of the executive directors of the company is involved in determining his own remuneration.
The Committee consults with the Chief Executive and takes independent advice from Inbucon Consulting, a leading firm of remuneration consultants, which is appointed as an advisor to the Remuneration Committee in respect of executive remuneration and share schemes.
The Inbucon Group acts as trustees and administrators of the companys Share Incentive Plan.
The Inbucon Group does not provide any other services to the company.
No other person or company materially assisted the Committee during the year.
Remuneration approach The companys remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages which ensure that directors and senior management are fairly and responsibly rewarded for their contributions.
The main components of executive directors remuneration are basic salary, an annual performance related bonus scheme with a deferred element, benefits, longer-term incentives and pension provision.
The remuneration therefore contains a suitable balance of direct performance related remuneration, which links both the short-term financial performance of the group and the long-term shareholder return with the executives total remuneration.
The remuneration package is weighted so that the majority of reward may potentially come from the performance related elements of the package.
The Committee endorses the principle of mitigation of damages on early termination of a service contract.
It is the Committees current intention to continue with the above remuneration approach for 2005 and subsequent years although the Committee will keep the matter under review.
The Committees current intention with regard to share options is that they will be awarded only in special circumstances.
Shareholders approved the adoption of the Asset & Equity Plan AEP at the AGM in 2004.
The AEP replaced the Executive Equity and Asset Incentive Scheme, which expired at the end of 2003.
The companys Articles of Association provide that the remuneration paid to non-executive directors is to be determined by the Board within the limits set by the shareholders.
20 Premier Oil Annual Report & Accounts 2004 Performance chart The chart below shows the companys total shareholder return TSR over the last five financial years compared with the equivalent information in respect of the Oil & Gas Exploration and Production sector, which the Committee considers to be the closest equity market index.
The company has recorded five consecutive years of positive TSR.
Total Shareholder Return % Premier Oil vs FTSE Oil & Gas Exploration and Production Premier Oil FTSE Oil & Gas Exploration and Production 120% 100% 80% 60% 40% 20% 0 -20% 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 Contracts of service Details of the contracts of employment for the executive directors are as follows: Provision for payment Effective date Unexpired Notice upon early Director of contract term period termination R A Allan 09.12.03 12 months None specified C J A Jamieson 15.09.83 24 months None specified S C Lockett 09.12.03 12 months None specified J A van der Welle 01.04.99 Statutory minimum See details below The Committee has previously agreed that the 24-month notice periods for Messrs C J A Jamieson and J A van der Welle will not be renegotiated.
The company has, in any case, announced that Mr Jamieson will retire at the end of June 2005.
With respect to Mr van der Welle, he and the Committee have now agreed a variation to his contract of employment dated 20 January 2005 which has reduced his notice period to the statutory minimum notice period and which provides that, in the event of termination of his employment other than for non-performance, Mr van der Welle will be entitled to a payment equivalent to nine-twelfths annual remuneration together with a further three-twelfths if he has not obtained equivalent alternative employment after nine months based on basic salary and benefits in kind including pension accrual.
In addition, if his employment terminates during 2005, he will be paid a bonus for 2005 under the normal bonus arrangements as if he had remained in position until 31 December 2005, and disapplying any deferral conditions.
The contracts for the more-recently appointed directors, Messrs R A Allan and S C Lockett, are subject to 12-month notice periods and any executive director appointed in the future will be subject to a notice period not exceeding 12 months.
The Committee has considered what compensation commitments, including pension contributions, the executive directors contracts would entail in the event of early termination other than for non-performance.
In certain circumstances, the executive directors may receive compensation upon early termination of a contract.
For Messrs R A Allan, S C Lockett and J A van der Welle, this could amount to one years remuneration based on basic salary, bonus, benefits in kind and pension rights during the notice period.
Non-executive directors have letters of appointment which are all effective from 15 July 2003 for a period of three years and which all have notice periods of three months.
Premier Oil Annual Report & Accounts 2004 21 Remuneration report continued Remuneration structure The remuneration package for the executive directors comprises base salary, benefits, bonus, pension, and entitlement to participate in the companys all employee share schemes and long-term executive share schemes.
Base salary Base salary is reviewed each year against other comparable companies in the oil sector and general market data on the basis of companies in similar industries and those of a similar size.
The object is to ensure that the base salary, when taken together with the rest of the package, provides a competitive but performance driven remuneration package.
The base salaries of the executive directors are currently positioned between the median and the upper quartile.
While salary is reviewed by reference to market conditions, the performance of the company and the performance of the individual, the Committee would not regard this element of remuneration as directly performance related.
Annual bonus scheme The annual bonus, which is non pensionable, consists of a payment of up to 50 per cent of salary which is paid immediately providing certain performance conditions are met and a deferred payment of up to 50 per cent of salary for the same performance conditions.
Payment of the deferred part of the bonus is made in shares and deferred for three years.
The deferred element of the bonus is contingent upon the relevant beneficiary remaining in employment for the three years from the date of the award, but is not dependent on any further performance related measures.
The performance measures for 2004 were a combination of operational and financial.
They were based as to 65 per cent on the achievement of key targets in exploration and portfolio management, 25 per cent on the achievement of cash flow targets and 10 per cent on the achievement of health, safety and environmental targets.
The target in exploration was to achieve discoveries from 2004 drilling of 30 mmboe.
In portfolio management, the targets comprised a number of strategic opportunities against which the Remuneration Committee judged performance.
The cash flow target consisted of a base target 12.5 per cent which was to achieve the operating cash flow number contained in the 2004 budget approved by the Board and a stretch target 12.5 per cent, which was to achieve the base target plus 10 per cent.
The health, safety and environmental target was to achieve combined frequencies of lost time injuries and restricted work day cases of 2.9 2.9 lost time injuries or restricted work day cases per million man-hours worked.
Based on these targets, the Remuneration Committee decided at its meeting on 22 March 2005 to award 40 per cent of salary for performance against the exploration and portfolio management target, 25 per cent for the cash flow target and 10 per cent for the health, safety and environmental target.
The annual bonus scheme for the 2005 financial year has the same structure and maximum award level.
The performance measures for the 2005 bonus scheme are based as to 20 per cent on cash flow, 70 per cent on the achievement of key targets in exploration, portfolio management and strategic development, and 10 per cent on the achievement of health, safety and environmental targets.
The cash flow target is to achieve the operating cash flow number contained in the 2005 budget approved by the Board.
The exploration target is to increase reserves through exploration drilling by 30 mmboe.
The portfolio management and strategic development targets comprise a number of strategic opportunities against which the Remuneration Committee judges performance.
The health, safety and environmental target is combined frequencies of lost time injury frequencies and restricted work day cases of 2.6 2.6 lost time injuries or restricted work day cases per million man-hours worked.
Benefits Mr C J A Jamieson received the benefit of a car fully expensed by the company until 30 June 2004.
For the remainder of the period Mr Jamieson received the benefit of a car allowance.
Mr Jamieson received medical insurance for the whole period.
Mr J A van der Welle received the benefit of a car fully expensed by the company together with petrol cost and medical insurance.
Messrs R A Allan and S C Lockett received the benefit of a car allowance and medical insurance.
2 4,187 of Mr van der Welles remuneration relates to a salary supplement as part of his pension arrangements.
3 Mr Alizai was paid US$116,600 2003: US$116,600 for advisory services undertaken for the group outside the UK.
Benefits in kind represent car and fuel benefits and medical insurance.

Pension schemes audited Messrs C J A Jamieson and S C Lockett are members of the Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan the Scheme.
The Scheme is a funded, Inland Revenue approved final salary scheme which provides a pension of up to two-thirds salary at the normal pension age of 60.
Benefits are actuarially reduced on early retirement before age 60 and pensions in payment increase in line with the lower of inflation or 5 per cent per annum.
Mr R A Allan is a member of a money purchase pension arrangement to which the company contributed 20,212.50 during 2004: contributions to this arrangement are made in respect of basic annual salary as restricted to the Inland Revenue Earnings Cap.
The company has agreed to provide Mr J A van der Welle with a pension substantially as if he were a contributing member of the Scheme and not subject to the Inland Revenue Earnings Cap.
The company extended the same provisions to Messrs R A Allan and S C Lockett consequent to their appointment as directors in December 2003.
For life insurance purposes, Mr R A Allan and Mr J A van der Welle are members of the Scheme.
Premier Oil Annual Report & Accounts 2004 23 Remuneration report continued The accrued pension entitlements of the directors who were members of the Scheme during 2004 are as follows: a b c d Increase from d e Accrued Transfer value in Accrued Transfer value in to b less Increase in pension as at respect of a pension as at respect of c contributions value on basis 31 December as at 31 December 31 December as at 31 December by director of Listing 2004 2004 2003 2003 during 2004 Requirements 000 pa 000 000 pa 000 000 000 R A Allan 3.2 24.2 14.7 14.7 C J A Jamieson 211.2 4,034.8 192.3 3,172.9 848.0 245.0 S C Lockett 18.9 103.4 14.6 71.3 22.6 11.6 J A van der Welle 22.0 214.0 17.4 135.3 66.8 27.9 Notes: 1.
The amounts of accrued pension under a and c represent the accrued pension entitlements of the director as at the stated dates.
The transfer values under b, d and e have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the guidance note GN11: Retirement Benefit Schemes Transfer Values issued by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries.
The amounts under e represent the increase in value of the directors benefits in terms of the value, on the transfer value basis in force at the end of the year, of the excess of the end-year accrued benefits over the start-year accrued benefits as revalued by price inflation less contributions by the directors.
The values stated in respect of Messrs R A Allan, S C Lockett and J A van der Welle correspond with the target level of their final salary pension provision: in practice, the pension benefits for these directors are principally established through individual money purchase arrangements.
Mr C J A Jamieson reached normal pension age on 30 September 2004 and has deferred drawing his pension: the accrued pension under a represents his entitlement as adjusted for deferred retirement to date.
In addition to the current provision noted above, Mr R A Allan is entitled to a deferred pension under the Scheme in respect of a prior service period with the company between September 1986 and November 1999.
Members of the Scheme have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions.
Neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.
The following payments were made to former directors of the company in respect of unfunded pension liabilities: Amount of unfunded Amount of unfunded pension paid during 2004 pension paid during 2003 J A Heath 28,320 27,549 R J Lascelles 26,561 25,838 R C Shaw deceased 19 December 2003 84,777 Share option schemes audited The company believes that share ownership by executive directors and senior executives strengthens the link between their personal interests and those of shareholders.
The company currently operates four share option schemes.
The Scheme of Arrangement in 2003 affected two of the schemes in operation at that time.
The company therefore adopted two new share option schemes to replace the Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 and the Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1999.
Executive Share Option Scheme 1985 Share options awarded under this scheme can be exercised at the holders discretion between three and ten years after being awarded.
After ten years the options expire.
No grant of options under this scheme has taken place since 1994.
Options held under this scheme by Mr C J A Jamieson during the financial year are listed in the table below: Mid-market Acquisition Options price on Options Date of Exercisable price per held at date of held at Director grant dates share 01.01.04 Event exercise 31.12.04 C J A Jamieson 18.10.94 18.10.9718.10.04 2.55 15,000 Exercised 15.10.04 6.225 These options were exercisable without the need to fulfil a performance requirement.
This is because the scheme was introduced and approved by shareholders at a time when performance criteria were not required by shareholders.
24 Premier Oil Annual Report & Accounts 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 Options granted under the 1995 scheme are normally exercisable not less than three years after their date of grant and will lapse unless previously exercised on their tenth anniversary.
Options cannot be exercised until pre-determined performance conditions have been achieved.
For options granted prior to 2000 the performance requirement was that the share price plus the value of dividends paid must, as measured at the end of any consecutive three-year period, have grown at a rate equal to or greater than the Oil Exploration and Production Index over the same period.
Options granted during and after 2000 are dependent upon growth in the companys earnings per share of at least 3 per cent pa compound above the retail price index over a three-year period.
The Committee believes that this is a challenging performance measure that in the long-term should reflect a good shareholder return.
This scheme was affected by the Scheme of Arrangement.
The options could be exercised within six months of the Court approving the Scheme of Arrangement or the options could be rolled over into options over shares of the new company.
Where the option holder elected to rollover his options the performance criteria continued to apply.
The performance conditions relating to all options granted to directors under the 1995 scheme have been met.
Messrs C J A Jamieson, S C Lockett and J A van der Welle held options under this scheme during the financial year.
The market price of the companys shares at 31 December 2004 was 5.29 31 December 2003: 4.55 and the range during 2004 was 4.55 to 6.60.
Executive Share Option Scheme 2003 This scheme replaced the 1995 scheme on completion of the Scheme of Arrangement.
Options granted under the 2003 scheme are normally exercisable not less than three years after their date of grant and will lapse unless previously exercised on their tenth anniversary.
There were no grants made to directors under this scheme during the year.
The companies in the group consisted of Cairn Energy plc, Dana Petroleum plc, Paladin Resources plc, Premier Oil plc, Soco International plc, Tullow Oil plc and Venture Production plc.
Premier Oil Annual Report & Accounts 2004 25 Remuneration report continued Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1999 Under this scheme, approved by shareholders on 18 May 1999, employees including executive directors with six months or more continuous service are invited, within a period of 42 days of the announcement of the annual and interim results, to join the scheme.
Employees may save between 5 and 250 per month, through payroll deduction for a period of three or five years, after which time they can acquire shares at a discount of up to 20 per cent of the market value set at the time of invitation.

Its terms are similar to those of the 1999 scheme.
Premier Oil plc Executive Equity and Asset Incentive Scheme audited The Executive Equity and Asset Incentive Scheme was a scheme designed to reward an improvement in the asset value of the business and the market value of the company over a three-year period the executive directors participated in the scheme as well as some 30 other executives.
The scheme therefore had two bonus pools, each pool being dependent upon one of the following two performance measures.
The equity bonus pool was created by comparing the market value calculated by reference to the average share price for the three months prior to the start of the period 16 May 2001 with the market value similarly calculated three years later.
The asset bonus pool is based upon the increase in the appraised net asset value of the business over a three-year period, from the start of 2001 to the end of 2003.
In either case there was no bonus pool unless there had been an increase in the relevant performance measure of at least 12 per cent compound per annum over a three-year period.
When a growth of 12 per cent compound per annum had been achieved then a bonus pool was created which was equal to 1 per cent of the increase in that measure.
If the growth were 25 per cent or more compound per annum, then a bonus pool would be created equal to 2.5 per cent of the increase in that measure.
Between the above two points a proportionate calculation was undertaken.
In addition, vesting under either pool was dependent upon the Remuneration Committee being satisfied that there had been an improvement in the performance of the company over the three-year period.
26 Premier Oil Annual Report & Accounts 2004 The bonus pools were distributed, with up to 33 per cent to the executive directors, 40 per cent to other executives and the remainder on a discretionary basis.
The individual participation was calculated according to a points system, the points being referred to as participation points.
Each participant had been awarded a number of participation points and these were compared to the aggregate number of participation points awarded for the purposes of calculating the individuals entitlement to part of any bonus pool.
Mr C J A Jamieson was granted 290 participation points and Messrs J A van der Welle and R T Liddell were both awarded 190 participation points in the executive directors pool on 16 July 2001.
The benefits under the scheme were paid half in cash and half in shares by dividing the cash value by the share price on the day prior to the release of the award.
The cash payment was released on 14 May 2004.
The shares had an additional holding period of six months before they were released.
Awards under this scheme vested subject to performance up to the date of the Scheme of Arrangement.
Some participants elected to receive their awards at that date.
As an alternative, participants were able effectively to roll over their awards under the scheme to reflect the restructuring of the company.
In this case, awards vested subject to performance at the maturity of the scheme.
Messrs C J A Jamieson and J A van der Welle followed this course of action.
An independent external valuation of the equity and asset pools was undertaken when the scheme matured.
The total value of the pools was as follows: Total pool size Equity pool @ 5.00 13,035,093 Asset pool 3,866,844 Total pools 16,901,937 Six-month average share price to 16 May 2004.
The benefits received by directors under the plan during 2004 were as follows: Value of Number of cash award shares awarded C J A Jamieson 1,207,101 235,762 J A van der Welle 790,860 154,465 The shares were released on 17 November 2004.
The number of shares released was based on the market value of a share on 16 November 2004 5.685.
Mr R A Allan received 245,735 50 per cent cash and 50 per cent shares and Mr S C Lockett received 179,314 50 per cent cash and 50 per cent shares under the plan in 2003.
Their awards vested prior to them becoming directors.
As part of the termination package agreed with former director Mr R T Liddell, it was agreed that awards made to him under the scheme would vest in their entirety on the normal vesting date and otherwise in accordance with the rules of the scheme.
Accordingly, Mr Liddell received a cash award of 790,860 and a share award of 154,465 shares during the year.
Premier Oil plc Asset & Equity Plan audited This plan is broadly similar to the Executive Equity and Asset Incentive Scheme, except that awards can be made annually and they will mature on the third anniversary of the date of grant.
The Asset & Equity Plan is a broadly based plan, with participation points being awarded to eligible employees throughout the group.
Again, two pools can be created.
No pool is created unless there is a minimum compound growth in net assets per share or increase in market value of the company of 10 per cent per annum and the maximum pool is generated if growth is 20 per cent per annum.
The maximum benefit that an individual may receive will normally be limited to twice his or her basic salary per annum.
A total of 823 participation points were awarded in 2004.
Of these, the directors received the following points: Number of participation points R A Allan 36.85 C J A Jamieson 64.00 S C Lockett 36.85 J A van der Welle 36.85 Premier Oil Annual Report & Accounts 2004 27 Remuneration report continued Premier Oil plc Share Incentive Plan audited Under this plan, employees may make contributions to acquire shares in the company Partnership Shares.
In addition to the Partnership Shares, the Board has awarded a number of shares to each employee being an outright award of shares Free Shares, and if an employee agrees to buy Partnership Shares, the company currently matches the number of Partnership Shares bought with an award of shares Matching Shares, on a one-for-one basis.
In the case of the award of Free Shares and Matching Shares the company has not required performance criteria to be fulfilled, as the purpose of the plan is to allow all employees to become shareholders in the company.
The company made an award of Free Shares to all company employees in the UK and overseas on 8 February 2002 of 526 shares per employee.
Following the one-for-ten share consolidation, these have been adjusted to 52 or 53 shares in a manner approved by the Inland Revenue.
These shares will be held in a trust for a period of three years after which each director may leave the shares in trust, hold the shares in his own name, or sell them provided the director is in employment at the end of the three-year period.
Should an employee leave the plan before the end of the three-year period he will lose the right to the Matching Shares, unless he leaves due to injury, redundancy, TUPE transfer, retirement, death or sale of the company.
The company invites all UK employees to make contributions to acquire Partnership Shares on a monthly basis.
Messrs R A Allan, S C Lockett and J A van der Welle contributed the maximum monthly amount of 125 to the plan.
For each Partnership Share purchased, the company provides a Matching Share.
The plan was amended following the Scheme of Arrangement to allow the use of shares in the new company.
Shares held beneficially in this plan by the directors during the financial year were as follows: Total Total PartnershipMatching Partnership Shares Shares awarded and Matching purchased in 2004 Shares acquired Shares in 2004 at prices Shares between held on at prices between 457p held on 1 January and 1 January between 457p and 634p, 31 December 23 March 2004 and 634p vesting in 2007 2004 2005 R A Allan 1,734 271 271 2,276 130 C J A Jamieson 52 52 S C Lockett 1,743 271 271 2,285 130 J A van der Welle 1,743 271 271 2,285 130 Mr Allans shares include shares held in the International Plan.
