Remuneration policy Executive Directors The Companys policy for the current and subsequent financial years is to provide remuneration packages for the Executive Directors which are appropriate to the size and nature of the business and which will attract and retain high calibre executives.
It is the Companys policy that a substantial proportion of the Executive Directors remuneration should be performance related to encourage and reward superior business performance and shareholder return and that remuneration should be linked to both individual and Company performance.
Accordingly, Executive Directors may earn up to an additional 90% of their basic salaries as a performance bonus and benefit from participation in the Share Option Scheme as set out below.
No further awards can now be made under the Share Option Scheme but they will in future be able to participate in the 2004 LTIP referred to on page 30, subject to its adoption following the Annual General Meeting.
The Executive Directors will also be able to participate in the proposed all-employee Savings Related Share Option Scheme the SAYE Scheme, referred to on page 30, following its adoption at the Annual General Meeting.
The individual salary, bonus and benefit levels of the Executive Directors are, and will continue to be, reviewed annually by the Committee.
This year, the Committee has also undertaken a review of the longer term arrangements for the Executive Directors remuneration, with particular emphasis on selecting an appropriate replacement for the 2001-2004 LTIP which expired in 2004.
It is the Companys policy to employ Executive Directors under contracts with an indefinite term subject to termination by notice given by either party, normally of 12 months.
During the year Lord Harriss notice period was reduced from 24 months to 12 months with no compensation for this reduction.
These employment contracts do not provide for termination payments other than, in the case of early termination by the Company, payment in lieu of notice.
Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Details of individual Directors remuneration and share options are set out on page 29 of this report.
The main components of the remuneration 27 package for Executive Directors are: Basic salary The Companys policy is that basic salaries for Executive Directors should take into account the role and responsibilities, performance and experience of the individual.
For an Executive Director who is experienced and fully effective in his role, basic salary is targeted at the retail market median for comparable roles.
Annual bonus Executive Directors are eligible to receive an annual performance bonus up to a maximum of 90% of their annual basic salaries at the time the bonus scheme is announced.
The amount of bonus is based on the achievement of profit targets specified and agreed at the beginning of the year.
Bonus payments do not form part of the Directors pensionable earnings.
Share option scheme In order to align the interests of Executive Directors and selected senior managers with those of the shareholders, the Company introduced an Executive Share Option Scheme in 1993.
Under this scheme the Committee approved the granting of options as an incentive to achieve long-term success for the Company.
No further grants can be made under the scheme although some options remain outstanding these are shown on page 29.
Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The 20012004 LTIP was adopted to encourage the senior management team to achieve exceptional returns for shareholders.
In the event, the performance target was not satisfied.
This LTIP has now expired.
At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting shareholders will be asked to approve the introduction of a new LTIP the 2004 LTIP, details of which are set out on page 30.
If the 2004 LTIP is adopted, the conditional rights to receive shares will be awarded to participants.
The extent to which such rights vest will depend upon the Companys performance over the three-year period following the award date.
The vesting of half of the awards will be determined by the Companys relative total shareholder return TSR performance and the vesting of the other half by the Companys relative earnings per share EPS performance.
The Companys TSR and EPS performance will be measured against those of similar, non-food retail companies in the FTSE Top 250.
No retesting will be permitted.
Pensions Executive Directors are members of the Carpetright plc Pension Plan which is a defined benefit scheme.
Details of the Pension Plan as it applies to the Executive Directors are set out below.
During the year the Companys contributions were increased from 16% to 18% of pensionable salaries.
The Executive Directors are subject to the Inland Revenue earnings cap on approved pension schemes and death in service benefits.
Other benefits Executive Directors are entitled to be provided with a fully expensed company car or an equivalent allowance, permanent health insurance, annual health screening and membership of a private medical insurance scheme.
Additionally, Executive Directors may join the All Employee Share Ownership Plan and will be able to join the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, if approved by shareholders.
Non-Executive Directors The fees of the Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board as a whole.
It is the Boards policy to set these fees according to the recommendations by the Chairman and Chief Executive who makes such recommendations with reference to current fee levels in similar businesses.
It is the Companys policy to appoint Non-Executive Directors for a term of three years or one year if the Non-Executive Director is aged over 70.
The appointment of Non-Executive Directors is subject to re-election in accordance with the Articles of Association and Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts with the Company.
Mr Simon Metcalf was appointed from 1 June 2004 and will retire and offer himself for re-election at the Annual General Meeting.

Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Directors remuneration report Long Term Incentive Plan 30 The 20012004 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP was adopted at the Annual General Meeting in 2001, expiring at 1 May 2004.
In addition to the Executive Directors shown below, 13 senior managers had an interest in the LTIP.
No payments became due under the Plan.

Details of the proposed LTIP are as follows: 2004 Long Term Incentive Plan The Company intends to introduce a new Long Term Incentive Plan the 2004 LTIP to reward the Executive Directors and other senior employees for performance against retail sector peers over performance periods of three years.
The 2004 LTIP will replace the 20012004 Long Term Incentive Plan, under which no awards were made.
Under the new Plan the Executive Directors will receive annual conditional awards in the form of rights over Carpetright shares.
The reward of these shares will be satisfied by the purchase of shares: no new shares will be issued.
The maximum conditional award under the 2004 LTIP is 40% of salary and for 2004 the conditional awards for Executive Directors are expected to be at the maximum.
Up to 20 senior executives will be invited to join the LTIP with a maximum award of 20% of salary.
Based on current basic salaries the annual cost of a maximum award under the 2004 LTIP would be 510,000 for the Directors and 340,000 for the senior executives, giving a total of 850,000.
The proportion of shares vesting after three years will depend on Carpetrights performance against a defined peer group with respect to two measures: Total Shareholder Return TSR and Earnings Per Share EPS growth.
Half of each award will be governed by each measure.
Using TSR peer group ranking as a performance indicator directly links Directors rewards to the investment returns enjoyed by shareholders.
The EPS growth measure encourages a focus on profitable growth.
The peer group has been selected from similar FTSE Top 250 non-food retailers.
For the 2004 conditional award, EPS and TSR performance against the peer group each determine vesting for one half of each award in accordance with the following table: Vested award TSR or EPS peer group ranking % of salary 50th percentile and below 0% 51st percentile 6% 75th percentile or greater 20% Vesting will be determined by straight-line interpolation for performance between the 51st and 75th percentiles.
Following the initial test, there will be no opportunity to re-test performance for the determination of awards.
If a participant ceases to be employed by the Company, the participant will forfeit all of his conditional awards relating to all active performance cycles.
In cases of death or retirement due to ill health a pro rata payment will be made at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
In the event of a change of control of the Company all awards will vest on a pro rata time and performance basis.
The above is a summary of the proposed 2004 LTIP.
No amendments to the advantage of participants may be made to the provisions of the LTIP described above without the prior consent of shareholders except in the event of a minor amendment to benefit the administration or tax treatment of the LTIP.
The Company will seek approval of the shareholders for the new Plan at the forthcoming AGM.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in either the original LTIP or the 2004 LTIP.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme the SAYE Scheme The Board considers it appropriate to establish another share incentive arrangement that can be offered to employees generally in addition to the All Employee Share Ownership Plan.
Accordingly shareholders are to be asked to approve the adoption of a new Inland Revenue approved SAYE scheme by the Company.
Under such a scheme employees are granted options at up to 20% discount on the share price and which may be exercised in three, five or seven years time using tax free savings of up to 250 per month deducted regularly from their salary.
A summary of the principal terms of the proposed SAYE Scheme are set out in the Appendix to the notice of the Annual General Meeting.
The Executive Directors would be eligible to participate in the SAYE Scheme.
The Board considers that similar SAYE Schemes operated by other retailers work well in encouraging employee investment in shares.

1 The cost to the Plan of the increase represents the incremental value to the Director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption that service terminated at the year end.
It is based on the increase in accrued pension net of inflation after deducting the Directors contribution.
2 The total change in value reflects the effects of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and the Directors, such as stock market movements.
It is calculated after deducting Director contributions.
The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the period.
The increase or decrease in transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11 less Directors contributions.
Members of the scheme have the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions but none of the Directors has elected to do so.
