26 Directors Remuneration Report DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT This report details the remuneration paid to the Companys Directors including the Chairman, Lord Rothschild, and the Chief Operating Officer, Duncan Budge, for the year ended 31 March 2004.
REMUNERATION AND CONFLICTS COMMITTEE The remuneration packages of individual executive Directors are determined by the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee which comprises Charles Bailey as Chairman, Andrew Knight and Baron Lambert, all of whom are considered by the Board to be independent, non-executive Directors.
Lord Rothschild and Duncan Budge liaise closely with the Committee, although they do not take part in any discussions relating to decisions on their own terms and conditions of employment.
The Committee appointed the Human Resource Services division of  LLP to provide information to it on the remuneration packages of senior executives in comparable companies and to advise on the implementation of the Executive Bonus Scheme, described below.
Determination of the remuneration of the non-executive Directors, within the limits imposed by the Articles of Association, is the responsibility of the Board as a whole.
The Remuneration Committee is also responsible for the operation of the long-term incentive plan for executive Directors.
Remuneration Policy The Company complied in the year under review with the provisions relating to Remuneration Committees incorporated in the Combined Code issued in June 1998 the 1998 Code.
The Remuneration and Conflicts Committee aims to set executive remuneration at an appropriate level to attract, retain and motivate Directors of requisite calibre.
Any arrangements made to provide longer term incentives will aim to encourage and reward performance and to benefit shareholders.
The Remuneration and Conflicts Committee aims to compare remuneration packages of similar financial institutions to the Company and models its decisions on the median position of those institutions.
In setting policy and making decisions, the Remuneration Committee gives full consideration to the provisions on the design of performance-related remuneration set out in Schedule A of the 1998 Code.
RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 Directors Remuneration Report 27 Directors Remuneration Directors remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2004 is shown below, with comparative figures for the previous year.
Comparative figures for the individual Directors emoluments are shown in brackets if they differ from the emoluments for the year ended 31 March 2004.
For the current year, to 31 March 2005, Lord Rothschilds salary is 340,000 per annum 2003 4: 340,000 per annum and Duncan Budges salary is 250,000 per annum 2003 4: 250,000 per annum.
The Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee, approved the adoption of an Executive Bonus Plan during the year.
The Plan provides that each executive Director, and such other participants as may be determined by the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee, shall be entitled to an annual bonus.
The amount payable under the Executive Bonus Plan is calculated by reference to the Companys three-year moving average outperformance over the three most relevant total return indices.
The indices are currently the FTSE All-Share Total Return Index, the Investment Trust Net Assets Total Return Index and the Morgan Stanley Capital International Total Return Index expressed in Sterling.
The percentage of salary payable as a bonus rises on a straight line basis from 0% to 100%, if the average annual outperformance is between 0% and 7%.
Thereafter, the percentage of salary payable as a bonus rises from 100% in a straight line to the maximum bonus payable under the Plan of 125%, if the average annual outperformance is between 7% and 10%.
The first bonuses payable under the Plan were in respect of the year ended 31 March 2004, and the entitlements of Lord Rothschild and Mr Budge thereunder amounted to 425,000 and 312,500 respectively.
In addition to the bonus entitlements under the Executive Bonus Plan, Lord Rothschild and Mr Budge each received a 900 bonus which was paid to all of the Groups employees in December 2003 year ended 31 March 2003: 900.
RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 28 Directors Remuneration Report Long-term Incentive Plan Long-term incentive arrangements were approved by shareholders on 10 July 1996, as they constituted related party transactions under Stock Exchange rules.
Under their respective participation in the Share Appreciation Rights plan as at 31 March 1999, Lord Rothschild and Duncan Budge were both entitled, at a time of their choice between the third and tenth anniversary of the grant and in respect of any subsequent grants to a bonus.
This would be calculated by reference to a notional number of the Companys shares in each case 587,371 at 340.5p.
The amount of the bonus will represent the increase, since the date of grant, in the Companys share price multiplied by the notional number of shares.
This is, however, conditional on any increase in the share price, plus dividends paid, exceeding the increase in the Retail Price Index plus 3% per annum for any three year period between the date of grant and the tenth anniversary thereof.
The Remuneration and Conflicts Committee decided that further participations in the Share Appreciation Rights plan should be granted to both Lord Rothschild and Duncan Budge on 22 March 2000 and 26 March 2003.
The notional number of shares involved was 228,833 at 437p and 262,467 at 381p respectively in each case.
As at 31 March 2004 the amount accrued under all three participations was 4,458,654 payable in equal parts to Lord Rothschild and Duncan Budge.
This compared with an accrued amount of 364,170 as at 31 March 2003 and followed an increase in the middle-market price of RITCP shares during the period from 371.5p to 577.5p.
Should either participant leave their employment involuntarily at any time, the bonus accrued to the relevant date will be payable, subject to there being no grounds for non-payment arising out of negligence or other misconduct.

Performance Graph In accordance with the regulations made under the Companies Act 1985, it is necessary to include a performance graph which measures the Companys total shareholder return calculated by reference to the Companys share price, including dividend reinvestment against that of a broad equity market index.
For this purpose the Committee considers that the Morgan Stanley Capital International Total Return Index in Sterling, the FTSE All-Share Total Return Index and the Investment Trust Net Assets Total Return Index are the most suitable indices for comparative purposes.
The graph below therefore compares the Companys total shareholder return to that of these three indices over the last 5 years.

Lord Rothschild and Duncan Budge are members of the RITCP Pension and Life Assurance Scheme, the RITCP Scheme.
Within the RITCP Scheme, money purchase arrangements have been set up for Lord Rothschild, to which the Company has contributed at the rate of 20% of basic salary, amounting to 68,000 during the year under review year ended 31 March 2003: 63,654.
Duncan Budge is a defined benefit member of the RITCP Scheme for which the contribution rate is 35% of basic salary.
No pension provision is made for the non-executive Directors.
Executive Directors Pensions Duncan Budge is the only executive Director who is a member of the defined benefit section of the Companys pension scheme.
The table below gives details of the movements in the potential benefits and transfer values during the year.
Accrued benefit at 31 March 2003 80,708 Change in accrued benefit due to inflation 2,260 Change in accrued benefit due to other factors 19,702 Accrued benefit at 31 March 2004 102,670 Transfer value at 31 March 2003 797,945 Increase in transfer value 263,826 Transfer value at 31 March 2004 1,061,771 Transfer value at 31 March 2004 in respect of increase in accrued benefit excluding inflation 203,626 The accrued, but deferred, pension entitlement is calculated on the basis that the Director left service on 31 March 2004.
The transfer value is a liability of the pension scheme rather than an amount due to be paid to the executive Director or a liability of the Company.
RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 Value of 100 invested on 31 March 1999 30 Directors Remuneration Report Non-executive Directors The remuneration of the non-executive Directors is determined by the Board as a whole, in accordance with the provisions of the Articles of Association, which limit the aggregate fees payable to non-executive Directors to 200,000 per annum.
Non-executive Directors do not take part in discussions on their own remuneration.
The basic annual fee is 15,000, which the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee believes to be in line with current market practice.
However, this figure is increased in certain cases when the involvement of the non-executive Director in the Companys affairs warrants such increase and more especially when they are members of a committee.
Jean Pigozzi and Michael Sofaer have each waived their right to receive 15,000 in respect of the years ended 31 March 2003 and 31 March 2004.
The non-executive Directors each have letters of appointment that are subject to termination upon one months written notice on either side.
Directors Service Contracts It is the policy of the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee not to grant service contracts with notice periods in excess of one year.
The terms and conditions of the Directors service contracts are detailed below and are reviewed as required.
Lord Rothschild and Duncan Budge both have service agreements with J. Rothschild Capital Management Limited.
Lord Rothschilds service agreement is dated 29 April 1996, but was initially with an associated company and originally dated 20 October 1993.
The agreement can be terminated, inter alia, by either party giving the other not less than twelve months written notice.
It provides for benefits in kind in line with normal company practice, including pension provision, private health insurance and a company car.
The agreement determined on Lord Rothschilds 65th birthday and is currently on a rolling one year basis.
The agreement does not specify compensation payable in the event of early termination.
Duncan Budges service agreement is dated 29 August 1996, but was originally with an associated company and dated 6 August 1985.
The agreement can be terminated, inter alia, by either party giving the other not less than twelve months written notice and will automatically terminate on his 60th birthday.
It provides for benefits in kind in line with normal company practice, including pension provision, life assurance, permanent health insurance, private health insurance and a company car.
When considering the size of any proposed termination payment, the Committee would take into account a number of factors including the health, length of service, age and the performance of the relevant executive, including the duty to mitigate his own loss, with a broad aim to avoid rewarding poor performance while dealing fairly with cases where the departure is due to other reasons, such as illness.
Termination Payments and Payments to Third Parties No payments were made to a Director of the Company for termination of employment nor were any payments made to third parties for Directors services during the year.
