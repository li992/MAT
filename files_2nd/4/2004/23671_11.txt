Report & Accounts 2004 Directors Remuneration Report Introduction The Board has delegated to the Remuneration Committee the determination of Executive directors remuneration.
The constitution and operation of the Committee comply with the Best Practice Provisions on Directors Remuneration in the Combined Code of the UK Listing Authority.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 which introduced new statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after 31 December 2002.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors remuneration and where it does not comply why this is the case.
As required by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations, the directors remuneration report will be submitted to the forthcoming AGM for approval.
Members of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee consists only of independent Non-executive directors.
Oliver Vaughan is the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee appointed Chairman on 13 July 2004.
The other members are Nicholas Irens appointed from 1 January 2004 and Lord MacLaurin of Knebworth, DL appointed from 13 July 2004.
Other members who served on the Committee during the year were Sir Malcolm Field who resigned as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on 13 July 2004, George Loudon who resigned on 13 July 2004 and David Norwood who resigned on 18 March 2004.
The Board considers that all members of the Committee are independent within the meaning of the Combined Code as explained in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 22 to 29.
Details of the number of meetings and each members attendance are set out in the table on page 26.
The Terms of Reference for the Committee comply with the Combined Code and are available for inspection at the Companys registered office, at the AGM and on the Companys website: www.
Advice During the year the Committee has received advice on remuneration from its lawyers, Jones Day and Stringer Saul, and internally from its Human Resources Department.
In addition during the year the Committee appointed Towers Perrin to advise on executive remuneration.
No individual is involved in the determination of their own remuneration.
Remuneration Policy For all employees throughout the Group the overriding aim is to develop and implement a remuneration policy which motivates individuals of the highest calibre to grow the value of the Group and maximise returns to shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee takes the view that the same philosophy that is applied to employees of the Group generally should also apply to Executive directors who are essential to the effective and successful leadership and management of a company.
Evolution Group operates in the highly competitive market place of investment banking and fund management, which places a heavy emphasis on exceptional rewards for exceptional performance.
An overriding objective is to ensure that the approach to remuneration is simple and clear.
Consistent with this philosophy, the Groups reward structure aims to achieve the following: motivates executives in the short term while also linking remuneration to the long term performance of the Group: aligns the interests of Executive directors with those of shareholders through performance related awards reflecting the performance of the Group: to be appropriate in the light of remuneration arrangements with its competitors and for senior Group employees who are not directors: and reflects Group profit levels and rewards profit growth, with a significant element of performance related remuneration.
the evolution group plc 31 Report & Accounts 2004 Directors Remuneration Report - continued In determining directors remuneration, the Remuneration Committee considers returns to shareholders as measured by profit and earnings performance both in absolute terms and against budget.
The quality of profit performance is also considered in the context of market conditions and whether it is broadly based across all divisions or derived more narrowly together with the application of risk controls across the business.
Other considerations are comparable market remuneration data, the experience and performance of individual directors, their areas of responsibility and remuneration levels throughout the Group.
A high proportion of total remuneration is related to performance, designed to motivate Executive directors to enhance the value of the Group.
The performance-related elements of remuneration represent over 90% of total remuneration.
All medium and long-term incentives are delivered in the form of Evolution Group options and share awards.
The Committee intends that the broad tenets of remuneration policy will continue to support the objectives of the Group but will keep it under review and will strive to balance the views of major shareholders and the needs of the Group.
The Components of Remuneration Overview The remuneration packages of Executive directors comprise four elements: basic salary, benefits in kind, annual discretionary performance related bonus, and medium long term incentive plans.
Fixed remuneration - basic salary and benefits The fixed component of Executive directors remuneration comprises basic salary and benefits in kind.
A salary cap was implemented in 2002 for all employees throughout the Group of 100,000 and remained in place throughout 2004.
It is intended that this will remain in place going forward.
The following benefits in kind are provided to Executive directors: medical cover: life assurance: critical illness and permanent health insurance: and a car allowance.
No pension provision is provided by the Group.
The basic salary of 100,000, together with the benefits in kind, represent some of the lowest levels of fixed remuneration in the FTSE 250, particularly in the absence of pension provision.
This accords with the Groups overall philosophy of remuneration having as low an element of fixed or non-performance related pay as possible.
Performance-related remuneration a Annual performance bonus The Group operates the same annual bonus scheme for employees of Evolution Securities and the Executive directors as part of the Groups overall reward structure since ESL represents the majority of the Groups operating profit performance.
The bonus scheme is formulaic to the extent that the funds available for bonus payments are directly related to the profit performance but the allocation of payments to individuals depends on the performance of the relevant business unit and on individual performance including contribution to profitability.
The scheme operates on a bonus pool system which is defined by reference to a percentage of operating profit.
Up to budgeted performance, 45% of operating profit is allocated to the bonus pool, thereafter, for performance above budget, 50% of operating profit is allocated to the pool.
The Committee divides and allocates the bonus pool to the business units within ESL and to the Executive directors, to reflect their overall performance and contribution to the Groups profit.
The concept of a bonus ceiling does not naturally align with the Groups remuneration philosophy.
The Committee acknowledges that the consequence of this is that the scheme does not comply with Schedule A of the Combined Code.
The Committee takes the view that the current bonus scheme design, which has operated very effectively for some years, generates and rewards behaviours which are successfully driving the creation of long-term shareholder value.
The emphasis on annual bonus payments which are not capped at the level of the individual but only by reference to the profit pool made available also allows the Group to keep fixed cost remuneration low while at the same time remaining competitive.
Each director has detailed and demanding performance criteria against which they are measured.
These performance goals are set by the Remuneration Committee and performance is determined by them.
the evolution group plc 32 Report & Accounts 2004 Annual bonus payments made in respect of the Groups performance in 2004 took into account the increase in operating income of 61% from 40.8m to 65.5m and the increase in adjusted operating profit of 89% from 10.6m to 20.1m.
Annual performance related bonus payments to Executive directors increased from 2.3m in 2003 to 3.6m in 2004, an increase of 57%.
The proportion of the overall ESL bonus pool paid to Executive directors fell from 27% in 2003 to 24% in 2004.
The Committee consider that in the light of these facts the bonus levels are justified and reasonable.
b Medium long term incentive plans The final element of reward for the Executive directors is the medium long term incentive plan.
Shares may be awarded to Executive directors under the 2002 Executive Share Incentive Scheme, approved by shareholders on 10 October 2002.
These awards were made by the Remuneration Committee in November 2003 to the Chief Executive, A.
Snow and in July 2004 to the Executive Chairman, R. Griffiths and the Finance Director, G. Dell.
Chief Executive Awards These awards were made by the Remuneration Committee in November 2003 and are intended to act both as an incentive and as a retention arrangement for the Chief Executive, A.
Snow, to the end of the 2005 financial year.
Full vesting of the total award of 6 million shares is phased over the period November 2003 to April 2006 and conditional upon the achievement of strict performance criteria.
These required a growth in the Groups adjusted earnings per share based upon the adjusted operating profit measure as defined in the Finance Directors Report on page 10 of the Group for each of the financial years 2004 and 2005 of 15% per annum from the level attained in the first half of 2003 of 3,219,000 or 1.34p per share, annualised to be an adjusted earnings per share 2.68p per share for 2003.
The second tranche of these awards is now confirmed since adjusted operating profit of 20,056,000 or 8.1p per share for 2004 is well in excess of the 15% growth required from the level of 2.68p per share.
The remaining award will be confirmed at the time of the announcement of the results for 2005 in April 2006.
Executive Chairman and Finance Director Awards Share awards were also made under the 2002 Executive Share Incentive Scheme to the Chairman and to the Finance Director in July 2004 as follows: Total award Tranche 1 Tranche 2 Tranche 3 Executive director of shares 2004 2005 2006 Richard Griffiths 1,312,500 187,500 375,000 750,000 Graeme Dell 1,312,500 187,500 375,000 750,000 These awards were made in a manner to take into account comments received from the institutional investor voting agencies.
Therefore, they were established in three phased tranches with performance criteria measured over three accounting periods and a requirement of an overall vesting period of three years.
Each tranche of shares will only vest subject to continued employment and the achievement of the Groups earnings per share growth of 15% per annum from the full year 2003 adjusted earnings per share of 4.37p per share.
This is calculated on the basis of an adjusted operating profit of 10,617,000 and a weighted average number of shares in issue of 242,953,440.
The awards will be confirmed after three years on 6 July 2007, subject to continued employment, by the grant of call rights to acquire the confirmed award shares at nominal value.
The performance condition for the 2004 award has now been met since adjusted operating profit of 20,056,000 or 8.1p per share for 2004 is in excess of the 15% growth required from the level of 4.37p per share and the awards will vest in 2007 subject to continuing employment.
Performance criteria for award vesting In all cases above the measure of performance required for awards to be confirmed is based upon a 15% growth in adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share.
This measure has been chosen as it best reflects the Groups target for growth appropriate to the sector and the market conditions in which the Group operates.
Adjusted operating the evolution group plc 33 Report & Accounts 2004 Directors Remuneration Report - continued profit is the measure that the Committee believes will enhance the long-term value of the Group and is therefore appropriately aligned with shareholders interests.
The Committee believes that a 15% annual growth is an appropriately challenging rate of annualised growth.
To the extent that IFRS will have an impact on adjusted earnings per share performance, the Remuneration Committee will continue to ensure that performance is measured consistently and that adjusted earnings per share at the start and end of the performance period are measured on the same basis.
Award levels have been determined in the light of the impact on shareholders dilution.
The awards made in 2004 to Executive directors will, subject to vesting, absorb 1.1% of issued share capital.
The current dilution arising from the Groups discretionary schemes is 8.9%, taking into account own shares purchased by the Groups employee trust to satisfy share awards.
The Remuneration Committee keeps the levels of dilution under regular review.
No Executive director has any entitlement to participate in the Plan and the level of awards has to date been made on an occasional rather than an annual basis.
The Remuneration Committee is aware that the Executive Share Incentive Scheme operates unusually in two main respects: there are no annual limits on individual award levels and the vesting of awards is phased over three years.
The Committee believes this flexibility allows remuneration to be structured in a simple and yet highly effective way which aligns the interests of Executive directors with those of major shareholders.
Awards from 2004 are subject to the achievement of a stretching performance condition and the Committee has introduced a requirement to defer the release of shares until the end of the three year period.
The Committee maintains that the measurement of performance over annual cycles combined with this deferral creates the right combination of meaningful incentive and shareholder alignment within a business in which short-term decisions and performance are critical to medium-term and long-term growth.
The requirement to defer the vesting of shares for three years and that shares should only vest subject to the achievement of performance conditions, are amendments to policy that the Committee has made after talking to major institutional shareholders in 2004 and receiving feedback from institutional shareholder voting agencies in respect of the Directors Remuneration Report for 2003.
The Remuneration Committee during 2005 will be reviewing its overall approach and will consider remuneration with major shareholders in due course.
Executive directors are eligible to participate in the The Evolution Group Share Incentive Plan SIP.
The SIP is an Inland Revenue approved plan open to all UK permanent employees.
Eligible employees may contribute up to 125 each month and the trustee of the plan uses the money to buy partnership shares on their behalf.
An equivalent number of matching shares is purchased with contributions from the employing company.
Details of their Executive directors share interests under these plans is given in the table below.
1 January Partnership Matching Dividend 31 December Executive director 2004 shares shares shares 2004 Richard Griffiths - 1,756 1,756 7 3,519 Alex Snow - 1,756 1,756 7 3,519 Graeme Dell - 1,756 1,756 7 3,519 IP2IPO incentive awards In May 2004 at the time of the placing of 9,000,000 shares in the Groups former associated undertaking, IP2IPO Group Plc, the Group was able to crystallise an amount of 40.5 million before any related expenses of sale upon the sale of a part of its remaining stake.
This transaction realised significant value for Evolutions shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee determined that a bonus pool of 10% of the cash realised from which commission and other transaction costs should be deducted, should be established and distributed among Executive directors and employees who had made the greatest contribution towards delivering this value to the Group.
Details of awards made to the Executive directors are shown in the table on page 37.
The remaining cash to the business from the placement is 36.4 million, which the Committee regards as an extremely positive contribution to the Groups value.
Pensions None of the directors receive any pension contributions from the Group either under defined contribution or final salary schemes.
the evolution group plc 34 Report & Accounts 2004 Proportion of fixed and variable remuneration In line with the reward structure outlined above, the relative proportions of fixed annual remuneration and performance related pay made for 2004 for the Executive directors are as follows:- Non-Performance Performance related related Annual IP2IPO % Bonus % award % Total % Richard Griffiths 4 52 44 100 Alex Snow 4 53 43 100 Graeme Dell 12 53 35 100 Directors service contracts The Combined Code recommends that a one-year notice period or contract terms be set as an objective for Executive directors.
The Remuneration Committees policy is that service contracts should not have a notice period exceeding 12 months and should not contain a liquidated damages clause in the event of termination.
All Executive directors have service contracts with no fixed terms and with notice periods of 12 months or less.
The principal terms extant in these contracts are as set out below.
The directors service contracts and letters of engagement for Non-executive directors will be available for inspection at the Companys AGM.
Contractual Contract Notice termination date period payments Alex Snow 13.11.03 12 months None Richard Griffiths 29.03.01 12 months None Graeme Dell 03.07.01 3 months None Non-executive Directors Non-executive directors do not hold service contracts but letters of engagement.
The dates of their appointment are shown on pages 16 to 17.
The Non-executive directors service contracts are each for an initial term of one year with two months notice.
Non-executives are subject to the same process of re-appointment on a rolling basis at the time of the AGM.
Non-executive directors receive a fee for their service to the Board.
Fee levels for all Non-executive directors are set by the Chairman and Executive directors.
The Non-executive directors are not involved in the discussions to determine their own remuneration.
On 1 January 2004, the Non-executive fees were changed to reflect the structure of Board and Committee responsibilities.
The basic Board fee was set at a level of 20,000 or 25,000, with an additional 5,000 for the additional responsibility of chairing a Committee, and an additional 5,000 for the Senior Non-executive director.
At the time of the restructuring of the Non-executive Board in July 2004, with the appointment of Lord MacLaurin from that date, the Non-executive fee structure was simplified as from 1 August 2004 to a simple overall fee for Board and Committee members of 50,000 per annum.
The Board believe this simplified structure and fee level is appropriate and reflects the experience brought by the Non-executive directors and the time commitment they give and the contribution they make.
Non-executive directors do not participate in the Groups annual bonus arrangements or long-term incentive arrangements.
Fees cease to be payable immediately upon termination of any appointments for any reason and no compensation is payable in respect of such termination.
Mr D. Norwood was granted share options during his time as an Executive director of the Company in respect of his services as an Executive director up until 9 September 2003.
At this point he took up full time executive responsibilities with IP2IPO and became a Non-executive director of the Company.
Mr Norwood resigned as a director of the Company on 18 March 2004. the evolution group plc 35 Report & Accounts 2004 Directors Remuneration Report - continued Five Year Historical TSR Performance Growth in the Value of a Hypothetical 100 Holding Over Five Years FTSE Mid 250 excluding Investment Trusts Comparison Based on 30 Trading Day Average Values 150 135 120 105 90 75 60 45 30 15 0 Dec-99 Dec-00 Dec-01 Dec-02 Dec-03 Dec-04 FTSE Mid 250 excluding Investment Trusts The Evolution Group plc The above graph shows the TSR against that of the FTSE 250 Index.
TSR is calculated assuming dividends are reinvested on receipt.
In the opinion of the directors, the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment Trusts is the most appropriate index against which the total shareholder return of the Group should be measured as at 31 December 2004, because it is an index of similar-sized companies to the Group.
However, in the period shown in the graph above the Group was listed on the AIM market from December 1999 up until its move to the Full List of the London Stock Exchange in June 2003, when it became a constituent of the FTSE Small cap index.
Thereafter, the Groups shares then joined the FTSE 250 index in March 2004.
During the five year period presented in the graph above, the Group has changed significantly in structure, size and operations.
The Group commenced its development into an integrated investment bank and stockbroker in November 2000 following the merger with Christows the Groups stockbroking and fund management business : followed by the acquisition of Evolution Capital Limited institutional investment banking in March 2001: and finally the acquisition of the Beeson Gregory Group investment banking services including corporate finance and advisory, sales and research Combined with the continuing organic growth and rigorous cost control, the Groups investment banking platform was really only fully established on 1 January 2003.
In the two year period since then the Groups TSR has increased 180% compared to the growth in the FTSE 250 index of 64%.

Snow and G. Dell, the provision of a company car allowance.
Mr D. Norwood received a 2,000 contribution under a money purchase pension plan.
Directors pensions None of the directors receive any pension contributions from the Group either under defined contribution or final salary schemes.
Save as set out above, no directors nor members of the immediate family of directors, have any options over shares in the Company or any Group company or, during the year to 31 December 2004, was granted or exercised an option over shares in the Company.
The market price for an ordinary share in the Company at 31 December 2004 was 1.50 2003: 1.015.
The highest price throughout the year was 1.58 and the lowest was 1.015.
Summary of schemes for directors options in the above tables 1.
These options were granted under the 2001 Executive Share Option Scheme.
Under the terms of this scheme the performance criteria require that the closing bid of The Evolution Group Plc share price as derived from the Daily Official List published by The London Stock Exchange Plc must be not less on average than a specified amount for a period of sixty consecutive days before options can be exercised.
If the share price is 90p then 25% of the options may be exercised, 110p a further 25% may be exercised, 130p then a further 25% may be exercised and 150p the remaining 25% may be exercised.
Up to 75% of these awards are now vestable on the basis of the Groups share price in 2004.
These options were granted under the 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme Unapproved Ordinary.
A performance criteria has been set making the exercise of the option conditional on the middle market quotation of The Evolution Group Plc share price increasing by an average of 50% above the relevant exercise price over a period of 30 dealing days since the date of the grant.
The vesting conditions for these options have been met in full.
No performance criteria are attached to the exercise of these options.
These options were granted outside of any share scheme.
These options were issued on the completion of the Christows acquisition in November 2000 and were immediately vestable since they were based on past performance.
the evolution group plc 38 Report & Accounts 2004 5.
These options were granted under the 2002 Executive Share Incentive Plan.
These options were immediately vestable since they were based on the past performance of Mr Snow and in recognition of the conclusion of the establishment of an appropriate service contract.
The Board considered that the Groups interests were served by the establishment of such a contract as a matter of paramount importance given that securing Mr Snows ongoing services is believed to be fundamental to the success of the Group.
The Committee feel that in the light of these facts the award levels and their vesting criteria are justified and reasonable.
The options are granted subject to performance criteria in respect of the Groups adjusted earnings per share based upon the adjusted operating profit figure divided by the weighted average number of shares for the full years in 2004 and 2005.
To fully vest the Groups adjusted earnings per share will need to grow by 15% per annum over the annualised level achieved in the first half of 2003 of 1.34p.
This will be confirmed at the time of the announcement of the Groups results for these periods in March 2005 and in or around April 2006 respectively.
This measure has been chosen as it best reflects the Groups target for growth appropriate to the sector, market conditions in which the Group operates, and is therefore appropriately aligned with shareholders interests.
The tranche for 2004 is now confirmed since adjusted operating profit of 20,056,000 or 8.1p per share in 2004 is well in excess of the 15% growth required from the level of 2.68p per share it was measured against for 2003.
The remaining award will be confirmed at the time of the announcement of the results for 2005 in or around April 2006.
These awards were granted under the 2002 Executive Share Incentive Plan.
These awards are subject to strict Group earnings per share performance criteria requiring growth of 15% per annum from the full year 2003 adjusted operating profit of 4.37p per share Adjusted operating profit 10,617,000, weighted average number of shares in issue 242,953,440.
The performance condition for the 2004 award has now been met since adjusted operating profit of 20,056,000 or 8.1p per share for 2004 is well in excess of the 15% growth required from the level of 4.37p per share and will vest in 2007 subject to continuing employment.
These options were granted under the 2001 Executive Share Option Scheme at an exercise price of 41.4p.
This award was made in respect of historic performance and partly in recognition of the cancellation of a previous award.
This award was made in respect of historic performance hence no performance criteria are attached to the exercise of these options.
