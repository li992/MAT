The full Terms of Reference of the Committee can be found on the Anglo American website and copies are available on request.
The Committee met five times during 2004.
Membership of the Committee The Committee comprised the following independent non-executive directors during the year ended 31 December 2004: R J Margetts chairman : D J Challen: Dr C E Fay: and F T M Phaswana.
The Companys chairman and chief executive attend the Committee meetings by invitation and assist the Committee in its considerations, except when issues relating to their own compensation are discussed.
No directors are involved in deciding their own remuneration.
In 2004 the Committee was advised by R J King and C B Corrin Group Human Resources, the Companys finance function and by Ernst & Young LLP who were appointed by the Committee to act as independent advisors.
In 2004, the Committee also received advice from: Monks Partnership a subsidiary of  LLP appointed by the Company, with the agreement of the Committee, to provide market remuneration data:  LLP appointed by the Company, with the agreement of the Committee, to provide specialist valuation services: and Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow Limited appointed by the Company, with the agreement of the Committee, to provide specialist actuarial advice.
In addition, Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited Mercer is engaged by the Committee to review the Committees processes on an annual basis in order to provide shareholders with assurance that the remuneration processes that the Company and the Committee have followed are in line with the stated policy as set out below, and that the Committee has operated within its Terms of Reference.
A summary of the letter from Mercer containing the conclusions of their review of the Committees executive remuneration processes for 2004 can be found on page 43, whilst the full letter can be found on the Companys website.
In 2004 the advisors to the Committee provided other services to the Company in the UK on the following basis: Advisors Nature of other services Ernst & Young LLP General tax advice  LLP Taxation and payroll advice: investment advisors and actuaries for various pension schemes: advisors on internal audit projects Mercer group companies Investment advisors and actuaries for various pension schemes Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow Limited Investment advisors and actuaries for various pension schemes Certain overseas operations within the Group are also provided with audit and non-audit related services from Ernst & Youngs,  and Mercers worldwide member firms.
The Companys auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP, have not provided advice to the Committee: however, in their capacity as Group auditors, they do undertake an audit of all remuneration elements.
7878v03 GC Rp 28-p39 020305. qxp 4 3 05 2:09 am Page 29 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2004 29 REMUNERATION POLICY Anglo Americans remuneration policy is formulated to attract and retain high calibre executives and motivate them to develop and implement the Companys business strategy in order to optimise long term shareholder value creation.
It is the intention that this policy should conform to best practice standards and that it will apply for 2005 and subsequent years, subject to ongoing review as appropriate.
The policy is framed around the following key principles: total rewards will be set at levels that are sufficiently competitive to enable the recruitment and retention of high calibre executives: total incentive-based rewards will be earned through the achievement of demanding performance conditions consistent with shareholder interests: incentive plans, performance measures and targets will be structured to operate soundly throughout the business cycle: the design of long term incentives will be prudent and will not expose shareholders to unreasonable financial risk: in considering the market positioning of reward elements, account will be taken of the performance of the Company and of the individual executive director: and reward practice will conform to best practice standards as far as reasonably practicable.
Representatives of the Companys principal investors are consulted on changes to remuneration policy.
Elements of executive director remuneration Each executive directors total remuneration consists of salary, annual bonus, long term incentives and benefits.
An appropriate balance is maintained between fixed and performance-related remuneration and between elements linked to short term financial performance and those linked to longer term shareholder value creation.
Assuming on-target performance, the Committees policy is that at least 50% 60% for the chief executive or more of total executive director remuneration is performance-related.
In 2004, 67% of the chief executives remuneration on an expected value basis was performance-related: for the other executive directors, on average the figure was 61% see illustrative charts below.
33% n Fixed n Fixed 33% 34% 39% n Performance-related n Performance-related annual bonus annual bonus n Performance-related n Performance-related long-term incentives long-term incentives 28% 33% Chief executive expected values Average executive director expected values Shareholders approved the introduction of the new Bonus Share Plan BSP at the AGM in 2004.
Taken together, the BSP and the existing Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP are designed to clearly underpin the Companys existing performance culture by creating a better linkage between shareholder value creation and executive reward.
The combination of performance measures provides a thorough assessment of value-driven performance.
The Committee monitors closely the relevance and appropriateness of the performance measures and targets applicable to the BSP and LTIP.
These performance conditions may be amended by the Committee only to the extent that they are a fairer measure of performance, consistent with the original performance conditions and no less demanding.
The level of share-based remuneration within the reward mix will ensure that executive directors and other levels of management have a meaningful level of exposure to the Companys share price performance.
7878v03 GC Rp 28-p39 020305. qxp 4 3 05 2:09 am Page 30 30 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2004 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Basic salary The basic salary of the executive directors is reviewed annually and is targeted at the median of companies of comparable size, market sector, business complexity and international scope.
Company performance, individual performance and changes in responsibilities are also taken into consideration in setting salary levels each year.
Bonus Share Plan The BSP was operated for the first time during 2004 and all executive directors are eligible to participate in it.
The BSP requires executive directors to invest a significant proportion of their remuneration in shares, thereby more closely aligning their interests with those of shareholders, and encourages management at all levels to build up a meaningful personal stake in the Company.
Awards under the BSP are made annually and consist of three elements: a performance-related cash element, an equal amount, as a conditional award, of Bonus Shares and an additional performance-related element in the form of Enhancement Shares.
These bonus awards are not pensionable.
The BSP operates as follows: the value of the bonus is calculated by reference to achievement against annual performance targets.
The performance measures for the BSP include measures of corporate and, where applicable, business unit performance as well as the achievement of specific individual objectives.
For executive directors, the corporate element is based on stretching Earnings Per Share EPS targets which are calculated using headline earnings defined in note 12 of the financial statements.
In 2004, the EPS targets were met in full: the Committee reviews these measures annually to ensure they remain appropriate and sufficiently stretching in the context of the economic and performance expectations for the Company and its operating businesses: it is the Committees usual policy to base 70% of each annual bonus award on the corporate or business measure and the remaining 30% on key personal performance measures.
The level of bonuses payable will be reduced if certain overall safety improvement targets are not met.
Bonus parameters are set on an individual basis: in the case of the directors and top tier of management, half of the bonus is paid in cash.
The cash element would not normally exceed 75% of basic salary for the chief executive and 60% of basic salary for the other executive directors.
The other half of the bonus is in the form of a conditional award of Bonus Shares equal in value to the cash element.
These Bonus Shares vest only if the participant remains in employment with the Group until the end of a three year holding period, or is, in the view of the Remuneration Committee, deemed to be a good leaver: and in order to provide continuing focus on medium term performance, executive directors will also receive an award of conditional Enhancement Shares at the same time as the award of Bonus Shares.
The maximum potential, at face value, of the Enhancement Shares is 75% of the face value of the Bonus Shares i. e. in the case of the chief executive a maximum of 56% of basic salary.
Awards of Enhancement Shares made in 2004 will vest after three years only to the extent that a challenging performance condition, based on EPS growth against the UK Retail Price Index RPI, is met, as shown below: 75% 33% 0% RPI RPI RPI RPI RPI RPI RPI 0% 3% 6% 9% 12% 15% 18% Real EPS growth over 3 years Vesting of Enhancement Shares Additional percentage of Bonus Shares acquired Real EPS has been selected as the most appropriate performance measure for this element of the plan because it is a fundamental financial performance indicator, both internally and externally, and links directly to Anglo Americans long term objectives of maintaining and improving earnings.
The targets were approved by the Committee after reviewing industry performance over a number of years and have been set at a level which provides stretching performance levels for management.
At the end of each performance period, the level of performance achieved and the proportion of awards vesting will be published in the subsequent remuneration report.
In 2004, only executive directors and the top tier of management worldwide circa 50 individuals participated in the BSP.
In 2005, it is intended that participation in the BSP will be extended to other tiers of senior management globally circa 1,300 individuals who will thereafter cease to receive grants under the Companys Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS.
Additional percentage of Bonus Shares acquaired 7878v03 GC Rp 28-p39 020305. qxp 4 3 05 2:10 am Page 31 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2004 31 Share option and all employee schemes No share options were granted to executive directors under the ESOS in 2004 and, as noted above, future grants under the ESOS will be discontinued, other than for use in recruitment or other exceptional circumstances.
Executive directors remain eligible to participate in the Companys Save As You Earn SAYE and Share Incentive Plan SIP schemes.
As these schemes are open to all UK employees, performance conditions do not apply.
Long Term Incentive Plan Grant levels Conditional LTIP awards continue to be made annually to executive directors.
Awards under the LTIP in 2004 were increased from 120% to 160% of basic salary for the chief executive and from 100% to 130% of basic salary for the other executive directors.
Awards were raised in order to maintain market competitiveness and to reflect the rebalanced incentive structure.
These awards are discretionary and are considered on a case-by-case basis.
In exceptional circumstances and in order to accommodate changing market conditions, individual awards may be made up to a maximum of two times basic salary per annum.
Performance measures As in previous years, vesting of LTIP awards made during 2004 is subject to the achievement of stretching performance targets, relating to Total Shareholder Return TSR and to an operating measure, currently Return On Capital Employed ROCE, over a fixed three year period.
In previous years, executive directors with direct divisional responsibility were measured partially on divisional ROCE as well as Group ROCE.
However, all awards made in 2004 and thereafter will be measured only on Group ROCE, in order to provide a simpler and more coherent focus on overall Group performance.
Half of each award made to a director, therefore, is subject to a Group TSR measure while the other half of each award is subject to a Group ROCE measure.
These performance measures were selected on the basis that they clearly foster the creation of shareholder value.
At the end of each performance period, the level of ROCE performance achieved and the level of award earned will be published in the subsequent remuneration report.
There is no retesting of performance.
The LTIP closely aligns the interests of shareholders and executive directors by rewarding superior shareholder and financial performance and by encouraging executives to build up a shareholding in the Company.
Total Shareholder Return The Committee considers comparative TSR to be a suitable long term performance measure for the Companys LTIP awards.
Executives benefit only if shareholders have enjoyed returns on their investment which are superior to those that could have been obtained in other comparable companies.
The vesting of that part of the LTIP award contingent upon TSR performance varies according to the Companys TSR over the performance period, relative to a weighted basket of international natural resource companies the Index.
The Index comprises three categories: the first consists of a minimum of five international diversified mining companies, the second a minimum of five international paper and packaging companies and the third a minimum of four international industrial minerals companies.
Each category is weighted to reflect Anglo Americans business mix.
The Committee may amend the list of comparator companies in the Index, and the relative weightings, if circumstances make this necessary for example, as a result of takeovers or mergers of comparator companies in the Index.
In calculating TSR, it is assumed that all dividends are reinvested.
For awards made in 2004, the companies constituting the Index were as follows: Mining Paper and Packaging Industrial Minerals Category weighting 71% 17% 12% Comparator companies BHP Billiton plc M-real Corporation Aggregate Industries plc Companhia Vale do Rio Doce Sappi Limited CRH plc Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc SCA Hanson plc Kumba Resources Limited David S.

A graph showing the Companys TSR performance against the weighted average of the Index as shown above for the five years from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004 can be found on page 35: for the purposes of drawing this graph, Companhia Vale do Rio Doce and Xstrata plc were excluded as they were not listed at the beginning of the period depicted by the graph.
Return On Capital Employed Group ROCE is the second performance measure for LTIP grants.
The board considers this to be among the most important factors which drive sustainable improvements in shareholder value in a natural resources business, as well as one of the most important measures of differentiation in performance in this sector.
The proportion of shares vesting based on Group ROCE will vary according to the degree of improvement in the Groups average annualised ROCE over the performance period.
The Committee sets minimum targets for improvement in returns on both capital employed for the financial year preceding the start of the performance period existing capital employed and on the additional capital employed during the performance period incremental capital employed.
The maximum ROCE targets are based on stretching levels of return on the existing capital employed.
The targets for each element of the LTIP conditionally awarded in 2004 are shown below.
These are adjusted for movements in commodity prices, certain foreign exchange rate effects, capital in progress and for relevant changes in the composition of the Group.
% Existing % Incremental capital capital employed employed Minimum ROCE target 14.57 11 Maximum ROCE target 16.57 11 The ROCE elements of the award vest as shown in the table below: % Proportion of ROCE element vesting Below or equal to the minimum target 0 Equal to or greater than the maximum target 100 Shares will vest on a straight-line basis for performance between the minimum target and the maximum target.
Vesting of share incentives in the event of change of control or termination of employment In the event of a change of control of the Company, the following provisions apply under the Companys incentive plans: share options granted under the former ESOS may be exercised irrespective of whether the applicable performance conditions have been met: the number of shares that vest under the LTIP will be calculated by reference to the extent to which the applicable performance conditions have been met at the time of the change of control: participants will be entitled to receive their bonus and matching shares under the former Deferred Bonus Plan: Bonus Shares awarded under the BSP will be released and Enhancement Shares awarded under that plan will vest, only to the extent that the applicable performance conditions have been satisfied: SAYE options may be exercised to the extent of savings at the date of exercise : and participants may direct the SIP trustee as to how to deal with their SIP shares although the Matching Shares may be forfeited in some circumstances.
In the event that a directors employment is terminated, vesting of outstanding share options is dependent upon the reasons the contract is terminated.
Performance conditions fall away in the event of redundancy.
However, if the executive resigns voluntarily, then all options lapse unless the Committee determines otherwise.
In the case of LTIP interests, if a director resigns voluntarily, then his interests lapse.
If he is made redundant, vesting at the end of the performance period is based on the normal performance criteria and then pro-rated for the proportion of the performance period for which the director served.
7878v03 GC Rp 28-p39 020305. qxp 4 3 05 2:10 am Page 33 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2004 33 In the case of the BSP, if a director ceases to be employed before the end of the year in respect of which the annual performance targets apply, then no award will be made unless the Committee determines otherwise taking into account the proportion of the year for which the director was an employee of the Group and of performance to date against the annual performance targets at the date of cessation.
If a director resigns before the end of the three year vesting period, the Bonus Share awards lapse and the Enhancement Shares are forfeited.
If a director is made redundant, Bonus Share awards will be transferred as soon as practicable after the date of leaving and the Enhancement Shares will vest at the end of the performance period, to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
Pensions Pension and life insurance benefits for executive directors reflect practice in the countries in which they perform their principal duties.
Pension arrangements are tailored to take account of historic obligations and, insofar as agreed by the Committee, the personal circumstances of each executive.
Details of individual pension arrangements are set out on pages 39 and 40.
The Remuneration Committee is considering the impact on UK pension arrangements of the new UK pensions regime which will apply from April 2006.
Further details will be disclosed in the 2005 remuneration report.
Other benefits Executive directors are entitled to the provision of either a car allowance or a fully expensed car, medical insurance, death and disability insurance, social club membership in accordance with local market practice, limited personal taxation financial advice and reimbursement of reasonable business expenses.
Directors based in South Africa are eligible to receive housing loan subsidies at a preferential interest rate in accordance with local market practice.
The provision of these benefits is considered to be market competitive in the appropriate locality for executive director positions.
Executive shareholding targets Within five years of their appointment, executive directors are expected to acquire a holding of shares with a value of two times basic salary in the case of the chief executive and one times basic salary in the case of other executive directors.
The Remuneration Committee will consider achievement against these targets when making grants under the various long term incentive plans.
External appointments Executive directors are not permitted to hold external directorships or offices without the approval of the board: if approved, they may retain the fees payable from one such appointment.
During the year ended 31 December 2004, B E Davison retained fees from one appointment amounting to 16,000.
Policy on non-executive directors remuneration Non-executive directors remuneration is approved by the board as a whole on the recommendation of the chairman and executive directors.
The Companys policy on non-executive directors remuneration is based on the following key principles.
Remuneration should be: sufficient to attract and retain world-class non-executive talent: consistent with recognised best practice standards for non-executive directors remuneration: in the form of cash fees, but with the flexibility to forgo all or part of such fees, to subscribe for shares in the Company if the non-executive director so wishes after deduction of applicable income tax and social security contributions : and set by reference to the responsibilities taken on by the non-executives in chairing the board and its committees.
Non-executive directors may not participate in the Companys annual bonus plan, share option schemes, Long Term Incentive Plan or pension arrangements.
The board reviews non-executive directors fees periodically to ensure they remain market competitive.
Additional fees are paid to the chairmen of board committees and to the senior independent director.
Where non-executive directors have executive board roles within subsidiaries of the Company, then they may also receive additional remuneration on account of these increased responsibilities.
With the exception of R M Godsell, who is remunerated by AngloGold Ashanti Limited in his capacity as its chief executive, none of the non-executive directors has any such role.
Chairmans fees The chairmans fees are approved by the board in the absence of the chairman on the recommendation of the Committee and chief executive, who take external advice on market comparators.

In order properly to reflect their spread of responsibilities, all the executive directors, with the exception of A W Lea, who is employed by Anglo American International BVI Limited, have contracts with Anglo American International IOM Limited and with Anglo Operations Limited.
The salaries under these contracts are payable in sterling and or South African rand as appropriate.
The employment contracts of all executive directors are terminable at 12 months notice by either party.

Details of those retiring by rotation this year are contained in the Notice of AGM.
In addition, a director may at any AGM retire from office and stand for re-election.
The contracts of executive directors contain a provision that sets out the compensation payable in lieu of notice if the Company terminates the contract other than for cause or if the executive director resigns in circumstances where there has been a material adverse change in role, responsibilities or remuneration.
Compensation is based on the value of 12 months basic salary, target annual bonus for 12 months and the annual value of benefits.
The Company may choose whether to continue to provide other benefits during any notice period or to pay an amount equal to the gross value of these benefits over the period.
Although the Committee notes that this policy is no longer in complete compliance with the latest ABI guidelines, it has enabled the Company to remain market competitive in an historic context.
As market practice has now moved away from the inclusion of liquidated damages in service contracts, the Committee will review this policy in 2005 for new appointments to the board.
The contracts of executive directors do not provide for any enhanced payments in the event of a change of control of the Company.
All non-executive directors have letters of appointment with the Company for an initial period of three years from their date of appointment, subject to re-election at the AGM.
In addition to his letter of appointment with the Company, R M Godsell has a service contract with AngloGold Ashanti Limited, an independently managed subsidiary of the Company, in his capacity as its chief executive.
Under this contract, his employment may be terminated by either party giving to the other 12 months notice.

This graph has been produced in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.
The second graph shows the Companys performance against the weighted comparator group used to measure company performance for the purposes of the vesting of LTIP interests awarded in 2002.
This graph gives an indication of how Anglo American plc is performing against the targets in place for LTIP interests already granted, although the specifics of the comparator companies for each years interests may vary to reflect changes such as mergers and acquisitions amongst the Companys competitors or changes to the Companys business mix.
The TSR level shown at 31 December each year is calculated in accordance with the LTIP rules.
In particular, TSR is calculated in US dollars, and the TSR level shown at 31 December each year is the average of the closing daily TSR levels for the six month period up to and including that date.
REMUNERATION OUTCOMES DURING 2004 The information set out in sections one to eight below has been subject to audit.
Directors emoluments The following tables set out an analysis of the pre-tax remuneration during the years ended 31 December 2004 and 2003, including bonuses but excluding pensions, for individual directors who held office in the Company during the year ended 31 December 2004.
They received fees of 29,000 2003: 29,000 and 21,000 2003: 26,000 respectively, for the provision of these services during the year.
2 As A J Trahar, B E Davison and W A Nairn had no provision for past service in respect of their sterling-denominated pension fund, their employing company has contractually agreed that supplementary pension contributions should be made to the Anglo American plc International Approved Pension Scheme in return for these executives having given up their right to part of their future basic salary.
The table above includes these amounts, which are 89,000, 47,000 and 42,000 respectively.
3 The 2004 performance bonus represents the cash element of the Bonus Share Plan payable in 2005.
The share elements under this scheme for 2004 will be awarded during 2005.
4 Each director received a car allowance or a fully expensed car and a limited amount of personal taxation financial advice.
All directors received death and disability insurance and, with the exception of W A Nairn, also received medical insurance.
A J Trahar, A W Lea and W A Nairn received club membership: in addition, A J Trahar received a housing loan subsidy.

Details of the performance conditions applying to bonuses in 2004 are described in further detail on page 30.
In 2004, the EPS targets were met in full.
Half of the bonus is paid in cash which would not normally exceed 75% of basic salary for the chief executive and 60% of basic salary for the other directors and the other half takes the form of a conditional award of Bonus Shares equal in value to the cash element.
The Bonus Shares vest if the director remains in employment with the Group until the end of a three year holding period.
The market price of the shares at the date of award of Bonus Shares made in 2004, in respect of 2003 performance, was 11.36 per share.
4 A conditional award of Enhancement Shares was made at the same time as the award of Bonus Shares to a maximum of 75% of the face value of the Bonus Shares.
Enhancement Shares awarded in 2004 will only vest to the extent that a challenging performance condition based on EPS growth against the UK Retail Price Index is met.
Further details of this performance condition are provided on page 30.
The market value of the shares on the date of award of the Enhancement Shares in 2004 was 11.36 per share.

Further details on the structure of the LTIP, the required level of performance for the 2004 award and how performance against targets is measured can be found on pages 31 and 32.
A second award during 2004, included in the table above, was made to the executive directors subsequent to the AGM at which the BSP was approved and the consequent rebalancing of the incentive structure as outlined on page 30.
The market prices of the shares at the dates of award were 12.62 and 12.34 per share respectively.
2 The performance period applicable to each award is three years.
The performance period relating to the 2001 LTIP awards which were granted on 26 June 2001 ended on 31 December 2003.
Vesting was subject to two performance conditions: the first based on the Companys TSR relative to a weighted group of international natural resource companies and the second based on an underlying operating measure which focused on improvements in the Companys ROCE in the medium term.
Part of each award was based on the TSR measure and part on the operating measure.
The market price of the shares at the date of the first LTIP awards was 10.30 per share.
The market price of the shares at the date of vesting of such awards was 13.07 per share.

In the case of B E Davison, to reflect his responsibility for Anglo Platinum, in 2001 the targets were 50% relative TSR, 30% Group ROCE targets and 20% on Anglo Platinum specific ROCE targets.
The ROCE targets are a function of targeted improvement in returns on existing capital employed at the start of the performance period and targeted returns in excess of the cost of capital on new capital investment over that period.
The entry level target for any LTIP has been the actual return achieved on the capital employed, excluding capital work in progress, in the year immediately preceding the commencement of the performance period.
In order to maintain the effectiveness of the plan in driving long term performance, the actual returns in the final performance year are adjusted for movements in commodity prices, certain foreign exchange rate effects e. g. translation windfalls, capital in progress to reflect the fact that mines under construction absorb large amounts of capital before producing a return, for relevant changes in the composition of the Group e. g. significant acquisitions and disposals and other one-off factors which would otherwise result in a misleading outcome.
The threshold blended target i. e. the target on existing and new capital for the period was 17.4% and the upper blended target 19.4%.
The ROCE achieved was 18.6% and the outcome on this element of the LTIP was thus 61.7%.
On the TSR measure, Anglo American achieved a TSR over the three year performance period of 60% which generated a 54% vesting in terms of the 2001 Comparator Group.
The overall vesting level for those directors with a 50% Group ROCE, 50% TSR split was therefore 57.9%.
In the case of B E Davison, the ROCE element attributable to Anglo Platinums ROCE 20% of the total 2001 LTIP failed to meet the threshold target.
The overall outcome in his case therefore was 45.5%.

Deferred Bonus Plan and Share Incentive Plan In 2003 and earlier years, executive directors were required to defer 50% of their annual bonus under the Deferred Bonus Plan and could, at the discretion of the Committee on a year-by-year basis, defer all of their bonus net of tax to acquire shares in the Company.
If these shares are held for three years they will be matched by the Company on a one-for-one basis, conditional upon the executive directors continued employment.
No further awards were made to directors under the Deferred Bonus Plan during 2004.

Pensions Directors pension arrangements Each executive director, other than A W Lea, is a member of the Anglo American plc International Approved Pension Scheme the International Scheme, which is a defined contribution pension scheme.
A J Trahar participates in the International Scheme in terms of his contract with Anglo American International IOM Limited for services to be rendered outside South Africa.
Normal contributions were made on his behalf into the International Scheme at the rate of 35% of the basic salary payable under this contract.
He also participates in the Anglo American Corporation Pension Fund the Pension Fund in respect of his South African contract, whereby he accrues an annual pension at the rate of 2.2% of pensionable salary as defined in the rules of that scheme for each year of pensionable service.
The Pension Fund provides spouses benefits of two-thirds of the members pension on the death of a member.
It does not have provision for guaranteed pension increases.
Following previously announced senior management changes in South Africa, A J Trahar will increase the time he devotes to Group matters globally.
Accordingly, the Committee has decided that, with effect from January 2005, the proportion of his overall remuneration paid under his South African contract will be reduced.
The Committee has been advised that, as a consequence, his pension payable on retirement out of the Pension Fund his South African final salary defined benefit scheme will be substantially less than he would otherwise have accrued.
The Committee has also been advised by independent professionally qualified actuaries that to provide benefits of equivalent value to those forgone would require additional contributions into the International Scheme amounting to 5.6 million, during 2005, which the Committee has decided should be paid.
Normal contributions will continue to be paid into the International Scheme with effect from January 2005, at the rate of 35% of the basic salary payable under his contract with Anglo American International IOM Limited.
A W Lea participates in the Anglo American plc Approved Pension Scheme formerly known as the Minorco Executive Directors Fund.
This scheme is also a defined contribution pension scheme.
Prior to the formation of the Company in May 1999, A W Lea was entitled to employer contributions at a rate of 35% of the basic salary under his contract with Anglo American International BVI Limited, a commitment which continues to be honoured.
A W Lea is also entitled to deferred benefits in the Pension Fund in respect of previous South African service.
B E Davison participates in the International Scheme in terms of his contract with Anglo American International IOM Limited: normal contributions are made on his behalf at the rate of 25% of the basic salary payable under this contract.
He also participates in the Anglo American Corporation Retirement Fund, whereby contributions are made at the rate of 15% of basic salary plus car allowance for historical reasons, under his South African contract.
He elected to join this scheme when it was established in September 1998 and transferred his accrued benefits from the Pension Fund, of which he was previously a member.
W A Nairn participated until his retirement at 31 December 2004 in the International Scheme in terms of his contract with Anglo American International IOM Limited: normal contributions were made on his behalf at the rate of 25% of the basic salary payable under this contract.
He was also entitled to contributions at the rate of 14% of basic salary plus car allowance for historical reasons to an independent personal retirement plan located in South Africa, under his South African contract.
No pension costs were incurred in respect of the non-executive directors, with the exception of R M Godsell, who continued to be a member of the AngloGold Ashanti Pension Fund a defined benefit pension scheme in his capacity as chief executive of that company.

Mercer undertook the review at the request of the chairman of the Committee in order to provide shareholders with assurance that the remuneration processes followed are appropriate and that the Committee has complied with the policies set out in the Remuneration Report.
In order to reach our opinion, we reviewed the Committees Terms of Reference and the minutes of its meetings held during the year as well as material presented to the Committee for its review.
We also interviewed the chairman and secretary of the Committee.
Our review was not intended to audit the compensation data set forth in the Remuneration Report or to evaluate the merits of Anglo Americans remuneration programme.
Based on our review, Mercer is of the opinion that the process followed by the Committee during 2004 was fully consistent with its Terms of Reference and that the decisions taken by the Committee were in line with the principles set out in the Remuneration Report.
It continues to be our view that the Committee takes a suitably robust approach to its work.
We would note in particular the changes to long term incentive arrangements which have been proposed in response to dialogue held with institutional investors.
We note that the Committee has refined its modus operandi each year, taking into account any comments we have made in our reviews.
As a result, we believe that the Anglo American Remuneration Committee is exemplary in its conduct, decision-making and reporting.
The members of the Remuneration Committee have received training and are regularly updated on executive compensation and corporate governance matters.
Further detail regarding the Mercer review is included in a letter of this date addressed to the Committee chairman, which we understand will be made available on the Companys website.
