"Following the 1997 and 2000 actuarial valuations of the Viridian Group Pension Scheme ""VGPS"", part of the designated surplus was set aside for distribution to Focus defined benefits section members."
On retirement these funds would be used to provide benefits in addition to those ordinarily provided by the VGPS, subject to Inland Revenue limits not being exceeded.
The final payment into these funds was made in May 2003.
As Focus members, each of the executive directors has designated funds allocated to him by the VGPS trustees for his benefit.
The values of these amounts as at 31 March 2004 were: Patrick Bourke 17,316, Patrick Haren 24,661 and Harry McCracken 43,719.
These amounts are not included in the accrued benefits and transfer values quoted above.
Due to the impact of Inland Revenue limits, there may be limited scope to utilise these funds.
Any unused funds would be returned to the general assets of the VGPS.

Harry McCracken reached this maximum limit in August 2003 and pensionable service accrual and member contributions ceased from that date.
Pension increases are in line with inflation, with increases above 5% at the Companys discretion.
If a director takes early retirement without Board consent a pension with actuarial reduction would be payable from age 50.
A pension on ill-health retirement would be based on potential service to normal pension age.
If the executive dies whilst in 2 service, a lump sum of four times final salary and a contingent spouses pension of 3 of the directors pension based on service to normal pension age would be payable.
In the event of a change in control of the Company resulting in early retirement, there would be no actuarial reduction for early payment of pension over the age of 50.
