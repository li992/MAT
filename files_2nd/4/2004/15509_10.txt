Report to shareholders by the Board on directors remuneration a Introduction The following report outlines the Companys policy on remuneration of executive and non-executive directors of the Company and senior executives of the Group and details actual remuneration of both executive and non-executive directors of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2004.
For the year ended 31 March 2004 remuneration of executive directors was considered by the Companys Remuneration Committee.
In preparing this report consideration has been given to the requirements of the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, the Listing Rules and accepted best practice.
It is the intention of the Board to put this report to an advisory vote of shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting at which the financial statements will be considered.
The Board unanimously recommend that shareholders vote in favour of this report.
b The Remuneration Committee: i Membership The Board established, with effect from 19 May 2003, a Remuneration Committee.
The committee currently comprises the following non-executive directors: P C F Hickson Chairman M K Atkinson K R Flaherty W K Koepf I M Clubb served as Chairman of the committee until his resignation as a director of the Company on 26 January 2004.
P C F Hickson became a member and was appointed Chairman of the committee on 6 May 2004.
In accordance with the best practice recommendations of the Combined Code the committees members are all independent of management and free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the committee.
ii Terms of reference The committee operates in accordance with written terms of reference, which have been determined by the Board and take into account best practice and the requirements of the Combined Code.
The committee meets formally at least twice a year and otherwise as required.
The committee makes recommendations to the Board on broad policy to be adopted for executive remuneration and on the total remuneration packages of the Chairman and executive directors and certain other senior executives of the Group.
This includes, where appropriate, the determination of basic salary, cash bonuses and other incentive scheme entitlements, other benefits including pensions and the terms of individual executive directors service agreements.
The committee has access to the advice and services of Neil Sutcliffe, Chief Human Resources Officer and Peter Harris, Head of Compensation, Pensions and Benefits neither of whom have been formally appointed by the committee.
The committee also takes the advice of the Chairman and Chief Executive, as appropriate, on the performance of the executive directors but they do not participate in any discussion relating to their own remuneration.
No external advisors have been consulted or formally appointed by the committee.
The fees of non-executive directors are reviewed and determined by the Board.
iii Remuneration policy and practice The key principles as adopted by the committee are: To ensure that executive remuneration policy and practices support business strategy and are cost-effective: To provide remuneration packages which are competitive within the Companys operating environment, enabling the Company to attract, retain and motivate senior executives of high quality with appropriate skills: To operate short and long-term incentive plans, as part of total remuneration, which reward the delivery of results aligned with shareholders interests while limiting earnings where there is under-performance: and To provide management and employees with appropriate incentives to develop the Companys position in order to exploit the opportunities which will arise in the telecommunications industry.
The main elements of remuneration of the executive directors are: Basic salary: Share based incentives: and Pension The Chairman and executive directors are remunerated by a combination of fixed and performance related elements.
Fixed remuneration consists of basic salary, pension and benefits in kind.
Performance related remuneration consists of the award of share options.
The performance related elements of remuneration are intended to provide a significant proportion of their potential total remuneration.
35 Report to shareholders by the Board on directors remuneration continued Basic salary Basic salaries for the Chairman and the executive directors are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee, usually annually.
Although payment of basic salary is not linked to performance the general approach adopted by the committee, when assessing the need for any increase, is to take into account individual performance and skills and the external competitiveness in conjunction with other elements of remuneration of the salary.
Currently the primary considerations, within the principles outlined above are: The Management Plan was approved by the Companys creditors as part of the restructuring on the basis that it would motivate executive directors and other key executives to achieve results in line with the creditors interests: Prior to the vesting of the final tranche in August 2006, the Management Plan is a powerful tool in retaining the executives critical to the future development of the business and as an equity based plan aligns their interests with those of shareholders: Post August 2006 the Company will aim to provide remuneration packages which are comparable to market norms, which will attract high quality executives and which will provide above average reward for above average performance: and Prior to August 2006, the Company will aim to ensure that base salaries do not fall behind market medians.
In assessing competitiveness, the committee will consider comparator groups in both Europe and the US, but weighted towards Europe.
Comparator groups include companies in similar sectors and those with similar levels of turnover to the Company.
Performance assessment of executive directors includes both the performance of the Company and the achievement of individual objectives.
Under arrangements put in place as part of the Schemes of Arrangement in respect of the Company and M 2003 plc formerly known as Marconi plc, its former parent company, which became effective on 19 May 2003 the Restructuring, no executive director received an increase in basic salary for a period of 12 months from 19 May 2003.
Having taken into account the value of both basic salary and the total levels of reward of the Chairman and the executive directors, the committee has determined that no salary increases should be awarded to them in the year to 31 March 2005.
Share based incentives The Company operates two share based incentive plans, the Marconi Corporation Senior Management Share Option Plan the Management Plan and the Marconi Corporation Employee Share Option Plan the Employee Plan.
These were effective from 19 May 2003 the Plan start date.
The Remuneration Committee will determine, if appropriate, any future grants under the Management Plan and the Employee Plan.
1 The Management Plan Options may be granted under the Management Plan for a period of up to five years from the completion of the Restructuring.
Under the initial grant made on 24 June 2003, options become exercisable in five tranches between 12 and 63 months after the Plan start date subject to the achievement of the following performance conditions: Percentage of shares subject to option that vest per cent Participants who released Retention and Emergence Other Tranche plan rights participants Condition 1.
20 10 Repayment of 30% of the Junior Notes within 24 months after the Plan start date.
Options will not be exercisable before 12 months after the Plan start date.
10 10 Repayment of 50% of the Junior Notes within 27 months after the Plan start date.
Options will not be exercisable before 15 months after the Plan start date.
20 20 Repayment of 100% of the Junior Notes within 30 months after the Plan start date.
Options will not be exercisable before 18 months after the Plan start date.
20 30 The Company achieving a market capitalisation of 1 billion and repayment of 100% of the Junior Notes within 39 months after the Plan start date.
Options will not be exercisable before 27 months after the Plan start date.
5. within 51 months within 51 months The Company achieving a market capitalisation of 1.5 billion and of the Plan start date of the Plan start date repayment of 100% of the Junior Notes within 63 months after the 30 30 Plan start date.
Options will not be exercisable before 39 months after the Plan start date.
between 51 months between 51 months and 63 months of the and 63 months of the Plan start date Plan start date 20 20 Does not apply to P S Binning and J F Devaney.
36 Participants in the Management Plan are not eligible to participate in any cash bonus plan or long-term incentive plan other than persons eligible to receive sales related bonuses or commission while they hold unvested options outstanding under the Management Plan.
The Management Plan therefore represents the total variable compensation for participants during its life.
These performance conditions and the numbers of options granted to each participant were determined in order to: Provide an incentive to deliver value to the Companys shareholders through the repayment of debt and growth in market capitalisation: and Provide a level of reward appropriate to the Companys performance.
In order for tranches 4 and 5 to become exercisable, the rolling average market capitalisation must exceed the stated target for a 90 day period.
The performance criteria in respect of tranches 1 to 4 have now been met.
For any subsequent grants, for example, to new employees or as a result of promotions or expanded roles or responsibilities, the Remuneration Committee will set appropriate performance targets which are at least as challenging as those for the initial grant.
Options have been granted to P S Binning, J F Devaney, M J Donovan and M W J Parton under the Management Plan.
Details are set out on page 43 of this report.
Each of them are subject to the performance conditions as explained above although the dates on which the option granted to P S Binning becomes exercisable differ.
No director holds any share options or any other long-term incentive plan awards, which are not subject to performance conditions.
No further grants to the Chairman or the executive directors are anticipated under the Management Plan.
2 The Employee Plan Options may be granted under the Employee Plan for a period of up to five years from the completion of the Restructuring on 19 May 2003.
Options granted under the Employee Plan only become exercisable to the extent that the performance targets to which they are subject have been satisfied.
The performance targets and vesting schedule for the initial grant of options are the same as those for the initial grant under the Management Plan.
The exercise price of options under the Employee Plan will be determined by the Remuneration Committee but will not be less than the middle market price of the Companys shares as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List on a date or dates, in the case of an average quotation not more than 30 days prior to the date of grant of the options or such other period as the Inland Revenue may agree in relation to Inland Revenue Approved Options.
No options have been granted to directors under the Employee Plan.
3 New Employee Sharesave Plan As outlined in the Chairmans statement on pages 2 and 3, shareholder approval will be sought for a new share option plan at this years Annual General Meeting.
The Marconi Sharesave Plan will be an equity based savings plan in which all employees including the executive directors will be eligible to participate.
More details on the Marconi Sharesave Plan can be found in the circular to shareholders accompanying this report.
Pension As stated above, the aim of the Remuneration Committee is that retirement benefits for executive directors should be both competitive and appropriate to the Companys circumstances.
Payment of pension benefits is not linked to performance.
The Chairman and the executive directors, are members of the Groups approved UK pension scheme, The G. E. C. 1972 Plan.
They have a normal retirement age of 62, other than the Chairman who has a normal retirement age of 65.
J F Devaney was admitted to the G. E. C. 1972 Plan under standard terms and conditions with effect from 19 May 2003 and has accrued benefits in the G. E. C. 1972 Plan since that date.
P S Binning was admitted to the G. E. C. 1972 Plan under standard terms and conditions with effect from 22 October 2003 and has accrued benefits in the G. E. C. 1972 Plan since that date.
Executive directors basic salary is the only element of their remuneration that is pensionable.
The earnings of P S Binning, J F Devaney, M J Donovan and M W J Parton are subject to the Inland Revenue earnings cap that restricts the benefits that can be accrued under a tax approved pension scheme.
Each has an unapproved arrangement to provide additional pension and life assurance benefits from those accrued under the G. E. C. 1972 Plan other than J F Devaney who has such an arrangement in respect of life assurance only.
Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Schemes FURBS were operated during the year for P S Binning, M J Donovan and M W J Parton.
Further details about the executive directors benefits under the G. E. C. 1972 Plan and FURBS are given in section g below.
Cash bonuses Going forward, no participant in the Management Plan may participate in a cash bonus plan or long-term incentive plan other than persons eligible to receive sales related bonuses or commission for the life of the Management Plan, i. e. until all options granted to them under the Management Plan have either vested or lapsed.
Other benefits In addition to basic salary the Chairman and executive directors receive certain other benefits including a car allowance, private medical insurance and life assurance.
37 Report to shareholders by the Board on directors remuneration continued c Directors service agreements The Remuneration Committee determines the terms and conditions of executive directors service agreements with the Company including duration, notice period and termination provisions.

5 Non-executive directors do not have service agreements with the Company.
All non-executive directors serve for an initial period of three years, subject to the Articles of Association of the Company, after which an appointment can be renewed by agreement of the Board.
No compensation is payable upon termination of appointment but if an appointment terminates in any year for which an advance fee has been paid see section d below the director concerned is obliged to repay a prorated amount of that years advance fee.
No compensation on loss of office was paid to I M Clubb.
38 External appointments With the Companys approval the Chairman and executive directors are permitted to hold appointments outside the Company.
Any such appointments must be in line with the Companys internal procedures and any fees payable in connection with these appointments may be retained by directors unless otherwise agreed.
d Non-executive directors The policy on remuneration of non-executive directors is determined by the Board, by reference to practice in companies similar in size to the Company.
The current basic fee for all non-executive directors is 30,000 per annum which reflects the importance and increasing complexity of the role.
This basic fee is based on two days service to the Company per month.
The non-executive directors may also be paid a fee of 1,500 per day for each additional day devoted to the Companys business over and above the threshold of 24 days per annum in respect of Board service plus an additional four days per annum in respect of chairmanship of board committees where applicable.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee receives an additional fee of 15,000 per annum and the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee an additional fee of 10,000 per annum.
The non-executive directors are also paid advance fees which, by agreement with the non-executive directors, are specifically used to purchase shares in the Company.
These fees are paid in advance for each of the corresponding years of their appointment as follows: Name of director Year one Year two Year three M K Atkinson 100,000 30,000 30,000 K R Flaherty 30,000 30,000 30,000 P C F Hickson 30,000 30,000 Nil W K Koepf 100,000 30,000 30,000 D F McWilliams 30,000 30,000 30,000 The non-executive directors must hold the shares purchased in year one included in section h i for three years from the date of their appointment and those purchased in years two and three for one year from the respective purchase dates.
If an appointment is terminated for any reason during any year, for which an advance fee has been paid, the director concerned is obliged to repay the advance fee for that year, less an amount pro rata to the time served during the year.
This arrangement was applied to I M Clubb upon his resignation as a director of the Company.
The Chairman has discretion to waive the holding periods if he considers there to be a valid reason to justify this.
Non-executive directors do not participate in any other incentive scheme or the Groups pension arrangements and receive no further benefits or entitlements.
e Performance graph The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 require the Company to provide, in this Report, a line graph illustrating the Companys performance, measured by Total Shareholder Return TSR, as compared with an appropriate and broad equity market index.
TSR is defined as the return shareholders would receive if they held a notional number of shares in the Company.
It measures the percentage growth in the Companys share price together with the value of any dividends paid, assuming that the dividends are reinvested in the Companys shares.
The following graph shows, since 19 May 2003, being the date on which the Companys shares commenced trading on the London Stock Exchange, the TSR on a holding of shares in the Company as against that of a hypothetical holding of shares made up of shares of the same kinds and number as those by reference to which the FTSE 250 Index is calculated.
The FTSE 250 Index was selected for this purpose as it is a widely recognised performance comparison for UK companies of a similar size to the Company.

W K Koepfs remuneration also includes additional sums paid to him in respect of his non-executive chairmanship of two German subsidiary companies of the Company.
g Retirement benefits The Chairman and the executive directors are members of the Groups principal pension scheme, the G. E. C. 1972 Plan, which is a defined benefit scheme.
Members contribute at the rate of 3% of pensionable earnings, subject to limits imposed by the Inland Revenue.
Company contributions made during the year ended 31 March 2004 amounted to 8.2% of pensionable earnings.
Such Company contributions were restricted in a similar manner to the members own contributions.
Details of the Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Schemes FURBS operated during the year for P S Binning, M J Donovan and M W J Parton are set out below.
With effect from 1 April 2002, the unapproved pension arrangement for M W J Parton was amended to remove his defined benefit promise, which was substituted by a defined contribution promise.
A gross contribution of 35% of basic salary is paid as a pension allowance, 60% of which is payable to the FURBS established for him and the balance of 40% is paid direct to M W J Parton.
In recognition of the change made to M W J Partons pension arrangement, the Company paid additional gross contributions of 588,333 during the year ended 31 March 2004 which were split 60 40 as described above.
The Company made contributions to the FURBS established for M J Donovan to provide benefits at his normal retirement age of 62 equivalent to a pension of two-thirds of average final pensionable salary.
The targeted benefit takes into account the capital value of benefits arising from membership of the G. E. C. 1972 Plan and any relevant benefit in payment or otherwise arising from previous employment.
The current contribution rate is 39% of his base salary, although while he is posted to the United States the rate is 46% owing to local tax legislation.
Contributions are paid in the ratio of 60% directly to the FURBS established for him and 40% to M J Donovan, or as may be required under United States tax law.
The Company made contributions to the FURBS established for P S Binning during the year ended 31 March 2004.
A gross contribution of 25% of basic salary is paid as a pension allowance, 60% of which is payable to the FURBS established for him and the balance of 40% is paid direct to P S Binning.
In the event of death in service, a lump sum of four times basic salary, plus additional benefits for a surviving spouse and or children, inclusive of any death benefits arising from the G. E. C. 1972 Plan and from previous employment where specified, will be held in trust for the benefit of dependants of P S Binning, M J Donovan and M W J Parton.
In the case of J F Devaney a lump sum of four times basic salary, inclusive of any death benefits arising from the G. E. C. 1972 Plan, will be held in trust for the benefit of his dependants.
40 In accordance with the requirements of the Listing Rules and the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, the disclosures required for the year ended 31 March 2004 are set out below.
Listing Rules tax unapproved benefits The pension benefits earned by the directors of Marconi Corporation plc under the FURBS arrangements are: Increase in accrued Cost of Length of pension over the period to pension benefits accrued Accumulated total pensionable 31 March 2004 during the period net of accrued pension at service net of inflation members contributions 31 March 2004 Name of director Years 000 000 000 M J Donovan 5 11 66 85 M J Donovans defined benefit FURBS arrangement exists to provide a pension equivalent to two thirds of average final pensionable earnings, inclusive of benefits provided by the G. E. C. 1972 Plan and from other employment retained benefits.
Retained benefits have reduced in value during the year resulting in a larger cost to fund the FURBS promise.
The pension entitlement shown above is that which would be paid annually at normal retirement based on service to 31 March 2004.
The increase in accrued pension during the year excludes any increase for inflation.
Periodically an actuary reviews the contribution rate.
Contributions paid to M J Donovans FURBS during the year were 87,648 2003: 334,778.
P S Binning and M W J Parton have defined contribution FURBS arrangements.
During the year the Company paid 463,250 2003: 110,250 to M W J Partons FURBS and 20,481 to P S Binnings FURBS.
The amount paid in respect of M W J Parton included the special payments related to the conversion of his FURBS from a defined benefit to a defined contribution arrangement referred to above.
Listing Rules tax approved benefits The pension benefits earned by the directors of Marconi Corporation plc under the G. E. C. 1972 Plan are: Increase in accrued Cost of Length of pension over the period to pension benefits accrued Accumulated total pensionable 31 March 2004 during the period net of accrued pension at service net of inflation members contributions 31 March 2004 Name of director Years 000 000 000 P S Binning 0.5 111 J F Devaney 0.9 218 2 M J Donovan 5 259 M W J Parton 13 24 29 For P S Binning the amounts shown relate to service from 22 October 2003 being the date on which he joined the G. E. C. 1972 Plan.
For J F Devaney the amounts shown relate to service from 19 May 2003 being the date on which he joined the G. E. C. 1972 Plan.
The pension entitlement shown above is that which would be paid annually at their expected retirement age based on service to 31 March 2004.
The increase in accrued pension excludes any increase for inflation.
The cost of pension benefits accrued during the year net of members contributions has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The cost of pension benefits accrued during the year net of members contributions is a measure of the capital cost of providing future pension payments and accordingly is a liability of the Groups pension arrangements and not a sum paid or due to the directors of the Company.
Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 tax approved benefits Increase in Accumulated Transfer Transfer Increase in accrued total value value transfer value pension over accrued of accrued of accrued over the the period to pension at pension as at pension as at period net 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March of members 2004 2004 2003 2004 contributions Name of director 000 000 000 000 000 P S Binning 11 5 1 J F Devaney 22 24 18 M J Donovan 29 57 90 22 M W J Parton 329 189 266 63 For P S Binning the amounts shown relate to service from 22 October 2003 being the date on which he joined the G.

The interests of directors in options over ordinary shares of 5p each in M 2003 plc are not disclosed in this report as it is no longer the parent company of the Company.
It should be noted that, as a result of the Restructuring, M 2003 plc shares were delisted from the London Stock Exchange and are now of negligible value.
It is highly unlikely, therefore, that the directors will be able to realise any value in relation to any options held.
The Company does not currently operate any long-term incentive schemes other than the share option schemes described in section b.
The information provided above is a summary and full details of directors shareholdings and options are contained in the Companys register of directors interests.
Sections f, g and h other than directors interests as disclosed in section h i of this report were subject to audit by Deloitte & Touche LLP.
The performance criteria for share schemes given in section b iii 1 and 2 also forms part of the audited information.
