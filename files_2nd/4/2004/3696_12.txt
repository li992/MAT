34 COBHAM PLC  Report This report provides the information required by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations.
It also describes how the company applies the principles of the Code in relation to remuneration.
The report has been approved by the Board and shareholder approval will be sought at the forthcoming AGM.
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE Mike Smith is the chairman of this committee.
The other committee members are Jeff Edington, Peter Hooley and Marcus Beresford appointed 1 March 2004.
All members are independent non-executives.
Details of their qualications and experience are set out on page 27.
The committee met on five occasions during 2004 and information on director attendance is set out in the table on page 30.
The committees terms of reference, which were reviewed during the year, are available on the companys website or on application to the company secretary.
The committees main duties are to make recommendations to the Board on the Groups policies on executive directors remuneration and to determine, on the Boards behalf, the specic remuneration packages of the chairman, executive directors and a number of senior executives.
The committee consults with the chief executive, but not in respect of his own remuneration, and has access to professional advice from New Bridge Street Consultants NBSC and reports in relation to total shareholder return monitoring from Inbucon.
NBSC, who were appointed by the committee, also provided advice during the year to the company in relation to a new share incentive plan for UK employees generally and in relation to a new executive share option scheme.
REMUNERATION POLICY The Boards policy is to recruit, motivate and retain executive directors of high calibre by rewarding them with competitive salary and benefit packages, increasingly linked to performance.
In particular, the executive pay policy for the current and subsequent financial years is designed to retain those executives with the skills and experience necessary to enable the Group to achieve its objectives and satisfy shareholder expectations.
More specically, the current strategy is to position base salaries around the median of the market and to provide an opportunity to enhance cash remuneration through a competitive bonus plan if performance so warrants through the satisfaction of stretching performance conditions.
The committee confirms that a significant element of potential remuneration is performance linked.
Remuneration is also linked to performance through participation in share incentive schemes, which ensures that executive directors interests are closely aligned with shareholders interests.
The chairman of the company ensures that the company, through the committee, maintains contact with its principal shareholders about remuneration matters.
To this end, the committee consulted during the year in connection with the introduction of the new executive share option scheme which was duly approved at the 2004 AGM.
BASE SALARY The committee reviews base salaries annually, generally in November, to take effect from 1 January of the following year.
When reviewing salaries the committee assesses individual responsibilities, experience, performance and personal objectives and considers external market data, internal relativities and other factors relevant to the company and the industry.
No increase to Andy Stevenss base salary was made during the year in view of his appointment in November 2003.
ANNUAL PERFORMANCE-RELATED BONUS The company operates an annual cash bonus scheme for its executive directors.
Bonuses are awarded by the committee having regard for the performance of the Group, the individual and, in the case of directors with specic subsidiary company responsibilities, the performance of the relevant subsidiaries.
Bonuses in respect of 2004 were capped at 60% of base salary, 75% of which was determined by financial performance.
For 2005, the committee, as part of its review of the effectiveness of the companys remuneration policy, has decided that the maximum annual bonus opportunity for executive directors should be increased to 80% of base salary to bring it into line with market practice.
Of this, 81% will be determined by financial performance.
In the cases of Allan Cook and Warren Tucker the constituent elements of their bonus plans relate to earnings per share EPS growth, cash generation against budget and proven achievement of personal objectives.
In the cases of Geoff Cooper, Andy Stevens and Alex Hannam, the constituent elements of their bonus plans relate to EPS growth, profit against budget for the group of subsidiary companies for which they are operationally responsible, cash generation against budget and proven achievement of personal objectives.
In changing the bonus scheme, the committee took the opportunity to increase the potential awards for growth in EPS and toughened the targets for cash and profit generation.
Personal objectives for the other executive directors are set by Allan Cook.
Personal objectives for Allan Cook are set by Gordon Page.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2004 35 LONG-TERM INCENTIVES Following a review of long-term incentive arrangements, the committee changed its approach to the provision of long-term incentives during the year.
As a result, a combination of share awards under the Cobham Long-Term Incentive Plan and grants of share options under the Cobham Executive Share Option Scheme 2004 may be made to directors and other senior executives.
In order to ensure that the aggregate award levels are not excessive, the aggregate value of shares awarded to any individual excluding senior executives in the US under the above share schemes in any year is not to exceed 1.5 times base salary unless there are exceptional circumstances, for example, the recruitment or promotion of a senior executive.
COBHAM LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN LTIP Under the LTIP, which was approved by shareholders in 1997, awards to acquire Cobham ordinary shares at nil cost are made to participants up to a maximum annual value of 75% of base salary.
During 2004, awards were made to 22 main Board and subsidiary company directors and senior executives.
The extent to which awards vest under the LTIP is based on the companys total shareholder return TSR relative to a comparator group comprising companies in the FTSE engineering and machinery sector and the aerospace and defence sector.
The committee believes that the use of TSR as a performance measure is justied because it aligns the interests of directors with shareholders by requiring superior TSR performance compared to those companies in the comparator group see below.
Awards vest in full at upper quartile performance over the three year performance period and 30% of awards vest at median performance.
There is a sliding scale vesting between median and upper quartile performance and no awards vest if performance is below median.
In addition, no awards vest unless the companys EPS growth has exceeded ination by an average of 3% p. a. over three years.
That part of an award which has not satisfied the performance conditions over the three year performance period will lapse i. e. there is no re-testing of the performance condition.
The committee will ensure that EPS is calculated on as consistent basis as is feasible following the transition to International Accounting Standards and that any arbitrary results are avoided.
In assessing whether performance conditions have been met, the committee relies upon performance status and verication reports prepared by Inbucon.
In 2004, the company achieved sixteenth position out of a total of 30 companies in its comparator group and, as a result, the awards made in 2001 did not vest.
The committee is considering whether the current way of identifying membership of the comparator group for LTIP awards remains appropriate.
COBHAM EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION SCHEME 2004 ESOS The ESOS was approved by shareholders at the 2004 AGM and includes an Approved part, which has been approved by the Inland Revenue, and an Unapproved part which is not designed for Inland Revenue approval.
Options to acquire Cobham ordinary shares may be made to participants up to a maximum annual value of 100% of base salary.
Options are granted at a price not less than the market value of the companys ordinary shares on, or shortly before, the date an option is granted.
During 2004, options were granted to 98 directors and senior executives.
The exercise of options will be conditional upon the companys underlying EPS growth exceeding ination by a specified margin over a three year period.
No part of an option will become exercisable unless the companys EPS growth over the period exceeds ination by at least 3% per annum on average.
If average growth in EPS in excess of ination over three years is between 3% and 5% per annum, calculated on a compound basis, shares under option with a value between 50%100% of the participants base salary will become exercisable.
If average EPS growth exceeds 5% per annum, the option will become exercisable in full.
There will be no provision for re-testing of the performance condition if it is not met after three years.
EPS growth is considered by the committee to be an appropriate measure of the companys performance for the purposes of the ESOS as it is based upon underlying financial performance.
The committee will ensure that EPS is calculated on a consistent basis following the move to International Accounting Standards as mentioned above.
OTHER SHARE SCHEMES AND HEADROOM A new savings related share option scheme was approved by shareholders at the 2004 AGM and was operated during the year.
Executive directors are permitted to participate in this scheme on the same terms as other UK employees.
The scheme operates within specic tax legislation including a requirement to finance the exercise of the option using the proceeds of a monthly savings contract.
The company is in the course of implementing a new Inland Revenue approved all-employee share scheme, the Cobham Share Incentive Plan.
Executive directors are permitted to participate in this scheme, which has been approved by shareholders, on the same terms as other UK employees.
This scheme operates within specic tax legislation and enables participants to buy Cobham ordinary shares out of pre-tax income.
Consistent with the legislation and normal practice, neither of these schemes requires the imposition of pre-vesting performance conditions.
There are limits relating to the issue of shares in any ten year period in connection with the all employee share schemes and also the discretionary employee share schemes i. e. the LTIP and the executive share option schemes.
These are 10% and 5% of the companys issued share capital respectively.
As at the year end, 7.6m 6.8% and 3.2m 2.9% shares have been, or may be, issued pursuant to awards made in the previous ten years.
36 COBHAM PLC  Report continued PERFORMANCE GRAPH This graph illustrates the performance of the company against a broad equity market index over the past five years.
As the company has been a constituent of the FTSE 350 index throughout this period, that index is considered the most appropriate form of broad equity market index against which performance should be graphed.
Performance is measured by reference to TSR share price growth plus dividends paid.

DIRECTORS PENSIONS Executive directors, with the exception of Geoff Cooper, participate in the Cobham Executives Pension Plan the Plan.
The Plan provides benets on final pay principles against a normal pension age of 60 subject to actuarial reduction for earlier retirement.
Pension accrues at 1 30th of pensionable earnings, i. e. base salary, for each year of service and participants contribute at the rate of 7% of pensionable earnings.
All pensions in payment relating to post April 1997 rights are increased in line with the retail prices index, subject to a minimum of 3% per annum and a maximum of 5% per annum, with the balance of pension being increased at 3% per annum.
On death in service, a lump sum of four times pensionable earnings is payable together with a spouses pension of two thirds of the members prospective pension.
On death after retirement, a spouses pension is paid at the rate of two thirds of the members pre-commutation pension.
Similar spouses pensions are payable on the death of a deferred pensioner prior to retirement.
The pension benets of directors who are members of the Plan are restricted by the Inland Revenues earnings cap.
Contributions in respect of such members, with the exception of Warren Tucker, are paid into funded unapproved retirement benefit schemes FURBS and details of the amounts paid are set out in table 2 B on page 38.
Cash payments in lieu of contributions to a FURBS are made to Warren Tucker as mentioned in the notes to table 1 on page 37.
Following Gordon Pages retirement as an executive director, no further contributions have been paid into his FURBS.
The policy in respect of newly appointed directors is that contributions should normally be 2% of annual basic salary per month.
The committee will review the current pension arrangements in the light of the tax changes due to come into effect in April 2006.
In undertaking the review the committee will consider all relevant factors, including the views of institutional investors.
Details of directors pension benets as required by the Regulations are set out in table 2 A on page 38.
SERVICE CONTRACTS The Boards policy on setting notice periods for new directors is that these should not normally exceed one year.
It recognises, however, that it may be necessary in the case of new executive appointments to offer a longer initial notice period which would subsequently reduce to one year.
The service contracts of Allan Cook dated 13 June 2001, Geoff Cooper dated 1 June 1989 and Alex Hannam dated 13 February 2003 are terminable on one years notice by either party.
Warren Tuckers and Andy Stevens service contracts both of which are dated 1 January 2004 are terminable on one years notice by, and six months notice to, the company.
With the exception of Geoff Coopers contract, these contracts provide for automatic termination on the director attaining retirement age, i. e. 60.
Geoff Coopers contract does not contain an expiry date.
The company may elect to terminate directors service contracts by making payments in lieu of notice.
Such payments are calculated by reference to the base salary otherwise payable during the notice period.
Payments in respect of annual bonus for the relevant periods may also be payable.
In the case of Warren Tucker, any payment in lieu of notice shall include a sum equal to the value of his annual benets.
The company recognises and endorses the obligation of departing directors to mitigate their own losses.
No executive director currently holds a non-executive directorship with any other company.
PERSONAL SHAREHOLDING Executive directors are encouraged to acquire and hold, over time, Cobham ordinary shares to the value of at least one years salary.
