The trustees, with the consent of the company, have discretion to apply such greater increase as they consider appropriate.

1 Performance share plan The committee awards shares under the performance share plan conditional upon the achievement of corporate performance targets over a period of three years.
Performance is assessed against two criteria: by comparing the growth in total shareholder return, in terms of share price growth and dividends, to that of the total shareholder return of the FTSE Food Producers Index, excluding Unilever: and by assessing the underlying performance of Northern Foods by reference to the real growth in earnings per share over the same period.
The total shareholder return performance is assessed by reference to a vesting scale, whereby for the full award to qualify for vesting, the total return to the companys ordinary shareholders during the three year performance period places it in the top quartile of the comparator group.
If the companys performance is ranked at 50 per cent or lower, all of the conditional awards will lapse.
Where the company is placed between 50 per cent and the top quartile, the maximum number of shares available for vesting will be calculated on a straight line basis with 25 per cent of the award being available when the company is placed at 51 per cent and the entire award being available where the company is placed in the top quartile.
