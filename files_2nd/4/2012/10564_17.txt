REMUNERATION REPORT A statement to shareholders from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee On behalf of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to present the Directors report on remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2012.
The Committee has continued to ensure that the targets we set are both challenging and incentivise management appropriately.
The Committee also sees the importance of ensuring that a significant part of the executive Directors packages should be linked to the long-term success of the Group.
As you will have read earlier in this Annual Report, following the Groups record results in 2011, 2012 Group revenue was down versus 2011, yet it was still the second best operating profit before one-off costs in the Groups history.
Nevertheless, no bonus is payable for the CEO and CFO in respect of 2012 performance, and a significantly reduced bonus versus last year is payable to the CEO Morgan Ceramics, whose bonus was based on both Group targets and specific targets for his Division.
EPS performance over the three years from 2010 has remained strong, and therefore will be reflected in the maximum payouts of the 2010 Bonus Deferral Share Matching Plan BDSMP.
Long-term Incentive Plan LTIP awards granted in 2010 were also part-dependent on EPS performance, and this element also vested in full.
However, 2012 performance has affected Total Shareholder Return TSR, and so this has significantly reduced the potential payout for the 2010 LTIP overall.
This is consistent with our approach to ensuring incentive payments do reflect stretching performance targets, and also reflect shareholder interests against relevant measures.
Those shares will be released in 2013 at the end of their three-year vesting period, and details are shown in this report.
Last year, I noted the considerable achievement by management of key performance measures over the previous three years, not least the upper quartile growth in shareholder return.
That performance resulted in a maximum vesting of the 2009 LTIP, and a 1.8 times match vesting of the 2009 BDSMP, which was also subject to very demanding EPS growth targets.
Those shares were released during 2012 at the end of their three-year vesting period, and are now detailed in this report.
We again reviewed EPS targets against internal and external reference points, and have once more set what we consider a challenging range particularly against the uncertain market outlook.
On this basis, the existing 8%-15% pa range for the LTIP and the 8%-20% pa range for the bonus deferral plan represent demanding targets over the next three years and remain appropriate for the 2013 award cycle.
Because no bonus was payable to the CEO and CFO in respect of 2012 performance, they will not be able to participate in the 2013 BDSMP.
ROCE targets, which were introduced last year, have been reviewed so that they reflect the returns the Board would expect to ensure that the Groups ROCE levels are maintained and enhanced.
At the same time, they put a strong emphasis on profit growth via the challenging EPS metrics.
The target range for Group ROCE has again been set at 33% to 37%, which the Committee still believes provides a significant degree of demanding performance when compared to the Groups 2012 ROCE of 26.5%.
For the bonus, the Committees view is that the likely macro-economic environment in 2013 makes effective cash management even more important.
Accordingly, an Operating Working Capital Sales % element has been applied to the executive Directors bonus targets, consistent with that used in Divisional targets.
This will accompany the main element of the bonus target, which will be operating profit before one-off costs.
My fellow Committee members and I have had contact with shareholders over the last 12 months, and value the views and feedback we have received.
We have also specifically consulted those with the largest shareholdings on the proposals for the renewal of the LTIP, which will be submitted for approval at the 2013 AGM.
We do discuss and consider feedback, and reflect on how to ensure overall remuneration should both be in the longer term interests of shareholders and meaningful for management.
I hope you will again find this balance appropriately reflected in the report that follows.
Consistent with the new regulations governing the reporting of executive remuneration due to come into force in October 2013, we have opted to incorporate a number of the proposed changes in this years report to enhance transparency.
Simon Heale Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 50 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual Report 2012 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Compliance statement This Report covers the period 2 January 2012 to 31 December 2012 and provides details of the Remuneration Committee and remuneration policy of Morgan Crucible.
The Company has complied with the principles and provisions relating to Directors remuneration in the UK Corporate Governance Code, and this Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 of the Large & Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008.
In accordance with Section 439 of the Companies Act 2006, an advisory resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the AGM on 10 May 2013.
Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing Group policy on executive remuneration and for determining, on behalf of the Board, specific remuneration packages for the executive Directors and the Chairman.
The Committees terms of reference are available on our website.
The Remuneration Committee consults the Chief Executive Officer and invites him to attend meetings when appropriate.
The Director of Human Resources attends meetings of the Committee by invitation.
The Committee also had access to advice from the Chief Financial Officer.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
No executive Director or other attendee is present when his own remuneration is being discussed.
Membership of the Committee is shown on page 55. i Policy Report Key principles of the remuneration policy The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that all the remuneration packages offered are competitive and designed to attract, retain and motivate executive Directors and senior executives of the right calibre in order to run the Group successfully, and to create value for shareholders.
The Committee takes a longer-term perspective on retention and motivation, and although the short-term is important, the Committees view is that this has to be put in the context of the Groups long-term interests.
The policy of the Committee is to ensure that a significant proportion of the total remuneration opportunity is performance-related, with particular emphasis on long-term performance, and based on the achievement of measurable targets that are relevant to and support the business strategy.
This is in order to create a strong link between performance and reward which should be beneficial to shareholders, employees and the Group.
In assessing all aspects of pay and benefits, the Committee also takes into account the packages offered by similar companies to ensure the remuneration of executive Directors is competitive against the market in which the Group competes for talent.
For the purposes of such analysis, comparator companies are chosen having regard to: business sector: the size of the company eg in terms of market capitalisation, turnover and number of people employed : the diversity and complexity of its businesses: and the geographical spread of its businesses.
The Committee also considers the level of pay and employment conditions throughout the Group when determining executive Directors remuneration.
The Committee believes that the current remuneration structure is appropriate and supports the business strategy.
The Remuneration Committee will keep remuneration policy under review during the forthcoming year, and, in doing so, will continue to give full consideration to the principles set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code in relation to Directors remuneration and to the guidance of investor representative bodies.

52 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual Report 2012 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Share ownership guidelines In order to encourage alignment with shareholders, individual shareholding guidelines are operated for executive Directors and senior executives.
Under such guidelines, executive Directors are encouraged to build and maintain over time a shareholding in the Company equivalent to at least 100% of basic salary.
This policy is supported by the BDSMP under which participants are encouraged to invest their bonus in Company shares.
From 2013 onwards, the Committee decided to increase the shareholding guideline for the Chief Executive Officer to at least 150% of basic salary.
Current executive Director shareholdings are set out in the Implementation Section on page 62.

Annual Report 2012 The Morgan Crucible Company plc 53 REMUNERATION REPORT continued Employee context The policy and practice with regard to the remuneration of senior executives below the Board is that these arrangements are typically reviewed annually, and principally with regard to performance against objectives, market information relevant to appropriate sectors and regions.
In making remuneration decisions, the Remuneration Committee also considers the pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group.
Prior to the annual salary review, the Remuneration Committee is briefed by the Director of Human Resources about pay increase data that individual business units will consider when deciding local pay awards for their specific businesses and countries.
This also forms part of the considerations for determining executive Director remuneration.
For UK businesses, salary increases in 2013 will be on average 3%.
Details of executive Directors service contracts The executive Directors are employed under contracts of employment with The Morgan Crucible Company plc.
Contracts may be terminated on 12 months notice given by the Company or on six months notice given by the Director concerned.
Contracts end on each Directors anticipated normal retirement date.
The following table shows the date of the contract for each executive Director who served during the year: Notice period Date of Date of Executive Position appointment service agreement From employer From employee Mark Robertshaw CEO 4 August 2006 15 August 2008 12 months 6 months Kevin Dangerfield CFO 3 August 2006 15 August 2008 12 months 6 months Andrew Hosty CEO Morgan Ceramics 28 July 2010 17 August 2010 12 months 6 months Exit payments policy The Companys policy is to limit severance payments on termination to pre-established contractual arrangements.
In the event that the employment of an executive Director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined in accordance with the terms of the service contract between the Company and the employee, as well as the rules of any incentive plans.
Under normal circumstances, all leavers are entitled to receive termination payments in lieu of notice equal to base salary and benefits.
There is no automatic entitlement to bonus as part of the termination arrangements, and the value of any termination payment will be at the judgment of the Remuneration Committee, having regard to all relevant factors including any available mitigation.
In the event an executive leaves for reasons of injury, disability, death, redundancy, retirement, or other such event as the Remuneration Committee determines, then outstanding LTIP awards and BDSMP matching awards will be pro-rated for time served and will vest based on performance over the full performance period.
In the event of death, the date to which performance is tested may be brought forwards to the date of cessation of employment.
Upon a change of control of the Company, LTIP awards will be pro-rated for time and will vest early subject to performance to-date, unless the Committee determines otherwise, or that a replacement award should be made.
BDSMP matching awards will vest early subject to performance and time elapsed to the change of control unless a replacement award is made.
For all other leavers, outstanding LTIP awards and BDSMP matching awards will normally lapse.
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to alter these provisions on a case-by-case basis following a review of circumstances and to ensure fairness for both shareholders and participants.
External appointments With the approval of the Board in each case, and subject to the overriding requirements of the Group, executive Directors may accept external appointments as non-executive Directors of other companies and retain any fees received.
Details of external directorships held by executive Directors along with fees retained during 2012 are as follows: Executive Director Company Role Fees retained Mark Robertshaw SEGRO plc Non-Executive Director 53,000 Kevin Dangerfield e2v technologies plc Non-Executive Director 38,000 Andrew Hosty Fiberweb plc Non-Executive Director 9,846 British Ceramic Research Limited Non-Executive Director 6,750 54 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual Report 2012 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Relative importance of spend on pay The graph below shows Morgan Crucibles profit after tax, dividend, and total employee pay expenditure for the financial years ended 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2012, and the percentage change.

Kepler reports directly to the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
Kepler Associates is independent and does not provide any other services to the Group.
The Committee received a specific report on international equity participation from Aon Hewitt New Bridge Street.
It also received advice from both Kepler Associates and Slaughter & May on the proposed Long-term Incentive Plan renewal for 2013.
Both Kepler and Aon Hewitt New Bridge Street are signatories of the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants.
Annual Report 2012 The Morgan Crucible Company plc 55 REMUNERATION REPORT continued Single total figure of remuneration The table below sets out a single figure for the total remuneration received by each executive Director for the year ended 31 December 2012 and the prior year.
Base salary: amount earned for the year.
Benefits: the taxable value of benefits received in the year.
Pension: 20x the increase in the value of their accrued benefit over the year, less Directors contributions, plus the value of any Company contribution.
Annual bonus: the total bonus earned on performance during the year.
BDSMP: the estimated value on 31 December 2012 of 2010 BDSMP matching shares and dividend equivalents vesting in 2013 subject to performance over the three-year period ending 31 December 2012.
The 2011 value represents the actual vest-date value including dividend equivalents of 2009 BDSMP matching shares.
LTIP: the estimated value on 31 December 2012 of 2010 LTIP shares vesting in 2013 subject to performance over the three-year period ended 31 December 2012.
The 2011 value represents the actual vest-date value of 2009 LTIP shares.
Base salary Annual salaries for executive Directors are generally reviewed each year by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the performance of the individual and having regard to practice in FTSE 350 companies of comparable sector, size and complexity.
In line with the approach being taken across the organisation, executive Directors salaries will be increased in 2013.
For 2013, executive Directors increases will be implemented with effect from 1 March.
In considering the level of increase, the Committee has been mindful of the general level of increase across the Group of, on average 3%, as well as the positioning of roles against the market.
In the case of Andrew Hosty, the Committee has also taken into account the additional global responsibilities of his new role of Chief Operating Officer which was announced in February 2013.
The table below shows the salaries in 2012, and those which will take effect from 1 March 2013: Base salary at: Executive Director Position 1 March 2013 1 January 2012 Increase Mark Robertshaw CEO 495,000 480,000 3.1% Kevin Dangerfield CFO 300,000 285,000 5.3% Andrew Hosty COO 340,000 312,500 8.8% Pensions The three executive Directors participate in The Morgan Group Senior Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme which is a contributory, HMRC-registered, defined benefit, funded occupational pension scheme.
With effect from 6 April 2006 the basis of the scheme switched from final salary to career average and the normal pension age increased by five years.
Its main features are now: A normal pension age of 65.
Pension at normal pension age based on two-thirds career average pensionable salary, subject to completion of at least 20 years employment 26 years and eight months for joiners since 2006.
Life assurance of four times basic salary.
Pensionable salary is the members basic salary restricted to an earnings cap of 136,800 for Kevin Dangerfield and Andrew Hosty and 110,437 for Mark Robertshaw for the 2012-13 tax year.
In addition, executive Directors received a pension allowance derived from employer contributions based notionally on the registered scheme pensionable salary in excess of the earnings cap.
In the last report, the Company advised that the Committee had reviewed the impact of the Governments then new annual allowance limits on pension contributions.
The Committee decided it wished to provide allowances for those affected, which overall were appropriate, cost-neutral and consistent with market practice.
Of those affected, Mark Robertshaw was the only Executive Director.
The value of the total Company pension contributions for each executive Director is shown in the Emoluments table on page 63.
The disclosure of executive Directors scheme benefits is shown in the table on page 66 at the end of this report.
56 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual Report 2012 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Benefits Executive Directors are eligible to receive certain benefits including either a company car or a car allowance, health insurance and, where appropriate, relocation and other expenses.
Annual bonus The purpose of the annual bonus is to incentivise the achievement of specific goals over the short-term that are also aligned to the long-term business strategy.
In 2012 the target and maximum bonus earnings for the executive Directors were: % of annual salary Executive Director Target Maximum Mark Robertshaw 50% 100% Kevin Dangerfield 50% 100% Andrew Hosty 50% 100% The targets for the annual bonus are set by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the shortand long-term requirements of the Group.
Challenging goals are set, which must be met before any bonus is paid.
This approach is intended to align executive reward with shareholder return by rewarding the achievement of stretch targets.
For 2012, the bonus for the CEO and CFO was based on Group profit before taxation and amortisation.
The targets were set to incentivise the executive Directors to deliver stretching earnings per share targets for the Group.
Senior executives with Divisional responsibilities have part of their annual bonus linked to the performance of their Division and part linked to Group performance.
In addition to the achievement of the targets set, in considering any awards to be made, the Committee also takes into account the quality of the overall performance of the Company.

The CEO Morgan Ceramics also did not receive any bonus in respect of the Group PBTA 30% of his bonus potential nor the Morgan Ceramics Division third-party working capital to sales percentage targets 20% of his bonus potential.
However, the Morgan Ceramics EBITA target 50% of his bonus potential for bonus purposes before allocation of central costs and at 2012 budgeted exchange rates was partially achieved at 103.2 million in a range from 99.5 million to 113 million resulting in a total bonus payment of 13.7% of salary for Andrew Hosty.
No changes will be made to the total annual bonus opportunity in 2013.
For 2013, the performance measures for executive Directors bonuses will be based 80% on EBITA and 20% on third-party working capital to sales.
The Committee has taken into account the Groups restructuring plans that were announced in February 2013 and considered that EBITA pre-restructuring and other one-off charges would be an appropriate measure given the untypical circumstances of the restructuring.
Performance targets have been set on this basis.
Bonus Deferral Share Matching Plan BDSMP The BDSMP was introduced following shareholder approval in 2008.
This plan operates alongside the other long-term incentive arrangements.
Under the plan rules, participants may be offered the opportunity to defer up to 75% of their annual bonus on a preor post-tax basis into Company shares.
Typically, the Committee has approved a deferral opportunity of 50% the only exception being the 2010 award, where the opportunity was 75%.
Participants must hold the deferred shares for three years to be eligible for a matching award based on the pre-tax value of their deferred shares.
Matching shares may be earned after three years in the event that stretching performance targets have been met.
For the bonus earned for the 2011 performance year ie payable in early 2012, participants were given the opportunity to defer up to 50% of their bonus under the BDSMP.
For any bonus earned in respect of the 2012 performance year payable in early 2013, participants will, again, be given the opportunity to defer up to 50% of their bonus under the BDSMP.
As a result of the nil bonuses awarded in respect of 2012, there will be no opportunity for the Group CEO and CFO under the 2013 BDSMP.
Annual Report 2012 The Morgan Crucible Company plc 57 REMUNERATION REPORT continued The performance criteria for the BDSMP are set annually: in 2012 they were based on EPS growth targets against the 2011 base year as follows: BDSMP matching shares EPS performance Matching shares 3.0x 20% pa 3x match 16% pa 2x match 2.0x 12% pa 1x match 8% pa 0x match 1.0x 0.0x 8% 12% 16% 20% Three-year EPS growth pa The details of outstanding awards held by all Directors, including details of the performance criteria attached, are shown on page 65.
2009 BDSMP award vesting The three-year performance period for the 2009 BDSMP awards ended on 1 January 2012.
Over the period Morgan Crucibles actual EPS growth rate was 10.2% and accordingly a 1.8x match vested on 6 March 2012: Maximum Matching Matching potential Matching Matching dividend Matching dividend Investment matching dividend Match shares shares shares shares Director shares shares shares earned released released lapsed lapsed Date of vesting Mark Robertshaw 48,222 245,201 32,009 1.8x 147,120 19,205 98,081 12,804 6 March 2012 Kevin Dangerfield 13,973 71,052 9,272 1.8x 42,631 5,562 28,421 3,710 6 March 2012 Andrew Hosty 71,042 361,233 47,158 1.8x 216,739 28,293 144,494 18,865 6 March 2012 The investment shares in this table are stated on a post-tax basis.

2010 BDSMP award vesting The performance period for the 2010 BDSMP awards ended on 31 December 2012.
Over the period Morgan Crucibles actual EPS growth rate was RPI 20.5%.
This exceeded the upper limit of the performance range and accordingly a 3x match will vest on 18 March 2013 and no shares will lapse: Maximum Matching Matching potential Matching Matching dividend Matching dividend Investment matching dividend Match shares shares shares shares Director shares shares shares earned released released lapsed lapsed Date of vesting Mark Robertshaw 20,635 104,928 10,148 3x 104,928 10,148 0 0 18 March 2013 The investment shares in this table are stated on a post-tax basis.
2011 BDSMP awards outstanding For the bonus earned for the 2010 performance year ie payable in 2011 participants were given the opportunity to defer up to 50% of their bonus.
In March 2011 Mark Robertshaw, Kevin Dangerfield and Andrew Hosty pledged shares equivalent to 50%, 25% and 44.44% of 2010 salary respectively and were granted matching awards of shares under the BDSMP equivalent to 3x their investments.
The three-year performance period over which EPS performance will be measured began on 3 January 2011 and will end on 31 December 2013.
Matching awards granted to executive Directors in 2011 are subject to three-year EPS growth.
The EPS target requires three-year EPS growth above a threshold of 8% pa before any matching, 12% pa for a 1x match, 16% pa for a 2x match, and 20% pa or higher for a 3x match.
There is straight-line vesting between these points.

The three-year performance period over which EPS performance will be measured began on 2 January 2012 and will end on 31 December 2014.
No award is eligible to vest until 21 March 2015.
The performance conditions attached to awards are discussed above.
Investment shares Number as % 2011 salary as % of 2011 bonus Matching shares Earliest date of vesting Mark Robertshaw 70,347 50% 50% 211,041 21 March 2015 Kevin Dangerfield 11,346 13.64% 13.64% 34,038 21 March 2015 Andrew Hosty 44,988 48.75% 50% 134,964 21 March 2015 Long-term Incentive Plan The LTIP was introduced following shareholder approval in 2004.
It offers executive Directors and other senior executives the opportunity to receive shares as a reward for outstanding performance.
The scheme allows awards of up to 150% of basic salary, although in exceptional circumstances the Committee is able to make awards of up to 200% of basic salary.
The vesting of the awards is subject to the achievement of performance targets measured over the three-year period from the start of the year in which the award is made.
The Committee discusses and reviews the performance criteria for new three-year LTIP awards before they are granted.
For the awards granted in 2012, the Committee considered its desire to have the most relevant balance of measures that reflected feedback from shareholders and directly related to the stretching objectives in the Groups business plan.
The Committee therefore decided on the introduction of a ROCE measure for the 2012-14 performance period.
For the CEO and CFO, TSR, EPS and ROCE performance are rewarded on an equal one-third basis as follows: TSR against FTSE All-Share % of award Industrials Index that vests EPS growth % of award that vests Group average ROCE % of award that vests Upper quartile 33% 15% pa 33% 37% 33% Median 10% 8% pa 10% 33% 10% Below median Nil 8% pa Nil 33% Nil For the CEO Morgan Ceramics, a third of the 2012-14 LTIP is linked to Group TSR and two thirds is based on the Ceramics Divisions EBITA and ROCE performance, as follows: TSR against FTSE All-Share % of award Industrials Index that vests Divisional EBITDA % of award that vests Divisional average ROCE % of award that vests Upper quartile 33% 15% pa 33% 43.5% 33% Median 10% 6% pa 10% 41% 10% Below median Nil 6% pa Nil 41% Nil The details of outstanding LTIP awards held by the executive Directors are shown on page 64.
2009 LTIP award vesting Awards granted to executive Directors in 2009 were subject to relative TSR.
The TSR target required Morgan Crucibles three-year TSR performance to rank at median against 17 industrial and engineering companies comparators for 30% to vest, rising to full vesting if Morgan Crucibles TSR ranked at or above the upper quartile against these peers.
The performance period for the 2009 LTIP awards ended on 1 January 2012.
Over the period Morgan Crucibles TSR was 183%, which was at the 76th percentile versus the industrial and engineering comparator group.
The performance resulted in 100% of 2009 LTIP awards vesting.
Annual Report 2012 The Morgan Crucible Company plc 59 REMUNERATION REPORT continued 2010 LTIP award vesting Awards granted to executive Directors in 2010 were subject to relative TSR and EPS.
The EPS target applying to 50% of each award required three-year EPS growth of RPI 4% pa for 30% of that element to vest rising to full vesting for EPS growth of RPI 10% pa or higher.
The TSR target applying to the other 50% of each award required Morgan Crucibles three-year TSR performance to rank at median against 23 industrial and engineering comparators for 30% of that element to vest, rising to full vesting if Morgan Crucibles TSR ranked at or above the upper quartile against these peers.
The performance period for the 2010 LTIP awards ended on 31 December 2012.
Over the period: Morgan Crucibles EPS growth was equivalent to RPI 20.5%, which exceeded the upper limit of the performance range and accordingly 50% of the award vested under this criterion.
Morgan Crucibles TSR was 69%, which was 41st percentile versus the industrial and engineering comparator group.
Accordingly, none of the award vested under this criterion.
This combined performance resulted in 50% of 2010 LTIP awards vesting.
2011 LTIP awards outstanding In March 2011 Mark Robertshaw, Kevin Dangerfield and Andrew Hosty were granted awards of shares under the LTIP equivalent to 111%, 100% and 100% of salary respectively.
The three-year performance period over which performance will be measured began on 3 January 2011 and will end on 31 December 2013.
Awards granted to the CEO and CFO in 2011 are subject to relative TSR and EPS.
The EPS target applying to 50% of each award requires three-year EPS growth above a threshold of 8% pa for 30% of that element to vest, rising to full vesting for EPS growth of 15% pa or higher.
The TSR target applying to the other 50% of each award requires Morgan Crucibles three-year TSR performance to rank at median against the FTSE All-Share Industrials Index for 30% of that element to vest, rising to full vesting if Morgan Crucibles TSR ranks at or above the upper quartile against the companies in this index.
For the CEO Morgan Ceramics, half of the 2011 incentive is linked to Group TSR as for the CEO and CFO and half is based on a Ceramics Division EBITA ROCE matrix.
This Divisional portion of the 2011 LTIP will only vest if stretching performance is achieved, with no vesting occurring unless EBITA growth in Morgan Ceramics is at least 12% pa and ROCE is 35.7% in 2013, in which case 30% of that element will vest: full vesting will occur for EBITA growth of 18% pa and ROCE of 40.7%.

No awards were made under the ESOS in 2011 or in 2012.
There is one outstanding award to Mark Robertshaw, who has a vested option from 2004 that he has not exercised see Directors executive share options table on page 63.
There is currently no intention to make awards under the ESOS in 2013.
Savings-related Share Option Scheme SAYE As UK employees, the executive Directors may also participate in the SAYE on the same basis as other eligible employees and subject to UK legislation.
SAYE participants save a fixed amount per month over three years and during 2012 options were granted with an exercise price at 80% of the five-day average market price calculated on 7 September 2012.
Those Directors who have received options under the SAYE are shown in the table on page 66.
No performance conditions apply to these options as they are a tax-efficient mechanism for all employees to acquire shares in the Company at their own cost.
Exit payments made in year No executive Director left the Company during the year.
Chairman and non-executive Directors Annual fees paid to the Chairman and non-executive Directors are reviewed on a biennial basis.
Tim Stevenson retired as Chairman on 31 July 2012, prior to which his fee had been 150,000 pa from 1 January 2012.
The Committee reviewed market information before setting the fee for a new Chairman, and set the fee at 175,000 pa. Andrew Shilston was appointed Chairman Designate on 8 May 2012, on that fee basis.
From Andrew Shilstons appointment as Chairman Designate on 8 May 2012 until 26 July 2012, his fee was 75,000 pa.
The annual fee for non-executive Directors was set at 42,000 pa following the biennial review in 2010.

The TSR target required Morgan Crucibles three-year TSR performance to rank at median against 17 industrial and engineering comparators for 30% to vest, rising to full vesting if Morgan Crucibles TSR ranks at or above the upper quartile against these peers.
At the end of the performance period, Morgan Crucibles TSR performance resulted in 100% vesting.
Vested awards were released on the third anniversary of grant 27 February 2012.
Awards granted to executive Directors in 2010 are subject to relative TSR and EPS.
The EPS target applying to 50% of each award requires three-year EPS growth of RPI 4% pa for 30% of that element to vest rising to full vesting for EPS growth of RPI 10% pa or higher.
The TSR target applying to the other 50% of each award requires Morgan Crucibles three-year TSR performance to rank at median against 23 industrial and engineering comparators for 30% of that element to vest, rising to full vesting if Morgan Crucibles TSR ranks at or above the upper quartile against these peers.
LTIP awards made in 2010 to Andrew Hosty and in 2010 and 2011 to Kevin Dangerfield are structured as an Approved Performance Share Plan APSP and comprise three elements: i HM Revenue & Customs HMRC approved options CSOP over shares to the value of up to 30,000 with an exercise price of 205.1 pence per share in respect of 2010 awards and of 292.28p pence per share in respect of the 2011 award: ii an LTIP award in the form of a conditional award of free shares to the value of the remainder of the award above this limit: and iii a funding award, also in the form of a conditional award of free shares, over such numbers of shares whose value at exercise of the approved option equals up to 30,000.
The provisions of these CSOP options, funding awards and LTIP awards are linked so that the maximum aggregate number of shares that can be acquired on exercise of LTIP and CSOP awards the funding award being used to pay the exercise price arising on exercise of the CSOP is limited to that number of shares that had a market value on the date of the awards equal to 100% of Kevin Dangerfields 2009 base salary and 240,000 for Andrew Hosty the limit.
The EPS target applying to 50% of each award requires three-year EPS growth above a threshold of 8% pa for 30% of that element to vest rising to full vesting for EPS growth of 15% pa or higher.
This Divisional portion of the 2011 LTIP will only vest if stretching performance is achieved, with no vesting occurring unless EBITA growth in Morgan Ceramics is at least 12% pa and ROCE is 35.7% in 2013 in which case 30% of that element will vest: full vesting of this element will occur for EBITA growth of 18% pa and ROCE of 40.7%.
Awards granted to executive Directors in 2012 are subject to relative TSR, EPS and average ROCE.
The EPS target applying to a third of each award requires three-year EPS growth above a threshold of 8% pa for 30% of that element to vest, rising to full vesting for EPS growth of 15% pa or higher.
The TSR target applying to another third of each award requires Morgan Crucibles three-year TSR performance to rank at median against the FTSE All-Share Industrials Index for 30% of that element to vest, rising to full vesting if Morgan Crucibles TSR ranks at or above the upper quartile against the companies in this index.
For the CEO and CFO, the Group average ROCE element has been set for a 33-37% pa range, vesting on a straight line basis, with 30% of the measure vesting at the 33% threshold rising to full vesting at 37% or higher.
For the CEO Morgan Ceramics, one-third of this award vests on relative TSR, with the remaining two-thirds vesting on a divisional EBITA ROCE matrix.
For the EBITA ROCE element, there will be no vesting unless EBITA growth in Morgan Ceramics is at least 6% pa and Divisional average ROCE is 41.0% in 2014: full vesting will occur for EBITA growth of 15% pa and ROCE of 43.5%.

I nvestment shares represent those shares acquired with a portion of the bonus set out in the emoluments table on page 63 voluntarily deferred into the BDSMP.
This is the maximum number of shares based on the pre-tax value of the investment shares that could be earned at the end of the performance period if the performance condition set out below is met in full.
The number of shares representing the value of reinvested dividends that would have accrued during the Retention Period on the executive Directors Matching award.
Dividends were paid throughout the Retention Period meaning there are various market prices applicable to these shares.
I n 2009 and 2010, the executive Directors deferred their bonus payment on a net basis.
In 2011 and 2012 deferral was on a gross basis, as it will be for 2013.
The flexibility to defer on either basis is within the BDSMP rules.
M atching awards granted to executive Directors in 2009 were subject to three-year EPS growth.
The EPS target required three-year EPS growth of 4% pa for a 0.25x match, 5% pa for a 0.5x match, 7.5% pa for a 1x match, 10% pa for a 1.75x match and 15% pa or higher for a 3x match.
The performance targets for awards made in 2009 did not reference growth above RPI.
Given the difficult economic climate at that time the Committee considered the targets to be stretching.
The three-year performance period for the 2009 BDSMP awards ended on 1 January 2012.
Over the period Morgan Crucibles actual EPS growth rate was 10.2% and accordingly a 1.8x match vested on 6 March 2012.
Matching awards granted to executive Directors in 2008 and 2010 are subject to three-year EPS growth.
The EPS target required three-year EPS growth of RPI 4% pa for a 0.25x match, RPI 5% pa for a 0.5x match, RPI 7.5% pa for a 1x match, RPI 10% pa for a 1.75x match and RPI 15% pa or higher for a 3x match.
The performance conditions attached to the 2008 BDSMP awards were not met and therefore matching awards lapsed in full.
M atching awards granted to executive Directors in 2011 and 2012 are subject to three-year EPS growth.

T he accrued benefit entitlement for Mark Robertshaw, Kevin Dangerfield and Andrew Hosty is the pension that would be paid annually on retirement based on service at the end of the year.
The transfer values for the pension benefits have been calculated on the basis set by the Trustee of the pension scheme.
The Trustee of the pension scheme is an independent body that is separate from the Company and they must calculate transfer values in accordance with legislation, having taken actuarial advice from an independent adviser.
The assumptions used in the calculation of transfer values depend on market conditions.
Over the year, Government bond yields fell.
This movement increases the assessed transfer values and was much more significant than the increase in accrued benefits over the year.
Members of the pension scheme historically had the option to pay additional voluntary contributions.
Neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.
Mark Robertshaw, Kevin Dangerfield and Andrew Hosty also received a pension allowance, details of which are set out in the Directors emoluments table on page 63.
Other transactions involving Directors are set out in note 27 Related parties to the Financial Statements.
