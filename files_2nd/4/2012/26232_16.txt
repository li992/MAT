BASE SALARY To help recruit and retain key employees.
To pay at around the mid-market range relative to the FTSE 100, with particular regard to other relevant financial institutions.
Regard is given to individual skills and experience.
In specific circumstances for example, a new appointment we may set salaries below mid-market range, with a view to reaching mid-market range within two to three years provided the individual has progressed into the role.
Increases in base salary for executive directors broadly follow the base salary budgets for the rest of the organisation.
Normally reviewed by the Committee annually and fixed for the 12months commencing 1 March, and paid in cash.
PENSION AND BENEFITS The policy aims to provide competitive post-retirement benefits and reward sustained contribution.
Salary is the only element of pensionable remuneration.
From 2009, increases in pensionable base salary for the defined benefit pension plan have been limited to a maximum of 2.5% each year.
New executive directors receive 15% of base salary into the defined contribution pension plan they contribute 5%.
Cash alternative in line with the defined contribution levels for executive directors opting for fixed protection above the lifetime allowance or for benefits in excess of the 50,000 annual limit.
For executive directors who took enhanced protection in 2006, they are given a cash contribution of 22% of base salary.
All cash contributions are subject to normal payroll deductions of income tax and National Insurance.
Normal benefits available to senior managers including car allowance and medical insurance.
Legal & General products can be acquired by executive directors on the terms available to other members of staff.
Executive directors are entitled to participate on the same terms as all UK employees in the Savings-Related Share Option Scheme and the Employee Share Plan, both of which are approved by HMRC.
There is no compensation for public policy or tax changes.

CEO LGIM on target is 60% of maximum i. e. 105% of base salary.
PERFORMANCE In setting bonus targets, the Committee seeks to link targets to areas ofthe business in which the executive has particular influence and responsibility, while also seeking to maintain a team ethos.
All executive directors have objectives related to Group Key Performance Indicators KPIs, plus individual where relevant divisional and strategic targets.
The objectives also embrace the importance of customer care, employee engagement and Company culture andvalues.
Executive directors bonus targets were weighted as follows for 2012: Other Other Group financial strategic Name KPIs targets targets Tim Breedon 50% 20% 30% Nigel Wilson 50% 20% 30% John Pollock 40% 30% 30% Mark Gregory 40% 30% 30% Mark Zinkula 20% 40% 40% The targets for 2012 are broadly outlined below: Group key Performance Indicators kPIs Common to all executive directors.
The TSR KPI is addressed through the PSP.
Other financial targets Key divisional metrics.
Other strategic targets Building a diversified business.
OPERATION Bonus result is determined by the Committee after the year end, based on performance against targets.
The Committee has both upwards and downwards discretion to adjust the overall bonus award but may not exceed the maximum potential.
Normally, 62.5% of the bonus is paid in cash and 37.5% is paid in deferred shares or nil cost options, subject to continued employment, under the SBP to be held for threeyears.
The deferred element may be subject to forfeiture if the performance which led to a bonus being paid is found to be incorrect or in the event of personal misconduct.
As the shares have been earned prior to award, any dividends occurring on these shares are paid to the executives during the vesting period.
If the executive has chosen nil cost options no dividends are paid until exercise post vesting.
The value of the shares awarded to directors is reported in the year of performance and shown in the directors remuneration table on page 82.

OPPORTUNITY Executive directors receive annual grants of up to 200% of base salary.
The award is made in nil cost options.
PERFORMANCE TSR was chosen to align outcomes with shareholder interests.

Vesting condition for the other half measures TSR versus the insurance constituents in the FTSEurofirst 300 plus any FTSE 350 Life Insurance companies not in the FTSEurofirst 300.
The constituents for this group are determined at the date of grant.
The two conditions are measured independently.
Performance against TSR conditions is independently reviewed by the advisers to the Committee.
The Remuneration Committee will also assess whether the TSR out-turn is reflective of the underlying financial performance of the Company and may scale back vesting if deemed appropriate.
The Committee has discretion only to reduce the level of award and may not increase it.
The parameters which the Committee uses in making this assessment include, but are not limited to, market share, partnerships entered into and maintained, cost constraint, capital management, risk and shareholder perception.
Any award vesting may be exercised at the end of the three-year performance period or at any time excepting close periods during the two-year period following vesting.
OPERATION The Committee reviews the quantum of awards made each year to ensure that it is in line with the market.
When making awards, the Committee will also consider wider factors such as Company performance in determining whether to grant at the normal policy level.

REMUNERATION FOR EMPLOYEES BELOW BOARD General remuneration policy The Groups remuneration policy is applied broadly consistently for all employees and, in line with our remuneration principles, is designed to support recruitment, motivation and retention as well as to reward high performance in a framework of approved risk management.
Remuneration is considered within the overall context of the Groups sector and the markets in which the divisions operate.
The policy for the majority of employees continues to be to pay around the relevant mid-market range with a competitive package designed to align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, and with an appropriate proportion of total remuneration dependent upon performance.
We define core remuneration as base salary, annual bonus that is closely aligned to performance and other benefits such as pension.
There is also a Long Term Incentive Plan that currently measures TSR.

A key factor is also the ability, experience including LGIM.
However, this does not mean a flat and performance of the individual.
Increases to base salary are in line with position in base salary band and other criteria.
ANNUAL BONUS The majority of employees have a discretionary bonus For 2013, annual bonus will be referred to as Annual scheme based on individual performance against Variable Pay AVP.
In the past, deferral has extended objectives.
For the management populations and to management grade employees which included above, 35% of this bonus is deferred into shares.

and looks at decisions for employees who report directly For performance in relation to 2012, the Committee to the business versus those who report to the function has agreed a grant of 372 shares to each employee head.
The review extends to all employees, including for 2011 performance this was 410 shares.
The SAYE allows employees to enter into a regular savings contract over either three or five years, coupled with a corresponding option over shares of the Group.
The grant price is equal to 80% of the quoted market price of the Group shares on the invitation date.
Under the ESP, approved by HMRC, permanent UK employees may elect to purchase Group shares from the market at the prevailing market price on a monthly basis.
The Group supplements the number of shares, purchased by matching the first 20 of each employees contribution.
From February 2013 the Company will also match employee contributions between 20 and 125 on a one matching share for every two purchased.
From time to time, the Group may make a grant of Freeshares see above.
Both the free and matching shares must be held in trust for three years before they may vest to the employee.
