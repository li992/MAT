Their fees were not increased in 2012: the previous increase having been made in July2011 5%.
Mr Connolly was appointed as non-executive chairman on 8June2012 and his fee was agreed with effect from that date.
The service contracts of those who served as executive directors during the period are dated as follows: Nick Buckles 2 June 2004 Trevor Dighton 2 June 2004 Grahame Gibson 6 December 2006 The service contracts are terminable on 12 months notice by either the company or by the executive directors.
There are no liquidated damages provisions for compensation payable upon early termination, but the company reserves the right to pay salary in lieu of notice.
The directors contracts do not provide for the payment of a guaranteed bonus in the event of termination.
It is the companys policy that it should be able to terminate service contracts of executive directors on no more than 12 months notice and that payments for termination of contract are restricted to the value of salary and other contractual entitlements for the notice period.
TheRemuneration Committee would consider the application ofmitigation obligations in relation to any termination payments.
Thecommittee is satisfied that the current arrangements are appropriate and were in line with best practice at the time the executive directors were appointed.
The chairman and the other non-executive directors do not have service contracts but letters of appointment.

None of the executive directors currently holds an external non-executive appointment.
Performance graph The performance graph below shows the total cumulative shareholder return of the company over the five years to the end of December 2012, based on a hypothetical shareholding worth 100, compared with the return achieved by the FTSE-100 constituent companies over the same period.
The directors believe this to be an appropriate form of broad equity market index against which to base a comparison given the size and geographic coverage of the company and the fact that the company is itself a member of the FTSE100.
The graph also compares the companys performance over the same period with the bespoke group of companies which is used now for comparative total shareholder return purposes in the companys performance share plan.
