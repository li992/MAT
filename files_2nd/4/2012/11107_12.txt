Remuneration Report This report sets out details of the remuneration paid to NEXTs directors for the year to January 2012.
The report is divided into three parts covering an overview of the year, the remuneration strategy adopted by NEXTs Remuneration Committee, and regulatory disclosures under Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Group Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 and the relevant parts of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and UK Corporate Governance Code.
The Board of Directors confirms that the Company has complied with these regulations throughout the year under review.
PaRT 1: OvERviEw Of THE YEaR Information not subject to audit In a year of challenging economic conditions NEXT delivered a robust performance, achieving record underlying pre-tax profit of 570.3m and earnings per share EPS which grew by 15 per cent to 255.4 pence.
The Companys key financial objective continues to be the delivery of long term, sustainable growth in EPS, and this is the metric against which the Committee assesses the annual bonuses of the executive directors.
annual bonuses and base salaries Despite NEXT achieving record EPS, the annual bonus payable to executive directors fell to 72% of the maximum potential award, giving an aggregate annual bonus of 1.7m compared with the previous year when the maximum bonus was paid.
This reduction reflects the Companys EPS performance against the stretching targets set at the start of 2011 by the Remuneration Committee.
Details of the targets are set out on page 34.
Base salaries of these directors increased by 1.2% in February 2011 and by 2.5% in February 2012, both increments being in line with the wider Company cost of living awards.
long term incentive plan Under the LTIP, a variable percentage of a pre-determined number of shares can vest, depending on NEXTs relative total shareholder returns TSR performance against the comparator group of companies.
The maximum number of shares that may be awarded to each director is a percentage of each directors basic salary at the date of each award, divided by NEXTs average share price over the three months prior to the start of the performance period.
Details of awards made to executive directors are set out on page 42.
Since 2008 NEXT has made LTIP awards twice a year and two awards matured in the year to January 2012.
Over the performance periods of these awards, i. e. between August 2008 to January 2012, NEXTs share price rose from 955p to 2639p.
During this period NEXTs market capitalisation grew from 1.9 billion to 4.4 billion: a further 611m was returned to shareholders through share buybacks and a total of 408m was paid in dividends.
Based on NEXTs TSR relative to its comparator group of around 20 other UK retailers, and the Committees review of NEXTs overall performance against wider economic and other conditions, both LTIP awards have vested.
The award that matured in July 2011 vested 100% as the Companys TSR ranked third against the comparator group over the three years to July 2011 and the award that matured in January 2012 vested 83% as the Companys TSR was ranked fifth.
It should also be noted that the calculation of TSR excludes the 611m returned to shareholders through share buybacks over this period.
The value of awards that vested this year is higher than last year: this is mainly due to the rise in the Companys share price over the relevant performance period and not to any increase in the maximum number of shares originally awarded.
The Committee has determined that the maximum value of any LTIP awards that vest for a participant in a year should be capped at 2.5m and, following discussions with the Chief Executive, this cap will be applied to his awards that have vested this year.
After this restriction, the total value to the executive directors of the two LTIP awards that vested during the year is estimated at 6.9m.
Of this sum, approximately 60% or 4.2m, is attributable to the growth in NEXTs share price over the performance periods.

indd 29 10 04 2012 10:17:28 Additional information Notes to the accounts Accounts Governance Business reports Governance Remuneration Report NEXTs share price growth compared with the FTSE 100 and the FTSE General Retailers indices over this period is illustrated by the graph below: nExT plc Share Price Performance Relative to fTSE General Retailers and fTSE 100 July 2008 Jan 2012 Share % price p 200 3000 2750 150 2500 2250 100 2000 1750 50 1500 1250 0 1000 750 500 -50 Jul 2008 Jan 2009 Jul 2009 Jan 2010 Jul 2010 Jan 2011 Jul 2011 Jan 2012 Re-based to 29 June 2008 NEXT FTSE General Retailers FTSE 100 Total performance-based remuneration Aggregate performance-based remuneration of the executive directors has increased from 4.9m last year to circa 8.6m see pages 40 to 41.
As noted above, the aggregate annual bonus level fell last year by 0.6m to 1.7m: therefore the increase in the executive directors performance-based remuneration is primarily due to the increase in the NEXT share price, as reflected in the value of the NEXT shares in the LTIP awards that vested during the year.
The Remuneration Committee has analysed carefully the level of performance remuneration earned by the executive directors and considers that it is a fair reflection of nExTs operating and financial performance and that it is well aligned with the financial interests of shareholders generally.

indd 30 10 04 2012 10:17:28 PaRT 2: REMunERaTiOn STRaTEGY Information not subject to audit The Remuneration Committees objective continues to be to ensure that the remuneration paid to NEXTs senior executives is appropriate in both amount and structure and, importantly, is directly linked to the Companys annual and longer term performance to ensure alignment with the interests of shareholders.
The Committees approach reflects its belief that stable and transparent remuneration structures are a key element in ensuring a fair system for rewarding personal and collective contribution across the business.
There are bonus structures at all levels throughout the Companys business, including Head Office, stores, call centres and warehouses.
The Committee focuses particularly on ensuring that a competitive and appropriate base salary is paid to directors and senior managers, together with disciplined incentive arrangements that, wherever possible, are: aligned with shareholders interests and with NEXTs long term business strategies: measured against challenging benchmarks, including both absolute financial targets which are set in advance and relative share performance: a mix of annual and three year performance periods: paid in a combination of cash and shares: and transparent, i. e. without any soft non-financial targets which would allow the Committee undue discretion to award bonuses that do not reflect actual financial performance.
We aim to maintain a stable remuneration structure whereby executive directors and senior management know at the start of each year the potential scale of rewards available to them, and the relevant performance thresholds, whilst avoiding significant increases in base salaries.
Over each of the past three years, base salary levels for all grades across NEXT, including executive directors, have risen by no more than 1.2%, excluding individual merit awards.
Individual merit awards to employees are only given after a careful assessment process which reviews personal performance.
Save for a merit award to Christos Angelides made in February 2010, no executive director has received a merit or promotion award during the last three years.
As noted above, for the current financial year, base salaries across NEXT will rise by 2.5%, well below the level of general price inflation.
The Committee considers it important that base salary increases are kept under tight control given the potential multiplying effect of such increases on future costs.
The Committee gives careful consideration to ensuring that there is an appropriate balance in the overall remuneration structure between both annual and longer term awards as well as between cash and share-based payments.
We recognise, however, that corporate performance and share price performance may not always be perfectly correlated in any single accounting period.
Notwithstanding this, the Committee believes that the present structure, which is weighted towards rewarding sustainable long term performance, is well aligned with shareholders interests.
This is particularly evident from the high proportion of executive directors performance-related pay in the year to January 2012 that derived from both growth in EPS and NEXTs share price, as opposed to inflation in salaries or annual bonus.
annual bonus Each January the Committee sets financial performance thresholds for the principal incentive arrangements.
In addition to the annual bonus targets for executive directors, these include parameters for annual bonuses payable to other Head Office staff, the Share Matching Plan which is open to executive directors and other senior executives, and management share options open to middle management and senior store staff.
Details of the relevant thresholds for these awards are set out later in this report.
Annual bonuses to executive directors are paid only if there has been growth in pre-tax EPS, with the amount payable being dependent on achieving a target range determined by the Committee at the start of each year.
The level of annual bonus earned by executive directors in the year to January 2012 fell by 28% from the previous year as the maximum EPS performance target set by the Committee was not achieved.
Against the background of a challenging consumer economy the Committee will continue to set stretching but realistic targets for awards.
long term incentive plan lTiP The Committee also reviews the composition of the comparator group of around 20 UK listed retailers that are used as a benchmark to assess the level of any vesting of LTIP awards.
At the end of each three year performance period the Committee further reviews NEXTs overall performance to determine whether the LTIPs general economic underpin has been satisfied.
From July 2008, LTIP awards have been made every six months at half the previous annual rate, as opposed to a single annual award.
The Committee believes that this arrangement enhances the portfolio effect for participants through offering more frequent but smaller awards.
As noted above, two awards vested during the year, details of which are set out on pages 40 to 41 together with the Committees conclusions on the economic underpin review.

indd 31 10 04 2012 10:17:28 Additional information Notes to the accounts Accounts Governance Business reports Governance Remuneration Report Share Matching Plan SMP Two years ago, with the approval of shareholders, the Committee introduced the SMP.
The purpose of this incentive plan was to encourage greater ownership of NEXT shares amongst the executive directors and other senior executives and thereby further align their interests with shareholders.
Participants who invest a proportion of their annual cash bonus in NEXT shares can receive up to a maximum of two times their original investment in NEXT shares, calculated on a pre-tax basis.
Any matching is conditional upon achieving pre-determined fully diluted EPS growth targets set by the Committee for the following three years.
In addition to the executive directors, around 20 other senior executives participate in the scheme.
The Committee has noted the high level of participation in the SMP by the senior executive team and expects to continue to issue annual invitations.
The Committee is also mindful of the annual accounting cost of the SMP and the high level of payments made under the LTIP this year.
Against this background, the Committee has decided to amend investment parameters for the SMP in 2012 in three ways: the amount of annual bonus that may be invested under the SMP has been reduced from 100 per cent of an individuals cash bonus to maxima of between 50,000 and 125,000: the matching award has been reduced from a maximum of two times to a maximum of one times the initial investment: and the maximum EPS performance threshold has been further increased to aggregate growth of 30% for the 3 year performance period of the 2012 award.
Further details are set out on pages 35 to 36.
Whilst the Committee intends the SMP should operate for the foreseeable future, the Committee will continue to review its suitability, structure and thresholds each year.
The first SMP award is due to vest at the end of June 2013.
EPS and performance measurement As noted previously, the Committee reviews each year the basis of annual bonus and performance thresholds under the SMP.
We have again concluded that EPS remains the most appropriate measurement basis for the following reasons: NEXT has used EPS as the determining measurement for many years: it is therefore both consistent and entirely transparent to participants and shareholders.
The Committee will however exercise its discretion to adjust EPS to reflect what it considers to be a fairer outcome for shareholders.
Thus, for the year to January 2012, the Committee decided to exclude from the calculation of EPS the capital profit achieved by NEXT on the sale of Ventura and the exceptional VAT refund and interest relating to past years: NEXT is predominantly a single business selling products through a number of channels under the NEXT brand.
As such its earnings are not derived from uncorrelated businesses and therefore a Group metric such as EPS is logical and consistent with NEXTs strategy: EPS continues to be the core financial yardstick by which management and the Board measure and assess the overall performance of NEXT: and the use of EPS in determining annual bonuses and awards under the SMP is complemented by the application of TSR for the LTIP.
Furthermore, the Committee considers it right that the impact of share buybacks be included in performance measurement as, for more than a decade, this has been one of the primary strategies of the Company in returning value to shareholders.
Share buybacks are subject to advance Board approval and are only undertaken after the Board is satisfied that the ability of the Group to invest in the business and to continue to grow the annual dividend would not be prejudiced.
The Committee believes that the remuneration strategy it pursues, and the structures implementing that strategy, have contributed positively to maintaining the stable and highly motivated management team at nExT who have consistently delivered strong performances for shareholders.

indd 32 10 04 2012 10:17:28 PaRT 3: REGulaTORY DiSClOSuRES Information not subject to audit Further details of each of the components of the directors remuneration are given in the report below.
THE REMunERaTiOn COMMiTTEE During the year the Committee comprised the following independent non-executive directors: Jonathan Dawson Committee Chairman Steve Barber John Barton Christine Cross Francis Salway The Committee met six times during the year under review and all meetings were fully attended.
Role of Remuneration Committee The Committee determines the remuneration of the Groups Chairman and executive directors, and reviews that of senior executives.
It is also responsible for determining the targets for any performance related pay schemes operated by the Company, approves any award of the Companys shares under share option or incentive schemes to the Companys employees and oversees any major changes in employee benefit structures throughout the Group.
The Committee members have no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no director is permitted to be involved in any decisions as to his or her own remuneration.
The remuneration of non-executive directors is decided by the executive directors of the Board.
The Committees terms of reference are available on the Companys website www.
co. uk or on request from the Company Secretary.
Remuneration policy The remuneration packages of directors are reviewed by the Committee at least annually on the same basis as other employees of the Group.
The review takes into account market practice and performance of the individual and of the business.
Other factors taken into account include the experience and responsibility of the individuals concerned, together with the Groups wider pay structures.
In particular, pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group are considered by the Committee to ensure that any differences in the pay and employment conditions of directors are justified.
From time to time, the Committee commissions benchmarking exercises by independent consultants covering all aspects of directors remuneration including share incentives and other performance related reward plans.
The Committee also receives information from various independent sources on directors remuneration and draws on members experience from other board positions.
The components of the Groups remuneration packages and directors service contract information are detailed below.
Remuneration is structured with the objective that no single component or measure dominates and that interests are aligned over different time periods with other employees and shareholders.
Remuneration policy does not conflict with the Companys approach to environmental, social and corporate governance matters and the Committee believes that the current arrangements do not encourage directors to take undue business risks.
Packages include basic salary, annual bonus based on pre-tax EPS, a long term incentive plan based on total shareholder return TSR, a share matching plan based on fully diluted post-tax EPS and participation in NEXTs group pension plan.
There are no uncapped incentive plans.
assistance to the Committee During the period under review the Committee received input from the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director and retained the services of Aon Hewitt and FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP to provide independent external advice regarding executive remuneration.
Aon Hewitt also provided the Board of the Trustee to the NEXT Group Pension Plan with investment advice up to September 2011.
 provided independent verification services of total shareholder returns for NEXT and the comparator group of companies under the NEXT LTIP.
Board remuneration packages Salary Directors salaries are set by reference to those prevailing in the market, particularly within other major retail companies, and according to individual performance, experience and responsibility.
Where appropriate, merit increases are awarded.
With effect from 1 February 2012 an annual salary increase of 2.5% was awarded to executive directors, in line with the wider Company award.
No merit awards were made to executive directors in the year.

indd 33 10 04 2012 10:17:28 Additional information Notes to the accounts Accounts Governance Business reports Governance Remuneration Report Annual performance related bonus The executive directors participate in an annual performance related bonus scheme which is based on pre-tax EPS targets set annually by the Committee.
These targets are set taking account of a range of factors, including consensus analysts profit forecasts, the Companys own internal budgets for the relevant period and the wider background of the UK economy.
Whilst company forecasts are not disclosed in advance for reasons of commercial sensitivity, the targets and performance against them are disclosed in the relevant years Remuneration Report.
For the year to January 2012, performance targets were set requiring pre-tax EPS of 320p before any bonus became payable.
A maximum bonus of 150% of salary in the case of the Chief Executive and 100% of salary for the other executive directors was payable if pre-tax EPS exceeded 350p.
A sliding scale of payments operated for performance between the minimum and maximum levels.
Based on the pre-tax EPS of 340p adjusted as described below an annual bonus of 72% of salary 108% in respect of the Chief Executive was earned.
In the case of the Chief Executive, any annual bonus in excess of 100% of basic salary is payable in shares, deferred for a period of two years and will be forfeited if he voluntarily resigns prior to the end of that period.
Following the sale of Ventura during the year, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the impact on EPS for the purposes of performance measurement of annual bonus, SMP and management share options.
The Committee noted that Venturas trading profit up to the time of its sale and the exceptional profit on its disposal are reported in the Groups consolidated financial statements as earnings arising from discontinued operations.
By contrast, any investment income arising from, and EPS enhancement on share buybacks financed by, the Ventura sale monies are included in the calculation of EPS on continuing operations.
In determining whether any incentive awards should be made, the Committee concluded that current year EPS reported in accordance with IFRS which includes the exceptional capital gain from the disposal of Ventura should be reduced to a more representative measure of sustainable profitability.
The Committee therefore determined that pre-tax EPS should include Venturas trading profits up to sale of 2.9m but exclude the 38.0m capital profit achieved on disposal.
In addition, the Committee decided that an exceptional recovery of VAT overpaid in past years and related interest totalling 9.2m should be excluded from the calculation of this adjusted EPS.
Had the Committee not made these adjustments the unadjusted pre-tax EPS of 369p would have resulted in a higher bonus of 100% of salary 150% in the case of Simon Wolfson.
Long term incentive plan From 2008 the Remuneration Committee adopted a semi-annual, rather than annual, grant policy.
The Chief Executive, other executive directors and senior management receive grants of conditional awards of NEXT shares, equal to 100%, 75% and 60% of basic annual salary respectively every six months in or around March and September each year.
Therefore, they are able to receive awards of up to 200%, 150% and 120% of basic salary annually.
For Christos Angelides, in recognition of the strategic importance of his product skills to the Group, each of the four semi-annual LTIP awards with performance periods ending July 2012 through to January 2014 were increased from 75% of salary to 125%.
No equivalent increase for other executive directors was made.
Under the plan, performance is measured over periods of three years, which commence in February and August each year, by comparing TSR against at least 20 other UK listed retail companies.
If no entitlement has been earned at the end of a three year performance period then the award for that period will lapse and there is no retesting.
Awards made for all periods starting on or before January 2009 have now either vested or lapsed.
For periods from August 2008 onwards, before allowing any of the awards to vest, the Remuneration Committee must have regard to the performance of the Company in light of underlying economic and other circumstances, including EPS performance of the Company and of other UK retailers over the period.
Whilst not disclosed in advance, the factors taken into account in determining the awards are disclosed in the relevant years Remuneration Report see pages 40 to 41 for details of the performance reviews for awards vesting in the year.
The comparator group of companies for the three year performance periods to January and July 2012 was as follows: ASOS Findel J Sainsbury N Brown Burberry French Connection Kesa Signet Carpetright Halfords Kingfisher Tesco Carphone Warehouse HMV Marks & Spencer WH Smith Debenhams Home Retail Group Morrisons Dixons Retail JJB Sports Mothercare Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 28 January 2012 34 21127-04 05 04 2012 Proof 5 21127-04NEXTPLC.
indd 34 10 04 2012 10:17:28 For subsequent performance periods the changes to the comparator group above are: 1. period ending January 2013 no change: 2. periods ending July 2013 and January 2014 Ted Baker added and Findel, French Connection and JJB Sports removed: 3. period ending July 2014 Supergroup added and Signet removed: and 4. period ending January 2015 Dunelm Group added and HMV removed.
The Committee considers that the comparator group consists of UK listed retail companies which are most comparable with NEXT in size and or nature of their business and believes that comparison against such a group of companies is more likely to reflect the Companys relative performance against its peers, thereby resulting in awards being made on an appropriate basis.
If TSR is below the median ranking company in the comparator group there will be no entitlement to any of the award.
Median performance earns an entitlement to 20% of the maximum award.
For performance above the median the entitlement will rise, with the maximum award being earned for performance which places the Company within the upper quintile in the comparator group.
Performance against the relative TSR performance targets is calculated by  and reported to the Remuneration Committee.
The maximum aggregate annual award allowed under the current rules of the plan is 200% of basic salary 300% in exceptional circumstances.
Details of potential awards granted for outstanding performance periods are as follows: Maximum potential award granted % of basic salary Simon Christos David Keens & Other Performance periods commencing wolfson angelides andrew varley employees August 2009, February 2010, August 2010 and February 2011 100% 125% 75% 60% August 2011 100% 75% 75% 60% The Committee has discretion as to whether entitlements earned are payable in NEXT shares or cash and to date it has allowed participants the choice.
Entitlements earned are not pensionable and are based on salary and share price at the start of the performance period.
No individuals included in the plan have received grants under the management share option scheme in the same year.
Share matching plan The share matching plan SMP was approved by shareholders at the 2010 AGM and awards made in June 2010 and April 2011, details of which are given below.
Under the SMP around 25 senior executives including the four executive directors are able to invest part or all of their annual bonus in NEXT shares Investment Shares and in return they receive a conditional award of Matching Shares Matching Shares.
Investment Shares may be purchased out of the post-tax cash element of any annual bonus, subject to limits specified by the Remuneration Committee.
Deferred shares i. e. any compulsory deferral element of the annual bonus, which currently only applies to the Chief Executive do not qualify.
Under the SMP awards made in 2010 and 2011 participants are eligible to receive a maximum matching award of 2 Matching Shares for every 1 Investment Share calculated on the value of gross bonus used to acquire their Investment Shares, with a minimum of 0.5 Matching Shares being received on achievement of a pre-determined performance threshold.
Vesting of matching awards is subject to remaining in employment, the achievement of 3-year performance targets and the retention of Investment Shares.
The scheme contains the ability to grant a higher matching ratio of up to 3:1 if the Committee considers it appropriate: however the Committee intends to operate the SMP with a maximum 2:1 match and will consult with major shareholders before any higher award is made.
As noted above, a reduced match will be offered for the award to be made in 2012.
Vesting of the awards made in June 2010 and April 2011 is dependent solely on achieving the fully diluted post-tax EPS targets detailed below: Required fully diluted EPS pence for 0.5:1 for 1:1 for 2:1 Date of grant match match match June 2010 191.5 206.5 221.5 April 2011 231.3 240.2 258.1 Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 28 January 2012 35 21127-04 05 04 2012 Proof 5 21127-04NEXTPLC.
indd 35 10 04 2012 10:17:28 Additional information Notes to the accounts Accounts Governance Business reports Governance Remuneration Report These targets require a minimum three year growth in EPS of 8.8% and 12% respectively before any shares vest and a maximum award is only achieved if EPS growth reaches 25.8% and 25% over three years respectively.
The effective matching ratio will be calculated on a straight line basis for EPS falling between each of the threshold points.
Details of the calculation of fully diluted EPS are provided in Note 10.
The Committee has reviewed the parameters of awards to be made in 2012 and has reduced the level of the matching award, limited the amount participants can invest and increased the maximum performance hurdle.
For the year to January 2015, the fully-diluted EPS hurdle will be 267.2 pence for a minimum match of 0.25 of a share to vest and 310.2 pence for the maximum match of one share with vesting calculated on a straight-line basis across the range.
The minimum threshold requires fully diluted EPS growth of 12% and the maximum match requires growth of 30% over the three years.
The Committee is able to set different performance measures and targets for future awards but will consult with major shareholders before applying targets which, in its view, are less demanding in the circumstances than these conditions.
Management share options The management share option plan provides for options over shares, exercisable between three and ten years following their grant, to be allocated to Group employees at the discretion of the Committee.
This plan is primarily aimed at middle management and senior store staff.
No options were granted to any directors or changes made to existing entitlements in the year under review.
No employee is entitled to be granted options under the scheme and be included in NEXTs LTIP or the SMP in the same year.
The total number of options which can be granted is subject to shareholder approved limits and there are no cash settlement alternatives.
Options are set at the prevailing market price at the time of grant.
The maximum total market value of shares i. e. the acquisition price of shares over which options may be granted to any person during any financial year of the Company is three times salary, excluding bonuses and benefits in kind.
This limit may be increased to five times salary in circumstances considered by the Committee to be exceptional, for example on the grant of options following recruitment.
Grants are generally made annually.
The exercise of options is subject to a performance condition.
If the performance condition for any option grant is not met at three years from the date of grant, the options lapse.
For the April 2010 and April 2011 awards the condition requires the percentage growth in the Groups post-tax EPS over a three year period to exceed RPI plus a further 3% per annum.
For future awards the Committee has determined this performance condition should refer to CPI rather than RPI.
In the light of the economic circumstances at that time, the Committee determined in 2009 that an EPS growth related performance condition was not appropriate.
Instead, a specific minimum post-tax EPS performance condition of 133p was required for the year to January 2012 for the April 2009 option grant to vest.
This performance condition has been satisfied as well as the standard RPI plus 3% per annum condition and the 2009 grant will vest.
Sharesave options Executive directors can participate in the Companys Save As You Earn Sharesave scheme which is open to all employees.
Invitations to participate are generally issued annually and the scheme is subject to HMRC rules which limit the maximum monthly savings to 250.
Options are granted at the prevailing market rate less a discount of 20% and are exercisable three, five or seven years from the date of grant.
Sharesave options granted to, or exercised by, directors in the year under review are detailed on page 43.
Dilution of share capital by employee share plans The Company monitors and has complied with dilution limits in its various share scheme rules and has not issued a significant number of new or treasury shares in satisfaction of share schemes in the last 10 years.
Currently, share based incentives are usually satisfied from shares held by the ESOT see Note 29.
The Committee may recommend further share purchases be made by the ESOT to satisfy outstanding and future option grants.
The Board has also approved in principle the use of market purchases into treasury where necessary for the future settlement of these obligations.

indd 36 10 04 2012 10:17:28 Group pension plan Executive directors are eligible for membership of the NEXT Group Pension Plan the Plan which has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs and consists of defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The trustee of the Plan is a limited company, NEXT Pension Trustees Limited the Trustee.
The Board of the Trustee includes members of the Plan, a pensioner member and an independent director who is also the Chairman of the Trustee.
Two of the directors are member nominated directors and cannot be removed by NEXT: the other directors, including the independent director, are appointed by and can be removed by NEXT.
All directors of the Trustee receive a fee for their services, including those directors who are also employees of NEXT.
No director of the Company is a director of the Trustee.
The Plans investments are kept separate from the business affairs of the NEXT Group and the Trustee holds them in trust.
Responsibility for investment of the Plans funds has been delegated by the Trustee to professional investment managers.
From October 2008 the Group initiated a salary sacrifice scheme whereby members from either section can elect to receive a reduced gross salary in exchange for enhanced employer pension contributions.
The participation of members in the salary sacrifice scheme does not result in any overall increase in costs to the Group.
Defined contribution section Employees of the Group can join the defined contribution section of the Plan.
Members elect to pay either 3% or 5% of their pensionable earnings which is matched by the Company.
For death prior to retirement, a lump sum of three times the members basic salary at the previous April is payable along with the current value of the members fund.
Defined benefit section The defined benefit section of the Plan was closed to new members in 2000 but continues for the benefit of existing members.
This section provides members with a retirement benefit of one sixtieth or one eightieth depending on the members chosen contribution rate of final pensionable earnings for each year of pensionable service.
This section also provides a lump sum death in service benefit and dependants pensions on death in service or following retirement.
Childrens pensions are only payable on death in service.
In the case of ill-health retirement only the accrued pension is payable.
All benefits are subject to Plan limits.
Increases to pensions in payment are at the discretion of the Trustee although pensionable service post-1997 is subject to limited price indexation.
For all current members, pensionable earnings are composed of basic pay, overtime and, prior to 1 October 2006, annual performance bonuses.
No other items of remuneration are taken into account.
From 1 October 2006, sales and profit related bonuses are no longer taken into account and the normal retirement age under the Plan was increased from 60 to 65.
Members contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings, whilst the Company currently makes contributions at the rate of 17.5%.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit sections financial position was undertaken as at 31 March 2010.
Adjusting these results for the subsequent buy-in transaction described more fully in Note 23 resulted in a fully funded position on an actuarial basis.
The Company and the Trustee of the Plan have agreed that no further special contributions are required at this time.
As calculated in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, the surplus in the Plan at 28 January 2012 was 35.1m: further details are given in Note 23 to the financial statements.
Certain members whose accrued or projected pension fund value exceeds their personal lifetime allowance are provided with benefits through an unfunded, unapproved arrangement where they so elect.
The relevant members contribute towards the additional cost of providing these benefits by a deduction of 5% of pensionable earnings.
Since April 2011, where existing members have reached either the annual or lifetime pension contributions limits, the Company has offered those members the choice of leaving the defined benefit section and either joining the defined contribution section with an enhanced Company contribution or taking a salary supplement, equal depending on their existing contributions and benefits to 10% or 15% of their base salary.
Specific information in respect of executive directors pension entitlements is detailed on page 44.

The Companys TSR ranked third in the comparator group of 20 other listed retail companies and 100% vesting accrued.
Before allowing the award to vest the Remuneration Committee also assessed the performance of the Company during the performance period in light of underlying economic and other conditions the economic underpin.
The Committee noted that NEXTs EPS compound growth of 12.2% and pre-tax profit compound growth of 6.1% over the three year period, was well ahead of RPI compound growth of 2.7%.
In addition, NEXTs dividend had grown broadly in line with EPS and the Company had returned over 500m to shareholders through buybacks over the relevant period.
The Committee also assessed NEXTs earnings growth against selected comparable major UK retailers and concluded that NEXT had performed favourably.
Taking these factors into account, the Committee determined that the economic underpin performance condition for the July 2008 award had been satisfied.
Details of the amounts that vested for each executive director are detailed in the table below.
The awards were cash settled.

The Companys TSR over this performance period ranked fifth against the comparator group of 22 other listed retail companies which corresponded to a vesting of 83% of the maximum award.
The Remuneration Committee has assessed the performance of the Company in this period on the same basis as the July 2008 LTIP award and noted that NEXTs EPS compound growth of 17.9% and pre-tax profit compound growth of 10.0% were both well ahead of RPI compound growth of 4.2%.
In addition, NEXTs dividend had grown broadly in line with EPS and the Company had returned over 600m to shareholders through buybacks over the relevant period.
The Committee again assessed NEXTs earnings growth against selected comparable major UK retailers and concluded that NEXT had performed favourably.
Taking these factors into account, the Committee determined that the economic underpin performance condition had therefore been satisfied.

Directors and some senior managers receive enhancements from the Plan, increasing the accrual of their retirement benefit up to two thirds of their final pensionable earnings on completion of 20 years pensionable service at age 65 and the lump sum payable on death is four times pensionable salary.
Since leaving the defined benefit section of the Plan, Simon Wolfson and Christos Angelides have been members of, and contributed to, the Companys unfunded, unapproved pension arrangement and the accrued annual pension and transfer value set out below includes both their membership of that arrangement and deferred entitlements under the Plan.
Andrew Varley and David Keens ceased to contribute to the Plan in 2008 and May 2011 respectively.
Their pensions are no longer linked to salary and will increase in line with statutory deferred revaluation.
On ceasing to contribute to the Plan these directors have received salary supplements from April and June 2011 respectively of 15%.
Prior to April 2011, the salary supplement paid to Mr Varley was 10% and was only paid from November 2008.
These supplements are less than the contributions the Company would otherwise have made to the defined benefit section of the Plan.
