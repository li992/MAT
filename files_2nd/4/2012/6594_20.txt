On behalf of the Board During the year, the Committee also reviewed the shareholding requirement for executive Directors.

The incentive arrangements which operate for executive Directors are applied to employees in management grades.
Where appropriate, local arrangements apply to other employees providing them with participation in an annual incentive plan.
Base pay is generally reviewed on an annual basis, except where agreements have been put in place to extend the timeframe, and the reviews consider market practice, economic conditions and the Companys budget.
Benefits vary according to statutory requirements and local market practice.
Remuneration policy for new hires When hiring a new executive Director, the Committee will typically seek to align the remuneration package with the Companys remuneration policy.
However, the Committee retains discretion to make remuneration decisions which are outside the policy to facilitate the hiring of candidates of an appropriate calibre and skill-set.
In determining appropriate remuneration arrangements, the Committee will take into consideration a number of relevant factors, including quantum, the nature and structure of remuneration, and the jurisdiction from which the candidate was recruited to ensure they are in the best interests of both the Company and its shareholders.
In such circumstances, the Committee may make an award in respect of buying-out incentive arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
In doing so the Committee will take into account a number of relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards and the time at which they would have vested.
D2 Remuneration report continued Executive Director pay mix The charts below show the balance of remuneration between fixed pay base salary, benefits in kind and pension and variable pay short and long term incentive arrangements assuming target and maximum performance levels.
Target: STVRS at 55% of base salary and SEP at 25% of maximum vesting opportunity.
Maximum: STVRS at 110% of base salary and full vesting of the SEP award 174% of base salary.
Pension value: 40% of base salary at target and maximum.
The Committee believes that these proportions represent an appropriate balance between fixed income and performance-related remuneration linked to GKNs operational and strategic objectives.
"Target Maximum % Base salary benets in kind ""% Long term incentive plan % SEP Pension !% Annual incentive plan STVRS Annual incentive plan Performance-related short term variable remuneration scheme STVRS Stretching targets are applied to a combination of Group and, where appropriate, individual portfolio financial and strategic measures."
The Committee has flexibility to select appropriate targets each year dependent on the specific business needs and strategic goals of the Group.
These targets, whilst stretching, are designed to discourage excessive risk taking.
STVRS payments are delivered as a mix of cash and shares up to a maximum of 110% of base salary.
Payments up to a certain percentage of base salary are delivered in cash and amounts in excess of this percentage are compulsorily deferred and invested in GKN shares under the Deferred Bonus Plan see below.
Delivered in cash Deferred into shares for two years Target Maximum 55% 65% 110% Details of the targets applied and payments made in respect of the 2012 STVRS are set out in the second table on page 66.
Deferred Bonus Plan DBP Awards are granted under the DBP in respect of the element of STVRS that exceeds a percentage of base salary currently 65%.
On release of the shares, a cash amount is paid equivalent to aggregate dividends per share paid during the deferral period.
The release of such shares is not subject to any further performance conditions: however in certain circumstances, such as resignation during the deferral period, the award may lapse.
As part of the remuneration strategy review, a clawback provision was introduced on awards granted from 2012 onwards which will apply in the event of a material misstatement or gross misconduct.
Details of share awards granted to executive Directors under the DBP are shown on page 71.

DA Long term incentive arrangements GKN Sustainable Earnings Plan SEP The SEP was introduced in 2012 to improve alignment with the Groups growth strategy and with shareholders interests.
It is designed to encourage and reward earnings performance which is sustained over the long term.
Awards under the SEP take the form of a Core Award and an associated Sustainability Award.
Executive Directors may receive award values up to 200% of salary: for 2012, the award values were 174% of salary which includes the Sustainability Award.
Core Award The Core Award is subject to the achievement of stretching EPS growth targets measured over a three year core performance period.
To the extent that this core target has been met, half of the Core Award will be released at the end of the third year and the balance the Deferred Core Award after a further two year period i. e. at the end of five years.
Sustainability Award The number of shares over which a Sustainability Award is granted is equal to 20% of the number of shares granted under the associated Core Award.
At the end of the core performance period the number of shares subject to the Sustainability Award will be reduced to the extent that the core target is not satisfied over the core performance period.
The number of shares that can be earned under the associated Sustainability Award is subject to the satisfaction of a sustainability target measured over a two year sustainability performance period.
This is illustrated below: Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Core performance period Sustainability performance period Deferred Core Award Core Award 50% Core Award released 50% Core Award released Sustainability Award Sustainability Award will be reduced to the Sustainability Award vests at the extent that the core target is not satis!ed end of year !five subject to the over the core performance period sustainability target set out below On vesting, dividends are treated as having accrued on the shares from the date of grant to the date of release with the value delivered in the form of additional shares or in cash.
Details of awards made to executive Directors during the year are set out in the table on page 70.
Vesting levels for awards granted in 2012 under the rules of the SEP are as follows: Core target a Compound annual EPS growth Vesting level 12% or more 100% 6% 25% Less than 6% 0 Between 6% and 12% Straight line basis a Management EPS calculated using cash tax rate as reported in the financial statements.
Sustainability target If the highest level of EPS attained in the core performance period is achieved or exceeded in both years four and five, the Sustainability Award will vest in full subject to any reduction made in respect of the core target not being satisfied over the core performance period.
The sustainability target will be assessed for year four and year five separately.
There is no provision for the retesting of performance for either the Core Award or Sustainability Award.
Adjustment of targets To ensure a measure of consistency year on year the Remuneration Committee has discretion to alter the core and sustainability targets.
DB Remuneration report continued Underpin The vesting of Core Awards and Sustainability Awards will be subject to an additional test based on the Remuneration Committees assessment of and its satisfaction that the quality of earnings justifies the vesting of awards.
This will involve consideration of the Groups return on invested capital against internal projections, shareholder expectations, new investment performance and cost of capital, and the extent to which the level of vesting appropriately reflects shareholder value creation.
The key conclusions from this assessment and the basis for any adjustment to the levels of vesting will be disclosed retrospectively in the remuneration report.
Retirement benefits Retirement benefits generally take the form of a supplementary allowance, expressed as a percentage of base salary, up to a maximum of 40% of base salary for existing executive Directors and up to 25% for newly appointed executive Directors.
These may be delivered by means of either a cash payment or as a payment to a defined contribution retirement plan.
Details of the supplementary allowances paid to executive Directors in the year are set out in the table on page 69.
In certain cases, based on historical contractual commitments, retirement benefits in part are delivered through membership of the executive section of the GKN Group Pension Scheme 2012, which is a defined benefit scheme.
The Scheme provides executive Directors with a pension of up to twothirds of annual base salary up to a pensionable earnings cap, from 1 September 2007 calculated on a career average basis, on retirement at age 60 after 20 or more years service and proportionately less for shorter service or for retirement before pension age.
An employee contribution of 8.6% of salary up to their pensionable earnings cap is required under the scheme.
The salary on which any defined benefit provisions are based is taken into account in calculating the supplementary allowance above.
Details of defined benefit provisions for executive Directors are set out in the first table on page 72.
No compensation is offered for any additional tax suffered by the individual in the event that the value of their pension exceeds the statutory Lifetime Allowance.
Executive Directors with non-UK service agreements typically receive pension retirement benefits consistent with local practice.
In particular, in accordance with standard practice in the US, GKN makes a total annual contribution equivalent to 11% of William Seegers base salary and any STVRS payment made in the relevant year to his qualified and non-qualified defined contribution pension arrangement.
The amount contributed by GKN, as noted above, forms part of the overall supplementary allowance payable to William Seeger of 40% of base salary.

Vesting of long term incentives Governed by leaver provisions in relevant share schemes rules.
Pension enhancements An enhancement to the pension rights upon early retirement will only be considered in exceptional cases and a full costing would be provided to the Committee at the time it is being discussed.
Such enhancement would not be considered unless objectives set for the Director had been met or it was otherwise merited in the opinion of the Committee.
The Remuneration Committee is proposing to make changes to the above policy for future appointments, in particular to remove the change of control clause, to bring it in line with best practice and in the light of the proposed new regulations on remuneration reporting.
The Committee will also consider whether such changes should apply to existing contracts.
DC It is also the Boards policy that, at the time of consideration of a proposed appointment of an executive Director, the Remuneration Committee will take into account the likely cost of severance in determining the suitability of the proposed terms of appointment.
In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006, no payment will be made to a Director for loss of office or employment with the Company in excess of the Directors contractual obligations without the prior approval of shareholders in general meeting.
Chairman and non-executive Directors Remuneration policy The remuneration policy for the Chairman and the other non-executive Directors is to pay fees in line with those paid by other UK listed companies of comparable size and complexity.
Such fees may include additional payments to the Senior Independent Director and to the Chairmen of Board Committees to reflect the significant extra responsibilities attached to these positions.
The fees of the non-executive Directors other than the Chairman, together with any additional fees payable to the Senior Independent Director and the Chairmen of Board Committees, are determined by the Board upon the recommendation of the Chairman and Chief Executive and are set at a level that the Board believes will attract individuals with the necessary experience and ability to make a substantial contribution to the Groups affairs.
The fees received by the Chairman are determined by the Remuneration Committee.
No Director participates in discussions concerning his own fee.
Neither the Chairman nor the other non-executive Directors participate in the Groups STVRS or long term incentive arrangements or in its pension scheme, nor do they receive benefits in kind.
Terms of appointment The terms of service of the Chairman and other non-executive Directors are contained in letters of appointment.

The current policy for non-executive Directors is to serve on the Board for nine years with interim renewals after three and six years, subject to mutual agreement and annual performance reviews.
There are no provisions for compensation in the event of termination.
John Sheldrick has indicated his intention to retire at the 2013 AGM having served for almost nine years as a non-executive Director.
With the exception of John Sheldrick, all Directors will offer themselves for annual re-election, in accordance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Shareholding requirement Executive Directors During the year, the Committee reviewed and increased the shareholding requirement for executive Directors from 100% to 200% of base salary in order to increase the alignment of their interests with those of shareholders.
Directors are expected to meet the new requirement within five years.
Newly appointed Directors are expected to reach a shareholding of 100% of base salary within five years and 200% of base salary as soon as possible thereafter.
Directors will be required to retain all vested long term incentive awards net of tax until the requirement has been met.
Non-executive Directors Non-executive Directors are expected to achieve a shareholding requirement equivalent to 30% of one years base fee within three years of appointment.
Information on the progress towards meeting the shareholding requirement is set out in the share interests table on page 72.

The vesting of outstanding awards under the LTIP and ESOS depends on the Groups performance against the relevant targets during the three years commencing on 1 January in the year of award and on satisfaction of a personal shareholding requirement.
In addition, before any shares become eligible for release or exercise, the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that this is justified by the underlying financial performance of the Group over the measurement period.
There is no provision for the retesting of awards.
The maximum number of shares that could vest upon satisfaction of the relevant performance condition in respect of each executive Director is set out in the tables on pages 70 and 71.
The performance targets and vesting levels for outstanding awards under the LTIP and ESOS are shown below: LTIP ESOS a b Compound annual EPS growth Vesting level TSR ranking in comparator group Vesting level 12% or more 100 % Upper quartile 100% 6% 30% Median level 35% Less than 6% 0 Below median level 0 Between 6% and 12% Straight line basis Between median and upper quartile Straight line basis a Management EPS normalised for tax, and excluding exceptional items, post-employment finance charges and volatile IFRS charges or credits see note 9 to the financial statements.
b TSR data and ranking information is obtained from NBS to ensure that the comparative performance is independently verified.
The performance period for the 2010 LTIP and ESOS awards ended on 31 December 2012 and the respective vesting levels are shown in the table below.
Vesting under the LTIP was dependent on absolute EPS growth targets, and vesting under the ESOS was dependent on the performance of GKNs TSR against that of the constituents of the FTSE 350 Index over a three year measurement period, commencing on 1 January 2010.

William Seeger is a US National who relocated to the UK in 2008 in the role of Finance Director.

As a result of the complicated interaction of the UK and US tax regimes, a payment of 429,333 2011: 425,188 was made by GKN to the UK and US tax authorities on his behalf in order to mitigate a period of double taxation.
Any subsequent tax refunds resulting from the tax paid by GKN are refunded to the Company in due course.
At the end of 2012, the Company held an estimated credit balance of 109,160 representing the difference between hypothetical tax amounts withheld from William Seeger and the amount actually paid over to the tax authorities which arose as a result of the timing of the exercise of an ESOS option in November 2012.
At the end of 2011, the best estimate of the amount which was not expected to be refunded based on information available at that date was 167,847.

b A transfer value represents the present value of accrued benefits.
It does not represent an amount of money which the individual is entitled to receive.
The change in transfer value over the year reflects the additional pension earned and the effect of changes in stock market conditions during the year.
In particular, a reduction in the discount rate assumption and a strengthening of the mortality assumption have resulted in a significant increase in the transfer value, in addition to that arising from the additional benefit accrued.
The method and assumptions used to calculate transfer values from the GKN Group Pension Scheme 2012 were last reviewed in November 2012 following a reorganisation of GKNs pension arrangements which took effect from 1 October 2012 details of which are set out on page 119.
The new 2012 Scheme adopted the same transfer value assumptions that applied under the GKN Group Pension Scheme prior to 1 October 2012. c Increase over the year in accrued pension in excess of inflation to which the Director would have been entitled on leaving service.
Total amounts paid to executive Directors as supplementary cash allowances and or as payments to defined contribution retirement plans are included in the supplementary pension allowance column in the remuneration table on page 69.
The payment for William Seeger comprises his retirement benefit in full.
