Strategic Operational Leadership & Financial Additional Review Review Governance Statements Information Directors Remuneration Report Letter from the Remuneration Committee Dear Shareholder The past year has seen the publication by Government of a package of reforms intended to give shareholders greater influence over the structure and quantum of directors pay.
A number of the proposals relate to the disclosure of reward arrangements by listed companies.
In particular, they seek to improve the way in which their remuneration policies and practices are communicated to shareholders by making a number of changes to the form and content of directors remuneration reports.
"Although the relevant regulations which were originally published in draft in June 2012 by the Department for Business, Innovation & Skills ""BIS"" will not come into force for Cairn until the preparation of the accounts for the financial year ending 31 December 2013, we have, as a preliminary step, decided to separate our report for 2012 into two distinct parts: firstly, a ""policy section"" which summarises our overall approach to executive pay and, secondly, an ""implementation section"" which provides shareholders with details of the remuneration actually delivered to the directors during 2012."
"The entire report will, of course, continue to be subject to a single ""advisory"" vote at the forthcoming AGM."
We have also adopted in this years report those of the new disclosure requirements specified in the draft BIS regulations that we feel enhance our explanation of Cairns pay arrangements.
For example, we have included: h A table setting out the key elements of pay to which current Executive Directors will be entitled during 2013 see pages 69 to 71 : and h A revised graph which sets out the proportion of each of these elements that becomes payable at different performance levels see page 72.
Comment on last years AGM The Remuneration Committee recognises that at last years AGM a significant proportion of shareholders voted against the 2011 Directors Remuneration Report.
I can assure shareholders that the strength of views they expressed was fully appreciated by the Remuneration Committee.
In the future we will continue to engage with and listen closely to all relevant stakeholders as we seek to ensure compliance with best practice and high standards of corporate governance.
Summary of key decisions on remuneration during 2012 The work of the Committee in 2012 was conducted against a background of transition as the Companys portfolio was re-balanced following the sale of a majority shareholding in Cairn India Limited to Vedanta Resources plc and the subsequent return of $3.5 billion in cash to shareholders in February 2012.
During the year the Company successfully established a portfolio of pre-development and mature basin exploration opportunities as well as potentially transformational frontier exploration opportunities.
This established foundation will provide the basis for multi-year and multi-well programmes funded via the Companys balance sheet strength and late pre-development North Sea assets which, when on stream, will provide cash flows to sustain future exploration.
Its key decisions relating to the operation of the Companys remuneration arrangements during 2012 are described in more detail in the implementation section of this report but in summary were: h The re-weighting, at the start of the year, of the key performance indicators for the 2012 annual bonus scheme which took into account the completion of the part sale of the Companys shareholding in Cairn India to Vedanta: h The assessment of the performance conditions governing the vesting of the LTIP awards originally granted in 2009: and h As disclosed in last years report, consideration of the impact of the Vedanta transaction and subsequent return of cash on the holding periods applicable to previously vested incentive awards.
66 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 During 2012, the Remuneration Committee also undertook a comprehensive review of the Companys remuneration policy for its senior personnel.
This included consideration of the level and mix of the total reward arrangements of the Executive Directors in the context of the businesss strategic objectives, investor preferences and market practice in FTSE 51 200 companies and relevant oil and gas exploration and production companies.
In general, the review confirmed that: the quantum of the packages was market competitive except for the Chief Executive whose base salary on appointment was positioned below a market competitive level with the expectation that it may be increased over time in line with his experience and performance in the role : and the overall composition with a higher than typical emphasis on long-term variable pay linked to demanding total shareholder return targets remained appropriate.
The Committee did, however, conclude that certain changes would be desirable to ensure that Cairns remuneration practices continue to be appropriate and in alignment with good governance and market practice.
"Details of these amendments are set out in the following pages but in summary were: h The adoption of certain changes to the termination provisions contained in the Executive Directors service contracts: h The introduction of clawback provisions in relation to the participation of the Executive Directors in the annual bonus scheme and Long Term Incentive Plan ""LTIP"" : h The creation of share ownership requirements for the Executive Directors: h A change in the weighting of the elements used to determine the level of annual bonus for 2013: and h The amendment of the LTIP so as to give the Committee the flexibility to grant nil-cost options as well as conditional share awards."
Feedback on directors remuneration report We welcome questions and feedback from all shareholders on both the content and style of this report.
"M. Jacqueline Sheppard QC Remuneration Committee Chair, 18 March 2013 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 67 Strategic Operational Leadership & Financial Additional Review Review Governance Statements Information Directors Remuneration Report Continued Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with Regulation 11 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 the ""Regulations""."
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles and complied with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code relating to directors remuneration throughout the financial year.
As required by the Regulations, a single resolution to approve the whole of this report will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
In preparing this report, the Company has also taken into account the Principles of Remuneration issued by the Association of British Insurers a proxy agency and trade body and the voting guidelines issued by the National Association of Pension Funds, as well as individual voting guidelines published by the Companys institutional investors.
The Companys auditors are required to report to Cairns shareholders on the auditable parts of the Implementation Section which have been highlighted as such below and to state whether, in their opinion, those parts have been properly prepared in accordance with the Regulations and the Companies Act 2006.
Policy Section Purpose and role of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee determines and agrees with the Board the overall remuneration policy for the Executive Directors and the Companys PDMRs persons discharging managerial responsibilities.
Within the terms of the agreed policy, the Committee is also responsible for: h determining the total individual remuneration package for each Executive Director and PDMR: h determining the level of awards made under the Companys LTIPs and share option plans and the performance conditions which are to apply: h determining bonuses payable under the Companys annual cash bonus scheme: h determining the vesting levels of awards under the Companys LTIPs and share option arrangements: and h determining the policy for pension arrangements, service agreements and termination payments for Executive Directors and PDMRs.
The Committee also reviews and approves the overall remuneration levels of employees below senior management level, but does not set individual remuneration amounts for such employees.
This oversight role allows the Committee to take into account pay policies within the Group as a whole when designing the reward structures of the Executive Directors and PDMRs.
Cairns Remuneration Committee operates within written terms of reference agreed by the Board.
These are reviewed periodically to ensure that the Committee remains up-to-date with best practices appropriate to Cairn, its strategy and the business environment in which it operates.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available on the Companys website.
Overview of remuneration policy and package Cairns policy on Executive Directors remuneration for the current year and subsequent financial years is to ensure that it appropriately incentivises individuals to achieve the Groups strategic objectives to enhance value for its shareholders, whilst offering a competitive package against the market.

Notes: 1 Participation in the LTIP is limited to the Executive Directors and certain selected senior managers.
Other employees are eligible to participate in the Companys share option schemes, details of which are provided on pages 7778.
2 Under the Companys defined contribution pension scheme, the Company contribution for less senior employees is 10% of basic annual salary.
3 A lower level of maximum annual bonus opportunity applies to employees other than the Executive Directors and certain PDMRs.
4 Benefits offered to other employees generally comprise permanent health insurance, private health insurance and death in service benefit.
5 The TSR performance conditions applicable to the LTIP were selected by the Remuneration Committee on the basis that they improve shareholder alignment and are consistent with the Companys objective of delivering superior levels of long-term value to shareholders.
6 As the SIP is an all-employee arrangement, no performance conditions are imposed in relation to any partnership, matching or free shares awarded or purchased pursuant to its terms.
7 As highlighted on page 78, the Company recently introduced a share ownership policy which requires the Executive Directors to build up and maintain a target holding equal to 100% of base salary.
Until such a holding is achieved, an Executive Director is obliged to retain shares with a value equal to 50% of the net of tax gain arising from any vesting or exercise under the Companys share incentive plans.
Weighting of remuneration package and expected outturn in different performance scenarios The overall package of the Executive Directors is generally weighted more towards variable pay and, in relation to the variable pay element, the package is weighted more towards long-term performance through the award of long-term incentives.
In the chart below we show the make-up of remuneration of the Executive Directors in 2013 for below threshold, threshold, target and maximum performance levels.

Any post-grant share price movements have been ignored.
Service contracts and exit payments The Companys policy is for all Executive Directors to have contracts of service which can be terminated either by the director concerned or by the Company on giving 12 months notice of termination.
The Committee believes that this policy provides an appropriate balance between the need to retain the services of key individuals who will benefit the business and the need to limit the potential liabilities of the Company in the event of termination.
Executive Directors contracts allow for termination with contractual notice from the Company or termination with a payment in lieu of notice, at the Companys discretion.
The contracts also allow for phased payments to be made on termination with an obligation on the individual to mitigate loss.
Neither notice nor a payment in lieu of notice will be given in the event of gross misconduct.
The Committees approach when considering payments in the event of termination is to take account of the individual circumstances including the reason for termination, the contractual obligations of both parties as well as the relevant share plan and pension scheme rules.
In the event of termination by the Company, an Executive Director would be entitled to receive an amount representing base salary and the value of benefits and pension contributions due under the individuals service contract for the notice period.
Directors will not be entitled to participate in any additional redundancy scheme.
On termination of employment the Committee has discretion as to the amount of bonus payable in respect of the current year.
The bonus paid would reflect the Companys and the individuals performance during that period.
However, any bonus payable on termination would not exceed a pro-rated amount to reflect the period for which the individual had worked in the relevant year.
Depending on the circumstances of termination, the Executive Director may be entitled, or the Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion to allow the Executive Director, to retain a proportion of his or her outstanding awards under long-term incentive arrangements which will only vest to the extent that any applicable performance conditions have been met.
It will be the Remuneration Committees normal policy to time pro-rate any awards on termination of employment, except in exceptional circumstances.
On a change of control of the Company resulting in the termination of a directors employment, each of the existing Executive Directors is entitled to compensation of a sum equal to his her annual basic salary as at the date of termination of employment.
While the Committee recognises that this provision is no longer in accordance with best practice and such provisions will not be included in the contracts of future appointments to the Board, this provision continues to apply to the existing Executive Directors.
Board appointments with other companies The Board believes, in principle, in the benefits of Executive Directors accepting positions as Non-Executive Directors of other companies in order to widen their skills and knowledge for the benefit of the Company, provided that the time commitments involved are not unduly onerous.
The appointment of any Executive Director to a Non-Executive position with another company must be approved by the Board.
In the case of a proposed appointment to a company within the oil and gas industry, permission will only be given if the two companies do not compete in the same geographical area.
Non-Executive Directors The remuneration of each of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the executive members of the Board and the Chairman within limits set out in the Articles of Association and having taken independent advice on appropriate levels.
In all cases, the fees are designed to attract experienced individuals and reflect the increased responsibilities of the Non-Executive Directors.
None of the Non-Executive Directors participates in any of the Companys share schemes and they are not entitled to a bonus or pension contributions.
Chairman The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Remuneration Committee, again based on independent advice.
None of the Non-Executive Directors or the Chairman has a service contract but all have letters of appointment that set out their duties and responsibilities and the time commitment expected by the Company.
These letters of appointment can be terminated with immediate effect by either the director concerned or the Company and are subject to the Companys Articles of Association, which provide for the annual election or re-election by shareholders of all of the Companys directors.
There are no provisions for compensation payable on termination of appointment.

Unaudited information The Remuneration Committee during 2012 Members of the Remuneration Committee The members of the Remuneration Committee during the year were as follows: h M. Jacqueline Sheppard QC Chair of the Committee with effect from 5 March 2012 : h Dr James Buckee Chairman of the Committee until 5 March 2012 : h Todd Hunt: and h Iain McLaren.
All of the current members of the Committee are independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Chief Executive is not a member of the Remuneration Committee but may attend its meetings by invitation and is consulted in respect of certain of its proposals.
He is not consulted or involved in any discussions in respect of his own remuneration.
The Managing Director and Chief Financial Officer is not a member of the Committee but may occasionally be invited to attend parts of its meetings to address specific matters although not in respect of her own remuneration.
During the year, the Committee also received material assistance and advice on remuneration policy from Chris Laughlin, the Groups Reward & Benefits Specialist.
External advisers to the Remuneration Committee As and when the Remuneration Committee considers it appropriate, it takes external advice on remuneration from a number of sources.
The Committee has appointed independent advisors New Bridge Street a trading name of Aon Hewitt Ltd. part of Aon plc and periodically consults them on various aspects of the directors remuneration packages.
In addition, the Companys legal advisers Shepherd and Wedderburn LLP and auditors Ernst & Young LLP provide ongoing assistance to the Committee in respect of the Companys LTIP and share option schemes.
Advice obtained from Ernst & Young LLP is purely in relation to their independent verification of the Companys achievement against performance conditions applicable to the Companys LTIP and share option schemes.
Finally, the Committee appointed and received advice from Slaughter and May during the year in connection with its review of the Executive Directors service contracts and other matters relating to their remuneration arrangements.
Elements of Executive Directors Remuneration Package for 2012 Basic salary and benefits Details of the basic salaries paid to the Executive Directors during 2012 and the increases that came into effect on 1 January 2013 are as follows: 2012 Salary Details Executive Directors Salary for period 1 January 2012 to % increase with Salary as at 31 December Salary as at effect from Executive Director Job title 31 December 2011 2012 1 January 2013 1 January 2013 Simon Thomson Chief Executive 475,000 494,000 525,000 6.3% Jann Brown Managing Director and CFO 400,000 416,000 427,000 2.6% Dr Mike Watts Deputy Chief Executive 435,000 452,000 464,000 2.7% In setting the above salaries for the Executive Directors, the Committee took into account the standard increase to basic pay across the Group below senior management level and also utilised objective benchmarking giving up-to-date information on remuneration practice within a comparator group of similar companies within the oil and gas sector and companies with a similar market capitalisation.
It should, however, be noted that whilst the Committee considers market data useful, it does not place undue emphasis on it and exercises its own judgement in determining pay levels.
Benefits available to the Executive Directors during 2012 comprised a company car, permanent health insurance, private health insurance and death in service benefit of up to four times annual basic salary.
Annual cash bonus scheme During 2012, Cairn operated annual cash bonus schemes for all employees and Executive Directors.
For all participants, as in prior years, bonus awards were based on individual and Company performance measures.
Individual performance was measured through the Companys performance management system.
Company performance measures were based on annually defined KPIs.
Details of the KPIs for 2012 are provided on pages 2528 the broad categories and ascribed weightings for the bonus plan are set out below.
However, some of the specific targets applicable to this arrangement for 2012 are commercially sensitive and have not therefore been fully disclosed in detail.
The maximum level of bonus award for the Executive Directors and certain PDMRs for 2012 was 100% of annual salary as at date of award.
The Remuneration Committee has introduced clawback provisions into the Executive Directors bonus scheme.
These rules which apply to awards in respect of 2012 and subsequent financial years may be operated by the Committee where, in the period of three years from the end of the period to which the bonus relates, it becomes aware of either a material misstatement of the Companys financial results or an error in the calculation of performance metrics.

2 The above bonuses were paid in cash to the directors in question shortly after their determination by the Remuneration Committee.
No part of the awards was deferred.
The Remuneration Committee considered that these payments under the annual bonus scheme appropriately reflected both the level of achievement against the objective KPIs and the very good general progress made by the Company during the year in building its portfolio following the sale of a majority shareholding in Cairn India Limited to Vedanta Resources plc and the subsequent return of $3.5 billion in cash to shareholders, with a focus on adding exploration, appraisal and development opportunities which have the potential to deliver material growth and value for shareholders.
The KPIs set for 2012 were consequently reflective of the early stages in the value creation cycle and focused in particular on three core strategic objectives: delivering a sustainable business, maintaining a balanced portfolio with significant growth potential and achieving operational excellence.
"Long-Term Incentives Introduction In order to encourage Executive Directors and other selected senior employees to deliver superior levels of long-term performance for the benefit of shareholders, the Companys policy since 1999 has been to provide these individuals with share incentives under a Long Term Incentive Plan or ""LTIP""."
"The current arrangement is the Cairn Energy PLC Long Term Incentive Plan 2009 ""2009 LTIP"", which was approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 19 May 2009."
As at 1 January 2012, there were no unvested awards outstanding under any other LTIPs previously operated by the Company.
The basic structure of the 2009 LTIP that was operated during 2012 can be summarised as follows: 2009 LTIP Overview of scheme structure during 2012 Executive Directors Scheme Description Summary of performance conditions Maximum award levels 2009 LTIP The 2009 LTIP enables Executive Directors Award vesting is determined by comparing Value of ordinary shares awarded to a and selected senior employees to be the growth in TSR of the Company with participant in any financial year is subject granted conditional awards over ordinary the TSR of a comparator group, which for to a limit of 300% of his her basic salary.

Unaudited information continued Elements of Executive Directors Remuneration Package for 2012 continued Pages 8183 contain a more detailed description of the LTIP performance conditions that will determine the extent to which currently outstanding awards under the 2009 LTIP including those granted during 2012, details of which are set out below will vest at the end of the applicable performance period.
On vesting of outstanding awards under the 2009 LTIP, only 50% of the ordinary shares to which the holder has become entitled are released to him her immediately, with the remaining 50% normally being released after a further period of one year.
Finally, it should be noted that the Committee has introduced clawback provisions into the 2009 LTIP which apply to all awards granted to Executive Directors in 2012 and subsequent financial years.
These rules may be operated by the Committee where, in the period of three years from the end of the applicable performance period, it becomes aware of either a material misstatement of the Companys financial results or an error in the calculation of performance metrics.
2009 LTIP Awards granted during the year On 14 June 2012, the following awards under the 2009 LTIP were granted to Executive Directors: Face value of Vesting maximum % of face value that Vesting determined by Individual Basis of award granted award, 000 as % of face value would vest at threshold performance over Simon Thomson 3 times salary of 494,000 1,482 133% 20% Three years until Jann Brown 3 times salary of 416,000 1,248 133% 20% 13 June 2015 Dr Mike Watts 3 times salary of 452,000 1,356 133% 20% 2009 LTIP Awards vesting during the year On 28 May 2012, the three-year performance period applicable to the awards granted under the 2009 LTIP on 29 May 2009 came to an end.
Thereafter, the Remuneration Committee assessed the relevant performance conditions.
The results of this assessment can be summarised as follows: Performance measure % of award subject to measure Performance achieved 2009 2012 % of award vested Relative TSR performance against a comparator group of 100% Cairns TSR over the period ranked 0% 19 companies with 20% vesting at median, 100% at upper decile below the median company in the and on a sliding scale in between.
"Opportunity for additional ""multiplier"" of up to 1.33 to be applied for upper decile performance."
Notes: 1 Further details of the performance conditions that applied to the above awards are set out on pages 8183.
2 At various points in the period 29 May 2009 to 28 May 2012, the Committee was required to determine the treatment of those comparator group companies that were the subject of takeover transactions.
No other discretions were exercised by the Remuneration Committee during or after the relevant performance period.
3 The calculations used to inform the Committees determinations in relation to the above awards were carried out by Cairn and independently verified by Ernst & Young LLP.
"Other LTIPs formerly used At the start of the year, directors also held certain awards under the following historic share incentive arrangements operated by the Company: h The Cairn Energy PLC Long Term Incentive Plan 2006 ""2006 LTIP""."
"h The Cairn Energy PLC Replacement Long Term Incentive Plan ""Replacement LTIP""."
As at 1 January 2012, all awards under the 2006 LTIP and Replacement LTIP had already vested in accordance with the terms of the applicable performance conditions.
As a result, the outstanding entitlements of participants in these plans at that time related solely to shares that were subject to a post-vesting holding period.
In the case of the 2006 LTIP, the vested shares were due to be released in December 2012 one year after the date of vesting and in the case of the Replacement LTIP, in January 2013.
During January 2012, the Committee was required to assess the impact on the above awards of the US$3.5 billion return of cash and associated share capital consolidation, details of which were provided in a Circular to shareholders dated 10 January 2012.
For the reasons that were set out in both the Circular and last years Directors Remuneration Report, the Committee decided to exercise a pre-existing discretionary power contained within the rules of the 2006 LTIP and the Replacement LTIP to terminate the holding period applicable to these awards with effect from and conditionally upon the passing of the appropriate resolutions at the shareholder meeting approving the return of cash.
As a consequence, all withheld shares under the 2006 LTIP and Replacement LTIP were released to the relevant participants on 30 January 2012.
All the shares that were released to the Executive Directors as a consequence of the above decision were, in fact, retained by the individuals and continue to be so held by them.
It Is also important to highlight that the Committee continued to monitor the forfeiture provisions that could have operated in relation to shares acquired by the Executive Directors under the Replacement LTIP and, in January 2013 being the expiry of the original holding period applicable to that scheme, noted that no relevant events or circumstances had come to light.
Pension arrangements As highlighted in the Policy Section of this report, the Company operates a defined contribution, non-contributory group personal pension plan which is open to all UK permanent employees.
The Company contributes 10% of basic annual salary 15% in respect of senior executives on behalf of all qualifying employees.
The Company also has a Pension Committee which meets on a regular basis to assess the performance and suitability of the Companys pension arrangements.

Unaudited information continued Elements of Executive Directors Remuneration Package for 2012 continued Jann Brown is a member of the Company plan and, during 2012, received a contribution equal to 15% of her annual basic salary.
During the year, Dr Mike Watts received an amount equivalent to 15% of his annual basic salary in the form of additional salary, as his pension arrangements are fully funded.
Simon Thomson has an individual personal pension plan and, during 2012, received a contribution from the Company equal to 15% of his annual basic salary.
Finally, the Company is also the principal employer for a Small Self-Administered Scheme.
Sir Bill Gammell is the sole member of this scheme.
The Company is not contractually obliged to make any contributions into this scheme on behalf of Sir Bill Gammell and did not do so during the year.
"All Employee Share Schemes During 2012 Share Incentive Plan 2010 In order to encourage increased levels of long-term share ownership amongst its general employee population, the Company launched an HM Revenue and Customs approved share incentive plan ""SIP"" in April 2010."
The SIP provides eligible employees, including the Executive Directors, with the following benefits: h Partnership shares employees can authorise deductions of up to 1,500 per tax year from pre-tax salary, which are then used to acquire ordinary shares on their behalf.
h Matching shares the Company can award further free shares to all participants who acquire partnership shares on the basis of up to two matching shares for every one partnership share purchased.
For the tax year 2012 2013, the Company awarded two matching shares for every one partnership share purchased and intends to continue using this award ratio for the tax year 2013 2014. h Free shares employees can be given up to 3,000 worth of ordinary shares free in each tax year.
On 15 June 2012, an award of free shares was made to employees, including the Executive Directors.
As the SIP is an all-employee arrangement, no performance conditions are imposed in relation to any matching or free shares awarded pursuant to its terms.
Details of the shares purchased by and awarded to the Executive Directors under the SIP during the course of the year are as follows: SIP Movements in Executive Directors holdings during 2012 Total SIP shares held Partnership shares Matching shares following share capital Free shares awarded on awarded on 15 June 2012 awarded on 15 June 2012 Total SIP shares held at consolidation on 15 June 2012 at a price of at a price of 2.7986 at a price of 2.7986 Total SIP shares held at 1 Director 1 January 2012 6 February 2012 2.80 per share per share per share 31 December 2012 Simon Thomson 3,652 1,438 1,071 536 1,072 4,117 Jann Brown 3,652 1,438 1,071 536 1,072 4,117 Dr Mike Watts 3,652 1,438 1,071 536 1,072 4,117 Notes: 1 All participants in the SIP including the above Executive Directors are the beneficial owners of the shares purchased by and awarded to them under the plan.
As a consequence, they benefited from the return of cash and were subject to the associated share capital consolidation that was approved by the Companys shareholders at the general meeting held on 30 January 2012.
The total number of shares held by each of the current Executive Directors under the SIP is included in their beneficial shareholdings disclosed in the Directors Report on page 52.
"Share option schemes for other employees during 2012 Introduction The Company currently operates the following share option schemes for employees below senior management level: h 2009 Approved Share Option Plan ""2009 Approved Option Plan""."
"h 2009 Unapproved Share Option Plan ""2009 Unapproved Option Plan""."
"h Replacement Share Option Plan ""Replacement Option Plan""."
"h 2003 Approved Share Option Plan ""2003 Option Plan""."
"h 2002 Unapproved Share Option Plan ""2002 Option Plan""."
Brief summaries of these arrangements are set out below.
It should, however, be noted that none of the Companys Executive Directors participate in any of the above schemes and it is not intended that options will be granted to them under these arrangements in the future.
2009 Approved Option Plan and 2009 Unapproved Option Plan The 2009 Approved Option Plan and the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan, both of which were approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 19 May 2009, are used to grant market value options to less senior employees of the Group.
The principal difference between these two arrangements is that the approval of HM Revenue and Customs was sought and obtained for the 2009 Approved Option Plan, whereas no such approval was sought in relation to the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan.
Options granted under the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan and 2009 Approved Option Plan are normally exercisable between three and ten years following their grant but only if and to the extent that specified performance conditions have been satisfied.

Unaudited information continued Share option schemes for other employees during 2012 continued The combined value of ordinary shares over which options may be granted to a participant under the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan and 2009 Approved Option Plan in any financial year is subject to a limit of 200% of his her basic salary although a 300% of salary limit can be applied to an individual by the Remuneration Committee in exceptional circumstances.
The first options under the 2009 Unapproved Option Plan and 2009 Approved Option Plan were granted on 29 May 2009, with further awards being made to selected employees during 2010, 2011 and 2012.
A summary of the performance conditions that will determine the extent to which these options vest at the end of the applicable performance period is provided on page 83.
Replacement Option Plan The Replacement Option Plan, which was approved by shareholders at an EGM on 21 December 2009, was introduced to facilitate the conversion of certain options that had previously been granted by the Company under the Cairn Energy PLC Share Option Plan 2006.
Converted options granted under the Replacement Option Plan comprise conditional rights to acquire ordinary shares for a specified price, the vesting of which was dependent on both continued employment with the Group and the extent to which pre-determined performance conditions were met over a specified period of three years.
All outstanding options granted under the Replacement Option Plan had vested prior to the start of 2012.
No further awards will be granted pursuant to this arrangement in the future.
2002 Option Plan and 2003 Option Plan The 2002 Option Plan and 2003 Option Plan both of which have subsequently been superseded were formerly used by the Company to grant options to a broad selection of employees in the Group.
Although a number of options granted under these plans currently subsist, no further awards will be granted pursuant to their terms.
A summary of the performance conditions that must be satisfied before outstanding awards under these plans can be exercised is provided on page 83.
Share Ownership Requirements for Executive Directors The Remuneration Committee believes that a significant level of shareholding by the Executive Directors will strengthen the alignment of their interests with those of shareholders.
Accordingly, during 2012 a formal share ownership policy was adopted under which the Executive Directors are required to build up and maintain a target holding equal to 100% of base salary.
The policy also provides that, until such a holding is achieved, an Executive Director is obliged to retain shares with a value equal to 50% of the net of tax gain arising from any vesting or exercise under the Companys share incentive plans.
Page 80 shows the extent to which the requirements of the above policy were satisfied as at 31 December 2012.
Dilution of Share Capital Pursuant to Share Plans During 2012 In any ten-year rolling period, the number of ordinary shares which may be issued in connection with the Companys discretionary share plans cannot exceed 5% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital.
In addition, in any ten-year rolling period, the number of ordinary shares which may be issued in connection with all the Companys employee share schemes whether discretionary or otherwise cannot exceed 10% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital.
For the purposes of operating both the above limits, the number of shares issued prior to 6 February 2012 in connection with options and awards is adjusted to reflect the share capital consolidation that became effective on that date.
It should also be noted that all shares acquired by or awarded to participants under the SIP are existing ordinary shares purchased in the market.
As a result, the SIP does not involve the issue of new shares or the transfer of treasury shares.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors Fees for 2012 The Chairmans and Non-Executive Directors fees for 2012 are set out in full in the remuneration table on page 80.
The annual rate of fees payable to the Chairman, Sir Bill Gammell, for 2012 was originally set at 213,000.
Following a review of fee levels paid to the Chairman that was informed by external advice, his fees were subsequently increased to 230,000 per annum with effect from 6 March 2012.
The annual fees for 2012 for the other Non-Executive Directors were 70,000.
In addition to this, an annual fee of 10,000 was payable to Iain McLaren for his role as Chairman of the Audit Committee.
The 10,000 annual fee for Chair of the Remuneration Committee was shared, on a pro-rata basis, by Dr James Buckee and M. Jacqueline Sheppard QC based on the proportion of the year that they fulfilled that role.
None of the Non-Executive Directors has any conflict of interest which has not been disclosed to the Board in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association and the Board is satisfied that each of the Non-Executive Directors commits sufficient time to fulfil his her duties as a director of the Company.
Service Contracts Letters of Appointment The Executive Directors service contracts and Non-Executive Directors letters of appointment, further details of which are given in the table on page 79, are available for inspection on request and will be available for inspection before and during the AGM to be held on 16 May 2013: 78 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 1.

In particular, they will only vest if, and to the extent that, the applicable performance conditions have been satisfied.
2 As more fully disclosed on page 76, the awards granted on 29 May 2009 lapsed in full shortly following the expiry of the performance period.
Each of the above awards will ordinarily vest on or shortly after the expiry of the applicable performance period, but only to the extent that the performance conditions described on pages 8183 of this report are satisfied.
No variations to the terms and conditions of any 2009 LTIP awards were made during the year.
Overview of Share Scheme Performance Conditions Introduction The vesting of each award and option granted under the Companys various share schemes is conditional on the achievement of performance conditions determined by the Remuneration Committee at the relevant date of grant.
Set out below is a summary of the conditions applicable to awards and options that were outstanding during the year.
In the case of the Companys LTIP being the arrangement in which the Executive Directors participate, the conditions principally relate to the TSR performance of the Company.
These TSR measures were selected by the Remuneration Committee on the basis that they improve shareholder alignment and are consistent with the Companys objective of delivering long-term value to shareholders.
On the expiry of the performance period applicable to an award or option, the calculations necessary to determine the extent to which the relevant conditions have been satisfied are subject to independent verification by Ernst & Young LLP.
2009 LTIP In the case of all outstanding awards under the 2009 LTIP including those granted during 2012, the extent to which they vest will be determined by comparing the TSR of the Company over a three year performance period with the TSR of a share in each company in a comparator group.
The table on page 82 shows the comparator groups for each tranche of awards granted under the 2009 LTIP to Executive Directors.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 81 Strategic Operational Leadership & Financial Additional Review Review Governance Statements Information Directors Remuneration Report Continued 2.
At the end of the performance period, each company in the comparator group will be listed in order of TSR performance to produce a ranking table.
The vesting of awards will then take place as follows: Ranking of Company against the comparator group Percentage of ordinary shares comprised in Award that vest Below median 0% Median 20% Upper decile i. e. top 10% 100% Between median and upper decile 20% 100% on a straight line basis In order to make sure that the 2009 LTIP encourages and rewards exceptional performance, the performance conditions attaching to awards also provide that, where the TSR of the Company produces a ranking at or above the upper decile level in the appropriate comparator group, a participant will then be given the opportunity to increase the percentage of his her award that vests through the application of a multiplier that is linked to the TSR actually achieved over the performance period.
The way in which this multiplier will operate is as follows: Multiplier applied to determine the number of ordinary shares that actually vest TSR of the Company over the performance period 1 50% or less 1.33 100% or more 1 1.33 on a straight line basis Between 50% and 100% 82 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 2.
Audited Information continued Details of directors remuneration for the year continued However, notwithstanding the performance of the Company against the above targets, no part of any award will vest unless the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that there has been an overall satisfactory and sustained improvement in the performance of the Company as a whole over the performance period.
2009 Approved Option Plan and 2009 Unapproved Option Plan All options granted under the above arrangements are subject to a TSR growth target measured over a three year performance period.
Under this target, vesting will occur as follows: Average annual compound growth in TSR of the Company over the performance period Percentage of ordinary shares comprised in option that vests Less than 5% 0% 5% 50% 10% or more 100% More than 5% but less than 10% 50% 100% on a straight line basis Notwithstanding the above condition, no part of an option granted under the 2009 Approved Option Plan or 2009 Unapproved Option Plan will vest unless the TSR of the Company over the performance period is sufficient to place it at or above the median level in the same comparator group of companies that is used for the purposes of the 2009 LTIP see table on page 82.
2002 Option Plan and 2003 Option Plan In the case of all outstanding options under the 2002 Option Plan and 2003 Option Plan, the option holder may only exercise his her award if Cairns share price has increased by 5% on a compound basis over the period from the date of grant to the date of exercise: and the percentage increase in Cairns share price over the same period is at least equal to or greater than the percentage movement in the FTSE Oil and Gas Index.
