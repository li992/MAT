R olls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2012 56 Governance Remuneration committee report Remuneration and opportunities for our employees All employees worldwide have the opportunity to benefit from our success through participation in our global bonus and share plans.
All employees who were with us throughout 2012 will be receiving a bonus of at least two weeks pay as a result of our 2012 performance.
Around a half of our employees currently participate in our global save-as-you-earn ShareSave plan which gives all employees the opportunity to benefit from share price growth.
In February 2013, two of our ShareSave plans matured a three-year plan granted in 2009 at an option price of 387 pence and a five-year plan granted in 2007 at an option price of 416.1 pence against a closing price on 1 February 2013 of 971 pence.
In addition, more than 6,000 employees participate in our SharePurchase and ShareBonus plans which allow employees to purchase shares on a regular basis and to convert bonus payments into shares.
The work of the committee during 2012 In February 2012, the committee endorsed the out-turn for bonus and long-term incentive plans.
It also considered a benchmarking report by Deloitte LLP and assessments of personal performance before approving salary increases for senior executives.
The committee set bonus targets for 2012 and targets for the Performance Share Plan 2012-2014 and agreed the participation of senior executives in those plans.
It also considered a draft of the directors remuneration report which it agreed to recommend to the Board for approval.
In November, the committee considered the way the bonus pool would be determined for 2013.
The committee agreed revised terms of reference and considered the BIS consultation on remuneration reporting.
It agreed that consideration would be given to early adoption of some of the disclosure requirements within the draft regulations in the 2012 annual report.
In December, the committee considered the potential out-turns for the 2012 bonus, the all-employee bonus scheme and the vesting of PSP 2010 2012.
In summary We support the clear message on executive remuneration sent by BIS that: generous rewards for leading executives are not an issue where executive remuneration is well-structured, clearly linked to the strategic objectives of a company, and which rewards executives that contribute to the long-term success of that company.
The committee is very pleased that once again we are disclosing and explaining the compensation arrangements for Rolls-Royce executives against a background of excellent business performance.
