Yours sincerely Tony Reading Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 55 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Laird PLC Governance Directors remuneration report for the year to 31 December 2012 Introduction The role of the Remuneration Committee the Committee is to recommend to the Board the Companys general policy on remuneration and in particular to determine the remuneration for the Chairman and the executive directors.

The Committee has adopted the principles of good governance relating to directors remuneration as set out in The UK Corporate Governance Code and also complies with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and with the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and the regulations thereunder the Regulations.
The Regulations require that the Companys auditor should report to shareholders on certain parts of this Report and state whether in its opinion those parts of it have been properly prepared in accordance with the above Regulations.
A resolution to approve this Report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company on 3 May 2013 and details are set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting.
This Report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee on behalf of the Board.
The Companys remuneration policy and practices are kept under regular review by the Committee which consults with the Companys major shareholders and their representative bodies as appropriate.
The Remuneration Committee The members of the Remuneration Committee are appointed by the Board and the membership is reviewed at least annually.

All members are independent non-executive directors, other than Nigel Keen who undertook the role of Executive Chairman whilst the Company sought a new Chief Executive.
Nigel Keen stepped down from his executive role on 13 August 2012.
The Board considers it essential thatthe Chairman of the Board be involved in setting remuneration policy and therefore he is a member of the Remuneration Committee.
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
During the year, Deloitte LLP provided independent external professional advice to the Remuneration Committee.
Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
Deloitte also provide internal audit services to Laird PLC.
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that no conict of interest exists in the provision of these services.
Deloittes performance was formally reviewed by the Committee in December 2012 and the Committee was satisfied with their performance.
During the year, the Remuneration Committee also sought theviews of David Lockwood whobecame Chief Executive on 13 August 2012.
The Chief Executive is given notice of all meetings and, at the request of the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, attends the meetings.
The Chief Executive may request that he attends and speaks at Committee meetings.
In normal circumstances, the Chief Executive will be consulted on general policy matters and matters concerning the other executive directors and employees.
The written Terms of Reference of the Remuneration Committee are available on the Companys website and from the Company on request.
The Committee met seven times in 2012.
Details of the attendance at Committee meetings are given on page 50.
56 Laird PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Business review Operating review Financial review Governance Financial accounts Additional information Policy report Remuneration policy The Remuneration Committee has established a policy on the remuneration of the executive directors and the Chairman: and the Board has established a policy on the remuneration ofthe other non-executive directors.
Executive directors The policy for the executive directors is to structure the remuneration package so that no single aspect dominates.
Therefore there is a mixture of xed remuneration and performance-related remuneration, with the latter split between annual bonuses, with a range of different measures, and longer-term share incentives, which use more than one performance target.
Further details are set out below.
The table below sets out the key elements of the policy for executive directors.
Element Purpose and link to strategy Operation Performance measures Base salary Core element of remuneration, Reviewed annually, normally in July, N A set at a level which is sufciently taking into account a number of competitive to recruit and retain factors including market practice, management of the appropriate the individuals performance, the calibre and experience performance of Laird and other pay structures within Laird Benets Support individuals in carrying out Reviewed periodically to ensure N A their roles, including the provision benets remain market competitive of a car or car allowance and health insurance Annual bonus Incentivises the achievement of Awarded annually, with the level Performance is assessed over one arangeofshort-term performance of payout determined by the Committee financial year, based on achievement targetsthat are key to the success of following the year end, based on of a range of financial and strategic theCompany performance against targets targets and having regard to environmental, social and governance issues and the overall risk prole of Laird Long-term incentives Incentivise the achievement Awards generally vest three years after Performance is generally assessed of long-term financial performance grant, subject to the achievement of over a three year performance period, and sustainable returns to shareholders performance conditions based on achievement of targets in a way that aligns the interests of designed to incentivise delivering executivesand shareholders sustainable returns to shareholders and the underlying financial performance of the business Chairman The table below sets out the key elements of the policy for the Chairman as decided by the Committee.

David Lockwoods and Jonathan Silvers service agreements are dated 9 July 2012 and 8 March 2004 respectively.
In line with the Companys policy, the executive directors service agreements are not for a xed term and provide for twelve months written notice of termination from either party.
The Companys policy on termination is to comply with the contractual terms and conditions set out in the service agreement.
The Company may, at its election, make a payment in lieu of notice.
Thepayment would be calculated as the total of the directors base salary plus the value of his benets, in each case by reference to the period of the unexpired notice of termination.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts but are appointed under letters of appointment which provide for a review afteran initial three year term.
The Chairmans appointment, which is subject to the rotation provisions of the Articles of Association, may be terminated by either party giving not less than six months notice.
Further details are set out on page 63.
After the initial three year term, the appointment is reviewed and, in the past, the appointment would be renewed for a further three year term.
However, due to the change in The UK Corporate Governance Code, which requires annual re-election of directors, the Board decided that the term of appointment for a non-executive director would now be one year after an initial three year term.
Professor Michael Kelly, Tony Reading, Sir Christopher Hum and Nigel Keen, whose terms came up for review during the year, were re-appointed for one year terms, subject to annual review thereafter.
Theappointment of a non-executive director is subject to termination if he or she ceases to be qualied to act as a director of the Company: if he or she resigns by written notice: or if he or she is not re-elected under the Companys Articles of Association.
Dates of appointment are shown on page 45.
Pay and conditions of the wider workforce In setting the remuneration policy for directors, the pay and conditions of other employees of Laird is taken into account, including any base salary increases awarded.
However, with 81% of employees in Asia, 10% in North America and 9% in Europe, only broad trends are considered.
In 2012 salary increases for management level employees ranged from 0 to 8% depending on several factors, including the region where they work and individual performance.
Greater increases were awarded to certain individuals as a result ofpromotions or significant increases in the scale or geographic scope of their responsibilities.
Shareholder views The Committee takes the views of the shareholders very seriously and these views have been inuential in shaping remuneration policy andpractice.
Shareholder views are considered when evaluating and setting on-going remuneration strategy and the Committee commits toconsulting with shareholders prior to any significant changes to its remuneration policy.
In February 2012, we consulted with key shareholders on the performance conditions for awards under the LTIP and Option Plan and further consultation has now been carried out in relation to the new share plan to be recommended to shareholders at the 2013 Annual GeneralMeeting.
Implementation report Executive directors Directors leaving the Board Peter Hill stepped down as Chief Executive with effect from 25 November 2011, due to ill health.
Under the terms of his contract of employment, Mr Hill was entitled to remain in employment on his existing salary and benets until 25 November 2012.
Subsequently Mr Hills doctor certied him as t for work and a compromise agreement to terminate his contract was signed on 10 August 2012.
Under the terms of Mr Hills service contract dated 8 March 2004, the Company was entitled to make a payment in lieu of notice of one years salary and benets on termination.
The total compensation paid to Peter Hill for the year was 728,817 which was based on salary and benets payable under his contract of employment pro-rated for the period from 10 August 2012 to 30 April 2013, as follows: Base salary 438,814 25% of base salary in lieu of bonus 109,703 40% of base salary in lieu of pension contribution 175,525 Cash in lieu of medical benets 4,775 728,817 His awards under the LTIP and Option Plan were dealt with in accordance with the respective plan rules and details are set out on pages 64 and 65.
The total gain on options and LTIPs exercised during the year was 1,742,064.
58 Laird PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Business review Operating review Financial review Governance Financial accounts Additional information Executive directors remuneration The executive directors receive base salary, annual performance incentive awards up to a maximum percentage of base salary, other benets, and long-term performance awards which are reviewed annually by the Remuneration Committee.
Details of pension and or pay in lieu of pension are shown on page 62.
On a regular basis, the Committee requests its independent consultants to undertake a benchmarking exercise on base pay.
The most recent benchmarking exercise was undertaken in 2012 and covered all aspects of the remuneration package for the executive directors and other senior executives.
The previous benchmarking exercise was carried out in December 2010.
The remuneration package for the new Chief Executive was carefully considered and advice was sought from Deloitte oncurrent market practice.
Performance linked incentives are a key component of the total remuneration package.
In addition to the annual performance incentiveaward, the Remuneration Committee makes awards under the Companys LTIP and Option Plan.
A summary of these arrangements is set out on pages 59 to 61 below.
The Committee believes that a combination of share options and LTIP awards for senior executives is an appropriate way of providing the incentive to create substantial improvement in the Companys performance in a way that aligns the interests of executives and shareholders.
Benets comprise the provision of a car or car allowance, life, disability and health insurance, participation in the annual performance incentiveaward scheme and membership of a pension scheme or pay in lieu of pension provision.
Performance incentive awards and benets in kind are not pensionable and are not taken into account in determining payments in lieu of pension.
Base salary Jonathan Silvers salary has not been increased since 1 July 2008 and will next be reviewed in July 2013.
Annual performance incentive awards The maximum award, for exceptional performance, that could be earned for 2012 was 100% of base salary.
Target awards were 75% ofbase salary.
In David Lockwoods case the bonus is pro-rated from the date employment commenced.
The award criteria established for2012 were based on the following: i underlying profit before tax 45% of the maximum : ii working capital metrics 10% of the maximum : iii the achievement of criteria designed to assess and drive performance against a number of key, measurable strategic objectives for theCompany, including those relating to environmental, health and safety 20% of the maximum : and iv exceptional performance 25% of the maximum.
The specic criteria used above are not disclosed for reasons of commercial sensitivity, but in the case of iii above include, inter alia, the successful implementation of Lairds strategy: the implementation of a new organisational structure: organic growth and development of thecustomer base.
The profit target was based on a combination of budgets and market estimates for the year.
In determining the awards for 2012, the Remuneration Committee took into account that underlying profit before tax in 2012 was 17% higher than in 2011, and that operating cash conversion, after capital expenditure, in 2012 was excellent at 109%, notwithstanding the significant growth in profits in the year.
David Lockwoods bonus was 47.5% of base salary reecting that he was not employed for the full year.
Jonathan Silvers bonus was 70% of base salary 2011, 75%.
Long-term incentives share plans The share incentive plans currently operated by the Company for the executive directors are the LTIP and Option Plan.
Each time awards are made under the LTIP and the Option Plan, the Committee carefully considers the performance measures to be used, including whether to use non-financial Key Performance Indicators.
For the awards made in 2012 it was concluded that both Total Shareholder Return TSR and underlying Earnings Per Share EPS be used for both plans and that they were the most appropriate measures for aligning the objectives of executives with those of shareholders.
These are described in more detail below.
The LTIP and Option Plan may use either market purchased shares or newly issued shares, provided that no new shares may be issued if, as aresult, the number of shares issued or capable of issue pursuant to grants of awards made within the preceding ten year period under theseplans and all other share plans operated by the Company would exceed 10% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital from timeto time.
59 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Laird PLC Governance Directors remuneration report for the year to 31 December 2012 Both of these plans will expire in May 2013 and the Remuneration Committee recommends that a new Long-Term Incentive Plan for the award of both options and LTIPs be put in place, as it believes these are the most appropriate way of providing the incentive to create substantial improvement in the Companys continuing long-term performance in a way that aligns the interests of executives and shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee felt it was important to take the opportunity of the share schemes coming up for renewal to introduce some new best practice terms and therefore the key changes proposed for the new Plan are the introduction of a 5% in ten year dilution limit: a reduced threshold for vesting at 25% currently 30% : and the introduction of claw back provisions.
Further details of the proposed new share Plan are set out in the Companys Notice of Annual General Meeting.
a The LTIP The LTIP involves the award of shares which only vest after the achievement of demanding performance targets measured over three years.
Executive directors are eligible for a maximum annual award of shares of one times base salary.
In setting the level of awards, the Remuneration Committee takes into account options granted to executive directors under the Option Plan in the same financial year.
Awards under the LTIP take the form of nil cost options or conditional awards in order to comply with US tax legislation to be satisfied by shares from the Laird 1990 Employee benefit Trust the Trust purchased in the market.
Further details on the Trust are in note 31 on page 108.
The level of awards in 2012 was considered by the Committee and the awards made to each director equated to 100% of base salary 2011, 100%.
In deciding this, the Committee took into account the level of award under the Option Plan described below.
These awards promote the common interests of the executive directors and shareholders in the delivery of above market growth in shareholder value in futureyears.
In accordance with the rules of the LTIP, outstanding awards may vest and or become exercisable before their normal vesting date inthe event of a change of control of the Company.
The rules of the LTIP also permit the waiver of performance criteria in certain limited circumstances, such as a change of control, death or retirement.
The amount charged to the income statement during the year in respect of the LTIP awards granted to the executive directors was 198,000 2011, 498,000.
The fair value for accounting purposes was calculated as 68.9% of the face value of the awards made in 2012. b The Option Plan The maximum possible grant of options to executive directors and other employees is over shares with a market value at the time of grant of up to one times base salary in any one year and up to two times base salary in special circumstances, such as the recruitment or promotion to a key management position.
When granting options, the Remuneration Committee takes into account both the level of awards made to executive directors under the LTIP and the prevailing share price at the time of grant.
In accordance with the rules of the Option Plan, outstanding options may vest and become exercisable before their normal vesting date in the event of a change of control of the Company.
The rules of the Option Plan also permit the waiver of performance criteria in certain limited circumstances, such as a change of control, death or retirement.
The maximum level of awards under the Option Plan is normally one times base salary, however, the Remuneration Committee considers the level of awards in the light of the Companys business performance and the then current share price level when it decides on the number of share options to be awarded.
In 2012 the Finance Directors award equated to 75% of base salary and the new Chief Executive was awarded options equivalent to 100% of his base salary.
The Remuneration Committee considers that these awards, together with awards under the LTIP described above, incentivise executive directors in the delivery of above market growth in shareholder value in future years.
The amount charged to the income statement in respect of the share options granted to the executive directors was 77,000 2011,229,000.
The fair value for accounting purposes was calculated at 31.8% of the face value of grants made in 2012.
Performance conditions for awards made in 2012 under the LTIP and Option Plan Performance conditions are measured over a single three year period and there is no provision for re-testing, therefore the awards lapse iftheperformance targets are not met.
The Committee consulted with key shareholders on the performance conditions for the 2012 awards under the LTIP and Option Plan.
Two measures were used: achievement of a Total Shareholder Return TSR target and an underlying Earnings per Share EPS target.
For LTIP awards made in 2012, 75% is based on achievement of the TSR target and 25% is based on achievement of the EPS target.
For awards under the Option Plan, 75% is based on EPS and 25% on TSR.
The EPS and TSR conditions are set out below.
60 Laird PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Business review Operating review Financial review Governance Financial accounts Additional information TSR condition In 2011, the following list of 20 companies was selected as the comparator group to be used for measuring TSR and the same list was used forthe 2012 awards.
Amphenol Invensys Sanmina TT Electronics AVX Meggitt Senior TTM Technologies Bodycote Molex Smiths Group Ultra Electronics CSR Morgan Crucible Spectris Vishay Intertechnology e2v Technologies Oxford Instruments Spirent Communications Wolfson Microelectronics The level of vesting of the applicable portion of the award 75% of the award under the LTIP: 25% of the award under the Option Plan is dependent on Lairds relative TSR performance over three years against this group of companies, as follows: Total Shareholder Return Amount of award vesting for TSR measure performance level % Upper quartile Full vesting Median to upper quartile Pro-rata between 30% and full vesting Below median Nil In addition, the TSR portion of the award will not vest unless the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the Companys underlying financial performance.
The TSR target for Jonathan Silver will be measured over a three year period from 2 April 2012 to 2 April 2015 and for David Lockwood from 13August 2012 to 13 August 2015.
EPS condition The level of vesting of the applicable portion of the award 75% of the award under the Option Plan: 25% of the award under the LTIP is dependent on Lairds EPS performance for the 2014 financial year, as follows: Applicable performance target: Level of vesting in 2015 for EPS measure Average annual growth in continuing earnings per share Threshold 30% vesting RPI 5% p. a Full vesting RPI 10% p. a There is pro-rata vesting on a straight-line basis where EPS is between the above two targets.
Earnings per share is calculated with reference to underlying earnings per share before exceptional items, the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, deferred tax on acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the gain or loss on disposal of businesses, the impact arising from the fair valuing of financial instruments and acquisition transaction costs as stated in the 2014 Annual Report and Accounts.
Vesting of awards made in 2010 under the LTIP and Option Plan 81.85% of the awards made under the LTIP in 2010 will vest on 19 April 2013 as the performance criteria for total shareholder return to 31December 2012 was partially met as Lairds TSR to 31 December 2012 was 78% compared with a median of 49% for the FTSE 250.
Options granted under the Option Plan in 2010 also partially met the performance criteria of 16.6 pence EPS for 30% vesting and 21.3 pence EPS for full vesting and 67.2% will become exercisable on 2 August 2013.
61 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Laird PLC Governance Directors remuneration report for the year to 31 December 2012 Pensions Jonathan Silver is a member of a UK Group contributory dened benets scheme.
The main benets are: on pension retirement at age 60, amaximum pension of two-thirds final salary excluding bonuses and other benets dependent on service: on death in retirement, a dependants pension of 60% of the members pension: on death in service, a lump sum of four times salary and a dependants pension of 20% of salary or 60% of the members expected pension, if higher.
Pensions in payment for Jonathan Silver will increase by the lesser of the increase in the retail price index or 8.5% per annum compound.
Transfer values provided on leaving service do not include any allowances for discretionary benets.
Following the introduction of the A Day legislation in April 2006, Jonathan Silvers pension has ceased to accrue within the dened benets scheme.
In light of the Companys previous pension commitment to Jonathan Silver, he now receives a taxable salary supplement of 40% of base salary in lieu of future pension accrual under the pension scheme.
This payment in respect of Jonathan Silver is expected to reduce future pension risks for the Company.
Payments in lieu of pension provision are excluded from the calculation of any bonus entitlements and share scheme awards and are not included in the calculations in the table below.
David Lockwood receives a contribution to a personal pension scheme pay-in-lieu of pension of 25% of his base salary.
The former Chief Executive, Peter Hill, who ceased to be a director due to ill health in November 2011, reached age 60 in August 2012.
He transferred his pension benets from the dened benefit scheme to another scheme at a value agreed by the Pension Fund Trustees having taken actuarial advice.
Peter Hills benets in the dened benets scheme were subject to an earnings capand they were supplemented by an unfunded arrangement to maintain the same level of benets as if the earnings cap did not apply.
Since 1 July 2008, Peter Hill received a taxable salary supplement of 40% of base salary in lieu of future accrual of the unfunded arrangement.
The unfunded arrangement is now in payment from the Company.
Under the terms of Peter Hills contract of employment, he could continue to receive salary and benets for up to 12 months whilst on sick leave i. e. until 25 November 2012.
In the event, he ceased employment on 10 August 2012.

The Chairman does not attend discussions onhis own remuneration.
Non-executive directors Lairds policy is to establish and maintain a body of non-executive directors with a breadth of international skills and experience that is relevant to Lairds global businesses.
In this context, it is the Boards policy for the non-executive directors to be paid a level of fee that reects market conditions and is sufficient to attract individuals with appropriate knowledge and experience.
