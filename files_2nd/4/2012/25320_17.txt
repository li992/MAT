Directors Remuneration Report Directors Remuneration Report Compliance statement This report covers the reporting period from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012 and provides details of the Remuneration Committee and remuneration policy for the Company.
This is the Directors Remuneration Report of International Personal Finance plc the Company which has been prepared pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 420 of the Companies Act 2006 the Companies Act and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008.
In accordance with Section 439 of the Companies Act, an advisory resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the annual general meeting AGM of the Company to be held on 25 April 2013.
The detail in this report sets out how the remuneration principles have been applied in 2012.
We support fully the focus on transparency in the new disclosure regulations for UK listed companies proposed by BIS, which are due to take effect from October 2013.
The Company has, therefore, decided to structure the 2012 report to incorporate voluntarily as many of the proposed features as practicable this year.
Policy section Key principles of the remuneration policy The Committee is committed to establishing an appropriate, open and transparent remuneration policy, as this is key to driving business performance and aligning the interests of senior management and shareholders.
The policy applied by the Committee reects the need to attract, motivate and retain talent via remuneration at appropriate market levels, and recognises the need for prudence and effective risk management in its reward structures.
In setting the policy and making remuneration decisions, the Committee takes into account pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group as well as shareholder views.
The remuneration policy is founded on the following principles: s TARGET TOTAL REMUNERATION REmECTING EFFECTIVE PERFORMANCE WILL BE AROUND MARKET MEDIAN WITH REFERENCE to an assessment of comparable positions from a cross-section of companies drawn from a combination of relevant broad equity index, similar market capitalisation and broadly comparable sector prole: s WHERE PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED AT A CONSISTENTLY HIGH LEVEL TOTAL REMUNERATION ABOVE MARKET median will be appropriate to retain key talent: s THE lXED COMPONENT OF REMUNERATION SHOULD BE SUFlCIENT TO ALLOW FOR A FULLY mEXIBLE BONUS PLAN THERE WILL be no minimum bonus guarantees: s mEXIBLE ELEMENTS OF TOTAL REMUNERATION AT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT LEVEL ARE DESIGNED to ensure clear links to long-term performance, with suitably demanding targets aligned with the objective of creating sustainable shareholder value.
This means that a significant proportion of bonus will be deferred, and all share-based incentives will be subject to an appropriate vesting period, as determined by the Remuneration Committee: s NO ELEMENT OF REMUNERATION WILL BE DESIGNED OR APPLIED IN A WAY THAT IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE #OMPANY S values and goals, or in a way that encourages the taking of inappropriate risk: and s REMUNERATION PLANS WILL BE STRAIGHTFORWARD AND EASY TO ADMINISTER Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 55 Directors Remuneration Report continued Future policy table This section of our report describes the key components of the remuneration arrangements for executive directors and non-executive directors for 2013 onwards.

There are no provisions for compensation payable on early termination.
Executive directors Gerard Ryan has a service agreement dated 17 January 2012, when he became CEO Designate.
He became CEO following John Harnett leaving the Board on 31 March 2012.
David Broadbent has a service agreement dated 21 June 2007, as varied on 11 December 2009 and in December 2010.
Each of these service agreements is terminable upon one years notice from the relevant director or the Company.
The Company may terminate employment by making a payment in lieu of notice equivalent to the value of base salary and contractual benets in respect of the notice period.
There are no provisions giving the director a right to specified compensation payable on early termination.
However, in the event that a director is not re-elected at an AGM of the Company, the agreement is automatically terminated and this is treated as a breach by the Company.
John Harnett was CEO until 31 March 2012.
Up to that point, he had a service agreement dated 19 June 2007, as varied on 22 October 2008 and 11 December 2009.
Non-executive directors A non-executive director is appointed for three years, subject to re-election by shareholders.
The initial threeyear period may be extended.

Election of directors At the AGM, Richard Moat will be standing for election and all the remaining directors, with the exception of John Lorimer who is leaving the Board, will be offering themselves for re-election.
Termination payments The Companys policy is to limit severance payments on termination to pre-established contractual arrangements.
In the event that the employment of an executive director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined having regard to the terms of the service contract between the Company and the employee, as well as the rules of any incentive plans.
Under normal circumstances, good leavers who do not serve notice are eligible to receive termination payments in lieu of notice based on base salary and contractual benets.
The notice period for both executive directors is one year.
The Company normally expects executive directors upon departure to mitigate their loss.
In any specic case that may arise, the Committee will consider carefully any compensatory payments having regard to performance, age, service, health or other circumstances that may be relevant.
In the event an executive leaves for reasons of death, injury, disability, change of control of the Company, or any other reason which the Committee in its absolute discretion permits, any outstanding DSP matching shares and PSP awards will normally be pro-rated for time and performance.
At the AGM, the Committee will be asking shareholders to approve an amendment to the rules to allow discretion to permit early vesting exercising of awards in certain circumstances.
For all other leavers, outstanding PSP awards and DSP matching shares will lapse.
The Committee retains discretion to alter these provisions as permitted by the relevant Plan Rules on a case-by-case basis following a review of circumstances and to ensure fairness for both shareholders and participants.

While the Company does not consult directly with employees as part of the process of reviewing executive pay, the Committee does receive and take account of employee engagement results as part of their overall assessment of executive performance.
The Company regards its measure of engagement an effective barometer of employee opinion and in the most recent survey an improvement in overall engagement was recorded, with Hungary in particular reporting world class levels of engagement, 12 using Gallup Q.
Considerations of shareholder views When determining remuneration, the Committee also takes into account the guidelines of investor bodies and shareholder views.
The Committee considers these to be of great importance.
In late 2012, the Company consulted a number of its major shareholders and shareholder representative bodies in order to discuss proposed changes to its long-term incentive arrangements.
We received valuable feedback from a number of key shareholders and took this into account in nalising the proposals.
As outlined in the Implementation Report below, the Company received strong support from its shareholders with a 98.84% vote in favour of last years Directors Remuneration Report.
The Committee continues to be mindful of shareholder views when determining ongoing remuneration strategy, and commits to undergoing shareholder consultation in advance of any significant changes to remuneration policy.

Annual bonus The maximum award for both the CEO and Finance Director in 2012 was 100% of salary 80% of salary for on target performance.
During 2012, a balanced scorecard approach was used for the annual bonus whereby 50% of the bonus was calculated on pre-tax profit and, subject always to a minimum profit threshold, the remaining 50% calculated against stretching performance objectives based on the following areas: growth and development: culture and leadership: operational effectiveness: people: customer experience: and brand and reputation.
The award for achievement of performance objectives is expressed as a percentage of the award for profit, and so scaled up or down from 0x to 1x according to the profit achievement.
Over the period, profit before tax and exceptional items was 95.1 million, which was between target and maximum.
The Committee also reviewed the performance of the CEO and Finance Director against their agreed personal objectives for 2012.

The bonus was payable one third in cash, and two thirds in deferred shares which will vest at the end of a three-year period, subject to the director not being dismissed for misconduct.
There are also provisions for clawback during the vesting period in the event of a restatement of the Companys Financial Statements or material misjudgment of performance.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 63 Directors Remuneration Report continued PSP Awards made during the year Executive directors and senior management all participate in this plan.
Awards are generally made as nil-cost options over a specic number of shares, and vest after a three-year performance period with vesting determined by performance targets and employment conditions.
50% of vested awards will be released after the end of the performance period, with 50% deferred for an additional 12 months.
Awards made up to the end of 2012 vest based on absolute TSR performance.
In addition to meeting the TSR target, for any shares to vest the Committee will need to satisfy itself that the absolute TSR performance is a fair reection of performance, specically with regard to the Companys TSR relative to the median TSR of the FTSE 250.
Type of award Performance share award Basis of award CEO: 150% of salary reecting his appointment during the year : Finance Director: 100% of salary Face value of award CEO: 675,000 Finance Director: 310,000 Performance period 3 years from the date of grant Performance conditions Absolute TSR growth Threshold 30% TSR over 3 years 33% vests Maximum 60% TSR over 3 years 100% vests Awards vesting during the year 2012 was not the last year of any PSP performance period for any of the executive directors who served in the year.

DSP Awards made during the year Awards are granted in respect of the deferred element of the annual bonus.
The award shares are eligible for a match.
The match is one-for-one for executive directors and one-for-three for other members of the Senior Management Group.
There are no performance conditions in respect of deferred shares granted in respect of the deferred element of the 2011 bonus scheme.
The corresponding matching awards will vest only to the extent that the performance condition is satisfied, namely absolute growth in TSR on the same basis as for the PSP as set out in the section above.

64 International Personal Finance plc Directors Remuneration Report Other share schemes The CSOP The CSOP is an HM Revenue & Customs approved scheme.
The use of these options may enable part of a UK-based executive or senior managers rewards from share plans to be received with relief from income tax and national insurance contributions within the thresholds permitted by HM Revenue & Customs, which allows options over shares with a value of 30,000 at the time of option grant to be held by an individual under the CSOP at any time.
Where an individual who receives CSOP share options also participates in an award made under the PSP, the award under the PSP is scaled back appropriately to reect the grant of CSOP share options, and grants made under both plans have the same performance conditions for vesting.
The SAYE Scheme The executive directors together with other UK Group employees with six months service or more may participate in the SAYE Scheme, which has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs.
Participants save a xed sum each month for three or five years and may use these funds to purchase shares after three, five or seven years.
The exercise price is xed at up to 20% below the market value of the shares at the date directors and employees are invited to participate in the scheme.
Up to 250 can be saved each month.
This scheme does not contain performance conditions as it is an HM Revenue & Customs approved scheme open to employees at all levels.
Exit payments made in year John Harnett ceased to be a director on 31 March 2012.
Pursuant to a compromise agreement made on 17 January 2012, by March 2013 he will have received 626,770 which represents 12 months pay in lieu of notice salary and contractual benets paid monthly in instalments.
This was subject to a pound for pound offset if alternative employment excluding non-executive directorships was secured during that period.
He was also eligible for a tailored incentive of up to 20% of basic salary linked to specic objectives during the period up to 31 March 2012, payment of which was at the discretion of the Committee.
The Committee agreed that John Harnett met the full conditions required for the payment of this incentive and authorised full payment thereof amounting to 96,000.
In addition, the Committee exercised its discretion to permit John Harnett to retain the award over 14,416 shares granted to him under the CSOP in July 2010, the award over 212,843 shares granted to him under the PSP in July 2010 and the award over 149,626 shares granted to him under the PSP in July 2011.
The performance condition will be applied in the usual way at the end of the three-year performance period, but the number of shares which vest will be reduced by being time prorated based on the number of complete months from the date of grant of each award to 31 March 2013 or, had John Harnett secured alternative employment, the date of notication.
Half of the award under the CSOP may be exercised within a year of the performance condition being satisfied, with the other half exercisable within a year from the first anniversary of the date the award became exercisable.
Half of the award under the PSP may be exercised within a year of the performance condition being satisfied, with the other half exercisable within a year of the anniversary of the end of the relevant performance condition.
The Committee considers that the compensation represented a fair settlement of the Companys contractual and statutory obligations and took account of the directors duty to mitigate.
