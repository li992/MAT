56 overview business review governance financial statements Remuneration policy for executive directors The Committees policy is to set remuneration levels which ensure that executive directors are fairly and responsibly rewarded in return for high levels of performance.
The remuneration policy set by the Committee aims to encourage a performance based culture which reinforces behaviour that will lead to the continued long term successful development of the business, is sufficient to attract, retain and motivate high calibre executive directors and senior managers and aligns their interests with those of shareholders.
The Committee believes that the aims of the policy are achieved by ensuring that a significant proportion of total remuneration is linked to the achievement of stretching corporate and individual targets both in the short and long term.
No incentive payments are made for below threshold levels of corporate and individual performance and all performance related remuneration is subject to caps.
As well as providing motivation to perform, remuneration plays an important retention role and needs to be competitive.
The Committee therefore seeks to position total executive director remuneration around midmarket for on target performance taking into account the size and complexity of the Group compared to other peer companies.
The Committee takes into account a range of factors including the Companys performance, economic conditions, the responsibilities, individual performance and experience of each executive director.
Consideration is also given to pay and employment conditions of employees within the Group and the Committee particularly takes into account pay increases throughout the Group when determining salary increases for executive directors.
The Committee is also mindful of the views of shareholders in determining appropriate levels of remuneration and in ensuring that shareholder and director interests are aligned.
The Committees remuneration policy approach is summarised below: Fixed remuneration Performance related remuneration Short term Long term Base salary Quarterly and annual Employee incentive plan Benefits performance incentive In 2012, the target mix of remuneration was as follows: 1 2 3 1 Fixed Bill Burns 2 Variable cash 1 2 3 Eric Hutchinson 3 Variable LTIP 0 20 40 60 80 100 57 spirent COMMUniCAtiOns plC AnnUAl repOrt 2012 RepoRt on diRectoRs RemuneRation CONTINUED Summary of remuneration The following table summarises the various elements of executive remuneration: Purpose and link Key Policy operated Policy for Element to remuneration policy features in 2012 2013 Base Reflects the competitive market Paid in cash CEO $700,000 CEO $720,000, increase salary salary level for the individual Based on individual CFO 312,850 of 2.9% and their role contribution CFO 320,000, increase Takes account of personal Reviewed annually of 2.3% performance and contribution In line with salary increases to corporate performance within Group across North America and Europe Annual Rewards the achievement of Paid in cash following No change: Target award Target award of 33% of incentive stretching annual EPS and year end of 33% of annual salary for annual salary for CEO, subject financial goals supported CEO, subject to cap of 50% to cap of 50% and 18.33% of by individual goals linked and 16.67% of base salary base salary for CFO subject to strategic milestones for CFO subject to cap to cap of 27.5% of 25% $72,333 and 16,164 payable to CEO and CFO respectively for 2012 Quarterly Rewards the achievement of Paid in cash following No change: Target award Target award of 67% of incentive stretching quarterly EPS and quarter end of 67% of annual salary for annual salary for CEO, subject financial goals supported CEO, subject to cap of 100% to cap of 100% and 36.67% by individual goals linked and 33.33% of base salary of base salary for CFO subject to strategy for CFO subject to cap of to cap of 55% 50% $353,209 and 78,930 payable to CEO and CFO respectively for 2012 Long term Aligns with shareholder interests Limits of 250% and CEO received a PS award CEO to receive a combined incentives through the delivery of shares 125% of base salary for of 100% of base salary.

Nonexecutive directors fees and letters of appointment The Companys remuneration policy with regard to fees for nonexecutive directors, including the Chairman, is to pay fees which are in line with market practice for companies of a similar size and complexity.
Fees for the nonexecutive directors are normally reviewed by the Board once every three years and were last reviewed on 1 January 2012, having been frozen since 1 January 2008.
It was determined that the basic annual fee for nonexecutive directors would be set at 40,000 per annum for 2012 to 2014.
Fees for the Chairman, which are determined by the Remuneration Committee, were set at 160,000 per annum for 2012 to 2014, having been frozen since 1 January 2009.
The Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees each receive additional fees of 11,000 and 9,000 respectively.
It is considered that nonexecutive director fees are at the median level for comparable companies.
Fees for nonexecutive directors and the Chairman will next be reviewed on 1 January 2015.
All nonexecutive directors have a letter of appointment with the Company for a period of not more than three years, subject to the Companys Articles of Association.
