Directors Remuneration Report The Board has prepared this report in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
An ordinary resolution for the approval of this report will be put to members at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The law requires the Companys Auditor to audit certain elements of this report.
These elements are described below as audited.
The Auditors opinion is included in the Independent Auditors Report on page 33.
Remuneration Committee The Board is composed wholly of non-executive Directors who together consider and determine all matters relating to the Directors remuneration at the beginning of each financial period.
A Remuneration Committee has not been formed as all of the Directors are non-executive and considered independent.
Statement of the Companys Policy on Directors Remuneration The Companys policy is that the remuneration of the Directors should reflect the experience of the Board, as a whole, and be comparable to that of similar investment trusts within the AICs UK Smaller Companies sector and other investment trusts that are similar in size and structure.
This information is provided by Aberforth Partners LLP, as Secretaries, who were appointed by the Board.
It is intended that this policy will remain in place for the following financial year and subsequent periods.
Directors remuneration is determined within the limits set by the Companys Articles of Association and is solely composed of Directors fees.
Directors are not eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share options or any other benefits.
There are no performance conditions relating to Directors fees.
There are no long-term incentive schemes.
