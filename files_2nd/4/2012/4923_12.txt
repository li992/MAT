Remuneration Policy for 2013 To ensure that our remuneration policy continues to support the Companys growth strategy in the current economic environment, and reflecting the feedback received from our shareholders following our 2012 AGM, the Committee has recently undertaken a review of its remuneration policy.
The key conclusion of the review was that the current policy of providing at or below median base salaries and an above median incentive opportunity for delivery of superior performance remains appropriate and therefore that no further changes were required save for performance related cost of living adjustments to base salary levels to ensure they remain appropriate.
As a result, 2013 policy will operate on broadly similar terms to the 2012 policy save for the first time there is an introduction of a second performance measure stretching personal objectives alongside growth in profit before tax for the annual performance bonus.

It is expected that the required shareholding will be built up over a maximum of five years.
