Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 79 reMUNerATioN rePorT report on remuneration strategy and Policy introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to directors remuneration in the UK Corporate Governance Code.
As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on certain parts of the Directors Remuneration Report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Accounting Regulations.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
UNAUdiTed iNforMATioN remuneration policy Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, retain and motivate the high calibre executives needed to manage the Group successfully and align their interests with those of the shareholders by rewarding them for enhancing value to shareholders.
The packages also seek to reward achievement of stretching performance targets without driving unacceptable behaviours or encouraging excessive risk taking.
The performance measurement of the executive Directors and key members of senior management and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the Remuneration Committee.

The Chief Executive is responsible for assessing the performance of each senior executive taking account of the complexity of the operations under their control, their opportunities for advancement with the Group, their remuneration relative to other executives in the Group and their bonus earning potential.
He then formulates a remuneration proposal for the Committees consideration.
In deciding appropriate remuneration levels, the Committee also considers the Group as a whole and relies on objective external research which gives information on a comparator group of companies.
Basic salaries are reviewed in February of each year with increases, if appropriate, taking effect from 1 April.
Executive Directors contracts of service which include details of remuneration will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
Annual bonus payments During the year the Committee carefully assessed existing incentive arrangements and determined that incentive levels are appropriately set.
The Committee established the economic value added EVA objectives that must be met for each financial year if a cash bonus is to be paid.
In setting appropriate bonus parameters the Committee determined that bonuses of approximately 60% of salary are payable on the achievement of targeted levels of growth.
The maximum performance-related bonus that can be paid is 100% of basic annual salary.
For the Chief Executive and Finance Director, bonuses are calculated as above but based on Group profit exceeding a target calculated from the profits for the three preceding financial years after charging cost of capital, including the cost of acquisitions.
In the case of a Divisional Chief Executive a bonus is earned if the profit of the Division for which they are responsible exceeds a target calculated from the profits of the three preceding financial years.
The profits calculated for this purpose regard each Division as a standalone group of companies charging it with the cost of capital it utilises including the cost of acquisitions.
Executive Director bonus payments for 2012 totalled 725,000 versus 1,127,000 in the prior year reflecting the Groups performance in terms of reported profit, EVA and the relative contributions of organic and acquisition growth.
This performance-related bonus plan, which applies to executive Directors and Divisional Chief Executives, is reviewed annually by the Committee and approved by the Board.

Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 81 reMUNerATioN rePorT coNTiNUed Performance share plan PsP The Directors have long believed that share plans are an excellent way to provide motivation and align the longer-term interests of senior management with those of shareholders.
The Committee, recognising the need to assess and evaluate such incentives, adopted a performance share plan following shareholder approval at the 2005 annual general meeting.
This PSP replaced the existing share option plans in respect of future share awards.
The Committee has responsibility for supervising the PSP and the grants under its terms.

The granting of options was spread over the life of the plan.

The Company does not operate any long-term incentive plans other than the share plans described above.
No significant amendments are proposed to be made to the terms and conditions of any entitlement of a Director to share options or performance share awards.
Pension arrangements Except as noted below, the executive Directors participate in the appropriate section of the Halma Group Pension Plan the Plan.
This section is a funded final salary occupational pension plan registered with HM Revenue & Customs, which provides a maximum pension of two-thirds of final pensionable salary after 25 or more years service at normal pension age 60.
Up to 5 April 2006, final pensionable salary was the greatest salary of the last three complete tax years immediately before retirement or leaving service.
From 6 April 2011, final pensionable salary was capped at 139,185 and is increased annually thereafter by CPI.
Bonuses and other fluctuating emoluments and benefits-in-kind are not pensionable nor subject to any pension accrued supplement.
The Plan also provides for life cover of three times salary, pensions in the event of early retirement through ill-health and dependants pensions of one-half of the members prospective pension.
Early retirement pensions, currently possible from age 55 with the consent of the Company and the Trustees of the Plan, are subject to actuarial reduction.
Pensions in payment increase by 3% per annum for service up to 5 April 1997, by price inflation subject to a maximum of 5% through to 31 March 2007 and 3% thereafter.
Whilst pension benefits are accruing, executive Directors receive pension supplements to compensate them for the fact that their pension accrual entitlement under the Halma Group Pension Plan defined benefit arrangements is limited by a pensionable salary cap introduced from 6 April 2006.
The Company introduced a pensionable salary cap in order to address changes affecting the Plan made in the Pension Act 2006.
Without the introduction of such a cap, there would, effectively, have been no benefit limits.
This could have resulted in benefits in excess of prescribed levels with some individuals suffering penal rates of tax and potentially causing a limitation on the tax deductibility of employer contributions.
The Company obtained external advice regarding the changes to the Plan and executive pension arrangements and required each affected executive to obtain independent advice prior to implementing the changes.
These changes reduce the Plans future liabilities and their associated funding risk.
Prior to receiving pension payments, to the extent that an executives current salary exceeds the Plan salary cap, the Company compensates him at an annual rate of 26% of the excess.
In April 2006, Kevin Thompson chose to cease entirely future service accrual in the Halma Group Pension Plan in return for the pension supplement on his full salary.
Benefits-in-kind The executive Directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, principally use of a car and private medical insurance.
Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 83 reMUNerATioN rePorT coNTiNUed directors contracts It is the Companys policy that executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term providing for a maximum of one years notice.

The Chairman receives a basic fee and the non-executive Directors receive a basic fee supplemented by additional fees for membership and or chairmanship of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees.
The contract in respect of Geoff Unwins services provides for termination, by either party, by giving not less than six months notice.
Stephen Pettit, Jane Aikman, Norman Blackwell, Steve Marshall and Daniela Barone Soares have contracts in respect of their non-executive Director services which can be terminated, by either party, by giving not less than three months notice.
