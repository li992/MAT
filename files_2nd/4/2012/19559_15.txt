Our business Our governance Our results Remuneration report Dear Shareholder On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to report on the activities of the Remuneration Committee for the period to 31 December 2012.
This report will be presented for approval by shareholders at the 2013 Annual General Meeting.
Our philosophy to remuneration Our focus and business policy is founded on the premise that staff Clare Hollingsworth should be motivated through highly incentive based and therefore Chair of the Remuneration variable remuneration consistent with our partnership style culture.
Committee We continue to believe that this approach best aligns shareholders and managements interests, and incentivises superior performance and the creation of long term shareholder value.
This approach also ensures that our reward arrangements are consistent with and able to respond to the cyclical nature of the real estate markets, particularly transactional markets.
Reflecting this philosophy, the salaries for the Executive Directors, GEB Members and fee-earners, 2008-2012 Overview particularly the more senior ones, are set below market medians for similar businesses, with a greater emphasis onthe performance related elements of profit share and or, outside of the UK, Underlying Profit Before Tax commission in the total reward package.
83% The Committee, supported by its advisors Towers Watson, ismindful of its responsibility to reward appropriately, but not Dividend Payments to Shareholders excessively, and rigorously assesses competitive positioning in 83% setting remuneration and determining targets to ensure that reward reflects performance, that it supports the delivery of our strategic and operational objectives and that it is fair to management and Executive Director Remuneration shareholders alike.
Overall, we expect employment costs over the 65% cycle to be in the range of 60% to 65% of revenue.
In the five years between 2008 and 2012, underlying profit improved by more than 80% and dividend payments to shareholders increased by the Total Shareholder Return same amount notwithstanding the volatile market conditions.
Over 100% the same period we have pursued our strategy of progressively building our non-Transactional businesses which provide more stable, long term earnings, to balance our Transactional businesses which are more dependent on the cycle.
We also broadened our geographic footprint.
Reward during this period overall for Executive Directors rose by 65% reflecting this performance and our progress in delivering our strategy, although in some years during this period reward reduced year on year reflecting performance.
There were no changes to our remuneration policy in 2012, and none are anticipated in 2013, although the Committee will continue to keep our reward structure under review.
2012 remuneration During 2012 the base salaries of the Executive Directors were reviewed, but no increases were awarded.
Profit share awards for the Executive Directors for the year were assessed against a combination of the Groups financial performance, which exceeded expectations following a very strong end to the year, and personal performance, measured in terms of the delivery of strategic and operational objectives or the achievement of specific milestones related to their delivery over the medium The dividend cost stated for 2012 includes the cost of the final dividend term.
Reflecting this strong performance, profit share awards recommended by the Board amounting to 8.5m, payment of which is subject of 65% of maximum potential were earned by the Executive to shareholder approval at the Companys AGM scheduled to be held on 8 May Directors compared to approximately 50% in respect of 2011 2013, and along with the cost of the supplemental dividend 7.5m, is based on of which approaching one quarter will be delivered in the the number of shares in issue as at 31 December 2012. form of Savills shares, deferred for a further 3 years.
Executive Director remuneration comprises the remuneration paid to the Group Chief Executive and Group Chief Financial Officer job holders in 2008 and 2012.
Since 1 July 2010 the Executive representation on the Board has comprised these job role holders.
Savills plc Report and Accounts 2012 45 Remuneration report continued Also in April 2012, Executive Share Option Scheme 2001 ESOS Overview of reward and Group awards granted in 2009 vested and became exercisable following performance in 2012 the satisfaction of the EPS growth performance criteria attaching to them.
The Group Chief Executive and the Group Chief Financial Officer hold such awards but have not exercised them to date.
Underlying Profit Before Tax After due consideration of Group performance and future plans, 20.6% Performance Share Plan PSP awards, linked to the delivery of further shareholder value over the medium term, with initial face values of, respectively, 450k being 2x base salary for the Group 2012 60.8m Chief Executive and 250k being approximately 1.5x base salary 2011 50.4m for the Group Chief Financial Officer, were awarded in March 2012.
2013 remuneration The base salaries of the Executive Directors have been reviewed but will not be increased in 2013.
Equally, the established policy Underlying Earnings per Share in relation to PSP awards will continue to be applied, with the 21.7% Group Chief Executive eligible to receive an award up to the value of 450k i. e. 2x base salary and the Group Chief Financial Officer 250k approximately 1.5x base salary.
2012 35.3p 2011 29.0p The established profit share arrangements will also remain in place for 2013 and 2014, although for these years the balance between reward for near term profit delivery and for the delivery of strategic or operational objectives, or specific milestones towards the achievement of these, has been reweighted to provide a greater focus on reward for the creation of longer term shareholder value relative to reward for near term annual profit Total Shareholder Return rebased performance.
1 year to 31 December 2012 47.9% Accordingly for 2013, the Committee has resolved that 70% of profit share reward potential will relate to annual profit 160 performance and 30% to personal performance measured in terms of the delivery against preset strategic or operational 140 objectives 2012: 75% 25%.
In addition, the amount of any deferred element has been increased so that progressively up to one third of any award will, at maximum potential award level, be 120 delivered in the form of Savills shares, deferred for three years.
100 Clear and transparent reporting During the year, there has been substantial initiative by the Department for Business Innovation and Skills BIS to improve 80 corporate communication on executive pay.
While a number of Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec these proposals are still yet to be finalised, the following report attempts to capture the spirit of BIS direction particularly with Savills FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts regards to simplification, separation of future policy and past pay and transparency.
We have also looked to respond to the feedback received from institutional shareholder bodies and shareholders on our 2011 Remuneration report, which we were pleased to see received a 94% vote in favour.
In particular we have included more detail on how profit share awards are determined.
I hope that you find this revised report clear and informative and will be able to continue your support by voting in favour of the resolutions relating to this Directors Remuneration report at the AGM.
Clare Hollingsworth Chair of the Remuneration Committee 46 Savills plc Report and Accounts 2012 Our business Our governance Our results Remuneration philosophy It is essential for Savills continued development and growth that the Group provides remuneration which attracts, retains and motivates individuals of the highest quality.
Consistent with this approach, the remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors are structured to provide a competitive mix of variable performance related i. e. annual profit share and longer term incentives and fixed remuneration principally base salary.
In determining the remuneration of the Executive Directors and GEB Members, the Committee takes into account the role and responsibility of the individual, their performance and the arrangements applying across the wider employee group, alongside consideration of sector and broader market practice.
The Committee is also able to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues.
The remuneration policy and its application to the Executive Directors is described in more detail in the following pages.
The information in this report has not been audited unless otherwise stated.
Summary policy The following chart and accompanying table on pages 48 and 49, provide a summary of the different elements of pay, their purpose and linkage to our strategy, and the key features of each component.

A high proportion of total reward will be awarded through near and long term performance related remuneration.
This is demonstrated by the charts below which illustrate that at target performance over 80% of the remuneration of the Group Chief Executive and Group Chief Financial Officer is delivered in the form of variable pay, which rises to 90% and 89% respectively if maximum performance is achieved.

For all other share schemes, including the DSP, awards are satisfied via an employee benefit trust EBT following purchase in the market.
As agreed with shareholders at the AGM held in 2003, the EBT can hold up to 15% of the Groups issued share capital.
There are no powers to issue new shares or to reissue its existing treasury shares under either the Deferred Share Bonus Plan, Deferred Share Plan or the EBT and therefore there is no further dilution of existing shareholdings.
Savills plc Report and Accounts 2012 49 Remuneration report continued Application of 2012 Executive Director remuneration policy In accordance with the policy, set out on pages 48 and 49 below are details of Executive Director remuneration in 2012.
The Committee notes that BIS proposes introducing a single figure remuneration disclosure for Executive Directors, although the exact requirements of this disclosure are yet to be finalised.
In anticipation of this disclosure, the following table shows total figure for base salary, benefits, pension and annual performance profit share in 2012 for each of the Executive Directors.
The final disclosure requirements may be different, but it is hoped that the table below helps shareholders understanding and demonstrates the Committees commitment to transparent reporting.

Performance graph The total shareholder return delivered by the Company over the last five years is shown in the chart below.
Over this period the Company has delivered total shareholder return of 15% per annum FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts : 7% per annum: FTSE 350 Super Sector Real Estate: -4% per annum.
Savills was ranked 46th by TSR performance in the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts and ranked 1st by performance in the FTSE 350 Super Sector Real Estate over the five years to 31 December 2012.

Savills TSR relative to that of the FTSE 350 Super Sector Real Estate Index is also shown, as this Index better reflects conditions in real estate markets over recent years.
