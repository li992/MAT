In addition to the normal bonus, the atthe Companys address via the Company Secretary.
Committee approved an exceptional performance award, thatwas originally advocated by the Partner on the Okoro eld inrecognition of exceptional technical achievements during theyear the Okoro Field Extension discovery, development andproduction.
The total exceptional performance award was approximately 3.7million, of which approximately 1.6 million was awarded tothe three Executive Directors.
Thiswasfunded Toby Hayward bythe project cash ows.
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee In June 2012, the Executive Directors received grants under the 25 March 2013 2008 Performance Share Plan with a face value of approximately 200% of salary, but subject to vesting conditions.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any incentive plans and have not received grants under any share-based plan since theMain Market listing in 2009.
The relative TSR performance benchmark for this grant was modied to provide amore relevant measure and a second underpinning measure Reserves Replacement Ratio was added, thereby increasing the performancestretch.
Whilst we believe that the latest exceptional performance award isfully merited and effective in motivating Executives to continue toachieve exceptional performance, we are aware that shareholders would prefer to see clear targets in place against which such achievement can be judged.
For this reason, the Company is planning to introduce a revised bonus plan in 2013 which integrates the exceptional opportunity into the main bonus plan and will subject it to predetermined performance standards.
Inorder to better balance shortand long-term incentives and match the risk of Executives and shareholders, therevised plan will also incorporate a substantial deferment of bonus into shares with a clawback arrangement.
At the same time we are introducing apersonal shareholding requirement for Executive Directors.
