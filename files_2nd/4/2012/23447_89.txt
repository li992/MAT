Ms L Webber was the Chairman of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee and the Senior Independent Director throughout the year.
The Committee resolved during the year that the Chairmans total fee should be reduced, in accordance with her request, from 150,000 to 100,000 per annum comprising a basic Directors fee of 35,000 per annum with a reduced additional fee of 65,000 per annum with effect from 1 February 2012 and that the Chairman of the Management Engagement Committee should receive a fee of 6,000 per annum with effect from 1 October 2011.
The Committee resolved at the same time that the non-Chairman members of the Valuations Committee should no longer receive any additional fees for their services on this Committee with effect from 1 January 2012 previously 3,000 per annum.
The Committee did not consider it necessary to recommend any other changes to the existing fee arrangements during the year.
The basic Directors fee for each Director is 35,000 per annum with an additional fee of 65,000 per annum for the Chairman of the Company which was reduced from 115,000 as discussed above from 1 February 2012.
An additional fee of 6,000 per annum is payable to the Chairman of each of the Audit, Valuations and Management Engagement Committees and to the Senior Independent Director.

The Company has no employees.
Policy on Directors Remuneration The Companys policy is that remuneration of non-executive Directors should be fair and sufficient to enable Directors properly to oversee the affairs of the Company and should reflect the specific circumstances of the Company, the duties and responsibilities of the Directors and the value and amount of time committed to the Companys affairs.
It is intended that this policy will continue for the year to 30 September 2013 and subsequent years.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible to receive bonuses, pension benefits, share options or other benefits.
The Remuneration and Nomination Committee relies mainly on general salary surveys in respect of its consideration of the level of Directors Remuneration.
The total remuneration of the Directors is determined by the provisions of the Articles of Association and by shareholders resolutions.
Directors Service Contracts None of the Directors has a service contract with the Company.
No arrangements have been entered into between the Company and the Directors to entitle any of the Directors to compensation for loss of office.
Total Shareholder Return The Directors consider that, since the Company invests in a broad range of commercial sectors, the FTSE All-Share Index is the most appropriate index against which to compare the Companys performance.
