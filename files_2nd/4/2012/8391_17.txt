The remuneration and our use of remuneration consultants.

In the lead up to the 2011 believes that pay should reflect performance with a high AGM, shareholders and their representative bodies raised proportion of total reward based on growth in profit and two main issues on which I would like to comment: the creation of shareholder value.
The additional one-off 100% of salary LTIP award As outlin ed in the Chief Executives Statement on madeto the current Chief Executive in 2011 i. e. 100% pages 8 and 9, the Company made some good progress in addition to the normal 200% as per the LTIP rules.
during the year, but our profitability was reduced by TheRemuneration Committee felt that it was entirely additional costs and provisions related to certain major appropriate to make this additional award on appointing projects.
Company performance has, of course, been a new Chief Executive to give him a bigger potential reflected inthe remuneration outcomes for executive stake in the future success of the Group under directors for2011 12: hisleadership.
The financial element of the executive directors annual The fact that the Remuneration Committee did not incentive plan did not achieve the threshold levels of apply mitigation in providing termination terms to the performance required to deliver a payment: former Chief Executive Ulf Henriksson.
The terms For the first time in 2011 12, a personal performance provided were in line with his contractual entitlement element to the executive directors annual incentive based on twelve-months base salary plus contractual planwas introduced with a 25% weighting of the overall benefits and the bonus paid was a payment earned bonus opportunity.
After detailed consideration of during the financial year 2010 11.
The Remuneration thepersonal performance of each executive director Committee believes in the principle of mitigation and inthe context of the performance objectives set, the allexecutive directors contractual terms include an Remuneration Committee concluded that the executive ability to mitigate by paying money due at termination directors had met or exceeded th eir personal ininstalments.
However, in this case, the Remuneration performance targets for the year.
However, in light of Committee decided that it was more important to move theoverall financial performance of the Company, the forward under new leadership and to achieve a prompt executive directors and the Remuneration Committee clean break with the former Chief Executive, and did not agreed that no bonus payment would be made to therefore invoke the contractual mitigation provisions.
executive directors in respect of 2011 12: The Remuneration Committee remains satisfied that the The financial performance thresholds for the 2009 two decisions outlined above were appropriate.
Award under the 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP In conclusion, we believe that our remuneration strategy whichhad the potential to vest bas ed on performance incentivises the delivery of strong financial results and the over three years to 31 March 2012 were not achieved creation of shareholder value.
