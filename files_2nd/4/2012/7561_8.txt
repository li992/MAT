In addition the Company will match any voluntary member contribution made to the dened contribution top-up section to a maximum of 8% of pensionable pay.
Alternatively a participant may receive a salary supplement of 8% of salary in lieu of this dened contribution opportunity.
A pension supplement system operates concurrently with the Plan which recognises that pension entitlement in respect of the CARE part of the Plan is capped.
This supplement is 30% of basic salary above the Plan Cap to reect competitive market practice.
The CEO has chosen to opt out of membership of the Plan and consequently receives a salary supplement of 30% of salary in lieu of pension.

Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual report & accounts 2012 Remuneration policy for other employees The remuneration policy described in the previous table applies specically to executives of the Group.
However, the Remuneration Committee believes it is appropriate that all senior managements reward is directly linked to the performance of the Company and aligned with shareholder value.
Accordingly Executive Committee members participate in the same incentive schemes as the executive directors at a reduced level to ensure alignment between the leadership team with each other and with our shareholders.
Below this level, a system of profit sharing and the encouragement of share ownership is cascaded through all tiers of management.
Individuals who sit within the upper tiers of the organisation participate in a similar bonus plan that is linked to PBT and cash ow.
These individuals also receive share awards which vest dependent on the same performance measures as the long-term incentive plan awarded to executive directors.
Share grants are made at a reduced level to a wider population within Howdens that do not use performance conditions.
These awards are made in order to encourage share ownership throughout the Company.
2013 remuneration scenarios The remuneration package for the executive directors is designed to provide an appropriate balance between xed and variable, performance-related components, with a significant proportion of the package weighted towards long-term variable pay.
The Committee is satisfied that the composition and structure of the remuneration package is appropriate and does not incentivise inappropriate risk taking and reviews this on an annual basis.
The composition and value of the executive directors remuneration packages in a range of performance scenarios are set out in the charts below.
These show that the proportion of the package delivered through long-term performance is in line with our remuneration policy and changes signicantly across the performance scenarios.
As a result, the package 39 promotes the achievement of superior long-term performance and aligns the interests of the executive directors with those of other shareholders.
A brief description of each remuneration scenario is set out below the charts.

In particular the Committee considers pay conditions across the Company when reviewing base salaries for executive directors.
Additionally some of the Companys workforce are unionised or belong to a works council.
Howdens maintains open lines of communication with these bodies and the Committee is always made aware of any relevant information in relation to remuneration policy.
Accordingly the salary increase for the wider workforce for 2013 was 3% on average, which was in line with the increase provided to the CEO and CFO.
Consideration of shareholder views The Committee remains committed to maintaining an ongoing and transparent dialogue with its shareholders.
During the year, open channels of dialogue were maintained with our major shareholders and shareholder representation bodies.
The Committee Chairman also sent a letter to the Groups top ten shareholders in advance of the publishing of this remuneration report summarising the contents and the key areas for shareholders attention.
This allowed shareholders to raise any issues or concerns they may have had in advance of the final publication date.
Shareholders were generally supportive and did not highlight any areas for change in policy during this years dialogue.
Service contracts The Companys policy on service contracts and termination arrangements is set out below.
As an overriding principle, 40 it is the Companys policy that there should be no element of reward for failure.
The Committees approach when considering payments in the event of termination is to take account of the individual circumstances including the reason for termination, contractual obligations of both parties as well as share plan and pension scheme rules.
All executive directors employment contracts have twelve months notice of termination on both sides.
In the event of termination by the Company, there will be no compensation for loss of ofce due to misconduct or normal resignation.
In other circumstances, executive directors may be entitled to receive compensation for loss of ofce which will be paid monthly for a maximum of twelve months.
Such payments will be equivalent to the monthly salary that the executive would have received if still in employment with the Company.
Executive directors will be expected to mitigate their loss within a twelve month period of their departure from the Company.
In their service contracts, executive directors have the following remuneration related contractual provisions: Receipt of a salary, which is subject to annual review.
Receipt of a car allowance and non-exclusive use of a driver.
Health insurance and death-in-service insurance payable by the Group.
Eligibility to participate in any bonus scheme or arrangement which the Company may operate from time to time, subject to the plans rules.
Participation in the Companys pension plan, subject to the approval of the Board.

BASE SALARIES IN 2012 The Committees policy is to position base salary for each director at the median level compared to market practice.
Base salaries are reviewed annually and are determined by taking into account the performance of the individuals, changes in their responsibilities and information from independent remuneration consultants on the levels of salary for similar jobs having regard to the size of the Company its turnover, market capitalisation and complexity.
The Committee also takes into account internal relativities and the total remuneration of the executives compared to the market.
Base salary is the only element of remuneration which is pensionable.
In addition, benets are provided to executive directors in accordance with market practice.
The salary increases for 2012 and 2013 are set out in the table below.
The increases provided are in line with salary increases provided to the wider workforce.
The CEOs increase in 2012 was his first increase since 2008.

The performance measures were made up of pre-exceptional profit before tax PBT and cash ow targets as shown below.
Under the PBT component, no bonus is payable for achieving below Threshold performance.
At Threshold performance, 10% of salary can be earned rising to 77% of salary for achieving a Target level of PBT performance with straight-line vesting between these points.
Above Target, the bonus is determined on a profit share basis whereby participants earn a bonus based on a xed percentage of the Companys PBT.
In 2012, the profit share percentages for the CEO and CFO were 0.43% and 0.30% respectively.
In respect of the cash ow element of the bonus, executives can earn up to 40% of salary based on achieving pre-determined cash ow targets.
The cash ow measure used in 2012 is based on net cash ow from operating activities, taking into account the efficiency with which working capital is used, and adjusted for exceptional items.
15% of salary is payable for achieving threshold performance and 40% of salary is payable for achieving maximum performance, with payments determined on a straight-line basis between these points.
No bonus in respect of the cash ow element will be paid below threshold.

In addition the share price increased over the period from 76p on 27 December 2009 the beginning of FY10 to 173p on 29 December 2012 the end of FY12.

A pension supplement system operates concurrently with the Plan which recognises that pension entitlement in respect of the CARE part of the Plan has included maximum benefit restrictions which was 135,000 for 2012.
If a director chooses to opt out of membership of the pension plan, then the supplement payment will be 30% of total basic salary.
During the year, Mark Robson participated in the Plan.
