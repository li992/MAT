Governance Governance REMUNERATION REPORT The Board of Directors presents its Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 April 2012, which has been prepared on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee the Committee.
An advisory resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code, Schedule 8 of the Large & Medium-Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008, and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
INTRODUCTION This years remuneration report is set against the strong operational performance of Berkeley in both an historical context and also relative to the performance of its sector.
Berkeleys strategy places an emphasis on achieving two operational measures that the Committee aims to align to the Executives remuneration.
The first is achieving sustainable pre-tax returns on shareholder equity ROE.
The second measure recognises that the ROE performance should not be achieved at the expense of shrinking the business and that a sustainable model for shareholders relies on growth in the value of the land bank at the same time.
The combination of these two targets is designed to provide a balance between earnings in the near term and creating a long term, sustainable business which the Board considers is the best way to create shareholder value.
In considering the level of the Executives Annual Bonus Plan the Committee has previously discussed the principles with major shareholders and aims to set these at a level that is both challenging and sector leading.
Comparing the Groups ROE to its sector over the last 5 years illustrates the relative performance of Berkeley and challenging targets set: 30% 20% 10% 0% -10% -20% Berkeley ROE -30% Sector average ROE 2007 08 2008 09 2009 10 2010 11 2011 12 The Committee believes it is important to set annual targets that have a strong operational correlation with the performance of the business and are targets that the Executive team are responsible for delivering.
Whilst the Committee considers total shareholder return TSR to be a helpful tool to measure performance over the long term, it believes that setting the right operational targets on an annual basis and putting in place a long term share based remuneration policy aligned to creating shareholder value above a hurdle level of return is the best way to deliver value for shareholders and to encourage, reward and retain the current Executives.
The absolute value delivered by Berkeley can be illustrated by the comparison of the TSR for Berkeley, expressed as the value of 100 invested in the company, both from 25 June 2004, being the date on which the previous Scheme of Arrangement was announced, and from 1 May 2010, the date on which the current Annual Bonus Plan was introduced, to 30 April 2012: Value of 100 invested on Company 25 06 2004 01 05 2010 Berkeley 321 154 FTSE 250 234 117 FTSE 100 169 111 Sector average 84 111 Over these timeframes, Berkeley has out-performed the sector average and generated additional value for shareholders over a difficult and challenging period.
At the 2011 AGM shareholders approved the Boards strategy to return 13 per share to shareholders over the next 10 years, which has the following key features: U ii}L ViLiii } i`ii ` VVi Liiivi } U `i }iv iV iLi``i`yiLLiiiii `V ` i VViVVV ivii i U iiii i i U i`i`i iv ViiVi iiiVLi i }iv }iiV V`ii U ``i` i`iVi `Liii`iiLii i`iii}i ` U iiiV }ii iii`V}iVi w V VVV iV v Berkeleys overall strategy.
Berkeley Annual Report 2012 89 Governance REMUNERATION REPORT KEY ELEMENTS OF THE REMUNERATION POLICY The objective of Berkeleys remuneration policy is to encourage, reward and retain the current Executives.
The core philosophies of the policy are: Fixed remuneration The Committee sets salaries for the Executive Directors based on their experience, role, individual and corporate performance.
Salaries on appointment to the Board are set at a lower quartile level which, based on appropriate levels of individual and corporate performance, will be increased with experience gained over time.
Annual performance related pay The Committee believes that shareholders interests are best served by remuneration packages that have a large emphasis on performance-related pay which encourage the Executives to focus on delivering the business strategy.
The chart below summarises the relative importance of the various components of annual remuneration for each Executive Director for 2011 12, illustrating that the majority of this remuneration is performance related: A W Pidgley R C Perrins N G Simpkin G J Fry K Whiteman S Ellis 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Fixed: Performance related: Salary Benefits Pensions Annual Bonus Plan The Committee is responsible for determining the performance measures, annual performance targets and bonus awards under the Annual Bonus Plan.
The specic performance measures under the Annual Bonus Plan, being a return based measure Return on Equity and a value based measure Land Bank Growth ensure that there is a balance between incentivising the Executives to provide a sustainable ongoing level of return to shareholders whilst ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Company, thereby creating long-term shareholder value.
iiv Vi }i ii L } VVi LiV`i `iyiV} iiiv risk.
It is not in the interests of any of the stakeholders in the Company to set targets that encourage a level of risk inconsistent with the agreed risk prole for the Company.
Long-term sustainable performance The reward arrangements should be designed to incentivise and lock-in the Executive team to deliver the Companys strategy and to ensure that they are focused on generating long-term sustainable value for shareholders.
The long-term incentives which extend to 2021 have been designed to lock-in the Executive team for a far longer period than is typical in most publicly listed companies.
This has helped ensure that the Executive team are focused on generating long-term sustainable value for shareholders rather than on meeting short term performance targets.
The chart below sets out the proportion of annual to long term remuneration of the Executive Directors, illustrating that the significant element of total remuneration is aligned to the long-term performance of the Group: A W Pidgley R C Perrins N G Simpkin G J Fry K Whiteman S Ellis 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Annual Long term 90 Berkeley Annual Report 2012 Governance Governance The Companys long term incentive plans are designed to align the interests of shareholders and the Executive Directors over the long term.
They are summarised below: 2009 LTIP This was approved by shareholders at an EGM in April 2009, and incorporates two parts: a.
Part A replacing the balance of the shares originally awarded under the previous 2004 b LTIP, exercisable on 31 January 2014 subject to continued employment with the Company and an exercise price of 3 per share b.
Part B requiring maintaining a minimum net asset per share of 5.94 over a six year period, vesting in two equal tranches on 15 April 2015 and 2016 with an exercise price of 8.40 per share 2011 LTIP This is a ten year plan introduced in September 2011 to support the Companys long term plan to return 13 per share approximately 1.7 billion, representing 183% of Net Assets at 30 April 2011, to shareholders by September 2021.
This was approved by shareholders at the 2011 Annual General Meeting.
The plan aims to maximise returns within a given level of risk, disciplining the business to make significant returns to shareholders in cash over a sustained period and ensuring the Group remains at the right size and balances investment and returns to shareholders.
This model is aligned to Berkeleys ability to add value and operate in a cyclical market.
These plans are set out in more detail later in this report.
Risk adjustment The Companys reward arrangements should contain the following elements of risk adjustment, in line with best practice: a. a focus on long-term sustainable performance this is set out above.
b. the weighting of the reward package towards building substantial equity holdings which the Executive team are required to earn and hold over long periods: The final shar es from the previous 2004 b LTIP will not vest and sale restrictions be fully removed until 31 January 2014, ten years after awards were granted under the Plan.
The 2009 LTIP provides longer than market standard vesting periods for example options granted in 2009 under Part B of this Plan will vest 50% on 15 April 2015 and the balance on 15 April 2016 subject to the Net Asset Value per share being a minimum of 5.94 at the first of these two dates.
c. the deferral of a significant proportion of annual incentive awards and clawback where there is a material deterioration in performance: The Annual Bonus Plan, whilst based on annual performance periods: U`ivixv }L Vii Vi iiw i i `i ii`v wii i` ` Uii xvii}L Vi i i i Vi `ivviivi`iiviv Vi set in each year are not achieved.
d. no reward for failure: Under the 2011 LTIP all options lapse, no shares vest and the LTIP terminates on 1 October 2015 if 4.34 per share has not been paid to shareholders by 30 September 2015.
Substantial equity holdings In order to align the interests of Executives and shareholders, the Committee believes that one of the most effective ways of doing this is to design the reward strategy so that, provided performance is delivered, the Executive team become material in relation to their overall compensation shareholders in the Company, which the Executive Directors are required to earn and hold over long periods.
The current shareholdings of the Executive Directors as a percentage of salary, based on the share price at 30 April 2012, are set out on page 99 of this report.
REMUNERATION REVIEW The Committee reviews on an annual basis whether its remuneration policy remains appropriate for the relevant financial year.

There are no salary changes proposed for the remaining Executive Directors on the Board.
Berkeley Annual Report 2012 91 Governance REMUNERATION REPORT REMUNERATION COMMITTEE Composition and role At 30 April 2012, the Committee comprised of three Independent Non-executive Directors, Alan Coppin Chairman, Sir John Armitt and David Howell.
David Howell was appointed to the Committee on 2 December 2011 and Victoria Mitchell retired from the Committee on the same date.
During the year the Committee met on four occasions and there were no absences.
With effect from 13 June 2012 David Howell retired from the Committee and Glyn Barker was appointed to the Committee.
The members of the Committee have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no potential VyVvii }vV`iV `` ` ii}iLi i ii Liii`ii`i `Vi iiiivi `Vi Lii}Li ii`} the year under review.
In determining the Executive Directors remuneration for the year, the Committee consulted with the Group Chairman, Tony Pidgley, the Group Managing Director, Rob Perrins and the Group Finance Director, Nick Simpkin.
No Director played a part in any discussion about his remuneration.
In addition, the Committee had access to information on executive reward provided to the Board by  LLP, who acquired Halliwell Consulting, the previous advisers, in December 2008 and who have extensive knowledge of the Group and its structure.
The Executive Directors hold no external appointments.

REMUNERATION POLICY FOR 2011 12 AND 2012 13 The 2011 12 financial year started on 1 May 2011 and nished on 30 April 2012.
The 2012 13 financial year started on 1 May 2012 and nishes on 30 April 2013.
The policy is to set the main elements of the Executive Directors remuneration package against the following quartiles in the Companys comparator group: Base salary Annual bonus Pension Benets in kind Share incentives Experience and Role Upper decile Lower quartile Market practice Upper decile For the purposes of benchmarking remuneration the Committee used the following comparator group of companies in the year ended 30 April 2012: Company name Amec Plc Bellway plc Marshalls PLC Taylor Wimpey plc Balfour Beatty Plc Bovis Homes Group PLC Persimmon Plc Travis Perkins Plc Barratt Developments PLC Carillion Plc Redrow plc The Committee also considers the remuneration in the FTSE 250 as an additional benchmark to the main comparator group set out above due to its relatively small number of constituent companies.

At the end of the five year plan period 100% of the balance of participants accounts will be paid.
Key features of the Bonus Plan The Committee designed the Bonus Plan based on the following rationale: Two targets the Committee felt that the dynamic tension between operating a return based measure ROE and a value based measure Land Bank Growth should ensure that there was a balance between incentivising the Executives to provide a sustainable ongoing level of return to shareholders whilst ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Company.
"In the Committees opinion the impact of these two measures over the five year plan period should incentivise the Executives to ensure the creation of long-term shareholder value as follows: Ui Viii`iivVi i`w`i Vii, "" i ii }}i `L should be noted that the ROE will be set from a challenging base as the Company has not taken any land write downs as is the case i vVi U, "" V`i i `iiviv i`iv` iiii` ` ` ``i`]i }}Li V`i` Viii }i Uiv V i }i V`i}i `L i]i iVi iiV }i` Vi ` iVi iv Lii i i Liw} UiV }iiiL `ii iV iVi }ii], "" }i` i`i ii `vi iviiivi]iiii`Vi i ` U, "" i i}}iivwViVvi }V iL Viii `i`iii }ii`iiv returns, this will encourage the Company to invest or return cash to shareholders."
Level of targets the Committee wishes to incentivise the Executives to achieve a good level of returns to shareholders whilst ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Company.
Therefore the targets set have to take into account an appropriate level of risk.
The Bonus Plan allows a close tailoring by the Committee of the performance conditions to the budget and performance of the Company for each financial year.
At the outset of the Plan, the Committee set the annual performance requirements targeting an average ROE of 12.5% p. a. and average Land Bank Growth of 10% p. a. over the full five years of the plan, which were considered challenging and stretching targets at that time.
"""iiVivi iiiLi Liiv Viiii V iiyiViii at the time the requirements are set see performance targets for 2011 12 and 2012 13 operation of the plan set out below, and these will be reviewed each year by the Committee to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and position of the Company, so that they continue to remain challenging and fully aligned to the strategy of the Group."
Level of awardsqii` `Li v ii]LiV ixviL Vii account is deferred, the actual annual payment prole, based on, for these illustrative purposes, maximum awards each year and 100% satisfaction of both performance conditions, would be: Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 150% 225% 262.5% 281% 581% 94 Berkeley Annual Report 2012 Governance Governance Risk adjustment there is a risk adjustment mechanism built into the operation of the Bonus Plan with a claw back of contributions if the threshold levels of ROE and Land Bank Growth are not met for any financial year during the five years of operation of the Bonus Plan.
This adjustment mechanism ensures: Uiv ViLi i`iiwii vi vi i ii V VV Vi i ` Uvii i `ii iv Viii V L VvxviL Vivi V VV Alignment of interests there is a real alignment of participants interests with shareholders: U i`iiVii iiviv Vi Vii i iVi U iVi iiV }i` iViiiviv Vii}i `iiV ` Uii }i }iiiiv i`i i`ivii`iiivi i i shares.
Operation of the Bonus Plan for the year ended 30 April 2012 The bonus payable to each of the Group Chairman, Group Managing Director and Group Finance Director is determined by reference to the Group performance condition.
For the Divisional Directors, 50% of the potential bonus payable is determined by reference to the Group performance condition and 50% by reference to the Divisional PBT performance condition.
The maximum bonus potential for the year ended 30 April 2012 is set out in the table below: Information A W Pidgley R C Perrins N G Simpkin G J Fry K Whiteman S Ellis Maximum Potential % age of Salary 300% 300% 220% 154% 175% 175% The following tables set out: Uiiv ViV`vi vii i`i` Uiiiv v Vviiv ViV` Group performance condition year ended 30 April 2012 Performance Requirement Matrix Land Bank Growth Target 0% 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% Target Factor 0.0% 50.0% 62.5% 75.0% 87.5% 100.0% 11.5% 0% Bonus Plan 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% Deduction 11.5% 50% 0% 25% 31% 38% 44% 50% 12.5% 60% 0% 30% 38% 45% 53% 60% 13.5% 70% 0% 35% 44% 53% 61% 70% 14.5% 80% 0% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 15.5% 90% 0% 45% 56% 68% 79% 90% 16.5% 100% 0% 50% 63% 75% 88% 100% Notes: 1 The matrix shows the percentage of each of the performance requirements for a given level of performance and the corresponding percentage of the targeted maximum annual bonus potential earned for 2011 12.
2 There will be straight line bonus vesting between points.
3 The matrix demonstrates the dynamic tension between the two performance conditions.
One cannot be met at the expense of the other.
If the minimum threshold levels for either are not met, no contribution is made to the Bonus Plan account.
If the minimum threshold levels of performance are not met for both performance conditions, 50% of the participants plan account will be forfeited.
Structuring the performance conditions in this way will ensure consistent levels of ROE at the same time as the Group invests and adds value to the land bank.
4 ROE is dened as profit before tax divided by average shareholders funds.
5 Land Bank Growth is dened as the annual percentage increase in the development margin in the land bank.
This is the anticipated future gross margin to be earned from plots controlled and included in the Groups land bank.
To be included in the land bank, management must have reasonable certainty that the plots will come forward for development, either benefiting from a planning consent or being on land zoned for development.
For the avoidance of doubt, the land bank excludes plots subject to strategic land options.
Calculated plot by plot, the development margin is measured on a consistent basis according to prevailing sales prices for revenue, historic cost for costs already incurred and prevailing prices for costs still to be incurred.
It is separately disclosed within the annual report and the presentations to analysts.
Each year the land bank gross margin is reduced naturally by the amount of gross margin sold in the year.
Therefore, zero % growth in the land bank means that replacement matches usage.

LONG TERM REMUNERATION This section of the report sets out the share incentives for the year ended 30 April 2012.
On 15 April 2009, at an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company, shareholders approved the introduction of The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which incorporated and replaced Element 2 of The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004 b Long-Term Incentive Plan the 2004 b LTIP and the previously approved 2007 LTIP, as set out below.
2009 LTIP Part A The balance of the shares originally awarded under the 2004 b LTIP i. e. 3 12 of the shares, totalling 5,330,340 shares, were replaced by options with an exercise price of 3 per share granted under the 2009 LTIP.
This new option is identied as Part A of the 2009 LTIP.
These options were awarded on 29 June 2009, at which time the Element 2 awards under the 2004 b LTIP were surrendered.
Options will become exercisable on 31 January 2014 subject to the relevant Executives continued employment with the Company.
888,390 options have subsequently been cancelled, as set out below.
2009 LTIP Part B Following shareholder approval on 15 April 2009, a maximum of 7,100,000 shares were capable of being granted under Part B of the 2009 LTIP.
The grants under Part B of the 2009 LTIP are market priced options which will vest subject to: UVi`iiiii i}` i ` Ui v Vvi`iV` i i ii i i x{ x x U6i}viiLi Vi qxx x ` 50% on 15 April 2016.
A total of 6,830,000 options were granted, of which 500,000 have subsequently been cancelled, as set out below.
Shareholder approval was received at the 2011 AGM to amend the rules of the 2009 LTIP so that the terms of existing options granted can be adjusted in the event of the payment of a cash dividend or dividend in specie.
This provides that where such a dividend is paid the adjustment will be a reduction in the exercise price of an option by the amount or value of the dividend provided that the exercise price can never be less than zero and a reduction will only be made to the exercise price of an option that is not then capable of exercise.
888,390 options under Part A and 500,000 options under Part B of the 2009 LTIP have been cancelled following the settlement agreed between the Company and Tony Carey, as follows: Plan Number of shares cancelled Exercise price Date first exercisable 2009 LTIP Part A 888,390 3.00 31 January 2014 2009 LTIP Part B Tranche 1 250,000 8.40 15 April 2015 2009 LTIP Part B Tranche 2 250,000 8.40 15 April 2016 2011 LTIP The Company announced in June 2011 as part of a strategic review of the business a long term plan to return 13 per share approximately 1.7 billion to shareholders over the next 10 years payable on or before the following milestones: Per share 30 September 2015 4.34 30 September 2018 4.33 30 September 2021 4.33 13.00 Berkeley Annual Report 2012 97 Governance REMUNERATION REPORT A new long term remuneration plan was proposed to support this strategy, the 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan 2011 LTIP, which was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in September 2011.
The key features of the 2011 LTIP are: Uvi i i i`ii ii i` iiv``i` iLiii` i referred to above, participants will be entitled to exercise options and receive a number of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company at the end of the ten year period.

These are set out by participant in the table below: Participant Position Number of shares subject to award A W Pidgley Chairman 5,000,000 R C Perrins Group Managing Director 5,000,000 N G Simpkin Group Finance Director 3,250,000 S Ellis Divisional Director 2,250,000 K Whiteman Divisional Director 2,250,000 G J Fry Divisional Director 1,866,503 Total 19,616,503 UiiiViViv} i``ii Lii ii i i iv ``i` ` between the date of approval of the 2011 LTIP and 30 September 2021, provided the exercise price cannot be less than zero.
The following table sets out the cumulative dividend amounts, the relevant dates and the consequences of failing to deliver these amounts by these relevant dates: Required date Cumulative Consequences of failing to make the cumulative dividend payments on or before the dividend required date on or before required date 30 September 2015 4.34 Options lapse, no shares vest and 2011 LTIP terminates on 1 October 2015.
30 September 2018 8.67 Where the cumulative dividend paid on or before 30 September 2018 is less than 8.67, the following process determines the number of shares vesting:- 1 The number of shares capable of vesting is calculated on the level of dividend paid and capable of being paid as at 30 September 2018.
2 The exercise price of the shares capable of vesting is set by reducing the original exercise price of 13 by the level of cumulative dividend actually paid on or before 30 September 2021.
3 No shares will vest until the end of the 2011 LTIP period on 30 September 2021 subject to the participants continued employment at this date.
For example:- A participant is granted an award over 3 million shares On 30 September 2018 it is determined that an additional 3 per share is capable of being paid as well as i V i `iLivi-iiLixv{{}} v{ Therefore the number of shares capable of vesting on 30 September 2021 is as follows:- 3 million shares x 7.34 1,693,846 shares 13 with an exercise price initially per share of 8.66 13 - 4.34.
If, however, the actual dividend payments made on or before 30 September 2021 exceed 4.34 the exercise price will be reduced to 13 minus the actual level of dividends paid.
For example if the actual dividend paid was 10 the exercise price would reduce to 3 13 - 10.
The number of shares capable of vesting would, however, remain unchanged with the balance incapable of vesting having lapsed on 1 October 2018.
30 September 2021 13.00 The process is the same as above with the relevant date being 30 September 2021.

98 Berkeley Annual Report 2012 Governance Governance OTHER SENIOR EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY The Companys business comprises of a number of operating Divisions.
The Committee in conjunction with the Board has, therefore, implemented both annual and longer term cash based compensation arrangements for these other senior employees of the Company linked to the performance of the relevant Division for which they work.
Some elements of the cash bonus plans are annual while other elements are deferred to ensure long-term consistent delivery by each Division.
The Committee, in line with best practice, continually reviews with the Board the policy behind the compensation plans at this level in the Company to ensure they remain appropriate to the market and the Companys current circumstances.
It is the view of both the Committee and the Board as a whole that these arrangements are very effective at ensuring the delivery of Divisional performance for which these senior employees are responsible.
Both the Committee and the Board believe that having senior employees focused on the delivery of Divisional results is an excellent way of driving shareholder value.
A number of senior employees of the Company have also been granted awards under the 2009 LTIP Part B. SHAREHOLDING REQUIREMENT The Company has a shareholding requirement for both Executive and Non-executive Directors and these requirements and the actual shareholdings of the Executive and Non-executive Directors as at 30 April 2012 are set out in the following tables: A W Pidgley R C Perrins N G Simpkin G J Fry K Whiteman S Ellis Shareholder requirements as a % age of salary to be met within 5 years of appointment 400% 200% 200% 200% 200% 200% Current shareholding as a % age of salary based on 30 April 2012 share price 10,604% 4,093% 128% 3,900% 170% 47% V M Mitchell J Armitt D Howell A C Coppin A Nimmo G Barker V Wadley Shareholder requirements as a % age of net fees to be met within 3 years of appointment 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% Current shareholding as a % age of net fees based on 30 April 2012 share price 419% 252% 131% 131% 88% 345% DILUTION The 2009 LTIP and 2011 LTIP were special arrangements, approved by shareholders at the EGM in April 2009 and AGM in September 2011 respectively.
In considering dilution under the 2011 LTIP the Committee took account of the long term nature of the plan which extends beyond the length of normal incentive plans.
In addition, the Committee took into account the significant priority returns of 13 per share representing 183% of Net Assets at 30 April 2011 that shareholders will receive from the plan over this 10 year period, with the actual value of the awards to the Executive Directors based on the ongoing value of the Group following this significant realisation of current value to the existing shareholders.
Historically the Company has operated all its share plans within the ABI dilution limits.
There has been no dilution other than under these special arrangements for the purposes of the ABI dilution limits in the year ended 30 April 2012.
Berkeley Annual Report 2012 99 Governance REMUNERATION REPORT OTHER REMUNERATION MATTERS All Employee Share Plans The Company has regularly consulted widely with the management and individuals in its operating Divisions on whether it was appropriate to introduce all employee share plans.
The consensus view remains that employees preferred the opportunity of receiving annual cash bonuses based on the performance of their respective Divisions rather than participate in a Group based all employee share plan.
The Board, therefore, does not believe it is in shareholders interests to incur the income statement and dilutive cost of share arrangements which would not have the desired effect on employees.
Accordingly the Company will continue to operate appropriate annual bonus arrangements in all of its Divisions.
Non-executive Directors Fees All Non-executive Directors have specic terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set by the Articles of Association.
The following table sets out the fee rates for the Non-executive Directors in the year ended 30 April 2012 and those rates which will apply in the year ending 30 April 2013: V M Mitchell J Armitt D Howell A C Coppin A Nimmo G Barker V Wadley Total Fee Rates 2012 13 100,000 80,000 67,500 67,500 55,000 55,000 55,000 1 1 1 1 Total Fee Rates 2011 12 100,000 80,000 67,500 67,500 50,000 50,000 50,000 % Increase 0% 0% 0% 0% 10% 10% 10% Breakdown of 2012 13 Fee 2 3 Basic Fee 100,000 67,500 55,000 55,000 55,000 55,000 55,000 Chair of Committee Fee 12,500 12,500 12,500 Committee Chair Sustainability Audit Remuneration and Health & Safety 1 Where Directors joined during the year or assumed additional responsibilities, fees have been annualised to allow a direct comparison 6V ViL VviiiyiVii i vi `-i Vi`ii ``vi ` the AGM on 5 September 2012 - L VviiiyiVii `ii`i iV-LiViiiV i ]iLiVi i of the Board from that date and his total fees will increase accordingly to 100,000 per annum The Board reviews the fees of the Non-executive Directors annually taking into account the following factors: Ui ` `iiviLvi iiVi iV`iiV }}V i}i ViiiV v i`i `iiii iL`i ` UiVi i ivviiv iiVi iV The basic fee for the new Non-executive Directors for 2012 13 has been increased to the basic fee level for the existing Non-executive Directors.
Non-executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Companys share incentive plans or performance based plans and are not eligible to join the Companys pension scheme.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS CONTRACTS The policy on termination is that the Company does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations.
The only event on the occurrence of which the Company is potentially liable to make a payment to any of the Executive Directors is on cessation of iii iLi} i`iii iiiiiv liquidation.
In addition, Executive Directors will be expected to mitigate their loss.
Further, the Committee ensures that there have been no unjustified payments for failure.
None of the Executive Directors contracts provides for liquidated damages.
There are no special provisions contained in any of the Executive Directors contracts which provide for longer periods of notice on a change of control of the Company.
Further, there are no special provisions providing for additional compensation on an Executive Directors cessation of employment with the Company.
The Company settled the litigation brought by Tony Carey against The Berkeley Group plc, St George PLC and other parties for age discrimination and unfair dismissal for 5 million prior to the year end and shortly before the commencement of a three week hearing in the Employment Tribunal.
The Boards decision to settle was unanimous having regard to legal advice, the size of the claim and the inevitable diversion of resources to run the action.
Following the settlement, option rights over 1,388,390 shares, being 888,390 options under Part A and 500,000 options under Part B of the 2009 LTIP, have been cancelled.
