I am very aware of how important it is to get the strategy, structure and levels of remuneration right for the groups executive directors and other members of the senior management team.
A responsible approach to remuneration should always support the companys overall strategic aims and objectives, not dictate them.
Furthermore shareholders should be able to clearly understand and appreciate the link between reward and performance.
This year, at Berendsen, we have focused on remuneration being accountable and transparent t by providing clear and relevant reporting for how we recognise and reward employees at all levels as we work towards delivering our stated business aims and objectives.
