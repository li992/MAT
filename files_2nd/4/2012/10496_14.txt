Remuneration report Introduction from the DLC remuneration committee chairman I am pleased to present the report of the remuneration committee the Committee for the year to 31 December 2012.
The report also includes the remuneration policy for the 2013 year.
The Committee has chosen to introduce the general structure and format of remuneration reporting that will apply under the UK Governments forthcoming reform of the regulations.
Mondi has again delivered strong financial performance in 2012, as detailed in other parts of the Integrated report and financial statements 2012.
Mondis Total Shareholder Return for the three years to 31 December 2012 was more than 140%, placing it above the upper quartile for companies in its sector, and Return on Capital Employed for 2012 was 13.7%.
This robust financial performance is reflected in the annual bonus payments and long-term incentive vesting for executive directors.
Half of the annual bonus is awarded in Mondi shares, deferred for three years.
Base salary increases for executive directors effective 1 January 2012 were below 3%.
Base salary increases effective 1 January 2013 will once again not exceed 3% for the chief executive and chief executive officer Europe & International.
After careful consideration, and consultation with major shareholders, the Committee has awarded the chief financial officer an exceptional, one-off increase in base salary of 8% effective 1 January 2013.
This sets his base salary at 500,000, which results in overall compensation that is consistent with the median for companies of Mondis size and international scope.
This recognises Andrews strong track record of performance in the role and the value of his contribution to the Group and its shareholders.
Despite Mondis share price growth, the Committee has continued to set the LTIP grant sizes as a percentage of base salary for Mondis executive directors below the market median for companies of Mondis size, and also lower than the maximum permitted under the Plan rules.
The Committee has increased the Return on Capital Employed performance requirement to 16% from 14%, at the top end of the scale, for LTIP grants in 2013.
This is the second time the Committee has raised this bar in the last three years.
Half of the LTIP award is dependent on Return on Capital Employed, while the other half depends on Mondis relative Total Shareholder Return, both measured over three years.
Currently, share awards under the LTIP do not qualify for the dividends shareholders receive.
The Committee is seeking approval at the annual general meetings to apply, effective from the 2013 LTIP grant, dividend accrual equivalent to other shareholders, but only to the extent that LTIP awards meet the performance conditions.
The Committee maintains a dialogue with major shareholders on remuneration matters, and aims to ensure that pay policy for executives is clear and simple, supports the business strategy and is closely aligned to the interests of Mondis shareholders.
The Committee would be pleased to have your support.

indd 80 2013 03 04 3:00 PM DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Overview Performance Governance Structure of the report This report has three sections.
The first section deals with the structure and role of the DLC remuneration committee.
The second and third sections the remuneration policy report and the remuneration implementation report respectively represent a new way of structuring the remuneration report and have been introduced in accordance with forthcoming UK reporting regulations applicable to financial reporting periods ending on or after 1 October 2013.
The remuneration policy report, which will in future years be subject to a binding shareholder vote, includes: a description of the Groups remuneration policy: a policy table which outlines the features of key elements of remuneration: an outline of remuneration scenarios for executive directors at different performance levels: executive directors shareholding requirements: the terms of executive directors service contracts: the Groups policy on exit payments: and descriptions of how shareholder views, and the conditions of other employees in the Group, are taken into account in the Committees deliberations about executive pay.
The remuneration implementation report details the earnings of directors in respect of the year under review.
The DLC remuneration committee The DLC remuneration committee the Committee is a formal committee of the Boards.
Its remit is set out in terms of reference adopted by the Boards.
A copy of the terms of reference is available on the Groups website at www.
The primary purposes of the Committee, as set out in its terms of reference, are: to make recommendations to the Boards on the Groups framework of executive remuneration: to determine individual remuneration packages within that framework for the executive directors and certain senior executives: to determine the remuneration of the joint chairmen: and to oversee the operation of the Groups share schemes.
The members of the Committee are Anne Quinn chairman of the Committee, Stephen Harris, Imogen Mkhize and David Williams, all of whom are independent non-executive directors.
David Williams is joint chairman of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc and Anne Quinn is senior independent director.
Philip Laubscher and Carol Hunt act as secretary to the Committee.
The Group head of reward, Paul Wessels, provides advice on remuneration policies and practices and is usually invited to attend meetings of the Committee, along with David Hathorn, the chief executive officer and Cyril Ramaphosa, joint chairman.
No director or other attendee takes part in any discussion regarding his or her personal remuneration.
Remuneration policy report The Groups remuneration policy has been set with the objective of attracting, motivating and retaining high calibre directors, managers and employees in a manner that is consistent with best practice and aligned with the interests of the Groups shareholders.
Remuneration policy for executive directors and other senior managers is framed around the following key principles: remuneration packages should be set at levels that are competitive in the relevant market: the structure of remuneration packages and, in particular, the design of performance-based remuneration schemes, should be aligned with shareholders interests and should support the achievement of the Groups business strategy and the management of risk: a significant proportion of the remuneration of executive directors and other senior executives should be performance-based: the performance-based element of remuneration should be appropriately balanced between the achievement of short-term objectives and longer-term objectives: and the remuneration of executive directors and other senior executives will be set taking appropriate account of remuneration and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group.
indd 81 2013 03 04 3:00 PM Remuneration report continued Remuneration policy table The executive directors throughout the period under review were David Hathorn, Andrew King and Peter Oswald.

Discretionary Share Option Plans and all-employee share plans In addition to the LTIP and BSP, Mondi Limited and Mondi plc have both adopted Discretionary Share Option Plans.
No grants have been made under these plans and there is no current intention to make such grants.
The Group currently operates two HM Revenue & Customs approved all-employee share plans in the UK.
Details of these plans, and the participation of eligible directors, are presented on page 93.

indd 83 2013 03 04 3:00 PM Remuneration report continued The most senior executives in the Group participate in the LTIP and the BSP.
Both of these plans deliver part of the remuneration in Mondi shares, thereby enhancing alignment of the interests of executives with those of shareholders.
The principle of performance based pay is well-established in Mondi: more than 60% of Mondis employees participate in a variable pay programme.
Share ownership requirements The chief executive officer is required to build a shareholding equivalent to 150% of base salary, and other executive directors a shareholding equivalent to at least 100% of base salary, over a period of not more than five years from the date of appointment to the Boards.
As at 31 December 2012, all executive directors had met the shareholding requirements.
Executive directors service contracts David Hathorn and Andrew King are employed under service contracts with both Mondi Limited and Mondi plc.
Peter Oswald is employed in Austria under a service contract with Mondi Services AG.
The Groups policy is that executive directors service contracts should provide for one years notice by either party, except where a longer notice period is appropriate as a transitional measure, in which case the notice period would reduce automatically to one year within a reasonable period of time.
The service contracts for David Hathorn and Andrew King provide for one years notice by either party.
The service contract for Peter Oswald is required under Austrian law to be for a fixed period, which expires on 30 April 2016.
However, the contract has been structured in such a manner that it can be terminated on one years notice by either party.
Details of the service contracts of the executive directors who served during the period under review are as follows: Executive director Effective date of contract Unexpired term notice period David Hathorn 3 July 2007 Terminable on 12 months notice Andrew King 23 October 2008 Terminable on 12 months notice Peter Oswald 1 January 2008 A fixed term expiring on 30 April 2016 but terminable at any time on 12 months notice Exit payments In the event of early termination of service contracts, the Groups policy is to act fairly in all circumstances.
The duty to mitigate is taken into account and the Group has due regard to the requirements of legislation, regulation and good governance.
The service contracts for David Hathorn and Andrew King contain pay in lieu of notice provisions which may be invoked at the discretion of the Group.
The payment in lieu of notice would comprise salary, car allowance and pension contributions for the notice period and an amount in respect of the bonus for that part of the financial year worked.

The contract provides, in addition to such other rights as he may have on termination of the contract by his employer other than for cause, for a payment which reflects an entitlement he had in Austrian law under his previous service contract.

The Committee annually receives a report from management on pay practices across the Group, including salary levels and trends, collective bargaining outcomes and bonus participation.
At the time that salary increases are considered, the Committee additionally receives a report on the approach management propose to adopt to general staff increases.
Both these reports are taken into account in the Committees decisions about the remuneration of executive directors and other senior executives.
Shareholder context At the 2012 annual general meetings of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc 98.8% of votes were cast in favour of the Mondi Limited resolution to approve the remuneration policy and 98.79% of votes were cast in favour of the Mondi plc resolution to approve the remuneration report.
The Committee considers the views of shareholders in its deliberations about the remuneration of executive directors and other senior executives, and consults directly with major shareholders when any material changes to policy are being considered.
In December 2012 the Committee consulted with Mondis 20 largest shareholders about changes that were being considered.

The value of Mondi plc shares increased from 1.29 to 6.04, and the value of Mondi Limited shares from R23.01 to R71.19 during this time.
Current salary levels, and increases awarded in January 2013, are as follows: From 1 January 2013 From 1 January 2012 Increase 1 David Hathorn 846,000 822,000 2.9% 1,2 Andrew King 500,000 463,000 8.0% Peter Oswald E872,000 E847,000 3.0% 1 David Hathorns and Andrew Kings salaries are denominated in pounds sterling.
In the remuneration tables on pages 86 and 94 euro amounts are reported based on exchange rates on the dates actual payments were made.
2 After consultation with major shareholders, the Committee implemented a one-off exceptional base salary increase for Andrew King.
The Committee examined market data for UK-listed and dual-listed companies with comparable sales turnover to Mondi and which, like Mondi, have the majority of their operations and sales outside the UK.
The new base salary places Andrew approximately at market median for this peer group.
However, Andrews total target and maximum remuneration remain below the market median.
Andrew has a strong track record of performance in the role, and his experience and skills have significant value for Mondi and its shareholders.

David Hathorn remains eligible for a bonus of up to 150% of salary in respect of 2013 and the other executive directors for a bonus of up to 120% of salary.
Half of any bonus earned will be paid out in cash and the other half will be deferred for three years in conditional Mondi shares.
For 2013, the existing bonus structure will be retained.
Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP awards that were made in 2009, with a three year performance period that ended on 31 December 2011, were reviewed by the Committee in February 2012 against the equally weighted relative Total Shareholder Return TSR and Return on Capital Employed ROCE performance conditions.
Maximum performance was achieved against the TSR target and 84.06% of maximum was achieved against the ROCE target.
92.03% of the shares under award therefore vested in March 2012 and the remainder lapsed.
The maximum award that can be made to any LTIP participant in any year is equal to two times salary.
For 2012, the award made to David Hathorn was 175% of salary and the awards made to Andrew King and Peter Oswald were 120% of salary.
For the LTIP awards made in 2012, the performance conditions are based on two performance measures of equal weight TSR and ROCE, measured over a three year performance period ending on 31 December 2014.
The Committee believes that this combination of metrics provides an appropriate means of aligning the operation of the LTIP with shareholders interests and the Groups business strategy.
indd 87 2013 03 04 3:00 PM Remuneration report continued The TSR performance condition is based on the Groups TSR relative to a group of competitor companies.
For the 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 LTIP awards, the following group of companies was selected: Billerud Norske Skog David S Smith Portucel Holmen Sappi 2 International Paper SCA 2009, 2010, 2011 Mayr-Melnhof Smurfit Kappa MeadWestvaco Stora Enso M-Real UPM 1 1 Domtar 2010, 2011 and 2012 Weyerhaeuser 2009 1 As previously reported, Weyerhaeuser was replaced with Domtar in 2010 as its business structure is considered closer to Mondis.
2 SCA was removed from the peer group for 2012 and subsequent awards following the sale of SCA Packaging to DS Smith.
For the 50% of awards attributable to TSR: If the Groups TSR is below the median when ranked against the comparator group, this part of the award will lapse in full.
For TSR at the median, 25% of this part of the award i. e. 12.5% of the total award will vest, with a straight-line progression to the upper quartile, at which point 100% of this part of the award i. e. 50% of the total award will vest in full.
For the 50% of awards attributable to ROCE: This part will lapse in full if ROCE is below 10%.
25% of this part of the award i. e. 12.5% of the total award will vest for achievement of ROCE of 10%, with a straight-line progression to full vesting of this part of the award for achievement of ROCE of 14% i. e. 50% of the total award.
The Committee intends to retain these performance conditions for the LTIP awards to be made in 2013, with a more demanding ROCE performance range of 10% to 16% rather than 10% to 14%.
For 2013, the Committee intends to make an award to David Hathorn of 185% of salary and of 130% of salary to Andrew King and Peter Oswald.
For the 2013 LTIP awards, following the acquisition of Nordenia and the Duropack operations in Germany and the Czech Republic and the disposal of Aylesford Newsprint, Norske Skog will be excluded from the peer group and Amcor and Bemis will be added.
