Based on the Companys EPS growth for the three years ended 31 December 2012, the Committee has determined that the LTIP vests in full.
The market price at vesting is an estimate of the value using the average price of a Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc share for the three months to 31 December 2012 which was 4.923.
The award will time-vest on 16 September 2013. c The number of shares subject to awards was calculated using the middle market price of a Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc share for the 5 days prior to the grant.
50% of each award of shares is linked to growth in EPS in real terms over three consecutive years and 50% is linked to TSR compared with companies in the FTSE250.
The awards will vest subject to meeting the two performance conditions.
d Richard Hartman retired as Chief Executive Officer on 27 June 2011 and stood down from the Board on 3 May 2012.
Long-term incentive awards made to Mr Hartman were unaffected by his retirement and vesting was subject to applicable performance conditions in accordance with the rules of the Long-Term Incentive Plan.
