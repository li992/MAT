The committee believes that it is important LTIP is currently the only long-term incentive scheme in place to keep under review whether these measures continue to be for the executive directors and other senior executives.
The incentives offered under both Rank Group Plc 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan the 2005 the 2005 LTIP and the 2010 LTIP have been set at robust, yet LTIP expired in April 2010 and two contingent share awards reasonably achievable, levels.

The Rank Group Plc: Annual report and financial statements 2012 79 DIRECTORS REPORT: GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Future long-term incentive arrangements The committee is considering the implementation of a new long-term incentive scheme to replace the 2010 LTIP.
The committee has, through its chair, consulted its majority shareholder and its four next largest shareholders with regard to their views on performance related pay, and in particular long-term incentives.
The committees deliberations on how such a scheme might work are still at an early stage but it is intended to revert to shareholders with a scheme for their approval in due course.
Change of control of Rank As discussed on page 72, on 7 June 2012 there was a change of control of Rank for the purposes of the rules of both the 2005 LTIP and the 2010 LTIP.

The executive directors interests in the 2005 LTIP and the 2010 LTIP are detailed in Table 3, page 85.
The committee considered the implications of the change of control given that the rules of the 2005 LTIP provided that, on a change of control, all outstanding LTIPs should vest on a pro-rated basis unless the remuneration committee in its absolute discretion determined otherwise and given that the rules of the 2010 LTIP provided that, on a change of control, the committee had absolute discretion as to whether and on what basis awards would vest.
In order to assist its deliberations, the committee took advice from its remuneration consultants, Towers Watson, having regard to the then most recent internal EPS projections vs. EPS performance targets, the length of the remainder of the performance period, total shareholder return, institutional shareholder representative body guidelines and illustrative market practice and advice from Ranks external lawyers, who advised on the interpretation of the rules of both the 2005 LTIP and 2010 LTIP.
The committee also took into account the views of the Companys majority shareholder.
With regard to the 2009 award, given that there were only approximately 28 weeks to run until the end of the performance period and given that the then internal EPS projection for the performance period end was 28% higher than the level required for maximum vesting, the committee resolved that this award should vest in full as a consequence of the change of control.
The actual EPS at 31 December 2011 the end of the performance period was 10.7p more than 125% of the level required for maximum vesting.
Further information relating to this vesting is contained in the notes to Table 3 in the audited section of this report on page 85.
With regard to the 2010 and 2011 awards, the committee considered that it was not in the interests of shareholders that these awards should vest in advance of their normal earliest vesting dates namely, as soon as practicable following the third anniversary of their respective dates of grant.
Equally, the committee considered that it would be inappropriate for the 2010 and 2011 awards to lapse immediately following the change of control given the unusual circumstances of the change of control and the fact that the Company was to remain a listed company after the change of control.
A key objective was to retain and motivate the senior management team.
Therefore, the committee, after consultation with its majority shareholder, determined that it would be in the best interests of the Company to preserve the 2010 and 2011 awards and allow them to vest at their respective normal vesting dates subject to the existing performance conditions.
The Rank Group Plc: Annual report and financial statements 2012 80 DIRECTORS REPORT: GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Active LTIP awards and targets as at 30 June 2012 2010 award 2011 award 3yr 2012 EPS target 3yr 2013 EPS target Plan 2010 LTIP 2010 LTIP Dates of grant 22 Apr 10 11 Mar 11 10 May 10 04 Aug 11 1 Aug 10 01 Jan 10 to 01 Jan 11 to Performance period 31 Dec 12 31 Dec 13 Earliest vest dates 22 Apr 13 11 Mar 14 10 May 13 04 Aug 14 1 Aug 13 Award size % of base salary 75% 75% Threshold vesting % 25% 25% Minimum adjusted EPS threshold vest 9.5p 12.0p Maximum adjusted EPS 100% vest 11.5p 14.0p Mean consensus EPS forecast prior to grant 9.5p 11.7p No individual director or other senior executive has been granted more than one performance share award in a calendar year.
The committee has considered whether the performance periods for the active LTIP awards should be altered having regard to the Companys change of accounting reference period and has concluded that it is not necessary and that it might indeed be potentially more complicated to attempt this.
The executive directors interests in the 2005 LTIP and the 2010 LTIP are detailed in Table 3 on page 85.
Exceptional discretionary bonus Several years ago the chief executive recommended to the board that the Group endeavour to reclaim from Her Majestys Revenue & Customs HMRC VAT that had been wrongly paid by various Rank Group companies to HMRC over a number of years.
Considerable time and effort went into the making of these claims by the chief executive and the current finance director whilst he was the Groups financial controller.
At the time of setting targets for the 2011 annual cash bonus, it was not envisaged that the final outcome of the litigation would be known in relation to any part of the claims during that financial period.
As has already been announced, during the period under review, Rank was successful in reclaiming a significant sum of money from HMRC which is no longer subject to the risk of further litigation by HMRC.
This has signicantly strengthened Ranks balance sheet for the long-term benefit of shareholders.
On the recommendation of the majority shareholder, the committee considered making a one-off discretionary payment to the executive directors and another senior manager involved in the process in order to recognise their efforts over several years in bringing a number of Ranks claims to a successful and final conclusion.
The committee sought the views of the Companys four largest institutional shareholders with regard to the proposed discretionary bonus payments and was mindful of their comments.
After careful consideration the committee resolved that it would be appropriate to reward those involved in the claims by reference to a percentage 0.5% of the net value of the claims that were no longer subject to any further challenge by HMRC net meaning after deduction of all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the claims but also subject to a further cap such that no individual would receive a payment of more than one times his basic salary.
The committee also determined that the amounts paid to the executive directors would be paid in three equal instalments between September 2012 and December 2013.
In order for an instalment to be paid, it is a requirement that the executive director is employed by Rank and is not in a notice period.
Therefore the committee has resolved to make the following discretionary exceptional bonus payments in respect of the period ended 30 June 2012: September 2012 April 2013 December 2013 Total Chief executive 175,100 175,100 175,100 525,300 Finance director 76,667 76,666 76,667 230,000 Total 755,300 The committee would like to emphasise that this is an exceptional reward for exceptional efforts on behalf of the executives in creating additional sustainable long-term shareholder value via the transformation of the Companys balance sheet.
It has been included within Exceptional items in note 4 to the financial statements.
The Rank Group Plc: Annual report and financial statements 2012 81 DIRECTORS REPORT: GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Directors shareholdings Until October 2011, independent non-executive directors were using between 30% and 40% of their base net fees after tax to purchase ordinary shares in the Company at quarterly intervals, with the intention that such shares be retained throughout their tenure of service.
Similarly, the Group had guidelines for executive shareholding which were set as a percentage of base salary and in respect of which executives had five years from appointment to build up.
These guidelines were as follows: Chief executive 150% Finance director 100% Other executive committee members 50% Shareholdings of directors of the Company and its subsidiaries are not considered to be in public hands for the purposes of determining the sufciency of the percentage of shares in public hands the free oat in the context of qualication for a listing on the UKLAs premium market.
In view of the low level of free oat following the completion of Guoco Group Limiteds general offer for Rank in July 2011, the non-executive director quarterly share purchase programme and the shareholding guidelines for executive directors and other members of the executive committee who are directors of Rank subsidiary companies were suspended pending a restoration of the Companys free oat to a higher level.

2 The Rank Group 2005 Share Savings Scheme.
No awards have been made to any Rank director or employee since the awards made on 3 October 2007.
3 The Rank Group 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme.
No options under this scheme have been made to any Rank director or employee since the options granted on 12 September 2006.
2 At its meeting in February 2011, the committee determined that the award would not vest.
Whilst, on the basis of the adjusted EPS measure alone, 58% of the award was due to vest, the committee considered the Groups four-year TSR performance over the same period.
Given Ranks performance, relative to the FTSE-350, the committee was of the view that it was inappropriate for any part of the award to vest.
3 At its meeting in February 2011, the committee determined that the award would vest in full.
On the basis of the EPS measure, 100% of the award was eligible to vest and given the Groups signicantly improved three-year TSR performance over the same period, relative to the FTSE-350, the committee was of the view that the award should vest in full.
4 At its meeting in June 2011, the committee determined that the award would vest in full.
For further information, please see page 80.
5 Paddy Gallagher left the Company on 6 November 2011 whereupon all his outstanding contingent share awards lapsed.
