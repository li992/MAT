com Remuneration for Senior Managers As for Executive Directors, it is the Companys policy that a substantial proportion of remuneration should be performance related in order to encourage and reward superior business performance and shareholder returns and that remuneration should be linked to both individual and Company performance.
Basic salary is targeted at normal commercial rates for comparable roles and is benchmarked on a regular basis.
Bonuses of up to 100% of salary can be earned on the same basis as the Executive Directors.
Senior Executives immediately below the Board also benefit from participation in the PSP, with other key senior managers participating in the CSOS.
Share Plans Summary While committed to the use of equity-based performance-related remuneration as a means of aligning Directors interests with those of shareholders, the Committee is aware of shareholders concerns on dilution through the issue of new shares to satisfy such awards.
Therefore, when reviewing remuneration arrangements, the Committee takes into account the effects such arrangements may have on dilution.
Halfords intends to comply with the ABI guidelines relating to the issue of new shares for equity incentive plans.
The current 10 year shareholder dilution is 2.60% [2011: 4.31%].
