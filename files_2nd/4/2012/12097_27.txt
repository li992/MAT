Committee decision Having reviewed all of the facts the Committee agreed that a deduction of 15% of the maximum shares that could vest under the Operating Condition was appropriate.
The deduction was made to take account of the failure to meet the Companys production targets in 2010 and a capital project that exceeded budget.
85% of the shares subject to the Operating Conditions target will, therefore, vest equating to 42.5% of the total shares subject to the 2009 LTIP Awards.
No shares subject to the TSR performance condition will vest.
As stated above, it is the intention of the Committee that these shares will vest in early April 2013 following the announcement of the Companys 2012 full year results.
