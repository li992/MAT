Governance REMUNERATION REPORT Remuneration Committee Report Carl Symon, Chairman Members Dear Shareholders, Carl Symon Chairman, Lee McIntire, Over the last year, the Committee has focused on the simplification of our long-term Nick Rose incentive arrangements.

The current environment is increasingly the Executive Committee EC, the Company competitive and, to deliver growth in shareholder value, we are focused on generating Secretary and other senior executives strong cash flows and profits.
Improving efficiency in our operations will also make us Within the agreed policy, determining more competitive to win future business.
Each year, the Board agrees the Executive individual remuneration packages for the Committees key objectives which are critical to delivering the Groups strategy.
For Chairman, executive directors and EC 2013, these are set out on page 11, and are used as the basis to set the individual members objectives for the executive directors and Executive Committee members which are agreed by the Chairman, Dick Olver, and the Remuneration Committee.
These then Agreeing the policy on terms and conditions to flow down to the senior leadership team to ensure that all businesses within the Group be included in service agreements for the are aligned with the overall Group strategy.
Chairman, executive directors, EC members, the Company Secretary and other senior Our remuneration strategy is intended to recognise this business environment, whilst executives, including termination payments fostering a Total Performance culture at all levels of the Group.
Given the maturity of and compensation commitments, where the Group, certain areas of corporate responsibility, such as diversity and inclusion, applicable will not be specifically incentivised in 2013.
In determining the levels of executive reward, the Remuneration Committee believes it is of utmost importance to ensure a Approving any employee share-based strong link between actual remuneration received and the achievement of our incentive schemes and any performance strategic and business objectives.
The remuneration strategy incentivises executives conditions to be used for such schemes to deliver their contribution and rewards them for the achievement of the Groups Determining any share scheme performance strategy through a combination of short-term incentives targeted at Group targets performance, business performance, personal performance and leadership behaviours, and long-term incentives targeted at Group performance and business performance in the case of our US senior executives.
To directly align short-term and long-term reward, executive directors will be required to defer at least one-third of their net 2013 annual incentive into shares when the annual incentive is paid in 2014.
The combination of the annual incentive plan, PSP and share options provides a balance between short-term cash reward and longer-term share-based reward.
The proportion of the incentive package delivered through longer-term performance is significantly higher at stretch pay-out than at on-target, demonstrating that the package supports the achievement of superior long-term performance and strongly aligns the interests of executives to those of shareholders by delivering long-term reward in shares.
Achieving strong performance on the in-year measures is important but, to maximise the value of their incentive package, executives need to realise growth in long-term EPS, TSR and share price.
In 2012, our performance against targets was as follows.
Our EPS of 38.6p underlying EPS adjusted to exclude the effect of foreign exchange was below threshold: the stretch target for both year-end and average cash was achieved.
Our TSR performance reflects the sustained under-performance of our share price.
The reported diluted underlying EPS of 38.8p is below the level required for any vesting of PSP and SMP long-term incentives awarded in 2010.
This result of 38.8p will form the baseline EPS figure against which performance of the 2013 PSP award will be measured.
Against this performance background, the main aspects of our remuneration policy and practice for the year were as follows: For 2013, the salaries of the Chief Executive, Group Finance Director and the President and Chief Executive Officer of BAESystems, Inc. were frozen.
There will be no increase in base compensation and no increase in earnings opportunity flowing through the rest of the package.

The Committee intends to implement a simple bonus deferral and claw back mechanism, in line with UK shareholder and regulatory guidance and without matching provisions.
As currently, it is proposed that one third of the annual incentive will be compulsorily deferred into shares without performance conditions and will be held for a minimum of three years, with claw back provisions in the event that performance is subsequently found to have been misstated.
We are retaining our requirement for executive directors to build up a significant personal shareholding and increasing the minimum shareholding requirements for the Chief Executive from 200% to 300% of salary.
Reflecting US market practice, the shareholding requirement for the President and Chief Executive Officer of BAESystems, Inc. was increased substantially last year from 200% to 350% of salary.
We will add order intake as a third financial metric within the Annual Incentive Plan to sit alongside EPS and cash, to ensure an appropriate alignment with the Boards strategic growth objectives.

provide a competitive package of benefits.
How remuneration is reviewed In determining the levels of executive reward, the Remuneration Committee believes it is of utmost importance to ensure a strong link between actual remuneration received and the achievement of our strategic and business objectives.
In 2012, information on the market for comparable positions was provided by  so that the Committee could form a view as to where to position the various elements of the package relative to comparable companies.
Appropriate comparator groups are constructed for the individual positions, taking account of company size, scale of operations and breadth of role.
The comparator group for the UK executive directors review in 2012 comprised 27 FTSE 100 companies where BAESystems was positioned towards the median in terms of market capitalisation and which the Committee believes is appropriate for benchmarking UK executive directors packages.
For the President and Chief Executive Officer of BAESystems, Inc. the comparator group for 2012 was drawn from companies in the US aerospace, defence and general industry sector, adjusted, as appropriate, to produce market figures consistent with the size, scale and relative independence of the US business, and adjusting where necessary to reflect the extra responsibility for her plc Board role.
The base salary, total cash reward base salary plus annual incentive, total direct reward total cash reward plus long-term incentives and total reward total direct reward plus pension are analysed at the lower quartile, median and upper quartile for the relevant posts in the comparator group companies.
This gives the Committee a view on the competitiveness of the individual elements of the package as well as the package as a whole.
The Committee also reviews market trends around the individual elements of remuneration to ensure that the structure of the package is appropriately aligned with market practice.
The remuneration structure overall also takes account of the performance of the individual, the Company as a whole, and the pay and conditions of Group employees.
For 2012, the review indicated that the structure is broadly in line with the relevant market.
In setting remuneration levels, the Committee is also sensitive to the pay and conditions of other employees within the Group.
Many of our employees work at the very leading edge of technology.
We have a diverse workforce operating in many countries.
Employee remuneration packages are therefore determined locally to meet local needs, whilst respecting our culture and values.
In 2012, general salary increases for our two largest employee populations in the UK and US typically averaged 3% and 3.5%, respectively.
The Committee intends to continue to flow down executive remuneration policy as detailed in this report to Executive Committee members and to the most senior executives within the Group globally to maintain a consistent approach to global reward.
The principles of the remuneration strategy are applied consistently across the Group below this level, taking account of seniority and local market practice.

BAE Systems Annual Report 2012 103 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Summary of Long-Term Incentive Plans Plan provisions Performance conditions for grants of awards to be made under the Performance Share Plan, the Share Option Plan and investment of the 2012 annual incentive deferral into the Share Matching Plan in 2013 are detailed below.
Performance conditions for grants of awards made prior to 2013 are detailed on page 111.
Clawback arrangements have operated in respect of the Performance Share Plan and Share Matching Plan from the 2010 awards onwards, and have operated for grants under the Share Option Plan since its inception.
The arrangements are intended to cover situations, for example, where results are restated or otherwise turn out to be materially inaccurate or where the executives employment can be terminated for cause.
Performance Share Plan PSP Key features for PSP awards in 2013: awards of shares are granted based on a percentage of salary and share price at the date of grant: the shares are subject to satisfaction of three-year performance conditions: TSR half the PSP award will be based on a Total Shareholder Return TSR performance condition PSP and the other half on an Earnings per EPS Share PSP performance condition.
For US participants, the first half of the award will be based on long-term operating cash performance measured at the level of the US businesses, reflecting an increased emphasis from shareholders on cash flow generation: TSR in addition, there is a further test on the PSP element to ensure that the TSR performance is supported by the underlying performance of the Company: shares under award after satisfaction of the performance condition vest at the end of year three.
Awards that vest are exercisable in three tranches between the third and seventh anniversary of vesting.
For US participants, the awards are automatically delivered at the end of years three, four and five, subject to the performance condition being achieved: and shares under award attract dividends prior to vesting.

110 BAE Systems Annual Report 2012 Governance Notes to Table B Performance Share Plan PSP A full description of the PSP is set out on pages 104 and 105.
PSP awards granted since 2008 attract dividends prior to vesting.
TSR PSP nil vesting if the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR at the end of the three-year performance period is outside the top 50% of TSRs achieved by a sectoral comparator group: 25% vesting if TSR is at median 50% : and 100% vesting if TSR is in the top 20%, with vesting on a straight-line basis between these two points.
A secondary financial measure is also used see page 105.
For US participants, this part of OCF the award is based on long-term operating cash flow performance measured at the level of the US businesses PSP, reflecting an increased emphasis from shareholders on cash generation.
EPS PSP proportion of the award exercisable is determined by the rate of average annual EPS growth over the three-year performance period, with nil vesting at average annual EPS growth of 5% or less, 100% vesting at 11% growth, and vesting on a straight-line basis between these two points.
Awards that vest are exercisable in three tranches at the end of years three, four and five except for US executives where the awards are automatically delivered at the end of years three, four and five, subject to the performance condition being achieved.
Executive Share Option Plan ExSOP The Plan was established in 2001 and its ten-year life expired in 2011.
No options have been granted under it since 2007.
Options granted under this Plan are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of grant.
The maximum duration of an option is ten years.
i 2005-2007 grants 33.33% of each option grant is exercisable if the Company achieves on average real EPS growth pa of 3% but less than 4% over the three-year performance period: 66.67% for real EPS growth pa of 4% but less than 5%: and 100% for real EPS growth of 5% or more: ii 2004 grant as in i but performance is retested at the end of year five against the full period from grant: and iii 2003 grant as in i but performance is retested at the end of years four and five against the full period from grant.
2012 Share Option Plan ExSOP 2012 A full description of the ExSOP is set out on page 106.
2012 grants for share option awards made to executive directors only, exercise is subject to a TSR performance condition such that: 25% of each option grant is exercisable if the Companys TSR is at the median relative to the comparator group: and 100% of each option grant is exercisable if the Companys TSR is in the upper quintile relative to the comparator group.
For performance between median and upper quintile, the proportion of options exercisable will be calculated on a straight-line basis.
Share Matching Plan SMP matching shares A full description of the SMP is set out on page 106.
SMP awards attract dividends prior to vesting.
2009-2012 awards nil match for average EPS growth of less than 5% pa increasing uniformly to a 2:1 match at 11% pa growth.
2012 Rationale for key performance measures for PSP, ExSOP, ExSOP and SMP EPS importance to major investors as a key indicator of long-term financial performance and value creation.
TSR and secondary financial measure importance to major investors as an indication of both earnings and capital growth relative to major companies in the same sector, and to ensure that awards only vest if there has been a clear improvement in the Companys performance over the relevant period.
Restricted Share Plan RSP The RSP is the time-vesting long-term incentive plan element applicable to senior executives in the US.
Approved by shareholders at the 2011 AGM, it does not have performance elements attached to it other than time-vesting conditions as it seeks to mirror US remuneration practices where performance-related LTIP awards only typically make up around one-third of the overall long-term incentive package for a US executive.
