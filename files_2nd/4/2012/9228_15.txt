At this years AGM, I will be retiring after my ninth year as a non-executive director of Ladbrokes and my sixth year as Chair of the Committee.

I believe the key to good remuneration management lies in transparency and clear linkage between pay, the delivery of strategic objectives, annual results and individual performance.
As a shareholder myself, I wish the Board every success in the future.
I know that if the Company does well, so will shareholders and so, rightly, and proportionately, will management.

In early 2012, Ladbrokes consulted a number of its major shareholders and shareholder representative bodies in order to discuss our current approach to executive remuneration.
We received valuable feedback from a number of key shareholders.
The consultation included details on the following: 2012 base salary freezes for executive directors: differentiation of 2012 PSP awards based on individual performance during 2011: and for 2012 the introduction of a cap to the annual bonus unless specific levels of performance were attained in the Digital business.
As outlined in the implementation report below, Ladbrokes received strong support from its shareholders with a 93% vote in favour of last years remuneration report.
The Committee continues to be mindful of shareholder views when determining ongoing remuneration strategy, and commits to undergoing shareholder consultation in advance of any significant changes to remuneration policy.

For R I Glynn and I A Bull, this reflects the cash allowance of 22.5% of salary paid in lieu of pension.

Base salary, pension and benefits In 2012, no annual salary increases were awarded to the executive directors.
At its January 2013 meeting, the Committee determined salary levels with effect from 1 March 2013.
It was decided that R I Glynns salary would be maintained at its current level.
The Committee determined that I A Bull should receive a targeted increase of 5.3% to reflect his strong performance since joining the Board, and therefore his salary will be increased from 380,000 to 400,000 from 1 March 2013.
In line with the Companys policy on salary increases, the Committee considered this increase very carefully to ensure that it was appropriate.
The average executive director salary increase is 2.65%, which is broadly in line with the wider workforce average of 2.5%.
The table below shows the current base salaries for the executive directors and proposed salaries with effect from 1 March 2013: Current Base salary with effect Executive base salary from 1 March 2013 R I Glynn 580,000 580,000 I A Bull 380,000 400,000 Annual bonus 70% of the 2012 annual bonus was based on financial performance assessed against profit targets and the remaining 30% on individual performance objectives: targets were set by the Board at the beginning of 2012 by reference to internal projections and the prevailing economic conditions at the time: the minimum threshold below which no payments are made is 94% of the profit plan: and maximum awards would be delivered for achieving 106% of the profit plan.
Given the importance of growing the Companys Digital business, for 2012, the Committee capped the amount payable under the financial element of the bonus at 60% of maximum unless a significant specified increase in net gaming revenue for the division is achieved.
This performance threshold was not met.
The maximum bonus opportunity for 2012 was 170% for the Chief Executive and 130% of base salary for other executive directors.
One third of any annual bonus earned will be delivered in shares and will only vest subject to continued employment after a three year vesting period.
The Company exceeded the bonus plan threshold for the 2012 financial year despite stretching performance targets and a challenging economic environment and bonuses have been paid to executive directors in respect of 2012 performance.
Profit growth of 8% represented 97% achievement of plan and, as a result, 43% of this portion of the annual bonus vested.
Assessments of individual performance targets resulted in vesting of 67% to 72% of this portion.

The structure of the 2010 PSP was the same as outlined on page 45.
50% of the awards was based on TSR performance against selected industry peers, using the same comparator group as outlined on page 45.
The Company ranked fifth out of 14 comparator companies and therefore 75% of this portion of the award vested.
The remaining 50% of the award was subject to EPS performance and the same performance targets applied as outlined on page 45 for the 2013 awards.
For awards made in 2010, EPS growth performance of 9.4% was achieved and therefore 88% of this portion of the award vested.
The Committee did not apply any discretion in relation to vesting percentages in the year under review.

Ladbrokes plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Governance Governance 53 Matters relating to Board changes R J Ames resigned as a director of the Company on 1 August 2012 and remained employed with the Group until 30 November 2012.
The Company took legal advice to determine the most appropriate treatment with reference to his contractual obligations.
The Committee carefully considered both the best interests of the Company and its shareholders when determining his exit payments.
The main features of his treatment upon cessation of employment are as follows: during the period to 30 November 2012 he remained in service on his existing terms and conditions and as such continued to be eligible for salary and benefits, plus incentive participation prorated for time and performance as appropriate see below : under the annual bonus plan, the Committee determined that R J Ames 2012 bonus should be subject to time pro-ration to reflect the period of employment during the year and should continue to be subject to the Company and individual performance targets set at the beginning of 2012 as outlined on page 51.
His payment of 175,553 will be made in March 2013 at the same time as for all other continuing executives: in settlement of all claims, he is eligible for a compensation payment of 506,585 which relates to salary and benefits, bonus for the remaining notice period and compensation for statutory claims.
Half of this payment was made in December 2012, and the balance paid in eight monthly instalments ending July 2013.
In the event that R J Ames obtains alternative employment during the eight month period, the monthly instalments will be reduced by reference to percentage of the earnings from such alternative employment.
An additional c. 10,300 was paid for associated legal costs and restrictive covenants: R J Ames existing share awards under the Deferred Bonus Plan were released to him following cessation of employment in line with the relevant treatment for redundancy under the plan rules: and in relation to the PSP and LGP, the Committee has determined that R J Ames should be treated as a good leaver.
Therefore his share awards will continue to exist, and will vest to the extent that relevant performance targets are met at the end of the relevant performance period.
The vested amount will be subject to time pro rating to reflect his period of employment during the performance period.
For his LGP award to vest, he will have to maintain his co-investment shareholding as required under the plan rules.
Long-term incentives awarded during the financial year Under the PSP, the maximum award as a percentage of salary is 175% for the Chief Executive Officer and 150% for other executive directors.
Actual annual award levels are determined by the Committee by reference to individual performance in the year prior to grant.
The 2012 PSP awards granted to executive directors were between 75% and 90% of maximum representing their strong performance during 2011.
The PSP awards granted on 17 February 2012 are detailed below.
The performance period runs from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2014.
