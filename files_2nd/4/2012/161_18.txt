Remuneration report Continued development of our compensation practices Dear Shareholders, Overall, 2012 has been an unusual year for ABG, notably as a result of anumber of key developments in our operating environment and the impact of discussions between China National Gold and Barrick, both of which required a refocusing of committee activities.
In particular, much ofthe committees work in the latter half of 2012 focused on ensuring we had appropriate retention and compensation arrangements in place in order to maintain workforce levels to provide for business continuation during a prolonged period of uncertainty.
As we emerge from this, the committee will resume its focus on developing our compensation practices in line with our strategic business objectives, in order to support long-term growth and returns.
Generally, compensation practices throughout the global mining sector Maintaining compensation arrangements have remained highly competitive throughout the year.
It is important that we ensure our approach to compensation and incentives remains broadly tosupport business continuity and retention competitive within this sector in order to attract and retain the talent oftalent.

In conjunction with this, we are mindful of the evolving trends and practices applicable to compensation generally.
Michael Kenyon, In 2012, the committee decided to replace awards under the Companys Chairman of the Compensation committee Share Option Plan with awards of commensurate fair value under the 7 March 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
LTIP awards will continue to be subject to the Total Shareholder Return TSR performance condition established for this plan.
In addition, the committee has approved the introduction of Executive Director shareholding guidelines, pursuant towhich Executive Directors will be required to establish a minimum shareholding in the Company equal to two times base salary over a period of5 years.
The committee will continue to review developments in remuneration in order to ensure appropriate alignment between the interests of executives and shareholders in the context of compensation and performance.
More generally, ongoing regulatory developments in the context of executive compensation and content requirements for the Directors Remuneration Report have remained a key focus for the committee in 2012.
We continue to monitor the proposals and await the ultimate outcome of requirements under the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Billand the effects that this will have on future reporting periods and theformulation of the Companys remuneration policy going forward.

To date, only RSUs have been granted under individuals within the organisation are eligible to participate: the LTIP and the LTIP.
The committee recognises that some of the features of the LTIP The Executive Directors and the other members of our Senior Leadership and SOP, which are based on the same structure of long-term incentive Team are eligible to receive annual awards under the LTIP.

The rules of the LTIP and SOP each permit a maximum award with a value equal to 200% of salary in each year under normal circumstances.
The committee may exceed this limit in exceptional circumstances.
The committee generally intends for awards to be delivered on a fair value basis.
As a result of regulatory restrictions applicable to the Company as aresult of the Offer Period, no awards were made under the SOP or LTIP in 2012.
Following year end, and subsequent to the lifting of Offer Period related restrictions, the committee granted LTIP awards in respect of 2012 equivalent to c. 150% of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer respectively.
The Committee made these awards onthe basis that both the LTIP should be looked at in overall terms of: i incentivisation: and ii retention.
