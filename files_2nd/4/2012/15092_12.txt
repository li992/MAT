21339.04 12 07 2012 Proof 3 SuperGroup Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 49 12 Directors Remuneration Report Remuneration policy The committee continues to operate a fixed pay remuneration policy i. e. base salary and benefits for those executive directors with significant shareholdings in the company i. e. the Chief Executive Officer, Brand and Design Director and Chief Executive Officer Wholesale and International hereafter referred to as the Founder Directors in this report.
This policy has been adopted given that the committee believes that these individuals are already sufficiently incentivised and aligned with other shareholders without the need to offer annual or long-term incentive arrangements although this approach will be kept under review.
For executive directors without major shareholdings i. e. the recently appointed Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer the committee is of the view that the companys executive remuneration policies should encourage a strong performance culture, strategy delivery and long term shareholder value creation and be positioned competitively to enable it to recruit, retain and incentivise appropriately skilled individuals.
To achieve this, the committee therefore aims to position their fixed pay competitively while operating a competitive suite of annual and share-based long-term incentives so that a substantial proportion of total remuneration is performance linked and aligned with shareholders.
Base salary and benefits Executive directors base salaries are reviewed annually by the committee, taking into account the responsibilities, skills and experience of each individual, pay and employment conditions within the company and the Group, and salary levels within listed companies of a similar size.
Current base salary levels, which have not been increased since the companys flotation in 2010, are as set out in the table on page 54.
Taxable benefits for 2012 related to the provision of medical and life insurance and, to certain executive directors, a car allowance.
In addition, in 2013, the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer may reclaim relocation costs incurred, up to pre-agreed limits.
Pension The Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer are eligible to participate in the companys Group Personal Pension Scheme GPPS whereby for an executive contribution of 5% of base salary, the company contributes 7.5% of base salary.
Retirement benefits are accruing to one director 2011: nil under a defined contribution scheme held with a third party.
Annual bonus No annual bonus arrangement was operated for executive directors during the year ended 29 April 2012.
However an annual bonus arrangement has been introduced for 2013 with a maximum limit of 100% of base salary based on financial metrics and pre-set personal and strategic objectives.
Specific targets have not been disclosed as they are considered to be commercially confidential but they will be demanding.
Only the Chief Operating Officer and the Chief Financial Officer will participate in the arrangement for 2013 given the committees view that the Founder Directors significant shareholdings are sufficient to align their interests with shareholders without the need to include them in an annual incentive arrangement.
21339.04 12 07 2012 Proof 3 Financial Statements Governance Performance Introduction 50 SuperGroup Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 12 Directors Remuneration Report Long term incentives Following shareholder approval at the 2010 AGM, the SuperGroup Performance Share Plan PSP enables the company to incentivise and reward participants appropriately for contributing to the delivery of the companys strategic objectives and to provide an appropriate level of long-term performance pay.
Under the PSP, each year individuals may receive awards of shares in the company which will normally vest three years after they are awarded, subject to the satisfaction of sliding scale performance conditions measured over a three year period and continued service.
Although Founder Directors are eligible to participate in the PSP, the committee believes that their significant shareholdings in the company are sufficient to incentivise them and align interests with longer term company performance at the current time.
Therefore awards under the PSP for 2013 will be restricted to the Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and below board level senior executives Senior Executives.
The PSPs individual annual limit is a maximum of 200% of an individuals base salary with scope to grant up to 300% of base salary in exceptional circumstances e. g. on recruitment.
For the 2012 awards and in connection with their respective recruitment arrangements, Susanne Given will shortly be granted an award of 300% of base salary and Shaun Wills will shortly be granted an award of 200% of base salary.
From 2013 onwards, it is expected that the normal grant policy for executive directors excluding Founder Directors will be 100% of salary.
Actual award levels to Senior Executives are generally significantly below the maximum levels.
Consistent with past awards granted to Senior Executives, performance for the 2012 awards will be 70% based on sliding scale earnings per share EPS and 30% based on total shareholder return TSR relative to a selected group of retailers as measured over the three year period ending the 2015 financial year end.
In addition to the TSR performance condition, the remuneration committee must also be satisfied that there has been an improvement in the companys underlying financial performance.
Full details of the awards, including the performance conditions, will be disclosed in the stock exchange announcement which will be published shortly following the grant and in next years Remuneration Report.
The remuneration committee is comfortable that the blend of EPS and TSR targets provides a balance between incentivising and rewarding strong financial performance while creating a strong alignment with the interests of institutional shareholders by rewarding stock market outperformance.
Executives may benefit, in the form of additional cash or shares, from the value of dividends paid over the vesting period, to the extent that awards vest.
Dilution In accordance with shareholder guidelines, the committee applies a limit on the amount of shares that can be issued to satisfy employee share plan awards of 10% of the companys issued share capital in any rolling 10 year period.
Of this 10%, only half can be issued to satisfy awards under the discretionary arrangements i. e. the PSP.
Since flotation in 2010, the company has not issued any shares to satisfy employee share plan awards.
Share ownership guidelines In conjunction with the introduction of the PSP, the company introduced share ownership guidelines.
Under the guidelines, executive directors not holding shares worth at least 100% of their base salary will be expected to retain 50% of any PSP awards which vest net of tax granted until such time as this level of holding is met.
