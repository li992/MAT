86 EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Remuneration Report This report has been prepared in accordance with The Companies Act 2006, Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008.
It also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles of good governance as set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council in September 2012.
The Groups auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, have audited the financial information contained in the tables set out in sections below on Non-Executive Directors Remuneration and Executive Directors emoluments.
Summary Statement from the Remuneration Committee Chairman Dear Shareholder, I am pleased to present our Remuneration Report for 2012.
Despite the challenging market environment over the past 12 months, we made good progress on our major modernisation programme and reached a milestone agreement on the acquisition of the controlling interest in Raspadskaya.
Furthermore, we ran our core Russian steelmaking operations at full economic capacity and demonstrated strong utilisation rates at North American operations.
Our continued focus will be on achieving strong financial returns for our shareholders, and we consider that our remuneration policy will play a vital role in helping us to achieve this.
We believe that our remuneration policy remains appropriate, and as such we made no major changes in 2012.
However, in line with corporate governance best practice, we have changed the membership of the Remuneration Committee and as a result it is now comprised entirely of independent Non-Executive Directors, allowing for completely independent oversight and judgement.
The Committee is fully aware of its responsibilities in developing a balanced and structured remuneration policy, and takes into account the views of investors and their representatives when making decisions on executive remuneration.
The Chief Executive Officer participates in a bonus scheme, the KPIs of which are aligned with the creation of shareholder value.
We have made some further changes with effect from 2013, the purpose of which is to align the bonus further with the Companys strategic objectives and priorities for the year.
At present, given our Chief Executive Officers substantial shareholding in the Company, it is considered appropriate that he does not participate in any long-term incentive plan, nor in fact in any pension or superannuation scheme.
Members of senior management are eligible to participate in a long-term incentive plan in order to ensure their interests are aligned with those of shareholders.
We recognise that we are moving into new territory in remuneration reporting.
As such, we are taking appropriate actions to ensure that we add additional value to what was disclosed in our Remuneration Report last year, and we have provided a Remuneration Report which reflects some of the proposed reporting requirements put forward by the UK Governments Department for Business, Innovation and Skills BIS.
Although these are not due to come into effect until later this year, we are reflecting come of the proposed requirements as an early response to what is being asked of us.
We are committed to providing clear and insightful disclosure for our shareholders, and we await the final BIS regulations due to be published later this year.
The Committee will continue to keep abreast of market trends and external expectations to ensure that the overall remuneration policy remains appropriate, in the context of business performance and strategy.
Members of the Remuneration Committee The EVRAZ plc Remuneration Committee was constituted and appointed by the Board on 14 October 2011, and the Committee comprised the following Non-Executive Directors during the 2012 year: r Duncan Baxter Committee Chairman : 1 r Alexander Abramov 1 r Eugene Tenenbaum r Karl Gruber: 2 r Sir Michael Peat : 2 r Alexander Izosimov 1 Stood down on 19 November 2012 2 Sir Michael Peat was replaced by Alexander Izosimov from March 2012 On 19 November 2012 the Board, on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee, decided that it was important to ensure that the membership of the Remuneration Committee was comprised of only independent Non-Executive Directors in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Consequently, Mr Abramov and Mr Tenenbaum stood down from the Committee.
Therefore, as of 10 April 2013 the Remuneration Committee consists of three members: r Duncan Baxter Committee Chairman : r Karl Gruber: r Alexander Izosimov.
No Directors are involved in deciding their own remuneration.
The Committee may invite other individuals to attend Committee meetings, in particular the Chief Executive Officer, the Head of Human Resources and external advisers for all or part of any Committee meeting as and when appropriate and necessary.
Corporate Overview Strategy Operating Review Social Responsibility Financial Review Governance Financial Statements EVRAZ plc 87 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Role of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is a formal committee of the Board and can operate with a quorum of two Committee members.
It is operated according to its Terms of Reference, a copy of which can be found on the Companys website.
The main responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are: r to determine and agree with the Board the framework or policy for the remuneration of the Chairman of the Board, the Companys Chief Executive Officer, the Company Secretary and key senior management and recommend Non-Executive Directors remuneration: r to take into account all factors which it deems necessary to determine such a framework or policy, including all relevant legal and regulatory requirements, the provisions and recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code and associated guidance: r to review and take into account the remuneration trends across the Group when setting remuneration policy for Directors: r to review regularly the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of the remuneration policy: r to determine the total individual remuneration package of the Chairman of the Board, the Company Secretary and key senior management, including pension rights, bonuses, benefits in kind, incentive payments and share options or other share awards within the terms of the agreed policy and in consultation with the Committee Chairman and or Chief Executive Officer: r to approve awards for participants where existing share incentive plans are in place: r to review and approve any compensation payable to executive Directors and senior executives: and r to oversee any major changes in employee benefits structures throughout the Group.
During 2012, the EVRAZs Remuneration Committee met four times.
The purpose of the meetings was to consider and to make recommendations to the Board in relation to the remuneration packages of the Chairman, Non-executive Directors, the Executive Director and key senior managers, as well as to approve the 2012 LTIP awards and list of participants.
Advisors The Committee received advice during the year from independent remuneration consultants Deloitte LLP.
Deloitte LLP was selected by the Committee to provide the Company remuneration consultancy services.
Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
Sir Michael Peat is an independent non-executive on the Board of Deloitte LLP.
Both the Chairman and the Remuneration Committee Chairman recognise the need to ensure that there is no conflict of interest arising from the appointment of Deloitte LLP as independent remuneration consultants.
We are satisfied that the nature of Sir Michaels role at Deloitte LLP does not give rise to such conflict and that there are appropriate internal controls and segregation of duties in place.
Sir Michael did not play a part in the tender and selection process.
Policy report Details of the executive Director and Non-Executive Director remuneration policies are given in the following sections.
The full text of the Remuneration Policy can be found on the Companys website www.
Currently none of the Directors receive any fees paid in shares of the Company and they are not entitled to participate in the Groups pension plan or long-term incentive schemes.

As a member of the Board of Directors he is also entitled to the Directors fee US$150,000 and any applicable fees for participation in the work of the Board committees as laid out in the section on Non-Executive Director remuneration.
Alexander Frolovs current shareholding 10.76% of issued share capital as of 10 April 2013 provides alignment to the delivery of long-term growth in shareholder value.
As such, we do not consider it necessary for the CEO to participate in any long-term incentive plans, or to impose formal shareholding guidelines.
However, the Remuneration Committee will review this on an ongoing basis.
The current balance between fixed and variable pay for the executive Director means that, on achievement of the set targets, 50% of remuneration is performance-related, rising to 66.7% for the achievement of maximum performance above the set targets.
88 EVRAZ plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Remuneration Report Continued The composition of executive Directors remuneration is as follows: Target 50% 50% Maximum 67% 33% annual bonus base salary Target remuneration comprises current base salary and on-target annual cash bonus.
Maximum remuneration comprises current base salary and maximum annual cash bonus.
The pay and conditions of employees across the Group and market data have been taken into account when setting the CEOs remuneration.
The CEO did not hold any external appointments during the year.
Senior management remuneration Senior managers are entitled to a base salary, a performance related bonus KPIs aligned with Companys strategy, participation in the long-term incentive programme with a 3 year vesting period and the provision of benefits.
Non-Executive Director remuneration The Companys policy on Non-Executive Director remuneration is based on the following key principles: r Remuneration should be: r sufficient to attract and retain world-class non-executive talent: r consistent with recognised best practice standards for Non-Executive Director remuneration: r in the form of cash fees, but with the flexibility to forgo all or part of such fees after deduction of applicable income tax and social security contributions to acquire shares in the Company should the Non-Executive Director so wish: r set by reference to the responsibilities taken on by the non-executives in chairing the Board and its committees: r Non-Executive Directors may not participate in the Companys share incentive schemes or pension arrangements.
A Non-Executive Directors remuneration consists of an annual fee of US$150,000 and a fee for committee membership US$24,000 or chairmanship US$100,000 in respect of the Audit Committee chairmanship and US$50,000 for the chairmanship of other committees.
As disclosed last year, the fee for the Chairman of the Board was increased at the Board meeting on 28 February 2012 and amounts to US$750,000 from 1 March 2012 this fee includes, for the avoidance of doubt, the Directors fees and the fees that are paid for committee membership.
The fees payable for the chairmanship of a committee include the membership fee, and any Director elected chairman of more than one committee is only entitled to receive fees in respect of one chairmanship.
In addition the Company contributes an annual amount of US$30,000 towards secretarial and administrative expenses of Non-Executive Directors.
Implementation report Executive Directors remuneration Base salary As disclosed in last years report, from 1 March 2012, the CEOs salary reverted to the salary that was originally approved by the Remuneration Committee on 23 May 2008, of US$2,500,000 which includes, for the avoidance of doubt, the Directors fee, the fees that are paid for committees membership and any salary from an EVRAZ plc subsidiary.
Due to the challenging economic environment at that time, the CEO voluntarily accepted a decrease in salary and deferred the approved increase in base salary to a later date.
The CEO has waived the right to receive any catch-up payments forgone between 2008 and 2012.
The Committee has not recommended a base salary increase for 2013.
Annual bonus outcome for 2012 The CEO is eligible to participate in a performance-related bonus which is subject to the agreement of the Remuneration Committee and approval by the Board of Directors.
The bonus is linked to the achievement of performance conditions based on predetermined targets set by the Board of Directors.
The target bonus is 100% of base salary with a maximum potential of up to 200% of base salary.
The bonus is linked to corporate performance.
Three indicators were taken into account when determining the CEOs annual bonus for 2012: EBITDA 30% weighting, return on assets 40% weighting and relative share price performance 30% weighting.
All targets were set at a very challenging level and during 2012 there were very tough market conditions, and as a result targets were not achieved for example, relative share price performance was not achieved due to the high financial and operational leverage of the Company.
Therefore, the CEO received no bonus.
