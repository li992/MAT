More detail on the specific achievements and shortfalls was described earlier in the Remuneration Report.

This is the first full vesting of these awards in the last five years.
All employee share plans Over 1,300 colleagues shared a pay-out of approximately 6m under the Sharesave scheme.
None of the executive directors received this benefit as their savings and share options under the scheme do not mature until December 2013.
Remuneration for 2013 As described above, the only significant change to the remuneration structure is the Replacement Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
Full details of the new scheme are set out in a separate resolution 14.
Basic salaries Basic salaries are reviewed annually for each director and are normally set with reference to individual performance, experience and contribution together with developments in the relevant employment market, internal relativities and reference to the general economic environment: it is this last point which has outweighed all others in determining pay awards for 2013.
68 TRAVIS PERKINS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2012 From 1 January 2013, the executive directors salaries remain unchanged from 2012: ?d]c 8VgiZg %%!%%%0 Zd[[ 8ddeZg '!
'!&%%# As described in the introduction to this report, the position will be reviewed in July 2013, but any increase at that time will not exceed 1.5% and will not be backdated.
Annual bonus As described in detail above, the executive directors will participate in the Replacement Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
The maximum award will be 180% for the CEO and 150% for the other executive directors.
50% of the full bonus will be paid in cash after the year end and the remainder will be held in shares deferred for at least 2 years and subject to a total shareholder return target.
The new plan will be extended to the Executive Committee members in 2014.
Performance share plan The maximum award levels will be 150% of basic salary for each of the executive directors.
The performance targets will again be Aggregate Cashflow, Relative Total Shareholder Return TSR and adjusted Earnings per Share EPS with the same relative weighting as last year.
Measure Rationale Weighting EPS growth A reasonable and well understood proxy for an increase in shareholder value for the benefit of all shareholders, provided undue leverage is controlled.

Increases in RPI have been well above 3% in recent years and the outlook remains uncertain.
If RPI reduces to average 3% over the next 3 years, the aggregate EPS growth will have to be 44% in 3 years time for this part of the award to vest in full.
Given the current economic climate, this would represent an outstanding achievement.
The three-year targets for aggregate cash flow and CROCE below reflect a poorer market outlook for construction than the prior year.
However, the targets require a more stretching performance when taken into account as part of the 3 year rolling forecast targets.
Share matching scheme Once again the maximum investment will be 50% of post-tax salary and the other features of the scheme will also be unchanged.
