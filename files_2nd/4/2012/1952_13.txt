Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2012 39 Governance Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration HOW REMUNERATION FOR THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS IS DETERMINED The remuneration of the executive directors is determined by the Board Committee on Executive Directors Remuneration theCommittee within a framework set by the Board.
As at the date of this report, the Committees members are three non-executive directors, Mr Toms Chairman, Mr Johnson and Mr Cuthbert.
None of the Committee members has a personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided.
There are no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Terms of Reference of the Committee are available on the Groups website www.
During the year, the Group Company Secretary provided advice on issues other than those relating to his own remuneration.
TheCommittee also received independent external advice from New Bridge Street NBS, a trading name of Aon plc.
NBS was appointed by the Committee and does not provide any other services to the Company other than to the Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors Remuneration.
The Chairmans remuneration is also determined by the Committee.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION The remuneration of the non-executive directors apart from the Chairman is determined by the Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors Remuneration, which comprises the executive directors.
The Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors Remuneration also receives advice from the Group Company Secretary and NBS.
CONTEXT AND KEY POINTS This report covers a year during which the Committee was busy with two primary activities, both of which were undertaken with the benefit of prior consultation with major investors, in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The first was the setting and review of base salaries and pension provision for the new generation of executive directors at Bellway, together with preparation for the further changes to take place in early 2013.
Last year we reported on our decision to set basic pay for the two new executive directors at levels significantly below those oftheir more experienced predecessors, but with a stated intention of raising these towards competitive market levels as they establish themselves in their roles.
As described below, the Companys operating performance has progressed significantly since these appointments and the Committee has recognised the contribution made by the new directors.
From 1 August 2012 weimplemented the first of a series of rises in basic pay which should in due course lead to pay levels which are competitive withother comparable housebuilders.
The Board subsequently has decided to promote Mr Ayres to Chief Executive in February 2013 and the Committee will follow the same policy by appointing him on a salary of 400,000, significantly below the level currently earned by Mr Watson, but with the express intention that he should progress towards full market levels, subjectto experience and satisfactory performance.
When Mr Watson moves to the Chairmans role the Committee intends to take the opportunity to rebase the Chairmans fee downward to 180,000.
The Committee has also examined thepolicy for pension provision and has set the value ofthe Company contribution at 20% of salary for both .
The second area of focus was the setting of annual bonus parameters.
For 2012 the total bonus potential was set at 120% of basic salary, with 90% of the bonus potential accounted forbyreference to an operating profit target.
The Committee set the target at a level which would require a substantial increase inoperating profit, and the performance delivered was at the higher end of the range and a payment of 89.2% has beenearned.
The additional 30%of the bonus potential was accounted for by non-financial measures, namely land bankmanagement, health and safety and customer care, and a payment of 30% has beenearned.
Progress has been made in each of these areas and in the latter case, 93.8% of Bellways customers would nowrecommend Bellway to a friend, with customer care being a very important issue forthe Company.
Finally, during the year, the Committee also introduced clawback provisions for both the annual bonus and long-term incentive plans LTIPs in line with bestpractice.
Looking forward to 2012 13, other than the proposed salary increases set out above, the Committee does not anticipate anyfurther changes to the policy.
OBJECTIVES OF THE REMUNERATION POLICY The aim of the Committee is to ensure that the Company has competitive remuneration packages in place in order to recruit, retainand motivate executive directors in the overall interests of shareholders, the Company, its employees and its customers.
The Committee has set, as an objective, a policy of paying a level of remuneration at around the median of a peer group of similar UK housebuilding businesses, subject to experience and performance.
The Committee has used this comparative approach to benchmarking with caution, recognising the risk of upward only reviews of remuneration and different sizes of comparator businesses.
The structure ofthe package has been designed to ensure that the performance-related elements of remuneration annual bonus and LTIPs constitute a significant proportion of an executives potential total remuneration package, but are only receivable ifdemanding and stretching performance targets are achieved.
The Committee considers that the remuneration policy is fully competitive with the market, with a significant element of the package payable in the form of share-based incentives, subject to long-term performance conditions.
Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2012 40 Governance Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration continued The structure of the performance conditions for annual bonus and long-term incentives has been designed to provide a strong link to the Companys performance, namely a focus on maximising profit in a sustainable fashion and generating superior shareholder returns.
This approach generates strong alignment of interest between senior executives and shareholders.
In framing the Companys remuneration policy for executive directors, the Committee has given full consideration to the best practice provisions in the UK Corporate Governance Code and the Association of British Insurers ABI guidance.
When determining the elements of remuneration for the executive directors, the Committee takes into consideration the pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group as a whole, paying particular attention to the levels of pay increase awarded to the workforce generally.
All employees, including the executive directors, can join the Companys savings related share option arrangements.
All employees have access to pension arrangements, most have access to life assurance benefits and a significant proportion of employees benefit from health insurance, a company car or car allowance.
The Committee is apprised of any significant policy changes for the workforce generally.

Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2012 41 SALARIES AND FEES Salaries are reviewed on 1 August each year, taking into account the general settlement across the Company.
Any changes are implemented from that date.
For the year under review, Mr Watson received a 3% increase in basic salary which reflected the average percentage increase across the workforce generally.
For 2012 13, Mr Watson has been awarded a 3% increase in basic salary, which again reflects the average percentage increase across the workforce generally for the same period.
Mr Ayres was promoted to the Board on 1 August 2011 and Mr Adey was promoted to the Board on 1 February 2012.
Their commencing salaries were significantly below those of their predecessors and market benchmarks.
As disclosed in last years report and elsewhere in this report, the Committees intention is that these will be progressively adjusted as they develop and adapt into their new roles, subject to performance.
With effect from 1 August 2012, Mr Ayres salary has been increased from 250,000 to 300,000 and will be increased to 400,000 on appointment to the role of Chief Executive in February 2013.
With effect from 1 August 2012 Mr Adeys salary has been increased from 200,000 to 225,000.
The Chairmans fee increased by 3%, which is in line with the average percentage increase across the workforce generally for the same period.
Fee levels for non-executive directors reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of the role, including membership or chairmanship of Board Committees.
Fees are reviewed annually, taking into account the level of fees for similar positions in comparable companies.
For the year under review, fees were increased by 3% which is in line with the average percentage increase across the workforce generally.
Following a review of non-executive director fees, with effect from 1 August 2012 the following fees are payable which represent an aggregate rise of just over 3%: Mr Johnson 58,500, Mr Toms 54,500 and Mr Cuthbert 51,500.
Non-executive directors are not entitled to any benefits with the exception of the Chairman or pension.
They do not participate in any bonus or long-term incentive plan and they are not entitled to compensation on termination of their agreements, other than normal notice provisions of three months notice given by either party.
ANNUAL BONUS SCHEME For the 2012 13 financial year the bonus opportunity will be unchanged at 120% of basic salary.
The performance conditions relate toastretching target range of operating profit 90% and personal performance 30%, with personal performance being assessed byreference to land bank management, health and safety and customer care.
The Committee considers that performance in relation to targets based on annual profitability and personal non-financial metrics provide a good link to the long-term performance of the business.
The focus on profitability is balanced by there being a meaningful weighting of the overall bonus on a number of core non-financial KPIs which are considered to have a strong link to short and long-term shareholder returns.
The performance conditions for the annual bonus are balanced by complementary long-term performance conditions under the Bellway p. l. c. 2004 Performance Share Plan the PSP, discussed below.
The bonus will be payable in cash, with executives having the opportunity to invest up to 25% of their net cash bonus in Bellway sharesheld in the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992 the Trust under the terms of the Bellway p. l. c. 2008 Share Matching Plan the SMP.
Details of the bonus payments are set out in the notes to the table of directors emoluments on page 44.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS The Company operates two LTIPs which are designed to focus executive directors on longer term value creation, provide a strong retentive element and alignment of interest with shareholders.
The PSP was introduced for the Companys executive directors and the Group Company Secretary.
Awards will vest to executives after three years, subject to the achievement of performance conditions based around TSR which measures the total return share price growth and dividend on a notional investment in Bellway shares, compared to the return on the same notional investment inshares in another company or index.
TSR is recognised as generating an alignment of interest between executives and institutional shareholders by providing a reward mechanism for delivering superior stock market performance.
TSR calculations are independently calculated for the Committee by the Companys brokers.
For the awards made in 2011 12 the TSR condition was in two equal parts.
Half the award was based on performance relative to the Housebuilders Index and half by reference to the FTSE 250 Index.
During the year the views of major shareholders have been sought onalternative or additional performance measures but in the absence of any consensus and in view of the strong alignment provided by TSR, the Committee has determined that the same TSR measures will be used for the 2012 13 awards.
The Committee will keep this issue under review for future years.
Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2012 42 Governance Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration continued Regardless of TSR performance, no part of the TSR element of an award will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that there has been an improvement in underlying financial performance over the performance period, taking into account, inter alia, operating profit, operating margin, ROCE and Net Asset Value NAV.
The Committee will scale back the level of vesting indicated by the TSR performance condition potentially to zero in circumstances where there has not been an improvement.
The SMP operates in conjunction with the annual bonus.
Under the SMP senior executives may invest up to 25% of their net cash annual bonus, in Bellway shares, which must be held for a minimum of three years in the Trust.
Invested shares will not be subject to a risk of forfeiture and executives will enjoy full beneficial ownership including voting rights and dividends.
In return for investing in shares under the SMP, an award of matching shares of up to 2:1 is granted.
The level of matching is on a gross basis to the net of tax bonus invested in shares.
Matching shares will vest subject to the executive remaining employed, retention of the invested shares and also subject to performance conditions.
No awards have been made to date.
For any awards which may be made, the performance conditions will be determined by the Committee at the time of grant.
Clawback To improve the risk profile of the policy and in line with best practice, the Company has introduced a clawback mechanism for bonus and LTIP awards to allow the Company, in exceptional circumstances, to clawback some or all of the payments made under the variable components of an individuals remuneration.
PENSION PROVISION Mr Watson receives a cash payment in lieu of pension contributions amounting to 30% of basic salary.
Mr Ayres is a member of the Companys Group Self Invested Personal Pension Plan GSIPP and from 1 August 2011 the Company made a contribution of 16% of his basic salary to the GSIPP on his behalf.
Mr Adey is also a member of the GSIPP and from his appointment to the Board on 1 February 2012 the Company made a contribution of 10% of his basic salary to the GSIPP on his behalf.
The Committee has reviewed the level of pension provision and from 1 August 2012 the Company pension contribution on behalf ofboth Mr Ayres and Mr Adey has been increased to 20% of salary, which is a broadly mid market level of pension provision asa percentage of salary.
Any amount payable in excess of HMRC approved pension contribution limits will be paid as a cash amount.
SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES There is a policy for a minimum shareholding requirement for the executive directors, equivalent to 100% of basic salary.
As at 31 July 2012, and at the date of this report, Mr Watson held shares with an equivalent value well in excess of 100% of his basic salary.
In response to the appointment of new executive directors to the Board, the Committee has established the following mechanism to ensure that new executive directors acquire the requisite shareholding.
Within a period of three months of appointment an executive director must acquire a minimum of 1,000 ordinary shares in the Company and must retain at least 50% of any shares awarded under the PSP or SMP, after allowance for paying tax, until the requisite number of shares has been accumulated.
Ifpersonal circumstances make this difficult, the Committee would exercise discretion.
SERVICE CONTRACTS AND LETTERS OF APPOINTMENT The executive directors have service contracts with a 12 month notice period from the Company and a six month notice period from the executive.
For Mr Watson, on termination by the Company, an amount equivalent to one years salary, benefits and the average amount of the lasttwo years annual bonus payments, would be payable.
Within six months of a change of control, if Mr Watson serves notice to terminate the contract, the liquidated damages payment would be triggered.
The inclusion of average annual bonus in the calculation ofcompensation payable for early termination has ensured that there was variability in the potential level of compensation.
Inparticular, after a period of poor performance, it could be expected that little or no bonus would be payable, reducing potential payout in these circumstances.
Mr Watson has long service with the Company and the Committee has not considered it appropriate to re-negotiate his contract in relation to this provision.
In accordance with best practice, the service contracts of Mr Ayres and Mr Adey do not provide for the inclusion of average bonus as part of the compensation arrangements in the event of early termination and contain no liquidated damages provision.
Consequently, following Mr Watson stepping down as Chief Executive on 31 January 2013, all executive directors will have service contracts fully compliant with latest best practice provisions.
If an executive director is not re-elected as a director of the Company by shareholders at an AGM then the Company may terminate the Executives employment by giving him 12 months notice or payment in lieu of notice.

Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2012 44 Governance Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration continued The auditor is required to report on the information contained in the following part of this report.
The annual bonus is payable in November 2012 for performance during the year ended 31 July 2012.
The performance conditions for the 2011 12 bonus were operating profit pre-exceptional items 90% and personal non-financial performance 30%, with non-financial performance being assessed by reference to land bank management, health and safety and customer care.
The actual bonus payments against each of these metrics were determined on the following basis: - oper ating profit was 114.6 million, with no exceptional items, an increase of 52% over the previous year and at the higher end of the target range.
Operating profit of114.6 million generated a payment of 89.2% of salary out of a maximum possible 90% of salary.
- in respect of the non-financial elements, the Committee took account of performance against each metric.
The Group had achieved a further improvement in its customer care score from 91% to 93.8%, and reduced its rate of over three-day lost time accidents per 100,000 employees to 761.18 from 767.90 and had achieved itsland bank target for the following financial year.
This outstanding performance generated a maximum payment of 30% in respect of the non-financial metrics.
Mr Adey was appointed on 1 February 2012.
The bonus paid is by reference to his period of service as a director, and was based on his salary as a director.
Mr Stoker retired from the Board on 31 July 2011 and Mr Leitch retired from the Board on 31 January 2012.
They did not receive any payments for loss of office ontheir retirement from the Board.
Mr Leitch earned a pro rata bonus for the period that he worked in the 2011 12 financial year.

The awards vested at 99.6% of the fullentitlement.
Aggregate gross gains made by the above directors on vesting of these awards under the PSP in the year were 1,088,918 2011 368,002.
The performance conditions for each award are summarised below: a For the awards made on 4 November 2008, 29 October 2009 and 21 October 2010, the awards were based on a TSR condition comparing Bellways TSR against an index of the TSR of other housebuilders the Housebuilders Index.
If Bellways TSR matches that of the Housebuilders Index, 25% of the award vests.
Full vesting would be achieved for 7.5% per annum outperformance of the Housebuilders Index.
The companies comprising the Housebuilders Index are Barratt Developments PLC, The Berkeley Group plc, Bovis Homes Group PLC, Persimmon plc, Redrow plc and Taylor Wimpey plc.
b For the award made on 24 October 2011 the TSR performance condition was in two parts.
Half was measured by reference to the Housebuilders Index as above, and theother half was measured by reference to the companies in the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts and financial services.
Awards start to vest at 25% if Bellways TSR matches the median of the companies in the group, increasing on a straight-line basis so that full vesting would be achieved if Bellways TSR reaches the upper quartile.
c For the a wards made on 4 November 2008 and 29 October 2009, regardless of TSR performance, no part of the TSR element of an award will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that the Companys TSR over the performance period is reflective of underlying financial performance.
For the awards made on 21 October 2010 and 24 October 2011, no part of the TSR element of an award will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that there has been an improvement in underlying financial performance, taking into account, inter alia, operating profit, operating margin, ROCE and NAV.
The market price of the ordinary shares at 31 July 2012 was 802.50p and the range during the year was 540.50p to 859.50p.
The only changes in the above potential future beneficial interests between 31 July 2012 and the date of this report are in relation to the awards made on 29 October 2009 where the performance conditions have not been met and the entire awards will lapse.
Following Mr Leitchs retirement from the Board on 31 January 2012, the full three year holding period of each of these awards is to apply up until the normal vesting dates.
In respect of the award granted on 29 October 2009, Mr Leitch may exercise the full allocation of shares awarded subject to, and calculated by reference to, the relevant performance conditions and subject to the relevant financial underpin.
In respect of the award granted on 21 October 2010, Mr Leitch may exercise up to 41.67% of the allocation of shares awarded scaled back to reflect the shorter period of service than the award was intended to cover subject to, and calculated by reference to, the relevant performance conditions and subject to the relevant financial underpin.

On behalf of the Board Mike T oms Chairman of the Board Committee on Executive Directors Remuneration 15 October 2012 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2012 48 Governance Statement of Directors Responsibilities in respect of the Annual Report and Accounts The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts and the Group and parent company financial statements inaccordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view ofthe state of affairs of the Group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU: and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent companys transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors Report, Directors Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Groups website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT OF THE DIRECTORS IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ANDACCOUNTS We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole: and the Directors Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the issuer and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
