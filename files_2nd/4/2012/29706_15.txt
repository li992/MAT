Its terms of reference take into account the provisions of the Corporate Governance Code.
The Committee is able to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues when setting remuneration of executive Directors.
As a financial services rm, the environmental and social impact of the Companys activities is low.
Governance issues, including effective engagement with shareholders and the general partners of the funds the Company invests in, is considered in evaluating the CEOs performance and therefore impacts the performance-related portion of her remuneration package.
The Committee has appointed independent remuneration consultants, New Bridge Street a trading name of Aon plc, to advise it.
NewBridge Street also provides advice on the operation of the Companys share schemes.
Work by New Bridge Street included providing updates on governance and tax developments and providing benchmark and market information.

Approved all remuneration packages for any Group executive with a proposed total cash remuneration in excess of 250,000 perannum.
Approved the salary payable to Andrew Sykes on his appointment as Chairman Mr Sykes was not present at the meeting at which this decision was taken.
Both SVGA and SVGIM have separate Boards with independent directors and separate remuneration committees.
The SVG Capital Remuneration Committee sets parameters and principles for the salary increases, discretionary bonuses and long-term incentive plans for these subsidiaries which are consistent with effective risk management.
Accordingly, the subsidiary remuneration committees, operating under specified delegated limits of authority from the main Board, met during the year to determine increases in salary and discretionary bonuses for all executives below main Board level.
A summary of these were presented to the SVG Capital Remuneration Committee for its approval.

A copy of the full terms of reference of the Committee isavailable on the Companys website, www.
SVG Capital plc Business Corporate Financial Company Annual report Overview review information information information 2012 35 Policy on the remuneration of executive Directors The Committees aim is to ensure that remuneration packages should attract, retain and motivate senior executives including executive Directors while avoiding paying more than is necessary for this purpose and not encouraging excessive risk taking or rewarding failure.
At 31 December 2012, Lynn Fordham was the only executive Director of the Company.
The Committees policy is that the xed elements of remuneration should be sufficient to allow the Company to be competitive againstother companies with which the Company competes for executive talent.
The majority of the remuneration package should be performance-related so that it is linked to the returns created for shareholders and the total cost is sufciently exible to reect changes inbusiness performance.
The variable element comprises a balance between short-term and long-term performance through the Companys annual bonus and the performance share plan.
In order to help mitigate risk and ensure that overall rewards are not excessive, incentive levels are capped at a level that encourages out-performance and allows the Company to deliver competitive levels of remuneration without encouraging undue risk taking.
The Committee considers performance on a multi-year basis and in the event of exceptional circumstances of misstatement or misconduct, an appropriate reduction will be made to a following years bonus.
This, coupled with the cap on bonuses which can be only exceeded in exceptional circumstances and an appropriate weighting to the long-term remuneration including performance shares, means the Committee is satisfied that it has sufficient exibility within the current arrangements to enable it to adjust future bonus payouts for exceptional circumstances and that executives are not incentivised to take undue risks.
The Committee continues to keep its policy under review in light of market and corporate governance developments and including BISsreview of executive remuneration.
The Committee reviewed its policy during the year and decided that for 2012 and future years it would be appropriate to introduce an annual deferred share bonus and reduce the long-term incentive award in order to create a more transparent set of awards while maintaining a clear alignment of incentives between management and shareholders.
The overall effect of these changes will be to reduce Lynn Fordhams total remuneration.
The changes are explained in further detail below.
Basic salary Salaries are reviewed annually with changes becoming effective in April each year.
The Committee decides on the increases awarded to the executive Directors and is consulted on increases for all employees of the business.
The Committee considers Group performance, individual performance and pay and employment conditions of employees of the Group in reaching any decisions.
In addition, relevant compensation surveys are reviewed but as a guide only.
No executive Director of the Company is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.
Lynn Fordhams salary was increased by 5% in April 2012 from 350,000 to 367,500 per annum which was in line with the rest of the workforce.
Lynn Fordhams salary will not be increased in 2013.
Annual bonus Annual bonuses are intended to reward achievement of Group and personal objectives.
Bonuses are non-pensionable and discretionary.
The Committee sets the performance targets for the annual bonus plan at the beginning of the financial year.
The targets are chosen to reect the successful implementation of the business plan and strategies agreed by the Board and may be adjusted to take account of risk.
The normal maximum annual bonus for an executive Director has been set at 200% of salary, although this cap can be exceeded inexceptional circumstances.
The Committee believes that capping bonuses at this level enables the Company to provide competitive levels of remuneration while ensuring that executives are not incentivised to take inappropriate risks.
The cash bonus awarded to Lynn Fordham in respect of her performance in the year to December 2012 amounted to 280,000 being 76% of her 2012 salary compared to a bonus of 560,000 last year which was 160% of the 2011 salary.
A deferred share bonus award of 250,000 has also been made that will normally vest on the third anniversary of grant subject only to continued service and good leaver bad leaver provisions.
Thecash bonus and deferred share bonus award together amount to 144% of Lynn Fordhams 2012 salary, compared to a bonus of 560,000 160% of 2011 salary paid in 2012.
Thekey performance parameters for Lynn Fordham for 2012 included increasing the strength of the balance sheet, developing the Companys long-term strategy and widening shareholder relationships.
SVG Capital plc Annual report 36 2012 Remuneration report continued The Chairman met with Lynn Fordham to assess her performance in 2012.
In each case, Lynn Fordham had met or exceeded her goals.
In particular, it was noted that: the Companys new strategy had been approved by shareholders: the Company had a positive net cash position of 28.7 million compared to net debt at 31 December 2011 of 127.7 million: significant progress on strategy development in the Groups fund management business had been made.
It was also noted that over the period, the Companys net asset value per share had grown by 16.0% versus an increase of 12.3% in the FTSE All Share TR Index.
Long-term incentives Lynn Fordham and selected employees of the SVG Group are eligible to participate in the PSP at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The Committee believes that participation in long-term incentives ensures that a significant part of executives potential remuneration istied to the returns received by shareholders over the longer term through the use of performance conditions linked to the Groups strategy and through exposure to the Groups share price.
This provides alignment between executives and shareholders and, because vesting of awards takes place three or four years after grant, provides an element of lock-in and encourages a focus on performance thatis sustainable in the longer term and potentially protects against misstatement or misconduct during the vesting period.
PSP awards have in the past been made annually, as this enables executives to build up a series of overlapping awards, which the Committee believes ismore retentive than larger one-off awards.
The PSP enables awards of conditional free shares or nil or nominal cost options to be made.
Award levels are determined by reference to the individuals seniority, level of salary and bonus earned in the previous year asthisprovides a link to individual performance.
The maximum that can be currently awarded in any financial year is 200% of base salary andbonus.
In future years, this will be capped at 200% of base salary only.
In order to ensure that long-term incentives provide alignment with shareholders, the Committee sets performance conditions that reward executives for delivering absolute growth in the value of the Group.
The performance conditions used for the 2012 awards were the same as those for the 2011 awards and consist of i the average growth in the Companys undiluted Net Asset Value per Share NAV over a four-year period of 7% per annum 0% of the award vests and 15% per annum 100% of the award vests and ii the Companys average annual compound total shareholder return TSR over a three-year period of 10% per annum 0% of the award vests and 20% per annum 100% of the award vests, with each determining the vesting of 50% of the award.
The 2013 targets will bethe same as the 2012 targets.
In 2012, Lynn Fordham was awarded 571,402 shares under the PSP.
The face value of that award 1,592,000 represented 175% ofLynnFordhams 2011 base salary and bonus paid in 2012.
The expected value of that award was 636,800 estimated by NewBridgeStreet.
For 2013, the Committee has approved a PSP award for Lynn Fordham with a face value of 600,000 and an approximateexpected value of 240,000 as estimated by NewBridge Street in respect of the year ended 31 December 2012.
The Remuneration Committee believes that TSR and growth in NAV are appropriate measures of long-term performance for a business f focused on delivering superior levels of NAV growth and returns to shareholders.
In setting the performance targets for the 2012 awards the Remuneration Committee took account of the current shareholder expectations of future performance for the Company.
The PSP replaced the 2001 ESOP following the 2007 AGM.
No further grants can be made under the 2001 ESOP.
The Company introduced a SIP at the 2007 AGM.
The SIP is a tax approved all-employee share plan with standard features.
No awards have been made under the SIP.
The combination of cash bonus, deferred shares and long-term incentives awarded will be lower than the 2011 level, but with a different composition, reecting the Committees assessment that Lynn Fordhams targets were again fully met and that Lynn Fordham had performed very well during the year.
A comparison of Lynn Fordhams 2011 and 2012 compensation is set out below: Bonus Long-term Incentive Total Salary Cash Shares deferred Expected value Expected value 2011 367,500 560,000 636,800 1,564,300 2012 367,500 280,000 250,000 240,000 1,137,500 Vests three or four years after grant subject to performance Benets Benets in kind which are not pensionable relate to the provision of health insurance and life assurance cover.
