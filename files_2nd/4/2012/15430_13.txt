h In line with current practice the Committee has decided in 2013 to make an administrative change to the rules of the TWPSP and also to the STIA rules so as to convert the contingent award structure to a nil-cost option structure with a short term exercise period of six months following which the option will lapse if not exercised.
This change applied to all outstanding awards held by current Directors and employees and are expected to apply, in normal circumstances, to all future awards.

Statement of shareholder voting At the 2012 Annual general meeting, 93.22% of our shareholders who voted, voted in favour of the Companys 2011 Remuneration Report and, as stated earlier, we have consulted further with our shareholders on remuneration matters during the year.
Whilst we are in no way complacent about the need to ensure that remuneration continues to reect the achievement of the Companys strategic objectives and the level of return being delivered to shareholders, in view of the enhanced reporting recommended by BIS noted earlier most of which is reected in this years reporting, we believe the current situation is satisfactorily explained and we hope that shareholders will, again, support the Remuneration Report at the AGM on 25 April 2013.
Approval This Remuneration Report was approved by the Board of Directors on 28 February 2013 and signed on its behalf by the Remuneration Committee Chairman: Tony Reading 28 February 2013 56 Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
