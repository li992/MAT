For the Long-term PSP awards granted in June August 2009 that are e[ercisable from 31 December 2013 to 30 December 2019, there are two performance targets applying.
Half of the Award is subMect to a Performance Target based on the Groups absolute earnings per share during the 2012 13 Financial ear as follows: EPS for the 2012 2013 Financial ear Percentage of one half of award that vests Below 14p Nil 14p 25% Between 14p and 17p Between 25% and 100% calculated on a straight line basis.
17p or more 100% The other half of the Award is subMect to a Performance Target comparing the Companys Total Shareholder Return against the FTSE All-Share Media Sector between 1 June 2009 and 31 December 2013.
25% of this portion of the award vests if ITE is at the median, with full vesting for upper quartile performance.
Between median and upper quartile, an award vests on a straight line basis between 25% and 100% based on rankings plus interpolation between intermediate rankings.
The cost of all share awards charged to the profit and loss account for the year ending 30 September 2012 was 2.1 million 2011: 1.7 million.
The ITE share incentive plans operate within a standard 10% in ten year dilution limit.
This provision takes account of all potentially dilutive awards made by the Company under any of its share incentive plans.
This is because as with other London Stock E[change companies the Company does not operate any form of share incentive on an all employee basis and therefore does not have an internal dilution limit of 5% in ten years for discretionary schemes.
The Committee continues to be of the view that this approach, whichhas been previously agreed with shareholders, remains appropriate and that, therefore, it would be inappropriate to introduce a dilution limit that relates to awards under discretionary e[ecutive schemes only.
However, the Committee will keep the dilutive impact of the share incentive schemes under regular view to ensure that the interests of shareholders are taken into account.
The ma[imum number of additional i. e. in addition to the e[isting 4,436,160 in issue new share issues possible under the ten year dilution limits in the option trust deeds is 20,450,180.
Additionally the Employees Share Trust ESOT can hold up to 5% of the Companys issued share capital against share awards.
