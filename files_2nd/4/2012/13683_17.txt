RPC Group Plc 50 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Remuneration report This remuneration report sets out the Companys policy on the remuneration of executive and non-executive directors together with details of directors remuneration packages and service contracts for the financial year ended 31 March 2012.
The Board is responsible for both the general policy on remuneration and its cost but has delegated prime responsibility for the Chairmans and executive directors remuneration to the Remuneration Committee.
The remuneration and terms of appointment of the non-executive directors are determined by the Board as a whole.
The Company maintains contact with its shareholders about remuneration in the same way as for other matters and, as required by section 439 of the Companies Act 2006, this remuneration report will be put to an advisory vote of the Companys shareholders at the Annual General Meeting AGM on 18 July 2012.
Remuneration Committee The members of the Remuneration Committee and its Chairman are as follows: From To S Rojahn Chairman from 1 April 2012 25 May 2006 To date P S Wood Chairman to 31 March 2012 1 April 2009 31 March 2012 M G Towers 1 April 2009 To date J R P Pike 1 April 2012 30 May 2012 I Haaijer 30 May 2012 To date The Chairman and Chief Executive are consulted on proposals relating to the remuneration of other executive directors and designated senior management and, when appropriate, are invited by the Committee to attend meetings but are not present when their own remuneration is considered.
The role of the Remuneration Committee is set out in its terms of reference which are reviewed annually and can be found on the Groups website.
The Remuneration Committee meets at least twice each year and thereafter as circumstances dictate.
The number of meetings held during the year and the attendance of members of the Committee are shown in the table on page 39.
The Committees principal responsibilities are: setting, reviewing and recommending to the Board for approval, the Groups overall remuneration policy for the Chairman, executive directors and senior management: reviewing and approving individual remuneration packages for the Chairman, executive directors and certain senior managers: reviewing and approving service contracts for executive directors including notice periods and terms for cessation of employment: and reviewing the rules, approving new grants and setting the performance conditions of any Group share or cash based incentive schemes and reviewing the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and where appropriate shareholders.
During the year, New Bridge Street NBS, a trading name of Aon Hewitt Limited, was engaged by the Committee to provide it with remuneration consultancy services.
These services were provided to the Committee independently of pension consultancy, accounting and actuarial advice that Aon Hewitt Limited and associated companies provides to the Group.
The terms of engagement between the Company and NBS are available from the Company Secretary on request.
In addition, advice was sought from Ashurst LLP, the Companys legal advisers, in respect of the drafting of the rules for the RPC Group Annual Bonus Plan and the grant and vesting of options and awards under the Companys share option and incentive plans.
Remuneration Policy Non-executive Directors The Board as a whole determines the remuneration of non-executive directors based on the recommendations of the Chairman and Chief Executive and comparison with other companies of a similar size and sector.
Non-executive directors receive directors fees only and do not participate in any bonus or share-based incentive schemes.
The total value of directors fees that may be paid is limited by the Companys Articles of Association to 500,000 p. a.
Directors fees are not payable to executive directors.
Under normal circumstances non-executive directors and Committee Chairmens fees are fixed for three years.
No additional fees are payable for membership of a committee.
The Board conducted its last triennial review of non-executive directors fees in January 2011 taking into account current practice and market data for companies of a similar size provided by NBS.
The Board approved an increase in fees from 32,000 p. a. to 37,000 p. a. fixed for a period of three years with effect from 1 April 2011 for all non-executive directors and confirmed its policy on fees for committee membership i. e. that no additional fees would be payable for membership of committees.
In addition, the fees awarded to the Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees in recognition of their responsibilities in these roles were increased from 5,000 to 7,000 each p. a.
The Remuneration Committee normally reviews the Chairmans fees every three years.
In March 2011, the Committee approved an increase in the Chairmans fees from 123,000 to 140,000 p. a. with effect from 1 April 2011 fixed for three years.
In determining the level of fees, the Committee considered the size and complexity of the Groups business, the time commitment and responsibilities of the role and, although used with caution given the risk of an upward ratchet in pay, relevant market data.
Overview Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information RPC Group Plc 51 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Executive Directors The Remuneration Committee considers the need to attract, retain and motivate executive directors and senior management in determining appropriate remuneration policies and packages.
It also takes into account the internal pay and benefits practice and employment conditions both within the Group as a whole and within the particular national contexts in which it operates.
External comparisons examine current market trends and practices and equivalent roles in similar companies taking into account their size, business complexity, international scope and relative performance.
Consideration is also given to the risks arising from market comparisons and inappropriate performance criteria.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the remuneration policy during the year and has continued to give particular consideration to the issue of performance related remuneration and best practice requirement that the performance related element should form a significant proportion of the remuneration package of executive directors.
Annual awards to executive directors and senior managers have been made under the RPC Group 2008 Performance Share Plan since its adoption in July 2008.
During the year under review, the Committee has paid particular attention to the introduction of an annual bonus scheme.
As a consequence, the RPC Group Annual Bonus Plan was established with effect from 1 April 2011, further details of which are set out below.
The addition of this annual bonus arrangement to the remuneration packages of senior management has enabled the Company to make further progress towards compliance with best practice as it relates to performance related pay.
The Remuneration Committee will keep the policy on performance related remuneration and the balance between fixed and variable pay under continuous review.
Taking into account the changes to executive directors remuneration packages explained in this report, their packages remain below median for comparable benchmarks.
The Committee remains comfortable that the remuneration policy accords with the Companys risk policies and systems and neither encourages nor rewards inappropriate operational or governance risk-taking.
Remuneration Components The key components of the remuneration of executive directors are set out below: Basic Salary Salaries for executive directors and senior managers are reviewed annually by the Committee, although not necessarily increased.
Salary increases are determined after taking into account an individuals responsibilities, abilities, experience and performance as well as both the Groups own salary structures, pay and conditions in the relevant countries as described above and, although used with caution, market data on salary rates for similar positions in comparative companies.
In determining the basic salary increases, the Committee aims to bring remuneration closer to the market median for companies of a similar size and complexity, where considered appropriate, taking into account the experience and performance of the individuals concerned together with the other factors referred to above.
For the financial year under review, there were no increases to base pay for the executive directors due to the introduction of a cash bonus under the RPC Group Annual Bonus Plan which increases the performance related proportion of total pay.
For the year commencing 1 April 2012 the basic salary for R J E Marsh will be increased by 2.4% to 288,400 p. a. being the standard increase applying to UK employees.
With effect from 1 April 2012 the basic salary for P R M Vervaat will increase from 309,000 to 334,000 p. a.
This increase reflects the Committees view on his personal performance, changes to the role over the last year and a desire to move the base salary closer to market norms.
Supplements and Allowances R J E Marsh receives a supplement of 20% of basic salary in lieu of employer pension contributions with effect from 1 August 2010.
P R M Vervaat receives a fixed allowance of 34,000 p. a. for regularly working outside the Netherlands.
These supplements and allowances are non-pensionable and are not taken into account when determining base salary for performance related remuneration.
Benefits in Kind Benefits in kind provided for executive directors are principally a fully expensed car, mobile telephone and private health cover.
UK accommodation and expenses for travel to the UK are provided for P R M Vervaat and tax equalisation payments in respect of these benefits.
Benefits in kind are not pensionable and are not taken into account when determining base salary for performance related remuneration.
Performance Related Remuneration Annual bonus The RPC Group Annual Bonus Plan was approved by the Remuneration Committee and established with effect from 1 April 2011, in order to provide the framework for an annual incentive for executive directors and eligible senior managers with the aim of promoting the achievement of the corporate strategy and success of the Group.
The incentive for the financial year ended 31 March 2012 was in the form of a cash bonus based on a requirement for a significant increase in the Groups adjusted PBIT profit before interest and tax, taking into account the effect of the acquisition of Superfos.
The maximum bonus payable was 50% of salary, with a sliding bonus scale commencing at 0% of salary and a challenging threshold target level of performance.
In addition, the bonus payable would be reduced by 25% if the targeted level of free cash flow generation was not achieved.
The actual adjusted consolidated PBIT for the year after deducting pension financing costs reclassified as interest costs since the target was set was 75.4% of the maximum performance target.
The Group consolidated free cash flow target was met resulting in no reduction and cash bonuses payable of 37.7% of base pay for executive directors.
RPC Group Plc 52 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Remuneration report continued The performance conditions for the annual bonus for the financial year ending 31 March 2013 will continue to be based on the Groups adjusted PBIT with a sliding bonus scale commencing at 0% of salary and a challenging threshold target level of performance.
The bonus payable will again be reduced by 25% if the targeted level of Group consolidated free cash flow generation is not achieved.
Following consultation with major investors, the maximum bonus payable to executive directors will be increased from 50% to 100% of base salary for achieving a demanding level of financial performance.
Any bonus payable will be divided equally between cash and an award of deferred shares in the Company.
The deferred shares will normally vest three years after they are awarded subject to continued service and a clawback provision whereby entitlement to unvested shares will be forfeit in the event of a material misstatement of the Groups consolidated results or serious misconduct.
An exceptional negative event clause will also be introduced.
A small number of senior executives participated in the annual bonus for the year ended 31 March 2012 with the same threshold and maximum targets as executive directors but at a lower proportion of base salary.
The annual incentive arrangements will be extended to a wider group of senior executives for 2012 13 with the same threshold and maximum targets as the executive directors but at a lower level of base pay and with no deferral in shares.
Any bonuses paid are non-pensionable and are not taken into account when determining base salary for performance related remuneration.
Long-term Share Based Incentives RPC Group 2008 Performance Share Plan The Companys long-term incentive plan for executive directors and senior management is the RPC Group 2008 Performance Share Plan the Plan.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for selecting eligible employees, including executive directors, to participate and for granting conditional awards of a specified number of shares in the Company under the Plan.
Awards may be made in the form of an allocation of shares or an option to acquire shares.
No payment is required on grant, vesting or exercise of an award.
Until an allocation vests or an option is exercised, a participant has no voting, dividend or other rights in respect of the shares.
It is intended that awards will be satisfied by the transfer of existing shares purchased by the RPC Group Employee Benefit Trust established by the Company for the purpose.
An allocation of shares is transferred on the vesting date while an option may be exercised at any time following vesting until the day before the 10th anniversary of the date of grant.
Participants are eligible to be considered for awards annually.
The aggregate market value of awards made under the Plan in any one financial year may not exceed 200% of basic salary.
However, annual awards will normally be limited to 100% of base salary with the 200% maximum reserved for exceptional circumstances.
The number of shares awarded is determined according to the average of the mid-market price of the Companys shares at the close of business for the five dealing days immediately preceding the award date.
Awards are subject to performance conditions determined by the Remuneration Committee which must be satisfied before an award vests.
Performance is measured over a three-year performance period commencing on 1 April of the year in which an award is granted.
There will be no retesting.
The Committee will regularly monitor the continuing suitability of the performance conditions and may impose different conditions on awards granted in subsequent years.
The Committee has given careful consideration to alternative performance measures for awards under the Performance Share Plan.
It considers that sustained growth in earnings per share EPS most accurately captures the impact of managements decisions and actions in areas such as production efficiency, margin improvement and efficient use of resources.
In terms of creating long-term shareholder value, sustained growth in profitability means that EPS is the most appropriate measure of performance.
The annual awards are made to executive directors and senior managers according to eligibility criteria determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The main features of the awards are: The awards will vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant contingent on the satisfaction of an average growth in reported adjusted EPS relative to the Consumer Price Index CPI for the three-year performance period commencing on 1 April in the financial year of grant and the participant remaining in employment with the Group.
Average growth will be measured on a point-to-point basis.
The table below shows the performance vesting schedule of earnings per share relative to CPI.
EPS growth above CPI % of award 2010 and 2011 2008 and 2009 vesting awards awards Threshold 25% 5% 3% Maximum 100% 10% 6% Failure to achieve the threshold level of performance will result in the full award lapsing: there will be no retest facility.
Vesting between the threshold and maximum is on a straight-line sliding scale basis.
For all three awards from 2008 to 2010 inclusive, the face values of the awards were 66% of basic salary for the Chief Executive, R J E Marsh, and on average 50% of base salary for other eligible executives, including other Board members.
These awards were made in the form of a conditional allocation of shares.
To further increase the focus on performance related pay the face value of the awards for 2011 was increased to 75% of basic salary for the executive directors, R J E Marsh and P R M Vervaat, and remained at an average of 50% of base salaries for other selected executives.
The 2011 awards were made in the form of nil cost options.
The number of shares awarded to executive directors and other information is given in the table on page 58.
Overview Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information RPC Group Plc 53 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 In addition to the adjustment of the number of shares awarded to take account of the diluting effect of the rights issue in January 2011 as described on page 53, the Remuneration Committee also considered the effect of the rights issue and acquisition of Superfos Industries a s on the adjusted EPS performance measure for outstanding awards made in 2008, 2009 and 2010 under the Performance Share Plan.
The Committee sought advice from NBS on the appropriate approaches to the calculation of adjusted EPS for the base year and end financial year used to measure performance for each award year.
Based on this advice, the Committee decided that adjusted EPS for all base financial years and, for the 2008 award, the end financial year would be calculated on the same basis as required under IAS 33 Earnings per Share.
The performance conditions for the award made in 2008 were met in full and the shares vested on 18 August 2011.
Details of the number of shares that vested for executive directors and other information is shown in the table on page 58.
2012 Award The Remuneration Committee intends to make awards under the Plan in July 2012 to the executive directors and certain senior managers at the same level of basic salary as 2011.
The Committee considers that EPS remains the most appropriate performance measure and has concluded that the performance conditions applied to the 2011 award remain stretching and relevant.
Therefore, for the 2012 award, the threshold performance at which 25% of the award will vest will remain at 5% average annual adjusted basic EPS growth over CPI and full vesting of the award will occur where the average annual adjusted basic EPS growth is 10% or more above CPI.
All other main features that applied to the awards made in previous years will be applied to the 2012 award.
RPC Group 2003 Approved and Unapproved Executive Share Option Schemes The Performance Share Plan is the current long-term incentive arrangement used for the executive directors.
However, there remain some outstanding options under executive share option schemes.
Under the Rules of the RPC Group 2003 Approved Executive Share Option Scheme and the RPC Group 2003 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme the 2003 Schemes, market value options may be granted which are normally exercisable between three and ten years after the date of grant.
The aggregate value of options granted to an employee under the 2003 Schemes in any financial year will not normally exceed their basic annual salary although this limit may be exceeded where the Remuneration Committee determines that special circumstances exist.
It is not intended that further grants will be made to executive directors under the 2003 Schemes.
RPC Group 2003 Sharesave Scheme Executive directors are able to participate in invitations under the RPC Group 2003 Sharesave Scheme and the RPC Group 2003 International Sharesave Scheme on the same terms as all other eligible employees.
The UK Scheme is HM Revenue and Customs HMRC approved and the unapproved International Scheme allows overseas employees to participate on terms that are no more beneficial than those for UK participants.
Options are granted at an exercise price equal to 80% of the market price of the Companys shares at the close of business on the last dealing day, or the average of the last three dealing days, before the invitation date.
Rights Issue Adjustment In the event of any variation in the share capital of the Company such as a rights issue, under the Rules of the Companys Performance Share Plan and its employee share option schemes, the Remuneration Committee may make an appropriate adjustment to the number and price of shares or options awarded, having taken professional advice.
The aim of such adjustments is to eliminate the diluting effect of a rights issue and maintain the aggregate amount payable and the aggregate value of shares under an option or award.
In accordance with advice from Ashurst LLP based on HMRC guidance, the Committee approved an adjustment factor for the number of shares awarded or under option of 1.2534 and an option price adjustment factor of 0.7978 in respect of the 5 for 8 rights issue approved by shareholders on 6 January 2011.
These factors are based on the last day cum rights price of 301.50p per share and the theoretical ex-rights price of 240.54p per share and have been approved by HMRC.
Shareholding Policy To reinforce the linkage between senior executives and shareholders, the Remuneration Committee has adopted a shareholding policy that applies to directors and other executives eligible to receive awards conditional on performance under its long-term incentive arrangements.
Such executives are required to build up and retain a personal shareholding worth an equivalent of a minimum of 50% of their prevailing base salary.
It is expected that the required shareholding will be built up over a number of years by retaining a minimum number of any shares that vest or options that are exercised until the required level is met.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to waive the requirement in exceptional circumstances.
Once attained, a subsequent fall below the required level may be taken into account by the Committee when determining the grant of future awards.
Pension Provision UK pension scheme R J E Marsh is a member of the RPC Containers Limited Pension Scheme.
This is a defined benefit pension scheme which is a funded, final salary, HMRC Registered Scheme.
RPC Group Plc 54 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Remuneration report continued The Scheme provides a pension of one 60th of final pensionable earnings average of the final 3 years since 1 June 2003 for each year of pensionable service plus widows and dependants pensions.
In addition, R J E Marsh has been granted a pension supplement uplifting pension benefits from all sources, including the RPC Scheme, up to two-thirds of pensionable earnings.
The supplement, payable at his normal pension age under the Scheme of 65 years, accrued uniformly over the period from 1 May 1989 until the age of 60.
Early retirement benefits may be taken from age 55 years reduced for early payment with the agreement of the Schemes Trustee.
In the event of death in service, a lump sum benefit of four times annualised earnings was provided.
Employee contributions were 11% of pensionable earnings or the above director could participate in a pension salary sacrifice arrangement whereby scheme members sacrifice an amount of their gross salary in exchange for the employer paying the employee pension contributions.
The employer contribution was 14.5% of pensionable earnings but it will make such additional payments to the Scheme as are appropriate to fund the pension supplement having regard to the advice of the Scheme Actuary.
R J E Marsh is responsible for meeting any tax charges arising if any from pension benefits.
With effect from 31 July 2010 the RPC Containers Limited Pension Scheme closed to future service accrual.
However, life assurance for R J E Marsh continues to be provided under an insurance contract.
The Remuneration Committee agreed to pay R J E Marsh a supplement of 20% of basic salary in lieu of employer pension contributions.
The supplement is not included in base salary for the purposes of performance related remuneration.
With effect from 1 April 2011 R J E Marsh became a deferred member of the Scheme.
Further information about this pension scheme is given in note 25 to the financial statements.
Dutch retirement benefits P R M Vervaat has an individual defined benefit pension policy with a Dutch insurance company, .
The plan provides pension benefits of 2.25% p. a. of pensionable salary and a spouses pension of 70% of his pension on death.
The employee contribution rate was 8.5% of basic pensionable salary during the year.
Employer contributions are capped at 60,000 p. a.
This type of pension arrangement is consistent with normal practice in the Netherlands.
The Committee approves the pension arrangements and contributions made by the Group on behalf of the executive directors.
The Company does not contribute to any pension arrangements for non-executive directors.
Service Contracts The Committee determines the terms of the service contract for each executive director.
Service contracts normally continue until the directors agreed retirement date or such other date as the parties agree.
The service contracts contain provision for early termination.
Notice periods given by the employing company are normally limited to 12 months or determined by local employment legislation.
However, in truly exceptional circumstances, the Remuneration Committee may consider limited extension of the notice period up to two years in respect of an executive director recruited from outside the Group in order to secure an appointment as was the case for P R M Vervaat see below.
A directors service contract may be terminated without notice and without any further payment or compensation, except for sums accrued up to the date of termination, on the occurrence of certain events such as gross misconduct.
If the employing company terminates the employment of a UK executive director in breach of contract, compensation is limited to salary due for any unexpired notice period and any amount assessed by the Remuneration Committee as representing the value of other contractual benefits which would have been received during the period.
Payments in lieu of notice are not pensionable.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an executive director under the Companys employee share option schemes or Performance Share Plan or bonus entitlement under the Annual Bonus Plan will be determined at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee in accordance with the relevant schemes rules.
A participants options and performance share awards lapse and right to any part of the relevant bonus ceases if he resigns or is dismissed.
In the event of a change of control of the Company, with the exception of P R M Vervaat see below, the notice period and compensation for breach of contract for executive directors is unchanged from the provisions described above.
Executive directors of the Company have no additional entitlement to compensation for loss of their office as directors.
The following table shows details of the service contracts for executive directors who held office during the year ended 31 March 2012: Name Commencement Date Notice Period R J E Marsh 17 May 1993 12 months P R M Vervaat 1 November 2007 12 months In the event of a change of control, the notice period for P R M Vervaat is extended to 24 months if the employing Group company gives notice during a period of one year following such change of control.
Thereafter the notice period reverts to 12 months.
There is no reversion to a 12 month notice period on change of control after an initial period of employment with the Group.
This does not comply fully with provision D. 1.5 of The UK Corporate Governance Code.
At the time of appointment, it was concluded that, given the quality of the individual and the benefits to the Company from securing his appointment, the term should be accepted.
However, it has been agreed that the 24 month notice period will cease to apply with effect from 1 July 2012 and thereafter the notice period in the event of a change of control will be 12 months.
Dutch employment law governs the notice period given in the event of dismissal as a result of a disciplinary procedure.
On 7 March 2011, R J E Marsh was appointed as a non-executive director of British Polythene Industries PLC.
In its approval of the external appointment, the Board agreed that any related earnings as disclosed in the notes under the Directors Emoluments table may be retained by him.
Overview Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information RPC Group Plc 55 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Non-Executive Directors Letters of Appointment Non-executive directors are not employed under service contracts and do not receive compensation for loss of office, but are appointed for fixed terms of three years renewable for further three-year terms if both parties agree and subject to annual re-election by shareholders.

P R M Vervaat is paid in euros.
The effect of the marginal weakening of the average exchange rate for sterling against the euro was to increase the sterling equivalent of his basic salary and allowance by 4,000 2011: decrease of 12,000 for the year ended 31 March 2012 compared with the previous year.
The threshold target for the Groups adjusted PBIT and free cash flow for the year ended 31 March 2012 were exceeded resulting in a cash bonus of 37.7% of base salary payable to R J E Marsh and P R M Vervaat.
Further details of the Annual Bonus Plan and the performance targets are given on pages 51 and 52.
The benefits in kind for P R M Vervaat include UK accommodation, the cost of commuting from the Netherlands to the UK and UK income tax on these benefits.
During the year, R J E Marsh received fees of 40,000 in respect of his non-executive directorship of British Polythene Industries PLC.
Retirement benefits accrued to two 2011: two executive directors who were in office during the year under defined benefit schemes.
However, as a result of the closure of the RPC Containers Limited Pension Scheme, future service accrual ceased for R J E Marsh on 31 July 2010 and, with effect from 1 August 2010, a supplement of 20% of basic salary is paid in lieu of employer pension contributions.
The supplement paid for the year ended 31 March 2012 was 56,000 compared with the supplement for eight months of 37,000 paid the previous year.

Overview Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information RPC Group Plc 57 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 UK Pension Scheme The year end accrued pension is that which would be paid on retirement based on service up to 31 July 2010 and final pensionable earnings at 31 March 2011, the date the director ceased to be a Continuing Member of the Scheme, increased in line with the Rules of the Scheme.
These increases are broadly inflationary increases on pension earned after 1 April 1995 and a late retirement uplift from age 60 on pension accrued before 1 April 1995.
Member contributions have been nil since the Scheme closed to future service accrual on 31 July 2010.
The accrued pension and transfer value for R J E Marsh includes an allowance for his retained benefits which have been offset against his accrued pension at 1 April 2011.
The transfer values have been calculated using the Schemes standard approach at the relevant dates without any reduction for underfunding.
The increase in transfer value during the year is mainly driven by market value adjustment factors including the fall in gilt yields.
