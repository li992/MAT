2 Date of appointment, if later.
3 Award made prior to joining the Board.
4 The 2008 09 LTIP award failed to meet its performance condition and has therefore lapsed.
5 The 2009 10 PSP award was dependent on the Companys TSR performance as outlined below over the three financial periods ended 1 May 2010, 30 April 2011 and 28 April 2012.
Since 28 April 2012, the Remuneration Committee has reviewed this performance condition and has determined that it has not been met.
Accordingly, these awards have now lapsed.
For 2009 10 PSP awards the TSR performance is compared to that of a bespoke weighted index comprising UK and European retailers.
This group comprised: Brown N Group, Carphone Warehouse Group, Debenhams, Game Group, Kesa Electricals, Kingsher, Marks and Spencer Group, Metro Group, HMV Group, Home Retail Group, Inchcape, Signet Group, Praktiker, PPR, Sports Direct International, Tesco, Halfords, Next and WH Smith Group.
All companies had equal weighting within the group other than Kesa Electricals and Metro Group, who have greater competitive relevance and therefore have double weighting.
Under this condition full vesting occurs for performance equivalent to the upper quartile over the three-year performance period, reducing to 25% of an award vesting for performance equivalent to median with no vesting below this level.
Vesting between these targets will occur on a straight-line basis.
6 PSP awards made in 2010 11 were subject to TSR performance relative to the FTSE 250 Index comprising FTSE 101-350 companies, excluding investment trusts, at the start of the performance period.
Full vesting would occur for upper quartile performance with 25% vesting for median performance with straight line vesting between the two.
No award vests for below median performance.

6 Options granted under the Sharesave Scheme are exercisable in the six month period following the date of maturity of the savings contracts which have terms of three years.

Accordingly, upon resignation from the Board, John Browett had earned two thirds of his potential entitlement and Nicholas Cadbury had earned one third of his potential entitlement.
