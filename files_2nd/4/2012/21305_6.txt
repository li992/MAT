The provision of a market competitive package of benefits is important to attracting and retaining the Pension and benefits talented staff Barclays needs to deliver Barclays strategy.
A new defined contribution pension scheme, the Barclays Pension Savings Plan, and a flexible benefits scheme, My Rewards, was launched in the UK in September 2012.
This enables employees to choose from a range of benefits including the level of their pension contribution, life assurance and private health benefits, annual leave with the ability to buy and sell subject to certain parameters, and participation in Barclays all employee share plans HMRC approved for UK participants.

Variable remuneration Annual bonuses incentivise the achievement of Group, business and individual objectives.
Annual bonus The ability to recognise performance through variable remuneration enables the Group to control flexibly its cost base and to react to events and market circumstances.
Bonuses remain a key feature of remuneration practice in the highly competitive and mobile market for talent within the financial services sector.
The Committee is careful to control the proportion of variable to fixed remuneration paid to individuals.
Bonus deferral requirements are significantly in excess of FSA requirements.
For FSA Remuneration Code Staff Code Staff the deferral rate is a minimum of 40% for bonuses of no more than 500,000 or 60% for bonuses of more than 500,000.
For non Code Staff, bonuses over 65,000 are subject to a graduated level of deferral.
2012 bonuses awarded to Managing Directors in the Investment Bank are 100% deferred.
Deferred bonuses are split equally between deferred cash bonuses under the Cash Value Plan CVP and deferred share bonuses under the Share Value Plan SVP, each vesting in equal annual tranches over three years subject to continued service and malus.
For Code Staff an additional six month holding period will be applied to 2012 share bonuses when they vest.
Deferred bonuses are subject to malus conditions which enable the Committee to reduce the vesting level of deferred bonuses including to nil in the event of, for example, employee negligence or inappropriate conduct, or a material failure of risk management.

The table below summarises the three steps taken by the Committee in finalising the 2012 incentives pool.
Adjustment for performance The Committee considered the overall performance of Barclays and individual Step 1 businesses.
The Committee also looked at any significant events and one off transactions that have had a material impact on the financial results.
The approach of the Committee is to use statutory profits as a starting point and then consider the impact of each adjustment.
The Committee does not regard own credit as reflective of performance and accordingly excludes these amounts from its consideration.
The Committee manages compensation based on a range of compensation ratios and is supported by advice from the Group Finance Director and Chief Risk Officer.
Holding the compensation ratios broadly flat to 2011 would have suggested an increase of 700m to the incentives pool.
Adjustments to reflect risk events in 2012 The Committee made adjustments to the 2012 incentives pool Step 2 totalling 860m.
In addition, adjustments were made to unvested deferred and long term incentive awards.
Further details on the risk adjustments made in 2012 are provided below and on the next page.
Additional adjustment to reposition Barclays in the market The Committees objective is to reposition Step 3 Barclays remuneration in the market and achieve a sustainable compensation ratio over time.
The Committee has made a further adjustment of 250m to make progress in achieving its objective, and the resulting 2012 incentives pool represents the starting point in 2013, i. e. the adjustments for risk events in 2012 and the market repositioning will not be added back in 2013.

This was driven by a reduction in salary costs reflecting a moderately declining headcount and reductions in the cost of post retirement benefits primarily reflecting scheme closures and benefit changes in the US and Spain, and lower interest cost for the UK Retirement Fund.

Adjustments to 2012 These are adjustments made by the Committee to reflect the significant risk events that 860 incentives pool to reflect impact Barclays.
For 2012 the Committee made discretionary risk adjustments as shown risk events in the table on page 80.
Adjustments to existing In certain circumstances the Committee may decide it is appropriate to exercise its 300 deferred and long term power to reduce the value of unvested deferred and long term incentive awards remuneration including to nil.
In 2012 the Committee clawed back approximately 300m of unvested deferred and long term awards, the majority of which related to the LIBOR investigation.
Combined with the adjustment to the 2012 incentives pool, the reductions for the LIBOR investigation exceeded the amount of the regulatory fines of 290m.
The risk adjustments outlined above are additional to the reduction in variable remuneration that naturally arises from the reduced profits as a result of the financial impact of the risk events.

84 I Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 barclays.
com annualreport The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Executive Director service contracts Barclays executive Director service contracts entitle the executive Directors to the fixed elements of remuneration and to consideration for variable remuneration each year.
The contracts do not have a fixed term but provide for a notice period from Barclays of 12 months.
Contracts may be terminated immediately with payments in lieu of notice being paid in phased instalments, subject to contractual mitigation.
In the event of termination for gross misconduct neither notice nor payment in lieu of notice is required.
The Committees approach to payments in the event of termination is to take account of the individual circumstances including the reason for termination, individual performance, contractual obligations and the terms of the deferred incentive plans and long term incentive plans in which the executive Director participates.
Termination provisions Contract termination provisions Antony Jenkins 12 months notice from the Company six months from the Director.
On notice from the Company 12 months salary payable and continuation of medical and pension benefits while an employee.

No future executive Director contract will include such terms.
Deferred bonus and LTIP awards treatment on termination Chris Lucas would normally continue to be entitled to receive unvested portions of deferred bonus if he was an eligible leaver under the relevant plan rules.
Any unvested awards under LTIPs would normally be released on the scheduled release date, pro-rated for time and performance, if Chris Lucas was an eligible leaver under the relevant plan rules.
The remuneration packages offered on appointment to any new executive Director are a specific part of the Committees Terms of Reference.
The terms of such packages must be approved by the Committee in consultation with the Chairman and except for the terms of his own remuneration the Group Chief Executive.
Any award made to compensate for forfeited remuneration from the new executive Directors previous employment may not be more generous than, and must mirror as far as possible, the terms of the forfeited remuneration.
Shareholding requirement From 2013 the Committee has introduced a new requirement that executive Directors should hold Barclays shares worth, as a minimum, four times salary.
The current executive Directors have five years from the introduction of the new requirement to meet it five years from appointment for a new executive Director and they have a reasonable period to build up to the requirement again if it is not met because of a share price fall.
Shares that count towards the requirement are beneficially owned shares including any vested share awards subject to holding periods including vested LTIPs.
Shares from unvested deferred share bonuses and unvested LTIPs do not count towards the requirement.
This requirement replaces the previous guidelines, enhances the alignment of shareholders and executive Directors interests in long term value creation, and positions Barclays at the higher end of market practice.
Current executive Directors shareholdings as compared to the new shareholding requirement are summarised in the chart on page 92.
The Committee also decided that from 2013 other members of the Group Executive Committee should be subject to a shareholding requirement in excess of the requirements of the FSAs Remuneration Code.
The shareholding requirement for other Group Executive Committee members is that they should hold Barclays shares worth, as a minimum, two times salary.
In all other respects the shareholding requirement for other Group Executive Committee members is the same as the requirement for executive Directors.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 85 Directors remuneration policy continued Illustrative scenarios for executive Directors remuneration The charts below show the potential value of the current executive Directors remuneration in three scenarios: Minimum i. e. fixed remuneration, Maximum i. e. fixed remuneration and the maximum variable remuneration that may be awarded and Mid-point i. e. fixed remuneration and 50% of the maximum variable remuneration that may be awarded.
For the purposes of these charts, the value of benefits is based on an estimated annual value.
The scenarios do not reflect share price movement between award and vesting.
A significant proportion of the potential remuneration of the executive Directors is variable and is therefore performance-related and at risk.
At the mid-point for the Group Chief Executive, 30% of total remuneration is fixed and 70% is variable, moving to 18% fixed and 82% variable at the maximum.
At the mid-point for the current Group Finance Director 29% of total remuneration is fixed and 71% is variable, moving to 17% fixed and 83% variable at the maximum.

The Committee Chairman has met with major shareholders and also with the Association of British Insurers, the National Association of Pension Funds and ISS to discuss remuneration matters.
The Chairman, Committee Chairman and the Group Chief Executive also receive frequent comments from private shareholders either in writing or at events such as our Annual General Meeting.
We listen to all of these comments and we try to respond to all of them.
The Committee takes account of the remuneration of the broader employee base when it considers the remuneration of the executive Directors.
The Committee receives and reviews detailed analysis of remuneration proposals for employees across all of the Groups businesses.
This includes analysis by corporate grade and by performance rating and details of proposed bonuses and salary increases across the employee population.
When the Committee considers executive Director remuneration it therefore makes that consideration in the context of a detailed understanding of remuneration for the broader employee population.
Our approach to executive Director and wider employee remuneration during 2013 will be characterised by a focus on bearing down on costs and ensuring the principles of our new remuneration policy are applied at all levels.
Comparison of executive Directors remuneration packages with remuneration packages for the broader employee population The structure of total remuneration packages for executive Directors and for the broader employee population is similar.
Employees receive salary, pension and benefits and are eligible to be considered for a discretionary annual bonus.
The broader employee population typically does not have a contractual limit on the quantum of their remuneration.
The Committee approaches any salary increases for executive Directors on an exception-only basis.
Incremental annual salary increases remain more common among employees at less senior levels.
As with executive Directors, bonuses for the broader employee population are performance based.
Bonuses for executive Directors and the broader employee population are subject to deferral requirements.
Executive Directors and other Code Staff are subject to deferral at a minimum rate of 40% for bonuses of no more than 500,000 or 60% for bonuses of more than 500,000 but the Committee may chose to operate higher deferral rates.
For non-Code Staff, bonuses in excess of 65,000 are subject to a graduated level of deferral and in the Investment Bank, 2012 bonuses for Managing Directors are subject to 100% deferral.
Executive Directors deferred bonuses may include deferred share bonuses awarded under the SVP.
2012 deferred bonuses for the broader employee population will be awarded 50% under the SVP and 50% under the CVP, which vest over three years in equal tranches.
The terms of deferred bonus awards for executive Directors and the wider employee population are broadly the same, in particular the vesting of all deferred bonuses is subject to continued service and subject to malus conditions.
The broader employee population is not eligible to participate in the Barclays Long Term Incentive Plan in 2013.

The LTIP award shown above for 2012 is for the 2013-2015 performance period.
Details of 2012 remuneration The 2012 salary shown above of 0.833m is the salary Antony Jenkins received in respect of the whole of Salary 2012.
This reflects a salary in 2012 of 0.7m per annum for Antonys role as CEO of Retail and Business Banking until 29 August 2012 and 1.1m per annum as Group Chief Executive from 30 August 2012.
The Committee did not increase Antony Jenkins salary for 2013.
The 2012 pension value shown above of 0.215m is in respect of the whole of 2012.
This reflects Pension participation in the Afterwork pension plan from 1 January 2012 to 31 March 2012, cash in lieu of pension of 21% of salary from 1 April 2012 to 29 August 2012, and cash in lieu of pension of 33% of salary from 30 August 2012.
The cash in lieu of pension of 33% reflects market practice for senior executives in comparable roles.
Antony Jenkins benefits include private medical cover, life and ill-health income protection, tax advice, car Benefits allowance and the use of a company vehicle and driver when required for business purposes.
Antony is not entitled to tax equalisation.
The Committee considered Antony Jenkins performance for the whole of 2012 in the round.
It assessed his Annual Bonus performance against Group, business by reference to his previous role as CEO of Retail and Business Banking up to 29 August 2012 and individual measures.
In doing so the Committee considered 2012 financial performance, including the highlights which are detailed on page 78.
In considering his 2012 performance the Committee considered that Antony Jenkins had delivered strong Retail and Business Banking performance prior to accepting the role of Group Chief Executive at a difficult time for Barclays.
Since that time the Committee agreed he has quickly established a leadership profile that differentiates him from predecessors and a commitment to leading the changes required including strengthening the culture and control environment across Barclays.
The Committee welcomed Antony Jenkins contribution to its own work in managing remuneration costs and redressing the balance between employee and shareholder returns.
On 1 February 2013 Antony Jenkins announced that he did not wish to be considered for a bonus for 2012, citing his wish to bear an appropriate degree of accountability for multiple issues besetting the bank during the year.
The Committee decided to make an award to Antony Jenkins under the Barclays LTIP for the 2013-2015 Long Term performance period with a maximum potential payout value of 400% of his salary at the date of award not Incentive Plan taking into account the potential effect of share price movement between award and any payout.
2013-2015 The LTIP maximum value of 4.4m is based on the maximum number of shares that can vest at the end of a performance period of three years.
The maximum number of shares is 400% of salary at the start of the performance period divided by the share price at the date the award is made.
For the purposes of assessing the value at award of the LTIP taking into account the range of possible outcomes Barclays historical approach has been to ascribe a value of one-third of the maximum value assuming no share price movement.
So on the basis of this approach the value at award of the maximum LTIP to Antony as shown above is one-third x 4.4m, i. e. 1.467m.
For the 2013-2015 Barclays LTIP, performance conditions will be based on financial performance measured on return on risk weighted assets, risk measured by loan loss rate and a balanced scorecard.
Any award that vests after three years will be subject to a further two year holding period.

BIS single figure for 2012 remuneration The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills BIS draft disclosure regulations include a requirement to show a single figure for executive Director remuneration on a basis different to that shown on the opposite page.
The BIS single figure basis requires that for LTIPs, rather than including the value of any LTIP awarded in 2013, the payout value of any LTIP whose performance cycle ended in 2012 should be included instead.
Accordingly, the table below shows Antony Jenkins 2012 remuneration on the BIS single figure basis.
As Antony Jenkins was not a participant in a previous LTIP cycle that ended in 2012, the LTIP figure is shown as zero and his 2012 total remuneration on the BIS single figure basis is 1.129m.

Antony currently holds unvested LTIP awards under the Barclays LTIP for the performance period 2012-2014.
Prior to joining the Board, Antony participated in long term incentive plans linked to divisional performance.
These divisional plans were not appropriate to his new role as Group Chief Executive and were brought to an end.
The equivalent value of these arrangements was made as awards with the same vesting date over Barclays shares under the SVP and the Barclays LTIP for the performance period 2012-2014.
These awards are shown in the table on pages 100-101.
2013 objectives Antony Jenkins performance objectives for 2013, by which 2013 remuneration decisions will be measured, include Group and individual measures and are both financial and non-financial.
In line with the announcements of the outcomes of the Boards Strategic Review that were made on 12 February 2013, Antony is responsible for delivering the Transform commitments and the financial and non-financial commitments made in those announcements.
In assessing Antonys performance, the Committee will assess Antonys progress in working towards the 2015 financial targets including: Return on equity in excess of cost of equity and improvement in the quality of income and predictability of earnings: Reduction in the cost to income ratio: Management of the core capital ratio: and Improvement in the dividend payout ratio.
Other key actions include a focus on activities which support Barclays customers and clients: growing the UK, US and African franchises: restructuring the European retail and corporate businesses: repositioning the European and Asian equities and Investment Banking Division businesses: closing the Structured Capital Markets tax-related business unit: reducing risk weighted assets and investing in higher return businesses: and reducing operating expenses through a new approach to strategically manage costs.
Antonys performance will also be assessed by the Committee by reference to the relationships he builds with internal and external stakeholders, the leadership he provides in driving cultural change, and his success in building a strong compliance and control structure to restore public confidence in Barclays.

Details of 2012 remuneration Chris Lucas salary for 2012 was 0.8m.
The Committee did not increase his salary for 2013.
Salary As Group Finance Director Chris Lucas is contractually entitled to cash in lieu of pension contributions of Pension 25% of his salary per annum.
This reflects market practice for senior executives in comparable roles.
Chris Lucas benefits include private medical cover, life and ill-health income protection, tax advice, car Benefits allowance and the use of a company vehicle and driver when required for business purposes.
Chris is not entitled to tax equalisation.
On 27 June 2012, Chris Lucas agreed with the Board voluntarily to forgo any consideration for a bonus for Annual Bonus 2012.
This decision was made in the context of settlements reached by Barclays in relation to investigations by UK and US authorities into submissions made by Barclays to the bodies that set various interbank offered rates.
In the circumstances the Committee did not consider whether a bonus would be appropriate for 2012 but it did still consider Chris Lucas performance during the year against Group and individual performance measures.
The Committee noted and confirmed the assessment of his line manager, Antony Jenkins, that Chris Lucas had exceeded expectations for the year, contributing positively to the process of change underway since Antony became Group Chief Executive.
The Committee noted Chris Lucas effective execution of Barclays capital planning, his leadership of the finance function and his contribution to the Boards business practices review and medium term planning.
In doing so the Committee also considered the 2012 financial highlights as detailed on page 78.
The Committee decided to make an award to Chris Lucas under the Barclays Long Term Incentive Plan for Long Term the 2013-2015 performance period with a maximum potential payout value of 400% of his salary at the date Incentive Plan of award not taking into account the potential effect of share price movement between award and any 2013-2015 payout.
The LTIP maximum value of 3.2m is based on the maximum number of shares that can vest at the end of a performance period of three years.
So on the basis of this approach the value at award of the maximum LTIP to Chris as shown above is one-third x 3.2m, i. e. 1.067m.
The 2013-2015 performance condition for Chris LTIP is identical to that of Antony Jenkins 2013-2015 LTIP award as detailed on page 88, as is the subsequent holding period.

Vesting of the award is subject to Barclays total shareholder return TSR growth and return on risk weighted assets RoRWA performance over the performance period.
Each performance condition operates independently over 50% of the award respectively.
For the performance period RoRWA was 0.69%, below the threshold for the RoRWA element of the award to vest.
At the end of 2012 Barclays relative TSR performance was ranked fifth out of a peer group of 12.
The award was also subject to a discretionary underpin by which the Committee must be satisfied with the underlying financial health of the Group.
The Committee was satisfied that this underpin was met, and accordingly determined that the award should vest to the extent of 23% of the maximum number of shares under the total award.
The shares are scheduled to vest in March 2013.
The value of these shares as at 28 February 2013 is 0.643m as shown in the BIS single figure table above.
Chris Lucas also currently holds unvested LTIP awards under the Barclays LTIP for the performance periods 2011-2013 and 2012-2014.
2013 objectives Chris Lucas performance objectives for 2013, by which 2013 remuneration decisions will be measured, include Group and individual measures and are both financial and non-financial.
As for Antony Jenkins 2013 performance assessment as detailed on page 89, the Committee will assess Chris performance in line with delivering the Transform commitments.
Chris 2013 performance will also be assessed by the Committee by reference to driving the control agenda through leading the finance, tax and treasury functions, and building and strengthening relationships with investors, regulators and other stakeholders.
Chris objectives also include ensuring all risk and control frameworks and regulatory requirements are adhered to, and developing financing and liquidity frameworks which are a source of competitive advantage for Barclays.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 91 Implementation of Directors remuneration in 2012 continued Executive Directors shareholdings From 2013 the Committee has introduced a new requirement that executive Directors should hold Barclays shares worth, as a minimum, four times salary.
The current executive Directors have five years from the introduction of this new requirement to meet it five years from appointment for a new executive Director and they have a reasonable period to build up to the requirement again if it is not met because of a share price fall.
This requirement replaces the previous guidelines and positions Barclays at the higher end of market practice.
The chart below shows the value of Barclays shares held beneficially by Antony Jenkins and Chris Lucas as at 28 February 2013 that count towards the new shareholding requirement.
Executive Director beneficial shareholdings based on share price at 28 February 2013 000s Shareholding requirement Antony Jenkins 4,400 Shares held beneficially 4,853 Chris Lucas 3,200 2,802 The table below provides further details of the executive Directors shareholdings.
The format of this table reflects the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills draft disclosure regulation requiring disclosure of shares owned beneficially by executive Directors, and shares in which executive Directors have interests which are subject to either deferral terms or performance conditions.
The interests shown below that are subject to performance conditions are based on the maximum number of shares that may vest.
Further details on the executive Directors outstanding long term awards and shareholdings are shown on pages 100-101.

Bob Diamond voluntarily waived all of his unvested deferred bonus awards and long term incentive share awards and no compensation was paid to him in respect of these.
These awards had an estimated value of 19.9m on 3 July 2012.
Bob Diamond was not considered for an annual bonus for 2012 and he will not receive any future bonus or long term incentive awards.
In accordance with his contract of employment, Bob Diamond was tax equalised during 2012 on tax above the UK rate where that could not be offset by a double tax treaty.
He is not entitled to tax equalisation for income in respect of any period after 3 July 2012.

The performance of the Committee is reviewed each year as part of the Board Effectiveness Review.
This years review concluded that the Committee continues to operate effectively.
There was a diminution in overall score partly as a result of the increase in votes against the 2011 remuneration report.

Shareholder engagement The Committee was concerned at the disappointing level of support for last years remuneration report.
At the April 2012 Annual General Meeting 73% of the votes cast were in favour of the 2011 report, while 27% were against.
The Committee is resolute in seeking to receive significantly more votes in favour of this report at the 2013 Annual General Meeting.
The decisions we have made for 2012 and the policies we have set for 2013 and beyond show that determination.
We recognise that remuneration is an area of particular interest to shareholders and that in setting and considering changes to remuneration policy we must take into account their views.
Accordingly, a series of meetings were held in 2012 and early 2013 with major corporate shareholders and shareholder representative groups including the Association of British Insurers, National Association of Pension Funds and ISS.
The Committee Chairman attended these meetings, accompanied by senior Barclays employees including the Reward and Performance Director and the Company Secretary.
Matters discussed included executive Director remuneration, the Barclays LTIP for 2013 and the enhancement of executive shareholding requirements.
Discussions also covered total compensation and incentive costs, and strategic matters such as remuneration strategy and the allocation of distributable earnings between shareholders and employees.
The Committee notes that shareholder views on some matters are not always unanimous, but values the insight and engagement that these interactions and the expression of sometimes different views provide.
This engagement is not cosmetic.
It has contributed directly to the decisions made by the Committee for 2012 and for 2013. barclays.
