Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 33 Directors remuneration report for the year ended 31 October 2012 Statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Dear shareholder The past eighteen months have been extremely challenging for the Company, as continuing pressure on defence spending has resulted in increasingly uncertain prospects within the sector.
The Board has also had to address the uncertainty caused by a third party approach for the Group, and the departure of David Price from the role of Chief Executive and Paul Rayner from the role of Finance Director.
The Remuneration Committee has had to determine their termination arrangements, as well as the remuneration arrangements for the new Chief Executive and Finance Director.
Against this backdrop, the Remuneration Committee has needed to ensure that its remuneration policy is capable of appropriately rewarding and incentivising the revised senior management team to deliver improved performance.
It has also taken account of the forthcoming changes to remuneration reporting announced by the UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, and has sought to incorporate many of these early, in this years remuneration report.
The Committees basic policy remains to provide executive remuneration packages which are competitive, but not excessive, by reference to market rates across comparator companies.
These take into account the individual contribution and performance of each executive, and reect the performance of the business against financial objectives.
The Committee also remains conscious of its responsibility to ensure that remuneration appropriately aligns executive and shareholder interests.
Accordingly, the Remuneration Committee has made the following decisions in respect of 2012 and 2013: Mark Papworth and Steve Bowers have joined the Company on salaries that are below the level of their predecessors.
Their next review will take place in early 2014.
As in 2011, no bonuses will be paid to executive directors in respect of 2012.
The Performance Share Plan awards which could have vested on 20 January 2013 have lapsed, as the threshold level of earnings per share growth has not been achieved.
David Price and Paul Rayner received termination payments that were consistent with their contracts, namely the payment of one times annual salary plus benets.
Their deferred share awards, which were made in connection with their annual bonuses for 2009 and 2010, were also allowed to vest.
Dr Prices and Mr Rayners other long term incentive awards lapsed.
The structure of the annual bonus remains largely unchanged for 2013, with 40% of any award deferred in shares for three years and subject to claw-back.
The maximum annual bonus will be 125% of salary for Mr Papworth and 100% of salary for the other executive directors.
The Committee has reviewed the weighting of the financial and personal objectives in the annual bonus plan, and has increased the weighting on personal objectives for 2013 in recognition of the need to focus on key strategic and operational goals, given the ongoing review of the strategy.
At the time of negotiating Mr Papworths remuneration package, there was a high probability that a bid for the Company would be forthcoming, and that a new owner might not wish to maintain his employment.
Therefore, it was agreed with him that we would include some additional elements in his package that would protect him in this eventuality.
A change of control clause was agreed, which provides that, in the event of a change of control of the Company during the first twelve months of his employment, which results in the termination of his employment within a six month period thereafter, he will receive a lump sum payment of twelve months salary in lieu of notice and a guaranteed bonus, pro-rated for that proportion of the year during which he is employed.
This provision falls away after the first twelve months of his employment.
In addition, in order to provide an immediate alignment with shareholders, the Committee decided to award Mr Papworth performance shares worth 200% of his annual salary.
The Committee is aware that the priority of many shareholders is to see a significant increase in the share price, and we therefore decided to set a performance condition which was linked directly to such a result.
The award will vest in full if the share price reaches 500p at the end of the three year vesting period.
This represents an increase of 130% over the share price at the time of grant.
The Committee also intends to use a performance condition based on share price growth for the performance share plan awards to be made to other senior executives in early 2013.
If the full vesting share price of 500p for these awards is achieved, the Companys market capitalisation will have increased by over 394 million since the date of this report.
The change in strategy and appointment of a new Chief Executive and Finance Director mean that it is an appropriate time to review the remuneration policy for executive directors.
The Committee intends to conduct a fundamental review of its remuneration policy during 2013.
If the Committee proposes to make substantive changes to the executive directors remuneration policy, it will, as part of the review process, consult with shareholders and will report back on the outcome in next years report and accounts.
I F R Much Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2012 34 Corporate governance Directors remuneration report continued Introduction This report sets out the information required by Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008.
The report also satisfies the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and describes how the Board has applied the principles and complied with the provisions relating to directors remuneration in the UK Corporate Governance Code.

The fees paid to the Committees advisers in 2012 were: New Bridge Street 27,198 2011: 27,576.
The Committee consults internally with the Chief Executive and the Company Secretary.
Remuneration policy section General policy The aim of the remuneration policy is to enable the Company to offer a package of rewards that is aligned with the strategy for the business by: being competitive but not excessive by reference to market rates across comparator companies: taking into account the individual contribution and performance of each executive: reecting the performance of the business against financial objectives: and aligning the interests of executives with shareholders, by ensuring that a significant proportion of remuneration is performance-related and delivered in shares.
Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2012 Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 35 The Committee aims to align the interests of executive directors and senior executives with those of shareholders, by ensuring that a significant proportion of remuneration is performance-related.
This is achieved through the performance-related elements of the annual bonus and share-based incentives.
The Committee reviews the policy annually in light of market conditions, performance and developments in corporate governance best practice.
The Companys policy is that a substantial proportion of an executives remuneration should be performance-related and delivered in shares, which executives are required to hold under the Companys share ownership guidelines.
There are five main elements of the remuneration package for executive directors and senior management: base salary: benets: pension arrangements: annual bonus: and long term incentives.
The table below summarises the Companys 2013 remuneration policy, including any changes to the policy.

These are described in more detail below.
Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2012 38 Corporate governance Directors remuneration report continued Remuneration scenarios for executive directors The chart below shows how the composition of each executive directors remuneration package varies at different levels of performance under the policy set out above: Long term share awards Annual bonus Benets and pension Salary 2,200 2,000 44% 1,800 1,600 1,400 1,200 28% 22% 1,000 41% 800 26% 40% 600 26% 18% 20% 10% 6% 23% 400 26% 17% 80% 42% 22% 22% 13% 7% 23% 23% 14% 8% 78% 46% 26% 200 77% 46% 26% 0 Threshold Target Maximum Threshold Target Maximum Threshold Target Maximum Chief Executive Finance Director Group Legal Director & Company Secretary Notes 1.
The target and maximum vesting for the Chief Executives annual bonus is 62.5% and 125% of salary respectively, and 50% and 100% for the other executive directors.
For performance share awards, the target and maximum vesting is 50% and 200% of salary for the Chief Executive, and 37.5% and 150% of salary for the other executive directors.
Pension provision is 20% of salary for each director.
The value of other benets is assumed to be 22,000 for each director.
How employees pay is taken into account The Committee also considers and approves the base salaries for approximately thirty other senior executives, and reviews salaries for the next tier of management at each of the Groups businesses.
In addition, the Committee receives information on general pay levels across the Group.
The Committee, therefore, has due regard to salary levels across the Group in applying its remuneration policy.
How executive directors remuneration policy relates to the wider Group The remuneration policy described above provides an overview of the structure that operates for the most senior executives in the Group.
Lower aggregate incentive quantum operates at below executive level, with levels driven by market comparatives and the impact of the role.
Employees are provided with a competitive package of benets that includes participation in the Groups dened contribution pension arrangements.
Long term incentives are provided to the most senior executives and those anticipated as having the greatest potential to inuence performance levels within the Company.
However, in order to encourage wider employee share ownership, the Company operates a Sharesave Plan in the UK and a Stock Purchase Plan in the US, in which all UK and US employees are eligible to participate on completion of six months service.
How shareholders views are taken into account The Remuneration Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the Annual General Meeting each year and guidance from shareholder representative bodies more generally.
Shareholders views are key inputs when shaping remuneration policy.
During the year, the Committee engaged with its largest shareholders regarding the policy for 2012, including the choice and weighting of annual bonus performance targets and the earnings per share performance conditions for the performance share awards made in January 2012.
Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2012 000s Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Other information 39 Planned application of the policy for 2013 Base salary and benets The executive directors base salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee, and adjustments made, if appropriate, taking into account individual performance and comparable salary levels in relevant comparator companies.
The Committee refers to published salary surveys and data provided by its remuneration advisers, New Bridge Street, and also reviews the remuneration information presented in the annual reports of companies in comparator groups.
Factors that are considered during the annual review of base salary and benets include: reference to market rates across comparator companies those of similar size to Chemring or within the same sector : individual contribution and performance of each executive: and pay levels across the Group.
Mrs Ellards basic salary was increased to 210,000 p. a. with effect from 1 January 2013.
This increase is consistent with the general level of increases awarded to other employees of the Group up to 5%.
Benets consist of a fully-expensed company car or car allowance, life assurance and private medical insurance.
Pension Mrs Ellard was a member of the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme the Staff Scheme until 6 April 2010.
This is an approved final salary scheme, which is contracted-out of the State Second Pension, and which provides, at retirement, a pension of up to two-thirds of salary, subject to HM Revenue & Customs limits.
The pension arrangements for the executive directors under the Staff Scheme 1 80ths accrual rate only as far as the notional earnings cap were well below market norms.
As a result, the Committee agreed that, with effect from 6 April 2010, the executive directors would cease to participate in the Staff Scheme, and would instead, for all future service, receive a salary supplement of 20% of base salary.
Mrs Ellard therefore now receives a salary supplement of 20% of her prevailing base salary in lieu of membership of the Groups occupational pension scheme, as does Mr Papworth and Mr Bowers.
Annual bonus The annual bonus plan provides the framework for an annual incentive for executive directors and eligible senior managers, with the aim of promoting the achievement of the corporate strategy and success of the Group.
The maximum bonus award is capped at 125% of base salary for the Chief Executive and 100% for other executive directors.
40% of any bonus payable is deferred as a conditional award of the Companys shares, vesting of which is subject to continued employment save in good leaver scenarios three years from the award of the bonus.
The Committee has consistently set highly challenging bonus targets for the achievement of maximum bonuses.
No bonuses have been paid to the executive directors in the last two years, and the executive directors did not receive maximum bonuses in any of the prior three years.
For 2013, the Committee has set equally challenging targets but has increased the weighting on personal objectives, reecting the importance of delivering key strategic and operational goals in the current year, given the ongoing review of the strategy.
For the executive directors, earnings per share and cash ow will therefore each account for 30% of the total bonus opportunity, with personal objectives accounting for 40%.
When determining performance against the personal objectives, the Remuneration Committee will have discretion to reduce, potentially to zero, the payout in respect of the personal objectives element taking account of the Groups underlying financial performance.
The increase in the weighting on personal objectives is intended to be exceptional, and the Committee intends to return to a more significant weighting on financial objectives for 2014.
Long term incentives The Company operates the Chemring Group Performance Share Plan for the executive directors and other key members of the senior management team who inuence the performance and prospects of the Group.
Conditional awards of the Companys shares can potentially be made at a value of up to 150% of base salary each year under normal circumstances, with awards of up to 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances.
Awards vest three years after grant, subject to the extent to which a demanding performance condition has been achieved over a single three year performance period.
The vesting schedules for the awards granted to date, and which remain outstanding, are as follows: Total earnings per share growth per annum not compound over three financial years Awards to executive directors Threshold vesting Full vesting RPI 10% p. a.
25% vests for RPI 25% p. a. for awards awards up to 100% of salary up to 100% of salary Awards made on 125% of salary or after 20 January 2010 RPI 25% p. a. for any additional RPI 30% p. a. for awards awards over 100% of salary up to 125% of salary RPI 10% p. a.
25% vests for RPI 25% p. a. for awards awards up to 100% of salary up to 100% of salary Awards made on 150% of salary or after 19 January 2011 RPI 25% p. a. for any additional RPI 35% p. a. for awards awards over 100% of salary up to 150% of salary 3% p. a.
15% vests 10% p. a. for awards up to 100% of salary Awards made on 5% p. a.
25% vests 150% of salary or after 27 January 2012 12.5% p. a. for any additional 10% p. a. for any additional awards up to 150% of salary awards over 100% of salary Earnings per share is calculated on a fully diluted and normalised basis, as specified by the Committee prior to grant.
Chemring Group PLC Report and Accounts 2012 40 Corporate governance Directors remuneration report continued An award of performance shares worth 200% of salary was made to Mr Papworth on 21 November 2012.
The aim of the award was to ensure an immediate interest in the Companys performance and alignment with its shareholders, and was agreed as part of Mr Papworths recruitment package.
This award was made under the exceptional circumstances provisions of the Groups Performance Share Plan.
No further awards will be made to him in the current financial year.
Vesting of the awards is subject to the achievement of demanding targets linked to growth in the Companys share price over three financial years beginning with the current year, as follows: Average share price over the three month period from 1 August 2015 to 31 October 2015 Percentage of the award vesting Less than 275p Nil 275p approximately 26% above the Companys share price on the date of grant 25% 500p or above approximately 130% above the Companys share price on the date of grant 100% Between 275p and 500p Pro-rata between 25% and 100% on a straight-line basis In addition, this award will be subject to the Companys clawback arrangements which apply to all awards made under the Performance Share Plan from 2011 onwards.
These enable the Company to claw back awards prior to vesting in the event of subsequent discovery of material misstatement of the Companys financial results, and after having first clawed back any unvested deferred shares awarded as part of the annual bonus for the financial year in which the results were misstated.
The Committee has historically set highly challenging earnings per share targets, reecting the Boards confidence in the strong growth prospects for the Group but also the Committees rm commitment to align the interests of shareholders with the executive management through the use of significant levels of potential variable pay triggered by exceptional levels of performance.
In considering the performance condition for awards which will be made in 2013, the Committee has remained consistent with its commitment to tough target setting.
However, with defence budgets around the world continuing to be under significant pressure and given that the new senior management team is conducting an ongoing review of the Groups operations, it is difficult to set robust earnings per share performance targets for the next three years.
Earnings per share is not therefore felt to be an appropriate measure at the current time, and the long term incentives granted to other senior executives in early 2013 will also be subject to a performance condition based on the share price growth as set out below: Average share price over the three month period from 1 August 2015 to 31 October 2015 Percentage of the award vesting Less than 350p Nil 350p approximately 18% above the Companys share price on the date of this report 25% 500p or above approximately 69% above the Companys share price on the date of this report 100% Between 350p and 500p Pro-rata between 25% and 100% on a straight-line basis The Committee believes that the adoption of this performance condition will ensure that the Companys senior executives are appropriately aligned with one another and incentivised to achieving an improvement in the Groups share price.
However, the Committee intends to review the performance measures used in the Performance Share Plan going forward, and will consider reintroducing a financial measure such as earnings per share for future awards.
Shareholding guidelines Over a five year period following appointment, executive directors are expected to build-up and maintain a shareholding in the Company equivalent to one years basic salary.
Other participants in the Performance Share Plan are expected to build-up a shareholding equivalent to 25% to 50% of their basic salary over a five year period.
Other schemes The Company operates all-employee savings-related share schemes in the UK The Chemring Group 2008 UK Sharesave Plan, in which executive directors can participate, and in the US The Chemring Group 2008 US Stock Purchase Plan.
There are no performance criteria for these arrangements, and options are issued to all participants in accordance with UK HM Revenue & Customs and US Internal Revenue Service regulations.
The Company complies with the dilution guidelines contained within the ABI Principles of Remuneration.
At 31 October 2012, awards outstanding and issued under all share schemes during the previous ten years amounted to 3.5% of the ordinary share capital of the Company.
At 31 October 2012, awards outstanding and issued under executive share schemes during the previous ten years amounted to 2.95% of the ordinary share capital of the Company.

Service contracts should contain provisions permitting the Company to make any termination payments by instalments, and should require directors to mitigate their loss in such circumstances.
The Committee is aware of investors views and current best practice guidelines regarding change of control provisions, and its normal policy would be not to include such provisions in directors contracts.
However, Mr Papworth was recruited at a time when it was known that the Company was in discussions with a potential acquirer, and the Committee confirms that the change of control provision was necessary to secure his appointment at a time of considerable uncertainty.
Non-executive directors Non-executive directors do not receive compensation for loss of ofce, but are appointed for xed terms of three years, renewable for further three year terms if both parties agree and subject to annual re-election by shareholders.
Mr Hicksons appointment may be terminated on six months notice by either party.
The other non-executive directors appointments may be terminated by either party upon three months written notice.
Non-executive directors do not participate in the Companys pension, bonus or share-based incentive schemes.

Details of variable pay earned in the year Annual bonus plan For 2012, three quarters of the bonus potential was linked to two separate financial performance conditions, namely earnings per share and cash ow with equal weighting.
No bonus was payable for achievement of less than 90% of target, with bonuses being earned thereafter on a straight-line basis up to the maximum for 110% or better achievement of target.
One quarter of the bonus potential may be achieved in connection with satisfaction of personal objective criteria set out at the beginning of the year.
The payment of any bonus ultimately remains at the discretion of the Committee.
In the year the Committee did not use its discretion.
Awards worth 150% of base salary were granted on 27 January 2012: shares with a value at grant of 15% of salary will vest if earnings per share growth is 3% p. a. over the three year performance period, rising on a straight-line basis to 25% of salary vesting for growth of 5% p. a.
100% of salary vesting for growth of 10% p. a. and up to 150% of salary vesting for growth of 12.5% p. a..
Participation in the plan is at the discretion of the Committee, and currently includes the executive directors and senior managers.
