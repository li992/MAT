Short-term incentives are aligned financial year which were far in excess of formal shareholding to the groups strategic priorities, and are based as to 60% on guidelines adopted by any FTSE 100 company.
With Jamies much challenging annual financial performance targets and 40% on specific shorter tenure with the group, the opportunity to acquire a significant personal and strategic targets, while long-term incentives are directly shareholding has obviously not been available, but the committee linked to demonstrable value creation for shareholders.

We remain satisfied that SABMillers remuneration policies have been working well, but we will continue to evaluate all policies each year to ensure that they remain appropriate for the future.

I therefore commend to you this 1 Adjusted earnings per share directors remuneration report and hope that, with your continued support, we will be able to continue to strive to make SABMiller Application of remuneration policies during the year themost admired company in the global beer industry.
The application of these remuneration policies guided us in the determination of an appropriate remuneration package for Jamie Yours sincerely Wilson upon his appointment as an executive director and Chief Financial Officer in July 2011 and for Alan Clark in anticipation of his Miles Morland appointment as Chief Operating Officer and as an executive director Director inJuly 2012.
As can be seen from the table of annualised base pay Chairman of the remuneration committee onpage 71, Jamies base pay for his first year was considerably lower than the then current base pay of his predecessor, Malcolm Wyman, 11 June 2012 who had served as an executive director since 1999 and as Chief Financial Officer since 2001.
This reflects our policy of setting base The directors remuneration report continues on pages 70 to 83. pay in part according to experience in the role.
Jamie is a very experienced and capable professional, but the committee considered it appropriate to set base pay at a lower level during his first year in this role, with the intention of bringing it more into line with the market median after this initial period.
In accordance with this philosophy, thecommittee at its meeting in May 2012 increased Jamies annual base pay to 720,000, which is in line with the median of the current market and remains slightly below that of his predecessor.
Short-term incentives were set and remain in the same proportion, and long-term incentives offer exactly the same opportunity, as is appropriate, given that any amounts resulting from these incentives will be based on actual performance.
Similarly, Alans pay as Chief Operating Officer has been set, after external and internal benchmarking, at a level which the committee considers appropriate for the transitional year, while he absorbs the complexities of the global business, and builds the relationships and partnerships on which the groups business depends.
