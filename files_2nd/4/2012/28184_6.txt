It has been audited where indicated as such.
An ordinary resolution to approve the report will be put to the AGM on 4 September 2012.
Consideration of Matters Relating to Directors Remuneration The Remuneration Committee sits under the chairmanship of Mr Dicks as the Senior Independent Director with two independent Directors, Mrs Bates, who succeeded Mr Moule in October 2011 and Mr Montagu who served on the Committee throughout the year.
The Committee considers and makes recommendations on the remuneration of the Directors.
The Company has no employees other than the non-executive Directors.
Statement of the Companys Policy on Directors Remuneration The Board consists entirely of non-executive Directors, who meet regularly throughout the year to deal with the Companys affairs.
The total fees payable to all the Directors is limited by the Articles of Association to 200,000 per annum.
The principles of the Companys remuneration policy have been, and will continue to be for the forthcoming financial year, that fees payable to Directors should: reect the time spent by them individually and collectively as part of the Board on the Companys affairs: be of a level appropriate to the responsibilities borne by the Directors: be in line with market practice and sufficient to enable candidates of high calibre to be recruited and retained.
The policy also recognises: that the form of remuneration be in cash, payable monthly in arrears, to the Director personally or to a third party specified by him: and the rates are reviewed annually: such review will not necessarily result in any change to the rates.
As the Company is an investment trust and all the Directors are non-executive, it is considered inappropriate to have any long-term incentive schemes and the fees are not specically related to the Directors performance, either individually or collectively.
Remuneration Arrangements In the year under review the Directors fees were paid at the following annual rates, the Chairman 35,000 2011: 32,500 : other Directors 23,000 2011: 21,500.
Mr Ashford-Russell waived his fee for 2011 2012 and has indicated that he will do so for the forthcoming year.
The increase in fees was as previously announced and followed the recommendations of the external review of the Directors remuneration by Trust Associates in 2009 2010: An increase in Directors fees from 20,000 to 23,000 over two equal steps of 1,500 with effect from 1 May 2010 and 1 May 2011.
An increase in the fees paid to the Chairman of the Board from 30,000 to 35,000 over two equal steps of 2,500 with effect from 1 May 2010 and 1 May 2011.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Senior Independent Director to receive an additional fee of 3,000 for the added responsibilities.
The Committee met on 20 April 2012 to consider the level of Directors fees for the year ahead.
The Committee concluded that there should be no increase in the level of fees paid to the Directors.
However they felt that an external review of the fees would be appropriate which will be carried out along side the externally facilitated Board review to be reported in the 2013 annual report.
