Remuneration Report Letter from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Dear Shareholder, The last twelve months have seen significant changes at Bumi plc, and this has been reflected in the key activities of the Committee which included: In early 2012, the Committee determined that no annual bonuses would be paid by Bumi plc for 2011 to either of the Executive Directors at the time.
In March, Ari Hudaya and Andrew Beckham resigned from their Executive Director roles and the Committee confirmed their termination arrangements.
Ari Hudaya did not receive any termination payment or compensation for loss of office from Bumi plc.
Andrew Beckham received one months salary as a payment in lieu of notice.
Nalin Rathod and Scott Merrillees were subsequently appointed to the Board, into the roles of CEO and CFO, respectively.
The Committee agreed appropriate remuneration packages and service contracts.
On 31 December 2012, Nick von Schirnding succeeded Nalin Rathod as CEO.
The Committee agreed an appropriate remuneration package and service contract for Nick von Schirnding.
We also confirmed the termination arrangements for Nalin Rathod who stepped down from his role as an Executive Director.
He received a termination payment of one months salary and all his awards under the Bumi Incentive Plan lapsed in full.
Overseeing the first grants of long term incentive awards under the Bumi Incentive Plan, which were made in July 2012.
Determination that no Executive Director annual bonuses would be paid for 2012.
The Committee kept the remuneration policy for Executive Directors under regular review in 2012 and made two key changes to that disclosed last year: We have introduced bonus deferral.
From now on, half of any annual bonus payable to an Executive Director will be deferred into Bumi shares for a period of three years, in order to strengthen further long term alignment with shareholders.
We have also reduced the policy for annual awards of Performance Shares under the Bumi Incentive Plan from 200% of salary in 2011 although no awards were actually made to Executive Directors to 150% of salary, which was the award size in 2012 and will be the award size in 2013.
The Committee believes this more appropriately reflects the size of our business.
As part of the extensive review of PT Beraus financial position referred to earlier in this Annual Report, the remuneration and other payments made to Rosan Roeslani a director of Bumi plc as well as President Director of PT Berau prior to his departure on 19 December 2012 are being reviewed.
The nature and extent of these payments are set out in the notes on page 51 of this report where it is indicated that certain of these payments had not been disclosed to the Board of Bumi plc and were made without its knowledge.
Where appropriate, the Company will pursue all means available for the recovery of payments which should not have been made and will engage with regulators where relevant laws and regulations have not been complied with.
In future, whilst respecting PT Beraus status as a listed company in Indonesia, the Remuneration Committee of Bumi plc will ensure that, to achieve alignment, there is a stronger relationship with the remuneration committee of PT Berau.
The Board recognises that the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors of Bumi will need to be reviewed in the light of the changed circumstances since the Indonesian coal interests were acquired.
As indicated elsewhere in the Annual Report, it is the intention to appoint a new independent chairman of the Board and to restructure the Board at which time the Non-Executive Director pay will be reviewed to ensure it remains appropriate.
I would like to thank my colleagues on the Committee for their hard work and valuable input during the year.
Sir Graham Hearne Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Bumi plc Annual Report Page 41 Remuneration Report continued Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, and describes how the Board has complied with the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code relating to remuneration matters.
The report will be presented at the AGM on 26 June 2013 for approval and shareholders will be able to ask questions on the report at the AGM.
The report is divided into two parts: The first part sets out the Companys remuneration policy and the governance structures which underpin it.
This is not required to be audited.
The second part contains the remuneration tables that have been audited in accordance with the relevant statutory requirements.
The Remuneration Committee The Committee determines the remuneration packages, and any changes to the service contracts, of the Chairman, Executive Directors and other senior executives of Bumi plc.
The Committee also reviews and administers all Bumi share incentive plans.
The Chairman and Executive Directors determine the fees for the Non-Executive Directors.
The table below details the members of the Remuneration Committee, their role, the number of meetings the Committee had during the year and their respective attendance.
Members Meetings attended in 2012 Sir Graham Hearne Chairman 4 4 Sir Julian Horn-Smith 4 4 Amir Sambodo 4 4 The members of the Committee are all INEDs and free from any relationship that would affect their impartiality in carrying out their responsibilities.
The secretary to the Committee is the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary.
The Chairman of the Committee reports to subsequent meetings of the Board and the Board receives a copy of the minutes of each meeting once these have been approved by the Committee.
The Committees terms of reference are available on the Companys website, www.
com or can be obtained from the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary.
During the course of 2013, the terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee will be reviewed to ensure they remain appropriate.
Advisors to the Committee The Committee retained Deloitte LLP Deloitte to provide independent advice to the Committee on all aspects of executive reward.
Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.
The Code is based upon principles of transparency, integrity, objectivity, competence, due care and confidentiality by executive remuneration consultants.
The Committee is comfortable that the Deloitte engagement partner and team, that provide remuneration advice to the Committee, do not have connections with Bumi plc that may impair their independence.
Deloitte did not provide any other services to the Company during the year.
The Committee also consulted with the Chairman who was invited to attend some Committee meetings during the year.
No person was present during the part of a meeting when their own remuneration was being discussed.
Principles of Executive Remuneration policy The Executive Remuneration policy is designed to provide a competitive and performance related package which supports the delivery of the strategy and the creation of long term shareholder value.
It is based on the following key principles: Provide a market competitive reward to attract and retain executives of the calibre needed to deliver on the Group strategy Include a significant variable element which is aligned to corporate performance, both over the financial year and in terms of long term shareholder value Support the delivery of strategic goals Ensure that remuneration structures do not encourage excessive risk taking Uphold the key principles of best practice on executive remuneration Bumi plc Annual Report Page 42 Remuneration Report continued Principles of competitive positioning The Committee positions salaries and incentive opportunities at what would be considered a market competitive level against the market data, taking into account all relevant commercial considerations, such as the capabilities and experience of the individual.
Salaries are normally positioned around the market mid-point, although the Committee does not seek to formulaically match the median.
The reduction in market capitalisation of Bumi plc during 2012 was reflected in the Committees executive pay decisions during the year.
For example, the salary of Nick von Schirnding on his appointment to the role of CEO was substantially lower than that of the previous incumbents.
In addition, the maximum size of annual awards under the Bumi Incentive Plan was reduced from 200% of salary the policy set out in the 2011 directors remuneration report to 150% of salary the maximum size of awards for 2012 onwards.
In their determinations, the Committee takes into account pay and conditions at Bumi plc.

Long term To provide a performance related element of the Annual award: up Bumi plc shares Three years package linked to the delivery of shareholder to 150% of salary value over the long term.

The salaries receivable by Executive Directors during 2012 are shown in the emoluments table on page 50.
Benefits The Committees policy is to provide a market competitive benefit package for the size, nature and location of the role.
This may include, depending on the location and scope of the role, private health insurance, life assurance, company car provision, housing and relocation allowances, and other expatriate benefits such as travel allowances and assistance with tax compliance fees.
Amounts in respect of benefits for Directors during 2012 are shown in the table on page 50.
Pension allowance The Committees policy is to provide, where appropriate, a market competitive retirement benefit for the size, nature and location of the role, in the form of a cash allowance.
From 2013, the CEO will receive an annual cash allowance of 15% of base salary in lieu of a company pension.
The CFO does not receive a pension allowance.
Annual bonus The purpose of the annual bonus is to provide a performance related element of the package linked to the delivery of strong annual performance and stretching targets related to key financial, operational and strategic goals.
Key features of the annual bonus policy for Executive Directors are: Maximum annual opportunity: 150% of salary Payments under the annual bonus are based on the Committees assessment of performance against stretching annual targets.
Significant outperformance is normally required to receive the highest levels of bonus payment Bumi plc Annual Report Page 44 Remuneration Report continued Targets are set for financial and operational measures which the Committee determines, on an annual basis, to be the most appropriate measures to support the ongoing delivery of the Company strategy, as set out on pages 7 to 9 of this Annual Report A range of measures are used to ensure that the bonus is well balanced and rewards Executive Directors for the achievement of a number of different objectives in the year, which are all related to the delivery of the Companys strategy From 2013 onwards, half of any annual bonus is paid in cash and the remaining half is deferred into Bumi plc shares for a period of three years, to improve alignment with shareholders.
In 2012, the annual bonus framework was based on a mix of corporate performance objectives and individual goals.
The corporate objectives included targets in relation to a range of financial and operational metrics, including: coal production, financial performance, health & safety, debt management, corporate governance, and delivery of expansion projects.
The Committee also retained discretion to adjust bonus payments to reflect the overall financial performance and health of the Company with reference to such metrics as it deems appropriate and inadequate safety performance or a material corporate governance failure.
The corporate performance objectives were not achieved but some senior executives of Bumi plc received bonuses in respect of achieved individual objectives.
Nalin Rathod was appointed to the role of CEO on 26 March 2012.
He resigned from the role on 31 December 2012 and the Committee determined that no annual bonus in respect of 2012 would be awarded.
Scott Merrillees was appointed to the role of CFO on 26 March 2012.
He was eligible for a maximum annual bonus on a pro rata basis of 112.5% of salary for 2012.
The Committee reviewed performance against the framework and determined that no annual bonus would be awarded for 2012.
Nick von Schirnding was appointed to the role of CEO on 31 December 2012.
He was not eligible for an annual bonus in respect of these duties in 2012.
However, he received a bonus of 180,000 in respect of his role as Group Head of Communications and Investor Relations.
Long term incentives The purpose of the Companys long term incentive awards is to support one of the key principles of the executive remuneration policy that a significant proportion of the overall remuneration package should be linked to the delivery of shareholder value over the long term.
In 2012, the Committee reduced the policy for the maximum size of annual awards under the Bumi Incentive Plan from 200% of salary the policy set out in the 2011 directors remuneration report to 150% of salary the maximum size of awards for 2012 onwards.
The Committee believes this executive award level is more appropriate for the size and complexity of Bumi plc.
Key features of the overall long term incentive policy for Executive Directors are: Annual award size: 150% of salary reduced from 200% in 2011 Awards delivered in the form of Performance Shares under the Bumi Incentive Plan Performance Shares are subject to relative total shareholder return TSR performance over a three year performance period against two comparator groups coal specific and a broader mining sector index Awards are subject to clawback in certain scenarios Bumi Incentive Plan Long term incentive awards can be made to Executive Directors and senior management under the Bumi Incentive Plan, which was approved by shareholders in 2011.
Full details of awards granted to Executive Directors are disclosed in the table on page 51.
As shown in the table, the awards granted to Nalin Rathod in 2012 lapsed in full following his cessation of employment and the awards granted to Scott Merrillees will lapse when he steps down as a Director and the CFO at the forthcoming AGM.
The key terms of the Plan, which is intended to be aligned with best practice, are summarised below: Awards are normally made in the form of nil Cost Options an option to acquire a Bumi share at nil or nominal exercise price.
The maximum award that may normally be granted in any financial year is 200% of salary 400% in exceptional circumstances as determined by the Committee.
However, the Committees current policy is to make awards at a maximum level of 150% of salary.
Awards will normally vest at the end of a three year period.
It is the Committees policy that awards will normally vest only to the extent that stretching performance conditions have been met over this period.
Awards are subject to clawback such that the Committee may reduce the size of outstanding awards if it becomes known that the participant had engaged in any activity which, in the opinion of the Committee, amounted to serious misconduct, fraud or misstatement or where effective risk management has been undermined, or any act or omission by the participant has contributed to material losses or serious reputational damage.
Bumi plc Annual Report Page 45 Remuneration Report continued Unvested awards will normally lapse on cessation of employment.
In the event of certain circumstances which include illness, injury, disability and redundancy, the Committee will normally allow an award to continue until the normal vesting date, and vest taking into account the achievement of applicable performance conditions and the period of time that has elapsed since the award was granted.
In the case of death, an award may vest immediately taking into account time and performance to that date.
Where a participants employment is transferred to an associate company where Bumi plc owns, directly or indirectly, at least 20% but not more than 50% of the share capital, they will be treated as having ceased employment and awards will normally lapse in full subject to circumstances identified above.
In the event of a change of control of Bumi, the extent to which awards may vest will be at the discretion of the Committee taking into account the performance of Bumi and the period of time which has elapsed since the date of the award and having regard to the interests of shareholders.
In any 10 year period, not more than 10% of the issued share capital of Bumi plc may be issued or issuable under the Bumi Incentive Plan or any other share plan of the Company.
Bumi Incentive Plan performance conditions The extent to which Performance Share awards under the Bumi Incentive Plan may vest depends on the Companys TSR performance over a three year period measured against two comparator groups as shown in the table below.
In addition vesting is also subject to the Committee being satisfied that the vesting outcome suitably reflects the underlying financial performance of the Company over the period.
Relative TSR has been chosen as the performance measure for the Performance Shares because it aligns reward with the delivery of superior market performance against appropriate sector benchmarks over the long term.

Founders Securities As disclosed in last years report and the Bumi plc prospectus issued in June 2011, a copy of which is available on the Companys website, www.
com, the Committee was also able to approve long term incentive awards to Executive Directors in the form of Founder Securities.
The Founder Securities were issued to members of Vallar Capital at the time of the flotation of Vallar plc.
The holders of the Founders Securities had previously agreed that up to 20% of the Founder Securities could be made available to be awarded to Bumi plc management, including Executive Directors.
However, no awards of Founder Securities have been made to any Executive Directors or senior management and no such awards will be made.
Termination arrangements for former Executive Directors During 2012, three Executive Directors resigned stepped down from the Board.
In each case, the Committee ensured that the cost to Bumi plc of termination arrangements was minimised and close to zero, as shown below.

He received substantially more than had been disclosed to the Board, and it is understood, of the PT Berau remuneration committee.
The correct position with the incomplete numbers disclosed in last years Directors emoluments table in parenthesis was as follows: Salary $609,956 $251,636 Bonus $3,067,547 $449,002 Benefits $117,509 $0 see also note 13 above Other $36,874 $0 The Board is reviewing the validity of all these payments and the failure to disclose them, and will pursue all appropriate remedies for recovery if they are not valid, and all sanctions that may be available for non-disclosure.
During 2011 and 2012 PT Berau incurred expenses chartering a private jet.
A jet was also leased to PT Berau by a company controlled by Rosan Roeslani for further details refer to note 31 of the Financial Statements.
Due to incomplete flight records being available for these jets, it is not possible to validate the purpose of each flight.
The amounts shown above exclude $888,720 of expenses incurred by the Company during 2011 and $2,363,855 during 2012.
The Company has sought justification for these payments to determine whether they are for business or personal purposes.
No such justification has yet been received and therefore they are being disclosed in full in this note.
The Company will seek recovery if they cannot be justified.
In August 2011, Rosan Roeslani received interest free advances of $550,000 from PT Berau.
The full amount remained outstanding as at 31 December 2012.
Rosan Roeslani has stated that this advance was for business purposes.
This is being reviewed and recovery will be pursued if it is otherwise determined.
Other payments to Rosan Roeslani represent pension allowance receivable in respect of his executive duties at PT Berau.
