Agreement of the Board is also required before a Non-Executive Director may accept any additional commitments to ensure possible conicts of interest are identied and which could affect their time available to devote to the Company.
Non-Executive Directors are not appointed for specified terms, but following the UK Corporate Governance Code are subject to annual re-election and all proposed reappointments to the Board are formally considered by the Nomination Committee in respect of each individuals continued effectiveness and commitment to the role.
Following Timon Drakesmiths resignation in January 2011, with effect from May 2011, prior to appointment of the external recruitment consultants Russell Reynolds, the role of the new Finance Director and qualities sought were agreed by the Nomination Committee with Jonathan Nicholls as Chairman of the Audit Committee and Toby Courtauld as Chief Executive.
Subsequent to interviews by the Executive Directors and Company Secretary, the two preferred candidates met with Martin Scicluna and Jonathan Nicholls prior to a recommendation being made to the Board that Nick Sanderson be appointed based on his extensive real estate and capital markets experience.
On the basis that Nick Sanderson had only been a partner and head of Real Estate Corporate Finance Advisory with Deloitte since 2010 and as he had no involvement in the Great Portland Estates account during his time at the rm, it is considered there is no conict in respect of his appointment with Deloittes position as auditors of the Group.
In anticipation of Phillip Roses expected retirement from the Board at the 2012 Annual General Meeting, prior to external recruitment consultants Egon Zehnder being appointed for the search of a new Non-Executive Director, the role of new Non-Executive Director and the qualities sought in Phillip Roses successor were agreed with the Board.
Following Lord Daviess report, in view of the Boards commitment to diversity, it was agreed that Egon Zehnder be requested to ensure that women candidates of equal merit be included in the long list for consideration by the Nomination Committee.
The Nomination Committee has chosen not to set specic representation targets for women at Board level at this time.
However, it recognises that the benets of diversity, including gender diversity, will continue to be an active consideration when changes to the Boards composition are contemplated.
As part of the Board evaluation process in January 2012, Charles Irby as Senior Independent Director led a review of the Chairmans performance which concluded that the Chairman has a good working relationship with each of the Executive Directors and encouraged discussion and debate between the members of the Board.
Following a review of the composition of the Board and its Committees, it was agreed that no other changes should be made.
By order of the Board Desna Martin Company Secretary 23 May 2012 Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2012 106 %JSFDUPST SFNVOFSBUJPO SFQPSU F $PNQBOZ T SFNVOFSBUJPO QPMJDZ TFFLT UP QSPWJEF SFNVOFSBUJPO JO B GPSN UP BUUSBDU SFUBJO BOE NPUJWBUF IJHI DBMJCSF FYFDVUJWFT XJUI BO FNQIBTJT PO EFMJWFSJOH HSFBUFS WBSJBCMF SFXBSE GPS BDIJFWJOH BOE FYDFFEJOH Charles Irby UIF SPVQ T TUSBUFHJD QMBO Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Remuneration policy principles The Executive Directors total pay is analysed by looking across each of the different elements of remuneration including salary, pension, the annual bonus plan and long-term incentives to provide the Remuneration Committee the Committee with a total remuneration view rather than just the competitiveness of the individual elements.
It is important that the Groups remuneration policy reinforces the Companys goals, providing effective incentives for exceptional Group and individual performance with significant upward and downward variability from median based on performance.
As well as providing motivation to perform, remuneration plays an important retention role and needs to be competitive with alternative employment opportunities, in particular at a time in the property cycle where demands on the Executive Directors and employees are high and there is a scarcity value on proven performers.
To achieve the Companys remuneration policy, the Committee seeks to position total executive remuneration around mid-market for on-target performance taking into account the size and complexity of the business as compared to other peer companies in the sector, using a significant proportion of variable reward with the opportunity to increase total potential remuneration for superior performance through the annual bonus plan and long-term incentives.
Changes in 2011 12 No changes were made to the Groups remuneration structure in the year ended 31 March 2012.
Changes in 2012 13 In considering the Executive Directors reward structure for the year to come, the Committee believes that the relative size of the elements of the variable reward structure and the proposed performance targets in the Groups long-term incentive plan are appropriate in the current market environment.
Composition of total on-target annual Composition of maximum annual 1 1 Executive Director remuneration Executive Director remuneration Salary Salary Pension Pension 15.5% 17.5% 17.5% Bonus Bonus 27.5% Performance shares Performance shares 4% 2012 2012 Matching shares Matching shares and and 2013 2013 6.0% 30.5% 26% 35% 20.5% 1.
The on-target award level for the bonus plan is assumed to be 75% of salary with a maximum award of 150% assuming the NAV underpin is achieved.
If the NAV underpin is not achieved, the on-target award level for the bonus plan will be 52.5%.
The on-target award for the Performance shares and Matching shares under the 2010 LTIP are based on the market norm expected values provided by  LLP PwC of 55% of face value apart from the additional award of Matching Shares in 2011 which has an expected value of 40% of face value.
Details of all payments to Executive Directors in the year, which are disclosed on page 107, show the relative values of the basic and performance related elements of remuneration for the year under review.
Basic salary and benets Basic salaries and the level and nature of benets provided to Executive Directors are reviewed by the Committee annually and are assessed having regard to Company performance, individual performance and responsibilities, as well as salary levels in comparable organisations particularly within the listed property sector.
The Committee is, however, mindful of the need to treat comparisons with caution to avoid an upward ratchet of remuneration levels.
It also takes account of pay and employment conditions across the Group, especially when determining annual salary increases.
Basic salary is the only element of Executive Director remuneration which attracts pension contributions.
Annual review Financials Governance 107 On 1 April 2012, the Executive Directors received increases in salaries, in line with the average increases provided to employees across the Group as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 March 2012 31 March 2013 000s 000s % increase Toby Courtauld 490 505 3 Nick Sanderson 315 325 3 Neil Thompson 390 402 3 It should be noted that, unlike many of its peers the Company does not provide a car allowance for Executive Directors.
Benets principally comprise life insurance, health insurance, private healthcare subscriptions, travel concessions and membership subscriptions.
The taxable value of these benets for Executive Directors is included in the table below.
Following the increases to basic salary described above, the Committee notes that the xed remuneration for the Executive Directors remains at or below market.
A contribution of 20% of basic salary is made to each Executive Director for his personal pension arrangements or pension allowance or direct to his personal pension plan.
Toby Courtauld receives a pension allowance.
Timon Drakesmiths contribution was paid direct to his personal pension plan.
Nick Sandersons contribution is paid direct to his personal pension plan.
Neil Thompsons contribution for the year ended 31 March 2011 was paid direct to his personal pension plan.
For the year ended 31 March 2012, his contribution is split between a pension allowance and a contribution direct to his personal pension plan.
Incudes adjustment for deferred receipts in respect the year ended 31 March 2010 in connection with the CPO of 18 19 Hanover Square, W1 of 167,000 for Toby Courtauld, 102,000 for Timon Drakesmith and 107,000 for Neil Thompson.

Annual review Financials Governance 109 Bonus plan Each year the Committee considers the appropriateness of the component parts of the annual bonus plan on page 108 in assessing the overall remuneration of Executive Directors.
The Committee also has the discretion to recommend the payment of an additional bonus to a director for exceptional performance over and above the high standard already required.
This discretion was not exercised for the year ended 31 March 2012.
The personal objectives, other than those covered by the corporate measures, for the Executive Directors for the year ended 31 March 2012 included the following and were specic as to each individuals role and responsibilities: proactive targeting of potential investment and development opportunities: fide-risking of the shortto medium-term development programme: successful progression of the development programme: active tracking of, and responsiveness to, lease expiries: ensure regular meetings with key tenants: exceeding rental income, void and delinquency targets: proactive shareholder relations programme: provision of high quality financial reporting: review of internal controls systems: maintaining and extending strong relationships with debt finance providers: arrangement of appropriate nancing facilities: effective internal and external communication: ensuring appropriate levels of human resources and succession planning: integration of the new Finance Director: supporting senior managers in growing into their roles: active representation on key property industry associations: As a result of the achievement of the Executive Directors objectives during the year, as reected in the review of the Company on pages 2 to 61, the Committee has awarded the Executive Directors the full 30% of salary for operational excellence.
Long-Term Incentive Plans 2010 LTIP Shareholders approved the 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan the 2010 Plan, in July 2010 to simplify the LTIP and SMP arrangements and to improve the alignment of executive incentives with the Companys strategy.
The 2010 Plan has two elements: rstly, participants are eligible to receive a conditional annual allocation of shares or nil price options worth up to 200% of base salary Performance shares : secondly, participants may purchase or pledge shares already owned in the Company Investment shares up to a value of one-third of basic salary in return for which they receive a conditional allocation of shares worth up to three times the equivalent of the amount so invested or pledged Matching share award.
Except in the first year, the Matching Share Award will be limited to shares worth up to 100% of salary.
Awards vest based on the achievement of performance conditions after three years.
In the first year of operation only, if Executive Directors purchased or pledged shares worth an additional one-third of basic salary, this limit was extended by an additional 100% of salary.
The associated additional Matching share award is also subject to more stretching performance conditions.
Investment shares will remain registered in the name of the holder with full voting and dividend rights but if Investment Shares are disposed of then the corresponding conditional Matching share awards will lapse.
Dividends on Matching shares will be rolled up and paid to the extent that the Matching shares vest either in cash or shares at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Under the 2010 Plan there are three separate performance conditions for the vesting of the Performance shares and the Matching share award, each applying to one-third of the shares awarded.
The Committee believes these provide the best alignment between the interests of participants and shareholders.
