REMUNERATION REPORT Dear shareholder As the new Chairman of the Remuneration Committee of PageGroup, I am writing to explain the rationale for the changes we are proposing to our executive remuneration framework.
While it was our intention to introduce changes with effect from January 2012, as you will be aware, the business leadership underwent significant change with the departures of Stephen Puckett and Charles-Henri Dumon and the arrival of Andrew Bracey.
There were also a number of changes in the Non-Executive Directors on the Board, with Sir Adrian Montague, Hubert Reid and Reg Sindall all leaving the Board, Robin Buchanan becoming Chairman, and Simon Boddie and myself joining.
