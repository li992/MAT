Governance Remuneration Report The aim of our remuneration policy is to attract, develop and retain leaders who are focused and adequately incentivised to deliver outstanding business results.
Dear Shareholders As the new Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to introduce our report on remuneration for 2012, for which we seek your support at our Annual General Meeting on 4 September 2012.
The Remuneration Report is designed to provide you with the necessary information to demonstrate the link between our Groups strategy, its performance, and the remuneration outcomes for its senior executives.
It is also intended to deliver the remuneration disclosures required by UK regulation.
I know that senior executive remuneration has been the subject of much comment, particularly in the last year or so.
In the past the Remuneration Committee has sought the views of shareholders before making any substantial changes to policy and I intend to continue that good practice.
This has been the year in which the Group has changed signi cantly with the disposal of the Of ce Products Wholesaling division and the announcement of the acquisition of SCA Packaging.
Our remuneration strategy re ects that change to ensure that we continue Remuneration Committee to attract, reward and retain the key people to drive the business forward whilst retaining Committee membership our pay for performance culture.
Within an increasingly demanding, competitive and international environment we want our employees to be fairly compensated and incentivised Chris Bunker Remuneration Committee to deliver our strategic vision.
Chairman from 4 January 2012 For the financial year ahead, following the announcement of such a transformational Gareth Davis Remuneration Committee acquisition, the Committee has considered the impact on the remuneration arrangements Chairman to 4 January 2012: Committee and policy for the senior executive team.
Whilst no changes requiring shareholder approval member from 4 January 2012 are proposed, some amendments to the policy are proposed for the year ahead.
These Philippe Mellier changes are necessary to re ect the revised complexity, breadth and near doubled size of the Jonathan Nicholls business and to ensure that the arrangements are aligned with the achievement of our strategic objectives.
At the same time, this has to be balanced with the need to align senior executives with the achievement of a fully integrated, enlarged Group focused on the long-term interests of the shareholders and not simply for the delivery of an acquisition.
We seek, through a substantial proportion of performance-related variable remuneration, to ensure that outstanding performance is well rewarded and that underperformance is addressed through a structured process of executive development and performance appraisal.
The Committee is rmly of the view that payment for failure is totally unacceptable, whilst executives should be well rewarded for outstanding performance.
It will exercise the powers it has at its disposal to achieve these goals.
I was appointed as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee in January this year, taking over from Gareth Davis on his appointment as Chairman of the Board.
I would like to con rm that both I and the Committee continue to be committed to the principles of good governance and best practice.
Chris Bunker, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 27 June 2012 DS Smith Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 43 Remuneration Report continued A Introduction The Remuneration Committee the Committee, is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code.
The Committee is a committee of the Board.
Its terms of reference can be found on the Companys website.
The Committees key objectives are to: t set and agree with the Board a competitive and transparent remuneration framework which is aligned to the Companys strategy and is in the interests of both the Company and its shareholders: and t determine the specic remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors, the Chairman and Company Secretary.
It also considers the remuneration of senior executives reporting to the Group Chief Executive, taking into account recommendations from him.
Details of the membership of the Remuneration Committee are set out on page 43.
All members of the Committee are independent non-Executive Directors.
In accordance with section 439 of the Companies Act 2006, shareholders approval of the Remuneration Report will be sought at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting AGM.
The Remuneration Report has been approved by the Board of Directors.
B Compliance The Board, in conjunction with the Committee, has taken the necessary steps to ensure that the Company complies with the provisions of the Code which relate to Directors remuneration.
This Report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 Schedule 8 and the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
In this Report we describe how the principles of good governance relating to Directors remuneration, as set out in the Code, are applied in practice.
The Committee confirms that throughout the year it has complied with these governance rules and best practice provisions.
The Regulations require our Auditor to report to shareholders on the audited information within this Report and to state whether, in their opinion, the relevant sections have been prepared in accordance with the Act.
The Auditors opinion is set out in the Auditors Report and we have clearly marked the audited sections of the Report.
The members of the Committee have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders of the Company, in the matters to be decided by the Committee, no potential conicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
C Advisers to the Committee New Bridge Street a brand of Aon Hewitt Limited has been appointed by the Committee to provide advice on the remuneration of Executive Directors and other senior executives.
New Bridge Street also provides advice to the Company in connection with the operation of the Companys share-based incentive schemes.
The Committee consults with the Chairman of the Company and with the Group Chief Executive, who may attend meetings of the Committee, although they are not involved in deciding their own remuneration.
The Committee is assisted by the Company Secretary and the Group Human Resources Director, and also receives advice from Mercer Limited, the Actuary to the Companys pension scheme, in relation to Executive Directors pensions.
New Bridge Street and Mercer are signatories to the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Advisers.
Neither New Bridge Street nor any other part of Aon Hewitt provided any other services to the Company during the year.
D General policy on remuneration The Committees overall policy is to ensure that the remuneration packages are competitive and enable the Company to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and other senior managers of sufficient calibre to meet the Companys needs.
The Committee regards remuneration policy as an essential tool to underpin the performance culture of the Group and the remuneration packages are designed to align the interests of executives with those of our shareholders.
Following the announcement of the acquisition of SCA Packaging, the Committee has considered the impact on the remuneration arrangements and policy for the senior executive team.
Whilst no changes requiring shareholder approval have been proposed, some amendments to the policy are proposed for the year ahead.
These changes are necessary to reect the revised complexity, breadth and near doubled size of the business and to ensure that the arrangements are aligned with the achievement of our strategic objectives.
At the same time, this has to be balanced with the need to align executives with the achievement of a fully integrated, enlarged Group focused on the long-term interests of the shareholders and not simply for the delivery of an acquisition.
As well as considering the impact of the recongured Group on the 2012 13 remuneration policy details of which are provided below, it has also been necessary for the Committee to consider whether any changes should be made to outstanding awards under our share schemes.
As with most rights issues, existing awards will be adjusted to reect the increased number of shares in issue following the Rights Issue.
com Annual Report & Accounts 2012 44 Governance The acquisition of SCA Packaging will be completed at the end of June 2012 and the Company has therefore only had limited access to non-publicly available information with regard to SCA Packagings financial performance.
Accordingly, the Remuneration Committee has set provisional targets for the SCA Packaging elements of the 2012 13 incentive schemes and the targets will be reviewed again following completion of the transaction.
In particular, it is worth noting the following safeguards that exist in the Companys remuneration policy: t Executive Directors have 12 month notice periods, with instalments payable for leavers rather than a lump sum.
t claw back exists in the bonus and long-term plans to recover payments if there is a material misstatement of results or if there is serious misconduct.
t bonuses are not contractual and also not payable to bad leavers if an executive has left or is under notice at the time of payment.
t deferred bonuses half of the annual bonus and long-term incentives will lapse in the case of bad leavers.
As in previous years, the main elements of the remuneration policy in 2012 13 will be as follows: t basic salary: t pension provision: t annual bonus scheme: and t long-term incentives, comprising the Performance Share Plan PSP and Share Matching Plan SMP.
Basic salaries and pension provision are not linked to performance except when basic salaries are reviewed, whilst payments under the annual bonus scheme and any long-term incentive scheme operated by the Company are wholly dependent upon performance against agreed targets.
Only basic salary is pensionable.
Variable performance-related remuneration for Miles Roberts and Steve Dryden for 2012 13 will account for approximately 64% 2011 12: 57% of total target remuneration excluding pensions and benets.
The Board is ultimately accountable for executive remuneration but delegates responsibility to the Committee.
The Committee addressed the following main issues during the year: Date Key agenda item 21 June 2011 Authorise 2011 bonus payments: Approve targets for 2012 bonus plan: Approve the 2011 Directors Remuneration Report: Review of the Executive Directors and senior executives pay incentive arrangements: Oversight of remuneration policy for senior management and employees: Review of the Chairmans fees: 2011 PSP award total shareholder return TSR, average adjusted earnings per share EPS and average adjusted return on capital employed ROACE range proposals: Approve changes to the rules of the PSP and the Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP to introduce claw back.
September 2011 Agree the vesting schedule for the release of 2008 PSP and the release of Miles Roberts Replacement 2008 LTIP award: Approve the conversion of existing share awards into Nil Cost Options.
7 March 2012 Assessment of Committee performance: Discussion of adjustment of share-based incentive scheme awards following the Rights Issue: Consideration of the adjustment of the performance conditions for the share-based incentive schemes following the acquisition of SCA Packaging.
24 April 2012 Revised terms of reference for the Committee: Review of feedback on the Committees performance: Discussion of the provisional adjustment to the performance conditions for the share-based incentive schemes following the acquisition of SCA Packaging.
DS Smith Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 45 Remuneration Report continued The Committee has reviewed salaries in the context of the roles, experience and responsibilities of the Executive Directors and senior executives.
It is cognisant of the current environment for executive pay and understands investors view that Executive Director salaries should not normally increase faster than those of the executive team generally.
It is also fully aware of the duty it has to shareholders to ensure that the right remuneration arrangements are in place.
The Group Chief Executives basic salary was increased by 6.5% on 1 August 2011 and the Group Finance Directors basic salary was increased by 6.0%.
Other senior executives basic salaries were increased in the range of 0% to 10.7% from 1 August 2011.
This compares to an average increase of 3.0% for the rest of the workforce.
Whilst there is no overall policy on the relationship between Executive Directors pay and that of the workforce, the Company aims to pay fairly across the business.
The last 12 months have seen a transformation at DS Smith as the Group strives to implement its strategy to become a focused, international supplier of recycled packaging for the FMCG market.
The 2011 calendar year closed with the completion of the disposal of the Ofce Products Wholesaling division.
This was closely followed in January 2012 by the announcement of the acquisition of SCA Packaging which received overwhelmingly positive support from shareholders at the General Meeting.
Against this background, the Remuneration Committee has been considering how to ensure that key management performance and remuneration is aligned with the interests of our investors.
The Remuneration Committee believes this can best be achieved by having key management well rewarded for achieving truly stretching objectives, and furthermore that the shape of this reward should emphasise the development of a significant shareholding in the Company by those key managers.
The Company is consulting with its major shareholders, the Association of British Insurers and RREV prior to nalising the details of the remuneration arrangements summarised below: Element of remuneration package Basic salary and benets Purpose Reect the individuals experience and role within the Group: Help recruit and retain key senior executives.
Policy for 2012 13 Increase Executive Directors basic salary to the mid-market level over the next two years taking into account the criticality of each individual : Regard given to individual skills, experience and performance.
Summary of how it operates Paid monthly in cash: Normally reviewed by the Committee annually and xed for the 12 months commencing 1 August: Salary is supplemented with normal benets available to Executive Directors and senior managers including car allowance, life cover and medical insurance.
Element of remuneration package Annual bonus Purpose Incentivise executives to achieve specic, predetermined goals during a one-year period: Reward ongoing delivery and contribution to strategic initiatives: Deferred proportion of bonus, awarded in shares, provides a retention element and additional alignment of interests with shareholders.
Policy for 2012 13 Bonus awards will be measured against the achievement of Group objectives.
In 2012 13 there will also be a requirement for the integration and synergy savings to be substantially as indicated in the acquisition prospectus: At target 50% of maximum bonus will be payable.
Maximum bonus is 150% of salary for the Executive Directors and generally 100% for the other most senior executives: Percentage of bonus deferred and awarded in shares.
Summary of how it operates The Executive Directors have objectives related to Group profit before tax and amortisation PBTA and ROACE.
Other senior executives are measured against a mix of Group PBTA, ROACE and Business Segment operating profit, as relevant to each individuals job: Bonus results are determined by the Committee after the year end, based on performance against targets: 50% of the bonus is paid in cash and 50% is paid in deferred shares: The deferred shares vest after three years and are paid together with an amount equal to the value of dividends payable on the vested shares during the deferral period.
The deferred element is subject to forfeiture for bad leavers who depart prior to vesting.
com Annual Report & Accounts 2012 46 Governance Element of remuneration package Performance Share Plan and Share Matching Plan Purpose Drive longer-term performance and retention and align interests of executives and shareholders through building a shareholding: Retain key executives over a set performance period usually three years.
Policy for 2012 13 PSP Awards Nil Cost Options made annually, with vesting dependent on the achievement of TSR 50%, EPS 25% and ROACE 25% performance conditions.
SMP Awards Nil Cost Options will vest dependent on the achievement of EPS 50% and ROACE 50% performance conditions: Executive Directors normally receive annual PSP grants to a maximum value of 150% of salary, plus SMP grants to a maximum of 75% of salary 1.5x the first 50% of salary worth of deferred shares earned under the annual bonus plan.
Other senior executives generally receive PSP grants at 100% of salary plus SMP grants to a maximum of 50% of salary.
Summary of how it operates TSR performance is measured against the Industrial Goods and Services Supersector within the FTSE 250 over the performance period: EPS performance is measured based on average adjusted EPS achieved over the performance period: ROACE performance is measured based on average adjusted ROACE achieved over the performance period: The three conditions are measured independently: Under the TSR tranche, threshold performance is set at ranking at median relative to the Group, at which point 25% of the award vests.
This increases on a straight-line basis to full vesting for ranking at the upper quartile: Under the EPS tranche, at threshold performance 25% of the award vests, increasing on a straight-line basis to maximum performance or more where full vesting occurs: Under the ROACE tranche, at threshold performance 25% of the award vests, increasing on a straight-line basis to maximum performance or more where full vesting occurs: The Committee has the discretion to vary the metrics used each year and their relative weightings.
E Basic salaries The basic salary for each Executive Director is targeted at the rates of salary for similar roles within a selected group of UK businesses of similar size with substantial overseas operations.
In reviewing these salaries, the Committee is fully aware of the duty it has to shareholders to ensure that the right remuneration arrangements are in place.
It has concluded that the increased international dimension of the enlarged Group, its near doubled size and the complexity this brings means that, subject to satisfactory individual performance, salary levels for Executive Directors and certain senior executives should move to the mid-market level over the next two years.
Whilst the increased complexity of the business and responsibilities of the executives should be recognised, this should be aligned with the successful achievement of the integration of the new businesses.
When determining the level of salary, the Committee takes into account market salary levels, the relative performance of the Group and of the individual Director, together with their experience in the particular job.
The Committee also considers relevant information on the remuneration of other senior employees elsewhere in the Group and, where appropriate, communicates its views on the levels of such remuneration to the Group Chief Executive.
During its deliberations, the Committee has regard to salary levels in other countries where this is relevant for any non-UK based senior executive.
The table of emoluments of the Directors is set out on page 51.
The current basic salaries of Miles Roberts and Steve Dryden are 570,000 and 357,000 respectively.
These were xed following a review on 1 August 2011 and reected the Committees views of the excellent achievement of each Executive Director as well as the Companys strong performance.
DS Smith Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 47 Remuneration Report continued F Annual bonus The Executive Directors participate in an annual bonus scheme which has been approved by the Committee.
The annual bonus payable to Miles Roberts and Steve Dryden for the financial year 2011 12 was 50% based on PBTA with the other 50% based on ROACE.
The outcome of the results for the financial year 2011 12 means that Miles Roberts earned a bonus of 100% of salary 570,000 and Steve Dryden earned a bonus of 100% of salary 357,000.
Full bonus was achieved for both the PBTA and ROACE targets and this required the Executive Directors to exceed the top end of the range of financial targets, a financial performance signicantly ahead of what was anticipated at the start of the year and a very significant improvement on the results for 2010 11.
The Committee has reviewed the maximum potential bonus for 2012 13 for the Executive Directors, which is being increased from 100% to 150% of basic annual salary, of which half will be deferred in shares.
The Committee has set a range of demanding targets to reect the Companys announced strategic objectives of substantially improved earnings quality, particularly with regard to PBTA growth and improved ROACE.
The growth targets set are signicantly higher than in the past reecting the prospects for the business following the disposal and acquisition.
The threshold above which payment starts to be made will be signicantly above 2011 12 actual performance and target performance will be signicantly ahead of the Groups historic best performance.
The annual bonus schemes are not contractual and bonuses under the schemes are not eligible for inclusion in the calculation of the participating executives pension scheme benets.
No bonus payments are made to bad leavers if an executive has left or is under notice at the time of payment and the deferred element will also lapse.
Claw back provisions have been introduced into the annual bonus plan and the DSBP so that individuals are liable to repay forfeit some or all of their bonus if there is a material misstatement of results or if there is serious misconduct.
G Performance Share Plan awards The Company operates a PSP which was approved by shareholders in 2008.
The individual grant limit under this Plan is 150% of basic salary per annum.
In exceptional circumstances this may be increased to 200% of basic salary.
The 2011 award to Executive Directors was 150% of salary.
Award levels for the other most senior executives were generally at the 100% of salary level.
It is intended to award at the same levels in 2012.
Following the acquisition of SCA Packaging, the Committee intends to review the membership of the PSP.
Under the PSP, the Committee has the power to vary the metrics used each year and their relative weightings.
It also has the power to review the specic targets for each award to ensure that they remain appropriate, but the new targets must be at least as challenging in the circumstances as the original targets were when they were set.
It is proposed that for the 2012 awards the same balance of metrics as for the 2011 awards will be used.
The TSR targets will remain the same and these, together with the revised EPS and ROACE targets, are set out in the table below: 1 2 3 Relative TSR Average EPS Average adjusted ROACE Percentage vesting as a proportion 50% of award 25% of award 25% of award 100% Upper quartile 23p 13.3% Between 25% and 100% Between median and upper quartile Between 19.2p and 23p Between 11.6% and 13.3% 25% Median 19.2p 11.6% 1.
The Industrial Goods and Services Supersector within the FTSE 250 currently contains 45 companies and is considered to provide a better basis for comparison than the FTSE 250 as a whole.
The Committee considers there are too few publicly quoted competitors to DS Smith to form a more bespoke group 2.
Average adjusted EPS as disclosed in the Annual Report 3.
Average adjusted Group operating profit divided by the monthly average of capital employed in each year 4.
The EPS and ROACE calculations will be based on the average gures for the forthcoming three financial years, commencing with the financial year starting immediately prior to the award.
Targets may be adjusted by the Committee for example, to reect the impact of acquisitions and disposals to ensure that the conditions achieve their original purpose Each element operates independently and is capable of vesting regardless of the Companys performance in respect of the other elements.
The Committee considers that the targets are signicantly more demanding than those set in previous years and achieving significant vesting will require performance which is better than anything achieved previously.
Claw back provisions have been introduced into the PSP and the SMP described below so that individuals are liable to repay forfeit some or all of their awards if there is a material misstatement of results or if there is serious misconduct.
Awards lapse in the case of bad leavers.
com Annual Report & Accounts 2012 48 Governance H Share Matching Plan This Plan was approved by shareholders in 2011.
The number of shares in a matching award will be based on the number of shares in the related DSBP.
The maximum match for the Executive Directors will be 1.5:1 on the first 50% of deferred shares earned under the annual bonus for a stretch level of performance and the maximum will be 1:1 for other participants.
25% of the maximum match i. e. 0.375:1 for Executive Directors, 0.25:1 for others will be available for achieving a threshold level of performance.
The performance measures applying to the Matching Shares are EPS and ROACE.
The growth targets set are signicantly higher than in the past reecting the prospects for the business following the previously described disposal and acquisition.
The potential total value of matching awards will not increase as a consequence of the change to the quantum of the annual bonus plan.
Matching awards normally vest three years after grant, to the extent that the applicable performance conditions have been satisfied, the related DSBP award has not lapsed and provided the participant is still employed within the Group.
If a DSBP award lapses before the vesting of the related matching award then that matching award will lapse at the same time.
I Shareholding guidelines Senior executives are expected to retain in shares half of the after-tax gains on the vesting of long-term incentive plan awards until they have built up a holding of 150% of base salary for the Group Chief Executive, 100% for the Group Finance Director and 75% for the rest of the Group Steering Team.
There is also a 50% of base salary target for other senior executives.
In addition, irrespective of the retention of shares, the Committee expects that these levels of share ownership should normally be achieved by 2015 or within four years of appointment if later.
If these levels are not achieved, the Committee reserves the right not to make, or to scale back, further awards.
The interests of the Directors in the share capital of the Company and awards made under the PSP last award 2011 and DSBP last award 2011 are shown on pages 52 to 54.
Non-Executive Directors are expected to build up and then maintain a shareholding that is equivalent to 50% of their annual fee from the Company within two years of their date of appointment.
All of the non-Executive Directors have met their minimum shareholding requirements.
The Directors interests in shares can be seen on page 54.
J Pension and benets Benets in kind include provision of a company car, free fuel, permanent health insurance, life cover and private medical cover.
Miles Roberts receives an annual pension allowance of 30% of salary, in lieu of pension benets, plus death in service cover equal to four times basic salary.
This payment is not considered to be salary for the purpose of calculating any bonus payment.
Steve Dryden participates in the Groups Registered Dened Contribution Scheme with death in service cover equal to four times basic salary.
Members of this scheme are required to contribute a minimum of 3% of their basic salary to qualify for matching Company contributions, with higher levels of Company contributions payable up to a maximum of 6% if the members pay a higher contribution.
Steve Dryden has elected to pay contributions at a level that qualies for the maximum Company contribution.
Steve Dryden also receives a cash supplement of 65,000 per annum.
This payment is not pensionable and is not considered to be salary for the purpose of calculating any bonus payment.
K Service contracts and compensation The Committees general policy is that the notice periods for Executive Directors appointed in future will not exceed one year, although on appointment it may be necessary in exceptional cases to offer a longer initial period which reduces to one year or less after a specic date.
The service contracts for Miles Roberts and Steve Dryden are dated 4 May 2010 and 1 April 2008 respectively.
The service contracts may be terminated by 12 months notice by the Company, and by the Executive Director.
The Company may terminate the contract with immediate effect by making a payment equal, in Miles Roberts case, to basic salary and pensions allowance for any unexpired period of notice and, in Steve Drydens case, to basic salary for any unexpired period of notice.
The Company may make such payment in a lump sum or in monthly instalments from the termination date.
These monthly payments will be reduced to take account of any alternative employment or consultancy income during the period over which such instalments are payable.

The awards made to him were as follows: t Substitute Share Bonus Award as compensation for loss of his share bonus entitlement with his previous employer for the year 2009 10 as a result of his recruitment by the Company.
The value of shares awarded reects the proportion of the period of 12 calendar months beginning on 1 July 2009 during which Miles Roberts was actively employed by McBride plc and was based on an assessment of the likely bonus which would have become payable to him had he remained employed by McBride plc: t Replacement Deferred Shares Award.
This award reects the value of shares as at October 2009 which Miles Roberts forfeited as a result of his recruitment by the Company.
As this award replaces an award with vesting dependent only on continued employment, the vesting of the Replacement Deferred Shares Award is not subject to performance conditions: t The Replacement 2008 LTIP subject to performance conditions as detailed below was awarded in respect of an award made by his previous employer and forfeited as a result of his recruitment.
The value of this award was based on the value of shares under award at October 2009.
The award is subject to a performance condition measuring the TSR of McBride plc up to the date Miles Roberts joined the Company and thereafter the Companys TSR against a comparator group of companies comprising the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts constituted as at the date of grant of the award over a three-year performance period commencing on 1 July 2008.
The award vested in full and became exercisable on 17 October 2011: and t The Recruitment Award subject to the 2010 PSP performance conditions as described in section O of this Report was made to facilitate his recruitment and in lieu of the 2009 LTIP award which he would have been granted at McBride plc if he had remained in employment.
The value of the award was based on the normal grant policy of 150% of his basic salary.
During the year the Company made a nine-for-eight rights issue and the interests in the above plans have been adjusted accordingly.
R All-employee share schemes In the UK a Sharesave Plan was introduced in January 2011.
Executive Directors are eligible along with all UK employees of the Company and participating subsidiaries of the Group to participate in this Plan.
Under this HMRC approved Plan options are granted to participants who have contracted to save up to 250 per month over a period of three years at a discount of up of 20% to the average closing mid-market price of a DS Smith Plc ordinary share on the three dealing days prior to invitation.
Options cannot normally be exercised until a minimum of three years has elapsed.
In common with most plans of this type there are no performance conditions applicable to options granted under this Plan.
A similar Plan is planned to be rolled out to other regions.
