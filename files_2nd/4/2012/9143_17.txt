In undertaking these responsibilities, the Committee seeks independent external advice, as is considered necessary.
During the year, the Committee was advised by its independent remuneration advisers, Kepler Associates Kepler.
Kepler provides no other advice, or services, to the Company.
Kepler complies with the Code of Conduct for Remuneration Consultants which has been developed by the Remuneration Consultants Group.
The Committee also seeks internal support and advice from the company secretary and the Groups human resources director.
The Committee consults the chief executive concerning its proposals.
No individual participates in any discussion regarding his or her own remuneration.

2010 LTIP, which were approved and adopted by shareholders at the 2010 annual general meeting.
As part of its decisionmaking process, the Committee consulted with, and took into account feedback received from, a wide range of the Groups institutional investors and shareholder representative bodies.
2013 award In line with its commitment to review the 2010 LTIP after its first two award cycles, the Committee undertook such a review and concluded that the award levels and performance targets for the awards granted to the executive directors in the 2011 and 2012 financial years remained appropriate for those to be granted in the 2013 financial year other than for the award to be granted to Haydn Mursell: please see below for further details.
Two-thirds of the 2013 award will relate to TSR performance, onethird to growth in EPS.
However, the Committee also concluded that it was important to ensure that the performance targets in particular, relating to EPS, while remaining stretching, are also realistically achievable in the light of prevailing market conditions.
The Committee therefore agreed 67 Long-term incentives Outstanding awards made to those persons who, during the year ended 30 June 2012, served as a director of the Company under either the 1999 LTIP or the 2010 LTIP are in the form of a deferred contingent right to acquire, at no cost to the individual, the following maximum number of ordinary shares in the Company: Cumulative Cumulative total total 2010 award 2011 award 2012 award 30 June 2012 30 June 2011 39,827 Steve Bowcott 6,635 24,218 23,239 54,092 Ian Lawson 25,781 29,296 27,113 82,190 89,948 Haydn Mursell 24,218 23,239 47,457 24,218 Paul Sheffield 25,781 33,593 32,394 91,768 94,245 Date of award 13 October 2009 15 November 2010 17 November 2011 Share price at the time of award 1,055p 1,271p 1,398p End of performance period 30 June 2012 30 June 2013 30 June 2014 The performance criteria relating to the 2012 award are set out on page 65 and 66.
The 2011 award is subject to the same performance criteria as the 2012 award, although the TSR and EPS elements of the former are equally weighted but are weighted two-thirds:one-third, respectively, in the case of the latter.
Principally as a result of a significant increase in the Groups profit before tax and a significant decrease in the Groups effective tax rate, the Groups profit after tax excluding exceptional items increased by 58.7% over the performance period for the 2010 award from 36.6m in 2009 to 58.1m in 2012.
As a result, growth in EPS over the performance period was 52.9%, which was sufficient for those directors who received the 2010 award to receive 100% of such award.
These directors will be entitled to receive the number of ordinary shares in the Company set out below, at no cost to the individual, on 14 September 2012.
Income tax and national insurance contributions will be payable in respect of the vesting of the awards.
Those persons who served as a director during the year ended 30 June 2012 will be entitled to the following number of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company as a result of the vesting of the 2010 award: Number of ordinary shares Steve Bowcott 6,635 Ian Lawson 25,781 Paul Sheffield 25,781 The former members of the Board referred to below each of whom was a director at the date of the award will also be entitled to receive ordinary shares in the Company, at no cost to the individual, as a result of the vesting of the 2010 award.
Upon leaving the Company, the maximum number of shares to which such individuals were entitled was pro-rated to reflect their length of service during the performance period for the 2010 award and each of the individuals will receive 100% of such pro-rated award.
Number of ordinary shares 1 John Dodds 22,535 2 Deena Mattar 17,501 3 Richard Simkin 17,187 1 John Dodds entitlement to the 2010 award was pro-rated to 22,535 shares upon cessation of his service with the Group on 31 October 2010.
John Dodds has no further entitlement to awards under the 2010 LTIP.
2 Deena Mattars maximum entitlement to the 2010 award was pro-rated to 17,501 shares upon cessation of her service with the Group on 31 May 2011.
Deena Mattar has no further entitlement to awards under the 2010 LTIP.
3 Richard Simkins maximum entitlement to the 2010 and 2011 awards was pro-rated to 17,187 and 8,583 shares, respectively, upon cessation of his service with the Group on 30 June 2011.
Richard Simkin has no further entitlement to awards under the 2010 LTIP.
With effect from the financial year ended 30 June 2011, profits arising on disposals of PFI investments have been included within the Groups profit from operations before exceptional items.
Therefore, profits arising on any PFI sales have been, or will be, included for the purposes of calculating the vesting of the 2010, 2011 and 2012 awards and all future awards under the 2010 LTIP, both in relation to establishing the opening EPS position with respect to an award and in assessing the Groups performance during the relevant performance period.
68 Directors remuneration report continued Directors pensions Executive directors participate in the Kier Group Pension Scheme the Pension Scheme which has both a defined benefit section and a defined contribution section.
Executive directors accrue pension up to the value of the lifetime allowance.
Where the value of pension benefits exceeds the lifetime allowance, future pension accrual ceases and a cash supplement is paid.
Following changes to the taxation of UK pensions and, in particular, the reduction in the annual allowance, the trustees of the Pension Scheme and the Company have agreed that an executive directors annual pension provision may be replaced partly by a cash supplement.
The level of cash supplement is 20% of that salary which is no longer pensionable or, in the case of Ian Lawson, 30%, as the cost of his current membership of the pension scheme is higher than for the other directors.
The Committee has determined the level of cash supplement for each individual with a view to maintaining the Groups pension-related costs at their current level.
An assessment has been carried out by the Pension Schemes actuary of the cost to the Group of the current benefit provision and the individual supplements have been set at levels which are commensurate with the value of the pension benefit foregone.
The Committee believes that the levels of supplement are in line with market practice.
Only the basic salary of directors is pensionable.
Any cash supplement is excluded in determining annual bonus and long-term incentive entitlements.
Pension benefits earned by those persons who served as a director during the year ended 30 June 2012 and are members of the defined benefit section of the Pension Scheme are as follows: Accumulated Transfer Transfer Increase Increase Transfer total value of value of in accrued in accrued value of accrued accrued accrued pension pension increase in pension at pension at Increase pension at over the over the accrued 30 June 30 June in transfer 30 June 1 2 year year pension 2012 2011 value 2012 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 3 4 Ian Lawson 3 2 31 94 1,384 292 1,676 5 Paul Sheffield 8 148 1,897 520 2,417 1 The figures in this column represent the difference between the total accrued benefit at the end of the year and the equivalent amount at the beginning of the year.
The figures shown have been adjusted to allow for the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation during the year.
2 The figures in this column are the transfer values of the increases in the directors benefits during the year.
3 Ian Lawsons pension accrual in the Pension Scheme was suspended on 1 September 2011.
Ian Lawson subsequently opted out of the Pension Scheme with effect from 5 April 2012 and became entitled to a deferred pension with effect from that date.
Ian Lawson receives a cash allowance of 30% in lieu of continued pension accrual.
4 The figures relating to Ian Lawsons pension entitlement which were set out in the 2011 Annual Report and Accounts have been adjusted to reflect the previously agreed basis of accrual.
5 Paul Sheffield opted out of the Pension Scheme with effect from 30 June 2010 and became entitled to a deferred pension with effect from that date.
Paul Sheffield receives a cash allowance of 20% in lieu of continued pension accrual.
The above transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice from the Pension Schemes actuary in accordance with UK legislation.
Members also have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions.
Neither these contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the above table.
Contributions paid to the defined contribution section of the Pension Scheme on behalf of the directors during the year ended 30 June 2012 were as follows: Contributions over the year 000 Steve Bowcott 50 Haydn Mursell 50 The above contributions are inclusive of contributions paid by the employer on behalf of the employee via a salary sacrifice arrangement.
All member contributions to the defined benefit section and the defined contribution section of the Pension Scheme are payable via a salary sacrifice arrangement.
Benefits in kind Benefits in kind comprise membership of a private health insurance scheme and the provision of a company car or a car allowance.
69 Directors total emoluments The value of all emoluments receivable by those persons who have served as a director during the year ended 30 June 2012 was as follows: 1 Salary Pension Total Total and fees supplement Benefits Bonus 2012 2011 000 000 000 000 000 000 Richard Bailey 52 52 38 Steve Bowcott 330 16 15 248 609 470 Chris Geoghegan 54 54 53 Ian Lawson 385 99 27 289 800 554 2 Amanda Mellor 25 25 3 Haydn Mursell 323 15 13 243 594 412 Paul Sheffield 460 92 15 345 912 753 Phil White 158 158 155 Nick Winser 43 43 42 4 John Dodds 92 4 Simon Leathes 39 4 Deena Mattar 476 4 Richard Simkin 555 Total 1,830 222 70 1,125 3,247 3,639 1 The pension supplement is explained in the pensions section on page 68.
2 Amanda Mellor became a member of the Board with effect from 1 December 2011.
3 In addition to the above amounts, the Group paid Haydn Mursell 287,485 gross of tax in respect of relocation expenses.
Haydn Mursells basic salary was increased from 310,000 to 330,000 per annum with effect from 1 November 2011.
4 John Dodds, Simon Leathes, Deena Mattar and Richard Simkin retired from the Board during previous financial years.
Service contracts and letters of appointment Effective date Notice period Richard Bailey 1 October 2010 1 month Steve Bowcott 1 July 2010 12 months Chris Geoghegan 1 July 2007 1 month Ian Lawson 1 October 2005 12 months Amanda Mellor 1 December 2011 1 month Haydn Mursell 12 November 2010 12 months Paul Sheffield 1 October 2005 12 months Phil White 2 January 2008 1 month Nick Winser 1 March 2009 1 month No term is included in any of the executive directors service agreements or the non-executive directors letters of appointment.
Notice may be served by either party to the service agreement or letter of appointment.
However, each director is subject to re-election, in accordance with the Articles, further details of which are set out on page 57.
The executive directors service agreements do not contain any provisions for compensation for loss of office.
These service agreements contain provisions relating to early termination and, in such cases, the Committee will consider the specific circumstances, the Companys commitments under the service agreement and the directors obligations to mitigate.
The Committee believes that its policy in relation to notice periods and early termination payments under the directors contracts is fair and reasonable in the interests of the Group and the individual concerned.
As indicated above, the Company has entered into letters of appointment with each of the non-executive directors.
The letters of appointment do not include any provisions for the payment of predetermined compensation in the case of wrongful termination by the Company.
70 Directors remuneration report continued Directors interests The directors of the Company at 30 June 2012 had the following beneficial interests including interests of connected persons in the ordinary shares of the Company: 1 July 2011 or date of appointment, 30 June 2012 if later Richard Bailey Steve Bowcott 4,537 2,451 Chris Geoghegan 5,000 5,000 Ian Lawson 24,489 21,031 Amanda Mellor Haydn Mursell 7,406 5,321 Paul Sheffield 44,375 39,698 Phil White 2,540 2,540 Nick Winser 3,500 3,500 The table above includes, where relevant, matching shares purchased, at no cost to the individual, on their behalf under the AESOP and shares to which the executive directors are beneficially entitled as a result of receiving one-third of their 2011 bonuses in shares.
The table does not include shares to which the executive directors will become entitled upon the vesting of the awards under the 1999 LTIP granted on 13 October 2009 and or any shares to which the executive directors may become entitled upon the vesting of awards granted under the 2010 LTIP.
The executive directors, as potential beneficiaries of the Kier Group 1999 Employee Benefit Trust the Trust, are deemed along with certain other UK employees to have an interest in 612,489 ordinary shares 2011: 522,664 with an aggregate nominal value of 6,125 2011: 5,227, representing approximately 1.6% of the issued share capital of the Company, held by the Trust as at 12 September 2012.
At 12 September 2012, the Company had been notified that the following directors had acquired beneficial interests in further ordinary shares in the capital of the Company under the AESOP since 30 June 2012: Steve Bowcott, 43 shares: Ian Lawson, 43 shares: and Haydn Mursell, 44 shares.

There have been no other changes in the interests of the directors or their connected persons in the ordinary shares in the capital of the Company since 30 June 2012.
Shareholding guidelines The Committee encourages executive directors to build up a shareholding in the Company equal to at least one years salary over a period of up to five years.
Executive directors are therefore encouraged to retain any shares allocated to them as part of the annual bonus arrangements and 50% of the shares allocated to them upon the vesting of LTIP awards net of tax until this shareholding has been reached.
The Sharesave Scheme The Sharesave Scheme is a save as you earn option scheme, approved by HM Revenue & Customs under Schedule 3 of the Income Tax Earnings and Pensions Act 2003.
