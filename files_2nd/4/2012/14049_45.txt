Section 4 | Governance Remuneration Report Dear Shareholder On behalf of your Board, I am pleased to introduce the Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2012.
In presenting my first report to shareholders, I would like to thank my predecessor, Leonard V. Broese van Groenou, for his very valued contribution to the Remuneration Committee over his six year tenure.
The Remuneration Committee recognises the importance of the BIS consultation on Executive Remuneration and the need to ensure that companies remuneration reports include clear information about the link between pay and performance.
This years report includes additional disclosures on our reward and on our remuneration decisions in line with the proposals put forward in the BIS consultation.
This Report is in two parts: 1.
Remuneration policy report setting out all elements of a companys remuneration policy and key factors that were taken into account in setting that policy, and 2.
Implementation report showing how the policy was implemented, setting out actual payments to directors and details on the link between company performance and pay for the financial year covered by the accounts.
As reported in the Operating Review pages 40 to 57, 2012 has been a year of significant progress operationally, nancially and strategically for Serco.
In addition to a record level of contract wins, the breadth of our portfolio has enabled our strength in the AMEAA region and the successful launch of our Global Services BPO division to offset challenges in the US federal contracting market.
We have made further significant strategic progress in positioning our business to deliver strongly for the future.
During the year, the Committee reviewed the existing remuneration arrangements and determined that the overall structure and shape of remuneration should be retained for 2013 and no changes have therefore been made for the coming year.
As part of that process the Committee engaged with our larger Shareholders and two key shareholder bodies and we found the process extremely helpful.
I would like to personally thank the Shareholders for their time, and for their open and transparent dialogue.
The Committee conducted its regular annual review of salaries of the Executive Directors, taking into account the current economic climate, the challenges facing the business, their performance and the competitiveness of their remuneration against the UK market.
The Committee also has regard to the overall pay decisions for employees across the Group as a whole.
Against this backdrop, salaries were adjusted in line with our remuneration principles to provide market competitive reward opportunities for performance where appropriate.
With effect from 1 April 2012, their salaries increased by 3% to 750,000 for the Chief Executive and 440,000 for the Finance Director.
On the basis of Sercos performance in 2012, annual bonus awards of 108.3% and 93.9% have been determined for the Chief Executive and the Finance Director.
These outcomes reect the performance achieved in the year against the financial and non-financial targets set.
Sercos financial performance for the year is described in more detail in the Our performance section starting on page 18.
The personal objectives set for each of the Directors covered areas such as active portfolio management with capability driven acquisitions and non-core disposals, widening our exposure to emerging markets and the securing of key strategic contracts to deliver long-term performance as well as specic activities around the ongoing development and execution of the Groups strategy.
Awards made in 2010 were subject to two performance measures, EPS growth and relative TSR.
Under the 2010 PSP, vesting of 30% of the shares are subject to our EPS performance, and under the DBP, 50% of the matching shares are subject to this measure.
We are pleased that our EPS performance against the three-year measure was compound growth of 12.6% per annum which resulted in 79.5% vesting for the EPS element of the 2010 PSP and DBP.
It is however, disappointing that our TSR performance for the period ended 31 December 2012 relative to the comparator group was below median, therefore no shares vested under this element of either the PSP 70% or the DBP 50%.
The voting outcome at the 14 May 2012 AGM in respect of the Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2011 is set out on page 110 and reected very strong Shareholder support of the Companys remuneration policy, which remains unchanged for 2013.
The Committee continues to be mindful of the views of Shareholders and other stakeholders, and welcomes Shareholder feedback on any aspects of Executive remuneration.
Angie Risley Remuneration Committee Chairman 4 March 2013 98 | Serco Group plc | Annual report and accounts 2012 Remuneration Policy Report The following report details the remuneration policy and the decisions on remuneration of the Directors of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2012.
In preparing this report, consideration has been given to the disclosure requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Companies Act 2006, Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 and the draft regulations from BIS on the proposed content of the new style Directors Remuneration Report that is anticipated to apply to accounting periods ending on or after September 2013.

Sercos approach to executive remuneration is designed to: Support Sercos long-term future growth, strategy and values Align the financial interests of executives and shareholders Provide market competitive reward opportunities for performance in line with expectations and deliver significant financial rewards for sustained out-performance Enable Serco to recruit and retain the best with the required skills and experience in all our chosen markets Be based on a clear rationale which participants, shareholders and other stakeholders are able to understand and support.
Key elements of remuneration table The remuneration package for Executive Directors consists of base salary, annual bonus, long-term share-based incentives, pension and other benets.
The Groups policy is to ensure that a significant proportion of the package is related to performance.
Each element of reward and how it will support Sercos remuneration policy and the Groups shortand long-term strategic objectives is summarised below.
Whilst the table is focused on Executive Directors, the following section provides further information of how pay policies are set for the broader employee population.

The Executive Directors remain entitled to lump sum and widows pension benets should they die before retirement and while still employed by Serco.

Statutory indexation restricts pre retirement increases to 5% p. a. over the period of measurement for pension earned prior to 5 April 2009 and to 2.5% p. a. for pension earned after that date, and we have used this measure of ination for calculating the increase in accrued pension net of ination in 6. f. The accrued pension for Andrew Jenner receives statutory increases and hence the increase net of ination is zero.
The increase in the accrued pension for Christopher Hyman allows for an increase in line with RPI to a maximum of 4% p. a. over the period from date of ceasing accrual to April 2012, as agreed when he ceased accrual.
Statutory increases will be received from April 2013, as agreed following recent changes in legislation.
g. The impact of allowing for changes in expectations of ination and improvement in life expectancy in the transfer value assumptions on their own would result in higher transfer values at the beginning and end of the year, shown in 4, includes the effect of both changes in the transfer values assumptions and the effect of uctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and the Directors, such as stock market movements.
h. The transfer values disclosed do not represent the sum paid or payable to the individual Director.
Instead they represent a potential liability of the pension scheme.
