com Group PLC Corporate Governance Annual Report 2012 Directors Remuneration Report Letter from the Remuneration Committee Chairman Bruce Carnegie-Brown Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Dear Shareholders, I succeeded Michael Wemms as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee in January 2013 and would like to pay tribute to Michaels tenure as Chairman of the Committee for the last five years.
Michael continues as the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and continues as a member of the Remuneration Committee, so I will continue to have the benefit of his counsel in 2013.
The remuneration structures of the Group are designed to support the key goals of the Group which are delivering a first class customer experience, having the best shop in terms of the products we offer our customers and delivering superior returns to our shareholders.
We aim to balance the desire for continued rapid growth in the business with a commitment to effective risk management.
Consistent with best practice, the Committee offers a reward package comprising a base salary, pension contributions, a bonus and long term share awards linked to the financial performance of the Group.
The Committee believes that the Groups remuneration structures are appropriate for our business model.
While the structure of the Groups remuneration plan has remained unchanged in 2012, for 2013 we have awarded some significant base salary rises to the Executive Directors and have introduced changes to the pension scheme for the Executive Directors which are described in detail on page 45.
Our decision to do this is based on our desire to recruit and retain the best talent in the media and technology sectors and we have had direct experience of the competitive pressures we face in doing this as we have been in the market to recruit a new Marketing Director and are currently recruiting a new IT Director for the Group.
These changes also reect the increasing complexity of the Group and its growth to date.
The Group operates a pay for performance culture and the Committee reviews both financial and non-financial performance targets each year to ensure they are appropriately challenging and relevant for the markets in which we operate.
Against this background, 2012 has been another year of strong performance for the Group with adjusted revenue increasing by 15% to 204.8m and adjusted EBITDA increasing by 26% to 66.5m.
Total shareholder return for the year was 62%.
This report provides further details of the Groups remuneration principles, policies and compensation awards for the Executive Directors in 2012.
These reect both the successful year we have just completed and the competitive environment in which the Group is engaged.
We will continue to monitor developments in executive pay to ensure that our compensation policies are aligned with the markets recommended best practices.
Consistent with the draft proposals on Directors pay which were published by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills in June 2012, the report has been split into two sections: a Remuneration Policy Report, which sets out the policy on the remuneration of the Directors, and an Implementation Report, which discloses how the remuneration policy has been implemented in the year ended 31 December 2012.
We will be seeking your support for both parts of the report by way of a single advisory vote at the forthcoming AGM on 17 April 2013.
Yours sincerely, Bruce Carnegie-Brown Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 4 March 2013 MoneySupermarket.
