Directors and governance Remuneration Committee report Dear Shareholder The Committee has made few changes to the remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors during the 2011 12 financial year.
When making salary increases for 2012 13 the Committee has been mindful of the prevailing economic environment.
While Rolf Soderstrom, CFO has received a one-off uplift in salary as from 1 April 2012, the salary increase for the Chief Executive Officer is in line with those for the wider workforce.
The Company performed very well against the targets set for the 2011 12 annual bonus, which reflected the Companys focus on delivering a balance between profitability, growth and cash flow while ensuring the Company is laying the foundations for longer term success.
Reflecting this, the bonuses awarded to executive directors in respect of 2011 12 were near the maximum levels.
During 2012 13 the Committee intends to undertake a detailed review of its remuneration policy for the executive directors, to ensure that it remains appropriate as the Company develops.
If the Committee proposes to make substantive changes to the executive director remuneration policy it will, as part of the review process, consult with shareholders.
Any changes to the policy will be explained to shareholders in next years report.
Ian Much Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Introduction and compliance This report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee on behalf of the Board in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 8 to the Largeand MediumSized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 Regulations, and explains how the Company has applied the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code in respect of directors remuneration.
The report has been divided into two sections: Part A, which describes the Companys policy for the remuneration of executive and non-executive directors for the coming year and which is not subject to audit: and Part B, subject to audit, which provides details of the directors emoluments, shareholdings, long-term incentive awards and pensions.
In accordance with the Regulations, a resolution inviting shareholders to approve the report will be put to the Annual General Meeting AGM on 17 July 2012.
Part A: About the Remuneration Committee and its advisers The Remuneration Committee has been established by the Board and is responsible for executive remuneration.
During the year the Committee reviewed and updated its terms of reference, which are available in full on the Companys website or from the Company on request, and are summarised below: Summary of the Committees terms of reference To make recommendations to, and determine on behalf of the Board, remuneration packages for each of the executive directors in accordance with current best practice.
To give advice and make recommendations on the framework and broad policy for all aspects of the remuneration of senior management and on the overall policy for total compensation for all other employees.
To determine policy and advise on equity participation schemes, employee share trust matters, pensions and other benefits.

Other attendees at Remuneration Committee meetings The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Head of HR & IT may attend meetings by invitation, other than when their own remuneration is being considered.
The Company Secretary or his deputy serves as secretary to the Committee.
Committee advisers The Committee appoints its own advisers as it sees fit and has appointed New Bridge Street NBS a brand of Aon Hewitt Limited, part of Aon plc to act as advisers to the Committee and a representative usually attends the meetings.
NBS advises the Committee on all remuneration issues including the vesting of long-term incentive arrangements.
The Group continues to use NBS to advise on other matters including remuneration matters in general.
The firm also assists with the total shareholder return TSR performance measurement and the implementation of employee share schemes and, through Aon plcs Radford brand, provides the Company with advice on matters specific to the US employment market.
The Group also uses Mercer Ltd and  to advise on remuneration issues, particularly in relation to pension schemes.
Remuneration policy The policy for remuneration for executive directors is to enable the Company to offer a package of rewards that: Is sufficiently competitive to enable the Company to attract and retain the management talent it needs to ensure the Group is successful: Supports the achievement of the Companys strategy by providing the potential to receive significant rewards linked to the long-term performance of the Company: Aligns executives with shareholders and helps to retain them by delivering a significant element of remuneration in shares: and Is flexible enough to cope with the Companys changing needs as it grows and the strategy evolves.
The Committee believes that the bonus opportunity aligned with the deferral into shares and forfeiture provisions, together with other elements of the long-term incentive plans, provides a balanced market-competitive package for the executive team.
However the Committee keeps such targets under regular review in order to ensure they remain appropriate.
62 Directors and governance BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Directors and governance The Committees specific policy for each element of remuneration is as follows: Element Policy Fixed pay Provides market competitive fixed remuneration that takes account of individual responsibilities.
Base salary Set at a broadly mid-market level and reviewed annually taking account of the incumbents responsibilities and performance.
Remuneration levels for executive directors are benchmarked using data from NBS on levels of remuneration among two comparator groups as well as on level of salary increases in the wider economy.
The two comparator groups used comprise a general industry group of companies selected on the basis of market capitalisation and a sector group of companies within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors.
Increases are determined by the Committee taking account of planned increases and bonus levels for the rest of the Group.
Benefits Chiefly comprise medical benefits and permanent health insurance.
Pension Louise Makin is a member of the Companys contributory defined benefit pension scheme under which she receives benefits up to the HMRC Earnings Cap.
In addition, she makes additional pension contributions to a separate defined contribution Executive Pension Scheme.
Following changes to pension legislation, the Company ceased making employer contributions to Louise Makins defined contribution scheme.
Additional cash payments were made to her to compensate her for the loss of employer pension contributions.
See the table on page 69 for further information.
The Company makes a contribution to a defined contribution pension scheme on behalf of Rolf Soderstrom equal to 20% of base salary.
Following changes to pension legislation, part of the Companys contribution was made in the form of an additional cash payment to him as set out in the table on page 69.
Variable pay Enables significant rewards to be earned for achieving the Companys shortand long-term aims.
Intended to be a significant proportion of overall remuneration with a greater emphasis on long-term rather than short-term remuneration.
Subject to demanding performance conditions and the intention is that around 50% of executive directors remuneration should be fixed and 50% variable.
Annual bonus Purpose: link reward to the Companys short-term aims.
All employees including the executive directors participate.
1 Maximum of 100% of salary for executive directors with 50% payable for on-target performance.
Performance targets for the executive directors for 2012 13 focus on growth in revenue, trading profit, operating cash and individual objectives.
Deferred Share Purpose: deferral of part of bonus provides an element of lock-in and alignment with shareholders.
Bonus Plan DSBP 50% of any bonus paid is deferred under the Companys DSBP.
Once the director has achieved a shareholding in excess of 100% of salary, executives will normally only be required to defer any bonus 1 earned above the target bonus level.
A lower percentage may be deferred for those senior staff who also participate.
DSBP awards are structured as conditional awards over shares, to be held for three years.
Other than in good leaver circumstances, awards will normally lapse should the recipient leave the Company during the deferral period.
1 Amended as from 2011 12 bonus year.
63 BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Directors and governance Remuneration Committee report Element Policy Long-term Purpose: support the strategy to transition the business from an R&D-focused specialty pharma incentives company to an earnings-driven international specialist healthcare company and ensure that packages for the executive directors include a strong emphasis on the absolute growth in shareholder value by the use of share option grants and also reward the delivery of superior shareholder returns and sustained financial performance.
As such, long-term incentive awards to executive directors are granted as a mix of awards under the Executive Share Option Plan ESOP and the Performance Share Plan PSP, the vesting of which are subject to the achievement of relative TSR and cumulative profit targets.
Maximum PSP award of 100% of salary.
Maximum ESOP award of 100% of salary 150% in exceptional circumstances.
Performance measured over three years.
2012 13 performance conditions are as follows: 50% of awards: TSR versus companies in a specific FTSE 250 index described in more detail later.
Measured over the three years from grant by NBS.
50% of awards: cumulative trading profit over the three financial years from the most recent year ending prior to the grant of awards.
The Company believes that broad-based employee participation in share schemes is an important tool in delivering value for shareholders.
Other senior staff are also able to receive awards of long-term incentives at a lower maximum percentage of salary.
In addition, BTG operates all-employee share arrangements in which all other employees can participate.
Shareholding Executive directors are required to build significant shareholdings of 100% of base salary in the guidelines Company to increase alignment with shareholders.
Clawback For all awards granted post 1 July 2011, awards made under the DSBP, PSP and ESOP are subject to clawback in the event of a material misstatement of the financial results of the Company for the financial year to which an award relates is discovered, an error in the calculation of performance for an award or individual misconduct resulting in dismissal.
Alterations to No changes may be made to plans by the Committee without shareholder approval, other than for minor plans and takeover alterations to benefit the administration of plans or changes to performance conditions which will, in situations the opinion of the Committee, be no less materially difficult to satisfy than those they replace.
In the event of a takeover of the Company, performance conditions will continue to apply to the release of share awards and the extent to which they have been achieved will be decided by the Committee on such reasonable basis as it decides.
Risk In line with the Association of British Insurers Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee will ensure that the incentive structure for executive directors and senior management will not raise environmental, social or governance ESG risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
More generally, the Committee will ensure that the overall remuneration policy does not encourage inappropriate operational risk-taking.
NBS reports to the Committee towards the end of each year on risks associated with the executive directors remuneration policy.

LTI 35% Annual bonus for the year to 31 March 2012 For the year ended 31 March 2012 bonuses were subject to a maximum of 100% of base salary for executive directors and up to 75% for other senior staff.
Bonus targets were set at the start of the financial year for both Louise Makin and Rolf Soderstrom based on the achievement of certain objectives.
These were the achievement of targets for a trading profit measure, cash generation and growth in the business.
The Committee set threshold, intermediate and stretch levels for the various targets.
The bonus is calculated on base salary with a percentage pay out of between 20% and 100% dependent on performance levels attained.
Pay out between these levels is calculated on a straight line basis.
The trading profit measure, used for both bonuses and long-term incentives, is a normalised measure relating to earnings before amortisation of intangibles, restructuring and acquisition costs, group foreign exchange movements and movements in derivatives.
They are calculated as follows: Trading profit Cash flow m m Profit before tax cash flow 23.0 43.1 Adjustments: Forward exchange contracts and derivatives 1.5 Amortisation of business intangibles 30.7 Restructuring and other acquisition costs 2.3 Reduction in long-term bank deposits 5.2 Trading profit cash flow for bonus purposes 57.5 37.9 65 BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Directors and governance Remuneration Committee report The performance achieved against the bonus targets are summarised as follows: Pay out Weighting Threshold Stretch Actual % of % of total bonus m m m maximum Trading profit 35% 9.3 25.0 57.5 35% Operating cash outflow inflow 35% 2.1 10.2 37.9 35% Growth in the business 30% N A N A N A 25% Total 95% 1 The above table shows the financial targets set for the threshold and stretch levels.
Long-term incentive performance targets for 2011 12 Trading profit targets for the awards made during 2011 12 were based on cumulative targets measured over a three-year period with a range of performance levels between threshold and stretch.

The Committees current policy for executive directors is that awards of long-term incentives should be made annually and consist of a mix of performance shares and share options.
These are granted under the Performance Share Plan 2006 PSP and the Executive Share Option Plan 2009 ESOP, respectively.
The executive directors will receive awards under each of the plans equal to 100% of salary.
Members of the Leadership Team will also receive awards under either one or both of the plans equal to 100% of salary in total.
Vesting of the awards granted in 2012 13 will be subject to achievement of performance conditions based on a combination of a trading profit target as described on page 65 50% and total shareholder return TSR 50% measured over three financial years.
The Companys TSR will be compared with that of a peer group comprising FTSE 250 companies excluding investment trusts, companies in the financial services sector banks, life and non-life insurance, equity and non-equity investment trusts, financial services, real estate investment and services, and real estate investment trusts etc.
and companies in the consumer discretionary sector general retailers, media, travel and leisure, and leisure goods with opening and closing TSR values averaged over three months prior to the start and end of the performance period.

The Scheme provides an international section to allow for the participation of Australian and German employees: A US Internal Revenue Service 423 Plan with a 24 month savings period under which its US employees are able to acquire shares at not less than 85% of the market value of the shares at the date of grant: and A new Senior Management Performance Share Plan was approved by the Board during the year in order to award nil paid shares to certain senior employees below board level where it is not appropriate to make awards under the PSP.
Awards under this plan can be made over market purchase shares only and are normally subject to different performance criteria to awards made under the PSP.
External appointments The Board believes that it may be beneficial to the Company for executives to hold non-executive directorships outside the Group.
Any such appointments are subject to approval by the Board and the director may retain any fees payable.
Louise Makin received fees from her position at Premier Foods plc of 67,500 during the year to 31 March 2012 10 11: 67,500.

Members are able to retire at any time from age 60 without any actuarial reduction to the pension payable.
Under current legislation, if members continue to work beyond age 60, they may continue to pay contributions and enhance their pension entitlement, subject to a maximum of 40 years pensionable service.
Pension payments post retirement are increased annually by inflation for pensionable service earned up to 5 April 2006 and inflation subject to a ceiling of 2.5% for pensionable service earned after that date.
Members may take early retirement, once they have reached 55 years of age, although any pension paid will be subject to an actuarial reduction.
