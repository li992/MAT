GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT Lord Turnbull Chairman of the Remuneration Committee British Land is an industry leader and a FTSE 100 Company.
The Companys goal is to achieve sustained outperformance for shareholders.
The business model is people-light and asset-heavy it leverages the work, skill and judgement of a relatively small team over a large value of assets.
To accomplish British Lands performance goals the Company targets a high performance, open and meritocratic culture where people are motivated individually and as a team to outperform competitors, subject to maintenance of quality and security.
It is vital to have strong alignment of management incentives with measures that matter to British Lands shareholders and with shareholder returns via share ownership.
It is also important that pay policy reinforces the Companys goals, providing effective incentives for exceptional Company, team and individual performance with significant upward and downward variability.
As well as providing motivation to perform, pay plays an important retention role and hence needs to be competitive with alternative employment opportunities.
This is particularly so as British Lands expectations of staff are high and there is a scarcity value on proven performers.

The total reward position is analysed by looking across each of the different elements of pay: basic salary and benefits, annual incentive awards and long-term incentives.
This provides the Committee with a total remuneration view rather than just the competitiveness of the individual pay elements and may vary widely to correspond to the needs of the role and the performance delivered.
In using salary and other remuneration data the Committee is mindful of not unnecessarily ratcheting up the remuneration levels, while properly incentivising performance and being able to attract and retain the best people.
The Committee also has regard to economic factors, remuneration trends and the level of pay increases throughout the Company when determining Directors pay.

The Committee considers basic salary levels against two peer groups.
For roles where corporate size and scope characteristics drive duties, basic pay levels and recruitment sources, a peer group of major UK companies across market sectors with a median market capitalisation broadly comparable to British Land is used to establish basic salary levels.
For other posts, the Committee will look at pay levels in other organisations such as agents, fund managers or with comparably sized support functions to match, with roles of comparable speciality, scope and responsibility to those within British Land.
This reflects the people-light and asset-heavy business model.

Since the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 came into force, company accounts are subject to two sets of disclosure requirements.
The extended Companies Act 2006 requirements have to be observed in addition to the current UK Listing Authority requirements.
The requirements differ slightly and these Regulations are expected to remain in force for the time being.
The alternative disclosures shown in the two tables overleaf provide the details of Directors pensions necessary to satisfy the two sets of requirements.

Notes 1 The total accrued pension shown are those that would be paid annually on retirement at age 60 based on service to the end of the year.
2 The pension equivalent shown above for Tim Roberts and Lucinda Bell are a mixture of pension from the Registered Scheme and EFRBS.
3 Graham Roberts had a contractual entitlement of a pension of two thirds of Final Pensionable Salary accrued uniformly from the date his employment with British Land started to age 60.
This contractual entitlement is being met using FURBS DC account: an unfunded EFRBS top-up arrangement and a pension payable from the British Land Group of Companies Pension Scheme.
Since 2006 accrual in the FURBS arrangement was no longer tax efficient and the balance of Grahams contractual promise is now being met by the unfunded EFRBS arrangement.
4 The benefit provided by the FURBS was a lump sum paid based on salary above the Earnings Cap.
To convert this into pension equivalent at the start of the year the basis used for setting commutation factors in the British Land Group of Companies Pension Scheme has been used.
5 Contributions and investment returns in the FURBS are taxed whereas the benefits are paid tax free.
The pension equivalent shown above for Graham Roberts are a mixture of FURBS pension paid free of income tax and pension from the Registered Scheme and EFRBS that will be taxed as income.
6 Graham Roberts stepped down as a Director on 30 June 2011 but as part of his exit terms pension will continue to accrue up to 30 June 2012.
The transfer amount as shown in the disclosures is calculated as at 31 March 2012 but only allows for the pension he accrued to the point he stepped down as a Director on 30 June 2011.
The pension accrued up to 31 March 2012 was 157,100 and the Transfer Value of his accrued pension at this date was 4,222,900.
As such the increase in accrued pension in excess of inflation during the year was 11,300 and the Transfer Value of his additional pension in excess of inflation was 302,800.
7 The following is additional information relating to Directors pensions for those included in the above table: a Normal retirement age for pension arrangements is age 60. b Members of the Scheme were not required to pay contributions during the year.
c Retirement may take place at any age after 55 subject to the consent of both the Company and the Trustees of the Scheme.
Pensions may be reduced to allow for their earlier payment.
d On death in service, the Scheme provides a capital sum equal to four times salary and a spouses pension of two thirds of the members prospective pension at age 60.
If a Member is entitled to a deferred pension, a spouses pension of two thirds of the members accrued pension is payable on death before or after retirement.
These pensions are paid throughout the spouses lifetime or until the youngest child reaches age 18 or age 23 if in full time education, if later.
e In payment, pensions are guaranteed to increase each year in line with the increase in the Retail Prices Index RPI subject to a maximum of 5%.
For consistency with the registered scheme transfer basis, the values in this Report have been calculated based on full RPI to reflect the potential for future discretionary pension increases awarded by the Trustees.
f Consistent with the approach taken in last years disclosures, deferred pensions are assumed to increase in line with RPI in the period before retirement.
8 The premiums paid, disclosed in the table above, are in respect of registered and excepted life insurance cover.
9 All pension amounts and transfer values disclosed in this Report have been rounded to the nearest 100.
This Report was approved by the Board on 20 May 2012.
