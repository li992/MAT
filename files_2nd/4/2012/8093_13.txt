Informa plc Remuneration Report Dear Shareholder On behalf of the Remuneration Committee the Committee, I am pleased to present the Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2012.
As you will see in the Chairmans statement, 2012 was another good year for Informa.
Highlights of the Groups financial performance include adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7.7%, which was ahead of market expectations: record adjusted operating margin of 28.4% and an increase in dividends to you, our shareholders, of 10.1%.
There was also significant progress from an operational perspective.
The quality of Group earnings improved through proactive portfolio management, and the Group continued to build its exposure to emerging markets.
Part of the Committees role is to ensure that the pay arrangements we put in place for the Executive Directors align with the strategic objectives of the Group and that the arrangements both incentivise and reward exceptional performance.
It has been a long-standing principle of the Committee that the remuneration arrangements of the Executive Directors should also be simple and transparent to shareholders.
While the Group comprises a variety of segments and operations, we believe it is important for the remuneration of the Executive Directors to be aligned with the performance of the Group.
For these reasons, the annual bonus is based on adjusted diluted earnings per share EPS growth and the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP is based on our total shareholder return TSR performance relative to two peer groups.
During 2012 the principal activities of the Committee were: t review and approval of Non-Executive Chairmans and Executive Directors remuneration: t assessment and sign-off of the Executive Directors bonuses for 2011 and bonus targets for 2012: t the setting of performance conditions and approval of new awards for both Executive Directors and senior management under the LTIP: t assessment of performance achieved in respect of the 2009 LTIP awards: t determination of the awards to be made under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan for the Executive Directors: t consideration and approval of the Remuneration Report for the 2011 Annual Report: and t monitoring of senior management remuneration.
This report has been divided into separate sections for: 1 information which is unaudited: and 2 information on which the Companys auditor has reported as having been properly prepared.
Although it is not a requirement of Jersey company law to have the Directors Remuneration Report approved by shareholders, the Board believes that as a company whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange it is important in terms of its corporate governance for it to do so.
Accordingly a resolution to approve this Report will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
The Committee is also aware of the on-going discussions led by the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills BIS in the UK with respect to remuneration disclosure and voting which will take effect in autumn 2013.
The Committee is hopeful that developments will improve the clarity in the reporting of Directors remuneration.
We have sought to make changes to our Report this year, and have been guided by the emerging themes and feedback from the broader shareholder community.
We will continue to keep these developments under review and welcome your feedback.
As Informa continues to grow and expand in the future, the Committee will keep under review the remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors and senior management to ensure they continue to support and align with the strategic vision of the Group.

1 The EPS calculation will be adjusted to eliminate any benefit or deterioration that changes in foreign exchange rates have on Adjusted Operating Profit.
The calculation is also based on the budgeted tax rate for the relevant year.
To achieve that, both the Actual Adjusted Operating Profit and the Budget Adjusted Operating Profit are recalculated on a constant currency basis.
While the Committee will adhere to the simple objective calculation it reserves the right to adjust the calculation if it considers there has been a material change in circumstances, such as a major share issue or significant Mergers and Acquisitions activity.
2 The Company also operates an All-Employee Share Plan Share Incentive Plan.
However, following the relocation to Switzerland, Executive Directors are unable to continue participating in the plan.

54 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 OV GOE VERN RVIEA W NCE Informa plc The Companys policy is that a clear majority of the maximum potential remuneration of the Executive Directors should be performance-related and that those elements linked to performance are clearly aligned with the strategy of the Company.
The balance of measures used under the Annual Bonus Plan and LTIP reflect the Committees view that the best long-term interests of shareholders are achieved through incentivising the Executive Directors through a dual focus on EPS and TSR growth.
The Committee intends to review this position during 2013 and, if necessary, consult with shareholders on any proposed changes.
The Committee is able to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues when setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
In its judgment the remuneration policies for both Executive Directors and senior management do not raise environmental, social or governance operational risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviours.
The bar chart and table below show the composition of remuneration under three performance scenarios and the ratio of performance-related remuneration to fixed remuneration for the Executive Directors paid or awarded in respect of the 2012 financial year.

Remuneration in 2012 for Executive Directors The following section sets out details of the Executive Directors remuneration in 2012, along with any planned changes for 2013.
A review of the total remuneration packages of the Executive Directors was undertaken at the end of 2012 with the assistance of Towers Watson.
It included an analysis of benchmark data from a comparator group of FTSE 51-150 companies, excluding those in financial services.
Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 55 Finance Director Chief Executive Adam Walker Peter Rigby Informa plc Remuneration Report CONTINUED Basic Salary Under the remuneration policy, Executive Directors salaries were reviewed at the end of 2011 and at the request of the Executive Directors the Committee resolved that there would be no change for 2012.
A similar review was undertaken at the end of 2012 and the Committee determined that basic salary of the Executive Directors would be increased by 3%.
The last time Executive Directors salaries were increased was in April 2008.
2012 2013 Salary salary CHF CHF Peter Rigby 1,225,700 1,262,471 Adam Walker 744,175 766,500 Benefits Details of all benefits are set out in the emoluments table.
As noted above this comprises a general benefit allowance of CHF42,500, private medical insurance, permanent health insurance cover and relocation benefit allowances.
Retirement and Life Assurance Benefits Retirement and life assurance benefits were in line with the stated policy during the year.
Details of these entitlements are shown on page 61.
Annual and Deferred Bonus In February 2012 the Executive Directors were awarded a bonus of 113.6% with respect to the 2011 financial year.
Of this, both Executive Directors received 100% of the bonus in cash and the remaining bonus of 13.6% was payable in deferred shares which are exercisable from 2015, subject to the terms of the Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP.
Under the DSBP award for 2011, Peter Rigby will receive 26,719 shares and Adam Walker will receive 16,222 shares.
More information regarding this is given on page 60.
Applying the sliding scale formula, a bonus of 98.8% of basic salary was awarded to each of Peter Rigby and Adam Walker for the 2012 financial year.
Diluted adjusted EPS for the financial year restated on a constant currency basis and using the budgeted tax rate was 40.1p, which despite representing an increase of 7.5% over 2011, was below the stretching target set for the year.
For 2013, the annual bonus will again be determined based on a sliding scale of diluted adjusted EPS performance, with the maximum opportunity of 150% of basic salary for appropriately stretching levels of performance.
Long-Term Incentive Plan Since 2006 Executive Directors have been invited to participate in the Companys shareholder approved LTIP, which had been introduced in 2005 and amended in 2009.
Awards were made to the Executive Directors in 2010, 2011 and 2012 of 150% of basic salary.
In March 2012, 74% of the 2009 LTIP awards vested to Executive Directors.
This level of vesting reflected the strong performance of Informa over the three-year period to 31 December 2011.
Over the period, Informas increase in TSR was 107%.
This ranked at the 68th percentile against the FTSE All-Share Media Index and at the 73rd percentile against the FTSE 350 Index excluding Investment Trusts.
In March 2013, 42.5% of the 2010 LTIP awards will vest to Executive Directors.
This level of vesting reflected the above median performance of Informa over the three-year period to 31 December 2012.
Over the period Informas increase in TSR was 52%.
This ranked at the 59th percentile against the FTSE All-Share Media companies and at the 58th percentile against the FTSE 350 excluding Investment Trusts.
The graphs overleaf illustrate the TSR performance of Informa compared with the performance of the FTSE All-Share Media Index and the FTSE 350 Index excluding Investments Trusts, in the five-year period ended 31 December 2012.
These indices have been selected for this comparison because the Company is a constituent company of both and performance relative to these indices informs vesting under the LTIP.

Both Executive Directors met this requirement as at 31 December 2012.
Outside Appointments Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside of the Company provided that the Chairman determines that it is appropriate.
During 2012, Peter Rigby served as Non-Executive Chairman of Electric Word plc, for which he received and retained fees of 12,000.
Remuneration for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Remuneration Committee in consultation with the Chief Executive.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Chairman and the Executive Directors within the limits set by the Articles.
As stated above, no Director plays a part in any discussion about his or her remuneration.
Fees are reviewed annually, taking account of the responsibility and time commitment, including a comparison with the level of fees paid by other companies of similar size and complexity.
For 2012, annual fees were paid to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors as shown below.
The Chairman and Executive Directors resolved that the Non-Executive Director fees will be increased by 3% for 2013.

Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 57 Value of Hypothetical 100 Holding Informa plc Remuneration Report CONTINUED Directors Contracts As a result of the relocation to Switzerland, the Executive Directors entered into new service contracts with the Company.
These contracts are under Swiss law but other than changes required to reflect local law and custom in Switzerland, the terms and conditions are essentially the same as those contained in their previous service contracts which had been entered into under English law.
There are no specific terms in relation to the service contracts concerning termination following a change of control or any special rules concerning equity awards following termination: the Executive Directors are subject to the same rules and awards under share schemes following a termination of employment as for all other participants of the relevant schemes.
In the event of early termination except for cause, their contracts provide for compensation equal to basic salary, benefits allowance and retirement benefit and, in the case of Peter Rigby only, bonus for the notice period.
The Companys policy in respect of protection from exposure to the risk of payment in the event of termination of an Executive Directors contract due to poor performance is to ensure that in the event of a new Executive Director being appointed that no bonus is payable under the service contract in the event of the Company making a payment in lieu of notice of termination.
This policy was followed in relation to the service contract of Adam Walker.
Each of the Non-Executive Directors has specific terms of appointment, terminable by three months notice from either party.
The dates of the Directors original contracts are shown in the table below, although the contracts have been amended from time to time by letter agreement as required, including to reflect the Groups redomicile, the relocation to Switzerland of the Executive Directors and to reflect changes to salary or fee levels.
The contracts, which include details of remuneration, are available for inspection at the registered office and principal office, and will be available for inspection at the AGM.
Date of original contract Executive Directors Peter Rigby 25 September 1996 Adam Walker 12 March 2008 Non-Executive Directors Derek Mapp 10 May 2004 Pamela Kirby 3 August 2004 John Davis 19 September 2005 Brendan ONeill 26 November 2007 Stephen Carter 11 May 2010 Remuneration below the Board Overview Senior management remuneration is set on a similar basis to the Executive Directors except often with lower basic salary and substantially lower LTIP elements but proportionately more variable bonus profit share provision.
The latter is usually tied directly to the annual profit performance of a business unit.
All-Employee Share Plans From January 2006, the Executive Directors, along with all other UK employees, were eligible to participate in the Companys pre-existing Share Incentive Plan, introduced and approved by shareholders in 2005.
A new Share Incentive Plan new SIP was approved by shareholders for its adoption effective on 30 June 2009 and approved by HM Revenue and Customs HMRC on 6 July 2009.
The terms of the new SIP are the same in all material aspects.
Both Share Incentive Plans are HMRC Approved All-Employee Share Incentive Plans which offer UK employees the opportunity to purchase up to 1,500 of shares in the Company per year out of pre-tax salary.
Eligible employees can join the Share Incentive Plan SIP provided they have completed six months service with the Company.
Following the relocation of both the Executive Directors to Switzerland, as overseas employees and in accordance with the rules of the SIP, neither of the Executive Directors is able to continue to participate in the plan.
Consequently, both Executive Directors have ceased to contribute to the SIP and so have ceased to acquire shares through the plan.
Shares previously acquired under the SIP prior to the Executive Directors relocation remain in the SIP.
Peter Rigby holds a total of 1,820 shares and Adam Walker 669 shares in the SIP.
58 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 OV GOE VERN RVIEA W NCE Informa plc The Company introduced a US Stock Purchase Plan SPP in 2008 which was approved by shareholders at the AGM in May 2008.
Eligible employees are invited to join the SPP on an ongoing basis once they have completed six months service with the Company.
The SPP provides a means by which the Groups US employees may purchase the Companys shares at a 15% discount to the market price.
No tax benefit is available under the SPP.
Eligible US employees can purchase up to $2,940 of shares per year out of post-tax salary.
Shares in Informa held in the SPP at the time of the Scheme of Arrangement becoming effective on 30 June 2009 were exchanged for shares in the Company: accordingly no new SPP was introduced at this date.
