com LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN Dear Shareholder In the last year, we completed a thorough review of Hikmas executive remuneration arrangements with a focus on competitive remuneration linked to performance.
We alsosought to improve transparency and toprovide a clear report on past pay and futurepolicy.
We decided to move this report in line with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills regulations one year early.
We developed and implemented clawback arrangements for all bonus and executive share schemes as well as share ownership requirements for Directors and senior management.
We also reviewed the performance of our remuneration adviser and conducted a tender exercise.
This follows the significant enhancements we implemented last year which enabled us tobe nominated for a transparency award.
4.3 REMUNERATION REPORTS Shareholders will recall that we froze salaries for Executive Directors 82 Governance and senior management in 2009 to 2011 and made an increase in 88 Policy 2012 which was linked to salary rises across the MENA region.
At the 93 Executive Implementation same time we have continued to review salaries for operational employees to remain competitive and reect the pressure that exists 102 Total Compensation in a number of our markets.
We have established a new bonus scheme throughout the Group with enhanced linkage to personal and group objectives and underlying group and business unit performance.
The Committee has spent a significant amount of time reviewing potential adjustments to enhance the performance linkage of the existing cash bonus structure.
Whilst we are not proposing to change the basis of the schemes, we aim to develop our process for linking awards and performance.
This builds on last years implementation of additional financial performance targets for our long-term incentive plan.

The maximum levels of bonus that executives may receive are dependent on performance: 3 On target: maximum bonus is 100% of salary 3 Exceptional: maximum bonus is 200% of salary The performance metrics for the annual bonus plan are reviewed and agreed by the Remuneration Committee each year to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and position of Hikma and in order to ensure that they continue to remain challenging.

Hikma Employee Context The Committee ensures that employees remuneration across the Group is taken into consideration when reviewing executive remuneration policy.
Disclosing a range of what is actually received for each HR Grade is likely to give rise to ever greater remunerations increases across the whole of Hikma and reduces the ability to reward for superior performance.
The Committee reviews internal data of the sort described and is satisfied that the level of remuneration is proportionate across the HRgrades.

As the Executive Directors are based in this region, an element of this rise was taken into account.
The Committee does not directly consult employees, but receives regular updates on employee feedback through the Group HR department.
Management Incentive Plan The 2009 Management Incentive Plan MIP was approved by shareholders at the 2010 Annual General Meeting, whereby shareholders consented to Hikma satisfying awards under the MIP from newly issued shares.
Under the MIP, Hikma makes grants of conditional awards to management across the Group below senior management level.
Awards are subject to the satisfaction of individual and group performance targets.
HIKMA PHARMACEUTICALS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2012 89 4.3 REMUNERATION REPORTS continued MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLAN PERCENTAGE OF EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE % Algeria 7 Egypt 2 Germany 4 Jordan 8 Portugal 3 Italy 5 KSA 7 Lebanon 4 Libya 8 Sudan 5 UK 13 USA 6 Yemen 6 Comparator Group During 2012, the Committee reviewed its Comparator Group to ensure that it remained appropriate for Hikma on an ongoing basis, reecting the increase in size of Hikma and increasing internationalisation of the business.
The Committee has resolved that, having taken account of those companies that have been acquired during the period, the Comparator Group did not remain appropriate for the Group as the benchmark for 2013.
Centerview, Citigroup and Bank of America Merrill Lynch assisted in the selection of comparable Companies.
Criteria taken into account by the Remuneration Committee when selecting the current Comparator Group included the: 3 Type of pharmaceutical specialism 3 International nature of Hikmas operations 3 International nature of the executive team 3 Market capitalisation and turnover 3 Number of employees 3 Consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry affecting the number of comparable companies 3 UK listing environment.
The Committee seeks to benchmark executive compensation against companies of a similar status, sector, and performance.
The Committee is cognisant of the fact that a too slavish devotion to comparators can lead to executive compensation continually rising above those of wider employee compensation.
Therefore, the Comparator Group is used as a guide to set parameters for compensation and ensure executives are incentivised to perform to the best of their abilities for thelong-term.
In this context it is only one of a number of factors taken into account by the Committee when determining the level and elements of Hikmas compensation policy.
90 HIKMA PHARMACEUTICALS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2012 Compensation practices in the Comparator Group are used to: 3 Rank Hikma Compensation against the Comparator Group.
This enables the Committee to determine Hikmas position in relation to other companies and, hence, assess the compensation of Hikma executives to ensure that the Policy is being met e. g. lower quartile to median salary 3 Assess TSR Performance.
The Total Shareholder Return TSR of Hikma compared to its Comparator Group is used as the performance target in respect of the executive share scheme LTIP.
Only upper quartile performance results in 100% vesting of the TSR components of LTIP awards.
The constituents of Hikmas Comparator Group for 2012 were as follows: NAME Adcock IngramHoldings Ltd Gedeon Richter Plc Novartis AG Aspen Healthcare Limited Grilfols SA Sanofi Aventis AstraZeneca PLC Hospira Inc Shire Pharmaceuticals PLC BTG PLC Impax Labs Inc STADA Arzneimittel AG EGIS PLC Krka UCB SA Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings Merck KgaA Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc Forest Laboratories Inc Mylan Inc Six companies added to the Comparator Group in 2012 Throughout this report, references to quartiles are to quartiles in the Comparator Group.
Clawback Policy The Committee has certain clawback arrangements in place for the annual bonuses and LTIP awards ofExecutive Directors and certain key executives.
In the event of any of the following situations occurring, the Remuneration Committee would reduce or cancel the next bonus and or reduce or cancel the next vesting of LTIP awards: 3 Hikmas financial statement or results being negatively restated 3 a participant having deliberately misled management or the market regarding Hikmas performance 3 a participant causing significant damage to Hikma 3 a participants actions amounting to serious misconduct Share Ownership During the year, the Committee decided to require all executive directors to build and maintain a minimum shareholding equal to three times base salary.
The Committee believes that this policy strongly links executive and shareholders interests and decided to set the shareholding targets atalevel higher than the majority of our peers.
This minimum holding must be achieved as quickly as possible and in any case within two years following appointment as a director.
Share ownership requirements also apply to Hikma Executive Management who are required to build up and maintain a minimum shareholding equal to two times base salary.
These limits will be reviewed periodically by the Committee.
The table below demonstrates that the target shareholdings as a percentage of salary were met in full by the Executive Directors.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TIME FROM APPOINTMENT TARGET ACTUAL REQUIREMENT FULFILLED?
Said Darwazah 6 years 9 months 3x 176x Mazen Darwazah 8 years 7 months 3x 152x Service Contracts Details of the service contracts of the Executive Directors of Hikma in force at the end of the year under review, which have not changed during the year, are as follows: COMPANY CONTRACT UNEXPIRED TERM POTENTIAL NAME NOTICE PERIOD DATE OFCONTRACT TERMINATION PAYMENT 12 months salary Said Darwazah 12 months 1 July 2007 Rolling contract and benefits 12 months salary Mazen Darwazah 12 months25 May 2006 Rolling contract and benefits HIKMA PHARMACEUTICALS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2012 91 4.3 REMUNERATION REPORTS continued The Executive Directors contracts are on a rolling basis, unless terminated by 12 months written notice.
This arrangement is in line with best corporate practice for listed companies.
In the event of the termination of an Executives contract, salary and benets will be payable during the notice period there will, however, be no automatic entitlement to bonus payments or share incentive grants during the period of notice other than in accordance with the rules of the relevant incentive plan.
There are no special provisions in the contracts of employment extending notice periods on a change of control, liquidation of Hikma or cessation of employment.
Recruitment of Executives In normal circumstances, new Executive Directors will receive a compensation package in accordance with Hikma remuneration policy for salary, benets, pension, bonuses and LTIP.
In exceptional circumstances, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to consider higher remuneration levels necessary to attract, retain and motivate high calibre executives.
In the event that the Committee exercises this discretion, the Committee will provide an explanation of the exceptional circumstances in the next remuneration report.
Leavers Remuneration Policy When considering termination payments, the Remuneration Committee takes account of the best interests of Hikma and the individuals circumstances including the reasons for termination, contractual obligations and LTIPs and pension plan rules.
The Remuneration Committee will ensure that there are no unjustified payments for failure on an Executive Directors termination of employment.
The Committees policy in relation to leavers can be summarised as follows: 3 In the normal course of events, the Executive Director will work their notice period and receive usual compensation payments and benets during this time.
3 In the event of the termination of an Executives contract and Hikma requesting the Executive to cease working immediately, payment in lieu of notice equal to xed pay, pension entitlements, other benets and, on a discretionary basis and only where it is in Hikmas interest, a pro-rated performance related bonus will be payable.
3 The Executive Director may also be considered for a variable pay award upon termination of employment.
However, the Executive would not be entitled to any variable pay in situations where the Executive resigned or where Hikma has terminated the Executives employment with the contractual right to do so.
The performance of Hikma in terms of finance and meeting of operational targets is the prime driver for determining whether to make an award and quantum.
3 In the event of termination for gross misconduct, neither notice nor payment in lieu of notice will be given and the executive will cease to perform his services immediately.
In the event that the Committee exercises the discretion detailed in this section, the Committee will provide an explanation in the next remuneration report.
External Appointments The Committee recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to take up non-executive directorships or public sector and not-for-profit appointments, and that these can broaden the experience and knowledge of the Director, from which Hikma can benefit.
Executive Directors may therefore accept such appointments as long as they do not lead to a conict of interest, and Executive Directors are allowed to retain any fees paid under such appointments.
During the year under review, Said Darwazah and Mazen Darwazah received fees of $10,000 2011: $10,000 and $10,000 2011: $10,000 respectively, in respect of such appointments which are detailed in their Director proles on page 60.
External appointments are kept under review by the Audit Committee and the process for controlling these appointments is described in the Governance Statement on page 73.
Non-Executive The policy for Non-Executive fees is set by the Board taking into account recommendations from the Chief Executive officer and Executive Vice Chairman and the limits set by the Articles of Association.
The Time Commitments see page 70 of the Non-Executive Directors to Hikma are above those of an average non-executive.
The nature of Hikmas business is international, requiring the Non-Executive Directors to travel to the USA, Middle East, North Africa and Europe.
The Board is therefore made up of Non-Executive Directors with a wide range of experience both in the UK and internationally.
The use of options for Non-Executive Directors is prevalent in the US and also to some extent internationally.
However, as a UK listed company complying with UK best practice it is not considered appropriate to grant options to Hikmas Non-Executive Directors.
To ensure that Hikma remains able to attract the appropriate calibre of candidate and to take account of its inability to grant options, the Board has therefore set its fee policy at the upper quartile.
92 HIKMA PHARMACEUTICALS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2012 Non-Executive Directors fees are structured into three elements: 3 Directorship: a base fee for undertaking the duties of a Director of Hikma, chiey regarding board, strategy and shareholder meetings.
3 Committee membership: a one-off fee for taking additional responsibilities in relation to Committee membership.
Usually Non-Executives are members of three committees.
3 Committee Chairmanship: committee chairmen undertake additional responsibilities in leading a committee and are expected to act as a sounding board for the Executive that reports to the relevant committee.
The chairmanship fee is paid in addition to the membership fee with a higher fee paid to the Audit Committee chairman to reect the significant demands of this position.
Letters of Appointment The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts, but have letters of appointment with Hikma.
Each appointment is terminable on one months notice from either Hikma or the Director, but is envisaged to be for an initial period of up to 36 months.
This period can be renewed and extended for not more than two further three-year terms, unless exceptional circumstances exist.
NAME DATE OF ORIGINAL APPOINTMENT NOTICE PAYMENT Samih Darwazah 17 July 2007 1 month Michael Ashton 14 October 2005 1 month Ali Al-Husry 14 October 2005 1 month Breffni Byrne 14 October 2005 1 month Ronald Goode 12 December 2006 1 month Sir David Rowe-Ham14 October 2005 1 month Robert Pickering 1 September 2011 1 month Senior Management The policy for senior management compensation is set in line with policy for the Executive Directors, with a degree of discretion for the Committee to take into account particular issues identied by the Chief Executive, such as the performance of a specic individual or business unit.
Policy for 2013 2012 was yet again a turbulent year in global markets and in particular in the MENA region where a significant amount of Hikmas business is conducted.
Political upheaval brought pressure on employment conditions across the region.
Notwithstanding those significant pressures, Hikma is a global business and the Remuneration Committee remains of the view that its existing Remuneration policy remains appropriate for the Group.
Therefore, it is envisaged that no change will be made to the Remuneration Policy in 2013.
EXECUTIVE IMPLEMENTATION Salary The Committees salary Policy position is Lower Quartile to Median.
Salary Lower Quartile Fixed Pension to compensation Median Benets With the assistance of  LLP, the Committee undertook a benchmarking of Executive Director salaries during 2012.
The conclusion was that salaries were below the policy range of Lower Quartile to Median, as can be seen in the table below: POLICY POSITION POLICY VALUE ACTUAL SALARY 2012 ADHERENCE TO POLICY Said Darwazah Chief Executive Lower Quartile toMedian $742k to $1,155K $750,000 Within Policy Position Mazen Darwazah Executive Vice Chairman Lower Quartile toMedian $523k to $631k $504,000 Below Policy Position HIKMA PHARMACEUTICALS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2012 93 4.3 REMUNERATION REPORTS continued When determining the base salary of the Executives, the main points the Committee takes into consideration are the: 3 salary levels of the Comparator Group 3 performance of the Executive Director 3 performance and development of the Groups business 3 Directors experience and responsibilities 3 pay and conditions throughout the Group The Remuneration Committee has access to information on the pay and conditions of other employees in the Group when determining the compensation packages for Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee actively considers the relationship between general changes to employees pay and conditions and any proposed changes in the compensation packages for Executive Directors to ensure it can be sufciently robust in its determinations in light of the position of Hikma as a whole.
In relation to 2012, the Committee has taken into consideration the following important factors in determining that the Executive Directors salaries should be increased by 7%: 3 The robust group performance, with sales and net income growth in excess of 20%.
3 The successful integration of strategic acquisitions.
3 Being positioned signicantly below our policy position from a comparison perspective.
3 There being no change to Executive Director salaries during 2009, 2010 and 2011.

The Executive Directors therefore, do not receive personal pension contributions from the Group.

Under the benefit Plan the Group matches employee contributions made to the benefit Plan.
These are xed at a maximum 5% of applicable salary.
Participants are entitled to 30% of the Groups contributions to the benefit Plan after three years of employment with the Group, and an additional 10% in each subsequent year.

Options outstanding In respect of each of the Executive Directors, the aggregate number of shares outstanding at the year-end under option was: NO.
Long Term Incentive Plan The 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP was approved by shareholders at the 2006 Annual General Meeting.
The LTIP is used to incentivise Executive Directors and senior management through the grant of nil-cost options with performance conditions that are measured over a period of three years.
Those who participate in the LTIP are excluded from participating in the 2009 Management Incentive Plan.
The Remuneration Committee believes that share awards under the LTIP enable Hikma to provide a competitive incentive and retention tool which is also cost effective in respect of both shareholder dilution and income statement expense.
The Performance Conditions are detailed separately on page 98 of this report.
Remuneration Committees policy is to provide annual share grants to Executive Directors and senior management at a maximum of the upper quartile level compared to the Comparator Group.
During 2010 the Committee reviewed the performance criteria for the LTIP resolving that the performance criteria should be expanded to include financial metrics for 50% of each LTIP award.
The Committee consulted major shareholders and the main shareholder representative bodies on the proposed change before it was implemented.
The Committee was grateful for the time taken by shareholders on the consultation and welcomed the conrmation received that the majority were supportive of the approach.
The Committee considers that the financial metrics chosen ensure that absolute performance is taken into account and more closely align the LTIP with the Groups strategy.
The advantages of Total Shareholder Return TSR were retained in respect of 50% of the award.
HIKMA PHARMACEUTICALS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2012 97 4.3 REMUNERATION REPORTS continued The Awards under the LTIP for 2012 and those that will be made in 2013, are therefore subject to the following performance conditions which are measured over a three year period from the date of grant: 3 Comparative TSR performance against the Comparator Group 3 Financial metrics Sales growth EPS growth Return on invested capital The threshold and maximum performance requirements for each of the performance conditions is detailed in the table below.
Eachcriterion is independent of the other criteria.
PERFORMANCE CRITERIA ELEMENT OF AWARD THRESHOLD REQUIREMENT MAXIMUM REQUIREMENT TSR against comparator 50% Median Upper Quartile Sales Growth 17% 9% 13% EPS Growth 17% 15% 20% Return on Invested Capital 17% 10% 12% Basis of Performance Condition Selection & Measurement Comparative TSR was selected as a performance condition for the proposed awards by the Remuneration Committee as it ensures that irrespective of general market conditions the Executives have outperformed their peers over the measurement period in delivering shareholder value before being entitled to receive any of their awards.
The Committee believes that the financial metrics link the final award of the LTIPs more closely to the underlying financial performance of the Group.
The combination of TSR performance and financial metrics allows comparable performance and absolute performance to be taken into account in equal measure.
The Remuneration Committee determines whether the performance conditions for share awards are satisfied.
The Committee has appointed  LLP to assist in the ongoing calculation of TSR and newly introduced financial metrics in accordance with the rules of the LTIP.
The Committee will review and, if appropriate, approve these gures prior to the release of any award.
In terms of performance and the vesting of awards in three years time: 3 0% of Awards will be released for achieving below threshold performance 3 20% of Awards will be released for achieving threshold performance 3 100% of Awards will be released for achieving maximum performance 3 Between threshold performance and maximum performance awards vest on a straight line basis Where the threshold requirement is achieved, 20% of this element of the award vests and becomes exercisable.
Where the maximum requirement is achieved all of this element of the award vests and becomes exercisable.
Therefore, the performance conditions ensure that: 3 Hikmas comparative TSR performance against the Comparator Group is at least at the upper quartile before executives receive the full benefit of this element of their share incentives: and 3 The underlying financial performance of the Group supports the comparative performance before Executives receive their full award.
This structure demonstrates the Remuneration Committees desire to correlate incentive arrangements with the achievement of substantial performance and align incentives with the objectives of shareholders.
98 HIKMA PHARMACEUTICALS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2012 The following chart sets out the level of release of existing LTIP awards if Hikmas performance measured as at 31 December 2012 for the financial metrics and as at 13 February 2013 the last available data for TSR was applied for the whole period.

The Committee reviewed the fee during the year and raised it to 200,000.
TheChairman elected to waive payment of the increase of 32,500 for 2013.
The Board has resolved that from 1 January 2013, the basic fees of Non-Executive Directors should be increased to the amounts set out above.
Theincreases continue to move non-executive fees back towards the Groups stated policy, though overall non-executive fees remain below thelevel set by Group policy.
The rises proposed are in line with the general level of rise for senior management across the Group.
The Board continues to believe that it is important to ensure that the fees paid to non-executives remain competitive, that they reect the increasingly important role played by non-executives and allow the Nomination Committee to recruit Non-Executive Directors of the appropriate calibre inaccordance with the requirements of succession planning.
The Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the Group pension arrangements and do not receive personal pension contributions by the Group.
