Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 51 Directors report Governance Remuneration report 1 This Report This year, there has been continued focus on financial performance in relation to senior executives pay and bonus packages and ensuring that the remuneration policy of the Group reinforces and aligns incentives, behaviour, strategy and performance.
Consistent with last year, the challenges for a Remuneration Committee include balancing prudence against appropriate reward for good performance, particularly so in the current global economic environment.
However, I am pleased to say that the Groups results for 2012 have been such that we have been able to determine rewards appropriate for the exceptional performance achieved.
Interteks successful growth strategy has been achieved by the continuing excellent performance of management and the Committee believes that the agreed remuneration appropriately rewards that effort.
In preparation for full adoption of the Governments new Christopher Knight Chairman of the Remuneration Committee remuneration reporting regulations, the Committee has sought to comply with some of the new requirements in this Report, noting that many features are already established within the Intertek Remuneration Policy and practices.
This Report sets out the Groups policy and disclosures in relation to Directors remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2012.
It will be subject to a separate shareholder vote at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting AGM.
The Report has been prepared on behalf of the Board and complies fully with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Contents Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 the Regulations and the UK Corporate Governance Code the Code as applicable for the financial year and the elements specically required to be audited, which are shaded, 51 This Report have been audited by KPMG Audit Plc in compliance with the requirements 52 The Committee of the Regulations.
