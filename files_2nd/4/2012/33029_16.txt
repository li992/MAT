John Varley Anticipating the coming into effect of Chairman of the Remuneration Committee the new regulations proposed by the UK Department for Business, Innovation & Skills, we have taken the opportunity to structure this 2012 Directors Remuneration Report to incorporate a number of the proposed features.
As a result, this Remuneration Report has been prepared with separate sections that set out, first, our remuneration policy Policy Report and, second, how that policy has been implemented in 2012 Implementation Report.
We have not yet produced a Remuneration Report that is fully compliant with the proposed new regulations because they are still to be published in their final form.
But our 2013 Remuneration Report will fully reect the new regulations and we will place resolutions before shareholders accordingly at the 2014 AGM.

In the case of members of the Senior Executive Team, this is conducted by the CEO.
In the case of the CEO, this is conducted by the Chairman of the Board.
Recommendations are then made to the Remuneration Committee.
Those reviews take place relative to Group and individual objectives which are set at the beginning of each year.
Service contracts The notice periods and unexpired terms of Executive Directors service contracts at 31 December 2012 are shown in the table below.
Subject to the arrangements in respect of the first 12 months of Pascal Soriots service, which are described below, either AstraZeneca or the Executive Director may terminate the service contract on 12 months notice.
It is the Remuneration Committees intention that, in the event of early termination of an Executive Directors employment, any compensation payable under his her service contract should not exceed the salary and benets that would have been received had the contractual notice period been worked and this may be further reduced in line with the Executive Directors duty to mitigate losses.
None of the Executive Directors has any provision in their service contracts giving them a right to liquidated damages or an automatic entitlement to bonus for the duration of their notice period.
Executive Director Date of service contract Unexpired term at 31 December 2012 Notice period 1 1 Pascal Soriot 27 August 2012 21 months Reducing to 12 months Simon Lowth 5 November 2007 12 months 12 months 1 The notice period in Mr Soriots service contract is 24 months initially, which is reducing by one month for each month of service and will stabilise at a 12 month notice period.
Policy on external appointments and retention of fees Subject to specic Board approval in each case, Executive Directors and other SET members may accept external appointments as non-executive directors of other companies, and retain any related fees paid to them, provided that such appointments are not considered by the Board to prevent, or reduce, the ability of the executive to perform their role within the Group to the required standard.
Simon Lowth is a Non-Executive Director of Standard Chartered PLC.
In respect of this position, he received fees of 130,000 for his services in 2012.
Considering the wider employee context The Remuneration Committee sets overall remuneration policy and makes decisions about specic remuneration arrangements in the broader context of employee remuneration throughout the Group.
The Remuneration Committee annually reviews Group remuneration data including ratios of average pay to senior executive pay: bonus data: gender and geographical data in relation to base salaries and variable compensation: and aggregate data about the shareholding levels of senior managers.
In reviewing the base salaries of Executive Directors and SET members, the Remuneration Committee considers the overall level of any salary increases being awarded to employees across the Group in the relevant year.
Shareholder and broader context In all aspects of its work, the Remuneration Committee considers both the external environment in which the Company operates and the guidance issued by organisations representing institutional shareholders.
It consults the Companys largest investors on general and specic remuneration and provides an annual opportunity for representatives of those investors to meet the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and other Remuneration Committee and Board members.
The Remuneration Committee works with the Audit Committee to ensure that the Groups remuneration policies and practices achieve the right balance between appropriate incentives to reward good performance and managing risk in terms of employee behaviour and how the Company achieves its business objectives.
The annual bonus plan, in which all employees participate, contains goals relating to the demonstration of commitment to integrity, with the aim of enhancing the Companys reputation and avoiding reputational damage.
126 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 Overview Strategy Performance Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Implementation Report Implementation of remuneration policy in 2012 Pascal Soriot Mr Soriot joined AstraZeneca as CEO on 1 October.
In establishing his remuneration arrangements, the Remuneration Committee sought to offer a package that was internationally competitive, but pay no more than was necessary.
In doing so, to the extent possible, the Remuneration Committee put in place a framework that maintained broadly the same balance in terms of its constituent elements and overall quantum as for the previous CEO, which the Remuneration Committee considers to be right for AstraZeneca and its shareholders.
At the time of Mr Soriots appointment as CEO, certain share awards and payments, which are described below, were negotiated and agreed.
They were approved by the Remuneration Committee in order to compensate Mr Soriot for the forfeiture of unvested long-term incentive awards and forfeited 2012 bonus opportunity from his previous employer.
The principle governing the decision of the Remuneration Committee was that the buyout should be implemented predominantly in shares of AstraZeneca in circumstances where the vesting and, in the case of the award under the AZIP, the holding period operate over several years.
The unvested long-term incentive awards from Mr Soriots previous employer were valued with the assistance of an independent third party, using its standard methodology for such work and, where relevant, taking into account the extent to which such awards might have been expected to vest.
General information about annual bonus outcomes for performance in 2012 can be found on page 129.
In awarding Mr Soriots bonus for 2012, the Remuneration Committee recognised the strong start he had made since becoming CEO and his positive impact on the organisation.

These are held for three years before being released.
The bonus is not pensionable.
Award of 2,000,000 On 26 October, Mr Soriot was granted an award of 69,108 restricted Ordinary Shares at a price of 2894 pence per share 1 restricted shares by way of compensation for the loss of long-term incentives from his previous employer.

This award is subject to a four year performance period 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2015 and a subsequent four year holding period 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2019.
The performance hurdles that apply to this award are that the annual dividend per share paid to holders of Ordinary Shares must increase from $2.80 over the four year performance period $2.80 being the full-year dividend for 2011, and that dividend cover over the same period based on Reported earnings before restructuring costs does not fall below 1.5 times.

128 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 Overview Strategy Performance Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Variable elements of the CEOs and CFOs remuneration in 2012 additional disclosures Annual bonus outcomes for performance in 2012 For Executive Directors, the principal drivers of annual bonus opportunity are EPS 27% weighting, cash ow 9% weighting, and scorecards Group and SET area, 64% weighting.
For the CEO, the average of all SET area scorecards is used to create an aggregate scorecard weighting.
For the CFO, the average of Finance and Strategic Partnering and Business Development scorecards is used.
Reward driven by EPS and cash ow performance depends on EPS and cash ow outcomes versus targets set at the beginning of each year.
Reward driven by the scorecards depends on performance outcomes relative to goals in the areas of Values, Pipeline and People set at the beginning of each year.
At constant exchange rates, there were declines in revenue, Core operating profit and EPS versus prior year.
However, the Core EPS outcome and the cash ow outcome both exceeded the target set at the beginning of 2012.
That element of the bonus payout which was driven by EPS and cash ow performance therefore exceeded target.
In respect of the scorecards, a number of factors were taken into consideration.
These include the supply problems described elsewhere in this Remuneration Report and the slower than expected uptake of Brilinta Brilique.
But they also include the strengthening of the pipeline through the acquisition of Ardea, the collaboration with Amgen, and the extension of our diabetes alliance with BMS through the inclusion of the Amylin product portfolio.
Both Forxiga and Zinforo were launched in Europe, and we had a successful launch of Nexium in Japan.
These factors collectively drove a score relative to scorecard performance of slightly below target.
The outturn is that the total variable short-term compensation of Executive Directors and other SET members in 2012 fell relative to the equivalent number in 2011.
The Remuneration Committee decided that Mr Soriots annual bonus should amount to 122% of base salary, representing 68% of the potential maximum.
The Remuneration Committee decided that Mr Lowths annual bonus should be 140% of base salary, representing 86% of the potential maximum.
Mr Brennan informed the Remuneration Committee that he did not wish to be considered for a bonus in respect of that part of 2012 during which he was CEO and the Remuneration Committee determined that no such bonus would be awarded.
Annual bonus deferral Part of the annual bonus of Executive Directors and other SET members is deferred into shares, helping to align senior executives interests with those of shareholders.
The proportion currently deferred into shares is one-third of the pre-tax annual bonus for Executive Directors and one-sixth for other SET members.
The shares are acquired on the open market at the prevailing market price and held for a period of three years from the date of acquisition before being delivered to individual Executive Directors and other SET members.
Performance measures under the PSP The vesting of PSP awards is contingent on performance against specified performance measures over the relevant three year performance period and continued employment with the Group.
Equal weighting is given to the two performance measures used: relative TSR and cumulative free cash ow.
Relative TSR Fifty percent of the award is based on the Groups relative TSR performance against a predetermined peer group of global pharmaceutical companies.
The peer group is: Abbott, BMS, Eli Lilly & Company, GSK, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Novartis, Pzer, Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Sano-Aventis.
TSR measures share price growth, and dividends reinvested in respect of a notional number of shares from the beginning of the relevant performance period to the end of it, and ranks the companies in the peer group by reference to their TSR achieved over that period.
The rank which the Companys TSR achieves over the performance period will determine how many shares will vest under the relevant PSP award.
Payouts against performance in relation to TSR for PSP awards are expressed as a percentage of the maximum award currently payable, shown within a range of 0% to 100%, as set out in the table below.
TSR ranking of the Company % of the maximum PSP award that vests Below median 0% Median 25% Between median and upper quartile Pro rata Upper quartile 75% Signicantly above upper quartile 100% Although 100% of the maximum award may vest at the Remuneration Committees discretion if the Companys TSR performance is substantially better than that of the upper quartile of the comparator group, the Company would need to have sustained a level of performance signicantly in excess of upper quartile over a period of years for the Remuneration Committee to be satisfied that the vesting of awards at this level was warranted.
In addition to the TSR performance target being met for each PSP award, the Remuneration Committee has to satisfy itself that achievement of the TSR performance target is an appropriate reection of the Groups underlying financial performance.
It has the discretion to prevent PSP awards from vesting or only allow them to vest partially where this, in the judgement of the Remuneration Committee, is warranted.
The TSR graphs on page 134 show, for each PSP award, how the Companys TSR performance has compared with the TSR for the companies in the comparator group from the first day of the relevant performance period to 31 December 2012, and how the Company ranks against those other peer companies on this basis.
Cumulative free cash ow Fifty percent of the award vests subject to the achievement of the free cash ow performance measure, which operates as a cumulative cash ow target over the same three year performance period as the TSR performance measure.
The measure for the cash ow target is net cash ow before distributions subject to any further adjustments the Remuneration Committee chooses to make at its discretion and thus referred to as adjusted cumulative cash ow and the level of vesting is based on a sliding scale between a threshold cash ow target and an upper target.
Vesting levels in relation to the threshold target and the upper target are shown in the table overleaf.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 129 Corporate Governance | Directors Remuneration Report Adjusted cumulative cash ow all PSP awards made before 2012 Adjusted cumulative cash ow PSP awards made in 2012 % of the maximum PSP award that vests Less than $16 billion Less than $12 billion 0% $16 billion $12 billion 25% Between $16 billion and $23 billion Between $12 billion and $18 billion Pro rata $23 billion and above $18 billion and above 100% Cumulative cash ow is considered to be the most appropriate measure of cash ow performance because it relates to the residual cash available to finance additional investment in specic business needs, debt repayments and our distribution policy.
The cash ow measure encompasses a number of important elements of operational and financial performance and helps to align executives rewards with shareholder value creation.
The level of vesting of this element is based on a sliding scale against a target that is intended to represent a significant challenge for the business.
It is intended that the Remuneration Committee should have the discretion to adjust, but on an exceptional basis only, the free cash ow target during the performance period for material factors that might otherwise distort the performance measure in either direction.
This allows performance to be assessed against targets that have been set on a consistent basis.
For example, adjustments may be required to reect exchange rate movements, significant acquisitions or divestments, and major legal and taxation settlements.
Any major adjustments to the calculation are disclosed to shareholders.
There is no retesting of performance.
Vesting of share awards made in 2010 under the PSP In 2012, the TSR ranking of the Company was below median and therefore none of the award will vest in respect of that element of the performance measure.
Fifty percent of the PSP award is based on free cash ow and in 2012 the Company achieved 95% of the free cash ow performance measure.
The PSP share awards made in 2010 in respect of the 2010 to 2012 performance period will therefore vest at 47% for SET members, including Simon Lowth but excluding Pascal Soriot who does not hold any 2010 PSP awards.
For the former CEO, David Brennan, vesting of his 2010 PSP awards will be pro-rated from 7 May 2010 to 30 June 2012 to reect the period of his employment since the award was granted.
Performance hurdles under the AZIP The performance hurdles for the AZIP awards are shown in the table below.

Pension arrangements Pascal Soriot and Simon Lowth Pascal Soriot and Simon Lowth are eligible to join the AstraZeneca Group Self Invested Personal Pension UK Dened Contribution Plan UK DCP at a Company contribution rate of 24% of annual base salary or, alternatively, to take the Company contribution as a cash allowance.
Since joining AstraZeneca, Mr Lowth has elected to take the cash allowance in lieu of a pension, which during 2012 amounted to 158,000 $251,000 2011: 153,000 $245,000.
In respect of 2012, Mr Soriot made a similar election, which amounted to 66,000 $105,000.
In the event of a senior employee in the UK DCP including one who has taken the alternative cash allowance becoming incapacitated, permanent health insurance cover provides continuation of a proportion of salary, subject to the satisfaction of certain medical criteria.
In the event of death prior to retirement, dependants are entitled to a lump sum secured from a multiple of 10 times salary, capped at 4.3 million.
David Brennan David Brennan is a member of the AstraZeneca US Dened benefit Pension Plan US DBP.
Benets for members of the US DBP are delivered on a tax-qualied basis, with accrued benets that exceed specic limits under the US DBPs formula and the US Tax Code being delivered through a supplementary, non-qualied plan.
The normal pension age under the US DBP is 65.
However, on his retirement in 2012, Mr Brennan was eligible to take a pension or lump sum equivalent based on accrued service and final pensionable pay ie without actuarial reduction due to his satisfaction of a condition in the pension plan relating to combined age and service exceeding 85 years.
Mr Brennans participation in the US DBP was subject to a service cap at 35 years service, which was attained during his tenure as CEO and therefore service beyond 35 years is not shown in the table below.
During his tenure as a Director, bonus payments were removed from the calculation of his pensionable pay under the US DBP.
Pension is payable to Mr Brennan in US dollars.
For ease of understanding, the table below has been presented in both pounds sterling and US dollars using the exchange rates for 2012 set out on page 133.
Transfer values are calculated to be consistent with the value of the lump sum distribution equivalent to his deferred accrued pension annually.

In addition to the US DBP, Mr Brennan as a US citizen was a contributing member of the US 401 k savings plan.
He also participated in AstraZenecas Executive Deferred Compensation Plan EDCP which is operated as a supplemental non-qualied plan in respect of US employees should annual contributions exceed the limit applicable to contributions under the qualied 401 k plan.
During 2012, total employer matching contributions of $47,000 30,000 2011: $96,000 60,000 were made to his 401 k plan and EDCP.
Member contributions of 224,000 $355,000 were paid through salary sacrifice into the plans.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 131 Corporate Governance | Directors Remuneration Report Summary of other share plans AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan The AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan GRSP was introduced in 2010 and provides for the grant of restricted stock awards over the Companys Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
The GRSP is operated for below SET-level employees only.
Typically, awards are made in March each year and, in relation, for example, to new appointments or promotions, in August.
Awards under the GRSP do not involve the issue or allotment of new Ordinary Shares or ADSs but rely instead on the market purchase of Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
AstraZeneca Restricted Share Plan The AstraZeneca Restricted Share Plan RSP was introduced in 2008 and provides for the granting of restricted share awards to key employees, excluding Executive Directors.
Awards are made on an ad hoc basis with variable vesting dates.
The RSP was used in 2012 to make awards totalling an aggregate of 643,000 Ordinary Shares under the plan for the calendar year 2012 to a number of key senior executives in specic situations considered by the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for agreeing any awards under the RSP and for setting the policy for the way in which the RSP operates.
Awards under the RSP do not involve the issue or allotment of new Ordinary Shares or ADSs but rely instead on the market purchase of Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
AstraZeneca Share Option Plan The AstraZeneca Share Option Plan SOP expired in May 2010.
Details of outstanding options granted to Executive Directors are shown in the table on page 137.
The Remuneration Committee imposed performance conditions in respect of the exercise of such options by SET members including the Executive Directors which, in the view of the Remuneration Committee, were considered appropriately stretching.
In order for options to vest, the EPS of the Group must increase at least in line with the UK Retail Prices Index plus 5% per annum on average, over a three year period, the base gure being the EPS for the financial year preceding the date of grant, with no retesting.
In addition, since the review of executive remuneration in 2004, the Remuneration Committee has included a condition that, if an event occurs which causes material reputational damage to the Company, such that it is not appropriate for the options to vest and become exercisable, the Remuneration Committee can make a determination to reect this.
No such determination was made in 2012.
Other plans In addition to the plans described above, the AstraZeneca Savings-Related Share Option Plan and the AstraZeneca All-Employee Share Plan are operated in the UK, both of which are HM Revenue & Customs approved plans.
Executive Directors and certain other SET members are eligible to participate in these plans.
Dilution under share plans Other than the AstraZeneca Savings-Related Share Option Plan and the AstraZeneca All-Employee Share Plan, which operate in the UK only, and the SOP, none of AstraZenecas share plans has a dilutive effect because they do not involve the issue or allotment of new Ordinary Shares or ADSs but rely instead on the market purchase of Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
Chairman The Remuneration Committee determines the terms of service, including remuneration, of the Chairman.
The annual Board fees payable to the Chairman are set out in the table below.
In addition to the Chairmans fee, a proportion of the ofce costs of the Chairman are reimbursed: the sum paid in this respect in 2012 is set out in the Directors emoluments section below.
The Chairman receives no additional fee or allowance for Remuneration Committee membership.
The Chairman does not participate in the Groups incentive plans or pension or healthcare arrangements.
Non-Executive Directors None of the Non-Executive Directors has a service contract but all have letters of appointment.
In accordance with the Articles, following their appointment, Directors must retire at each AGM and may present themselves for election or re-election.
None of the Non-Executive Directors has any provision in their letter of appointment giving them a right to compensation payable upon early termination of their appointment.
They are not eligible for performance-related bonuses or the grant of share awards or options.
No pension contributions are made on their behalf.
The annual Board fees applicable to Non-Executive Directors are set out below.
Under the Articles, all Directors must, within two months of their appointment, acquire a beneficial interest in at least 500 shares.
In addition to this mandatory shareholding requirement, the Board encourages each Non-Executive Director to build up, over time, a shareholding in the Company with a value approximately equivalent to the basic annual fee for a Non-Executive Director 75,000 or, in the case of the Chairman, approximately equivalent to his annual fee 500,000.
Non-Executive Directors fees Chairmans fee 500,000 Basic fee 75,000 Senior independent Non-Executive Director 30,000 Membership of the Audit Committee 20,000 Membership of the Remuneration Committee 15,000 1 Chairman of the Audit Committee or the Remuneration Committee 20,000 Membership of the Science Committee 10,000 1 Chairman of the Science Committee 7,000 1 This fee is in addition to the fee for membership of the relevant Committee.
Directors emoluments in 2012 The aggregate remuneration, excluding pension contributions and the value of shares under option and shares subject to share awards, paid to or accrued for all Directors for services in all capacities during the year ended 31 December 2012 was 7,308,000 $11,572,000.

The Company is a member of the FTSE 100 Index and consequently, for the purposes of this graph, which is set out above, we have selected the FTSE 100 Index as the appropriate index.
This graph is re-based to 100 at the start of the rolling five year period.
We have also included a Pharmaceutical peers average, which reects the TSR of the same comparator group used for the PSP graphs above.
The PSP requires that the TSR in respect of a holding of the Companys shares over the relevant performance period be compared with the TSR of a peer group of pharmaceutical companies as described on page 129.
The graphs above show how the Companys TSR performance has compared with the TSR for the relevant companies in the comparator group from the first day in the relevant three year performance period in respect of each PSP award to 31 December 2012 and how the Company ranks against those other companies on this basis.
To alleviate any short-term volatility, the return index is averaged in the TSR calculations for each company over the three months prior to the start of the relevant performance period as stipulated in the PSP and, for the purposes of the graphs above, over the last three months of 2012.
Directors interests in shares beneficial interests The table opposite shows any change in the interests of the Directors including the interests of their Connected Persons, as such term is dened in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 in Ordinary Shares from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012 or on the date of resignation of such Director if earlier.
All such interests were beneficial except as otherwise stated.
However, interests in Ordinary Shares or ADSs that are the subject of PSP awards and or AZIP awards, as well as Ordinary Shares or ADSs that are deferred under the annual bonus plan discussed in this Remuneration Report, are not included in the Directors interests in shares table opposite but are shown in the relevant tables from page 135.
No Director or senior executive beneficially owns, or has options over, 1% or more of the issued share capital of the Company, nor do they have different voting rights from other shareholders.
None of the Directors has a beneficial interest in the shares of any of the Companys subsidiaries.
Between 31 December 2012 and 31 January 2013, there was no change in the interests in Ordinary Shares shown in the table opposite.

Unitised stock plans David Brennan, in common with other participating executives in the US, has interests in the following plans which were awarded to him prior to him becoming CEO: the AstraZeneca Executive Deferral Plan, the AstraZeneca Executive Deferred Compensation Plan and the AstraZeneca Savings and Security Plan.
These are unitised stock plans into which the value of certain previous share incentive awards has been deferred and are not incentive awards in their own right.
Participants hold units in each plan, which represent a long-term equity interest in the Company.
A unit comprises part cash and part ADSs.
The overall unit value can be determined daily by taking the market value of the underlying ADSs and adding the cash position.
The ADSs held within these units carry both voting and dividend rights.
David Brennan is deemed to have a notional beneficial interest in these ADSs, calculated by reference to the fund value and the closing price of ADSs.
Therefore, the number of ADSs in which a notional beneficial interest arises can vary daily as a consequence of stock price movements.
