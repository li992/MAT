Table 2 Attendance at committee meetings Member Meetings attended: Marion Sears Chair 4 Geoff Cooper 4 Simon Emeny 3 1 Matt Davies 2 1 Matt Davies has attended all committee meetings since his appointment.
No Director is ever present when their own remuneration is discussed.
During the year, the committee took advice from Deloitte in respect of the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
Deloitte had no other connection with the Company in the last financial year.
Remuneration Committee role, responsibility and meetings The Board has delegated to the Remuneration Committee responsibility for reviewing and recommending the pay and benefits and contractual arrangements of the Executive Directors, for monitoring the structure and level of pay and benefits for senior managers and for overseeing the operation of the Groups share schemes.
The Remuneration Committee is committed to principles of accountability and transparency to ensure that remuneration arrangements demonstrate a clear link between performance and reward.
The committee considers fully the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Executive remuneration policy The Remuneration Committees policy is to provide an executive remuneration structure that will pay fairly for the roles and responsibilities of each Director and incentivise strongly for value creation, with an emphasis on the long term.
It is our intention to maintain a simple and transparent remuneration structure that does not frequently change.
Base salaries are set at, or below, the median for comparable companies and increases are expected to be in line with Group-wide awards unless merited by specific circumstances.
In setting base salaries a retail peer group is considered within the FTSE 250 as well as industry wide surveys which cover the FTSE 250 and small-cap sector.
It is our policy that base salary should comprise a minority of the total remuneration that an Executive Director can earn.
The opportunity is available for executives to earn a multiple of base pay if the Group delivers strong results.
Potential performance pay currently comprises just over two thirds of maximum potential earnings at up to 2.5x base salary.
It is set at the median for the annual cash bonus but in the upper quartile for the three-year Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP in order to incentivise consistent above-market-average growth.
Policy alignment with corporate strategy Our corporate strategy is centred around the growth and development of our specialist product offer, our stores, our multi-channel capability and our infrastructure.
These are all long-term objectives and the Committee has, since IPO, structured senior executive remuneration in three specific ways: to be aligned in share ownership terms, to reward performance and to be focused on long term value creation.
This is in keeping with the family origin of the business and is important to the Adderley family who remain our majority shareholders.
In view of this, required Director shareholdings are set at above market levels two times base salary for Executive Directors and senior executives will be highly rewarded on a market competitive basis for the delivery of stretching goals.
However they will receive reduced rewards if the business performs less strongly.
On an annual basis, around 70% of the maximum earnings opportunity is performance related and over 40% is measured on a three year cumulative performance.
Our new CEO has an additional five-year LTIP award, which was approved by shareholders in 2010, which runs until 2015 and which aligns him to share price performance over and above the regular three year LTIP.
To strengthen further the alignment between management and long term business success, members of the Operating Board are required to build a shareholding equivalent to at least one times their base salary and other senior management who receive discretionary share awards are required to build a holding of 50% of their salary.
Business overview Business review Governance Financial statements Dunelm Group plc Dunelm Group plc 40 Annual report and accounts 2012 Annual report and accounts 2012 41 Balance of fixed and variable remuneration As described above, the Remuneration Committees policy is that a substantial proportion of the Executive Directors remuneration should be variable and performance-related in order to encourage and reward superior business performance and shareholder returns.
Through performance criteria and the setting of personal objectives each Directors remuneration is individually linked to both personal and Group performance.
The following illustrates the balance between fixed and variable remuneration during the year for the Executive Directors: Table 3 Balance of fixed and variable remuneration 400 Variable 350% Variable 350 Fixed 300 LTIP 150% 250 % gures 177.5% indicate 200 proportion LTIP 37.5% 150 Bonus 100% of base salary Bonus 40% 100 Base 100% Base 100% 50 0 On target performance Maximum opportunity The breakdown does not include any share price growth or other benefits e. g. cash car allowance, value of private medical insurance, pension contribution or all employee share ownership plans.
Summary of Remuneration The Remuneration Committee selects performance measures that it believes are aligned with the Groups strategic goals, that are unambiguous and easy to calculate and that are transparent to Directors and shareholders.

Base salary and benefits Prior to the beginning of each financial year the Remuneration Committee sets the base salaries of Executive Directors.
The committee examines the salaries of Directors in a comparator retail peer group of public companies and also considers all-industry surveys for the FTSE 250 and small cap sectors.
In addition the operational scale and complexity of the role each Director performs is discussed and adjustments are applied to reflect these.
In setting base salaries any increase for Executive Directors is expected to be in line with Group-wide staff increases unless specific circumstances merit a different approach.
Base salary comprises just under one third of the total potential remuneration that an Executive Director can earn.
In addition to base salary, the Executive Directors are entitled to benefits comprising a car allowance, a contribution of 10% of base salary to a personal pension, private medical insurance and life insurance.
Nick Whartons base salary of 400,000 was set on his appointment in December 2010, with the first review due In July 2012.
Accordingly Nick did not receive an increase in base salary in July 2011.
Will Adderley waived any increase to his reduced salary of 265,000 during the year.
In July 2011 David Stead was awarded an increase in base salary of 1.5%, in line with the pay increase across the Group, to 258,800.
Executive Directors have been awarded a 2% increase in basic salary from July 2012, in line with the Group-wide award.
Will Adderley has waived this increase.
Therefore, from July 2012 Nick Whartons base salary is 408,000, Will Adderleys base salary is 265,000 and David Steads base salary is 264,000.
Annual bonus The Group operates a discretionary annual cash bonus scheme.
Any bonus amounts determined to be payable are paid after the year-end results are finalised.
The Remuneration Committee has established bonus objectives that are principally financial, based on the level of EPS achieved against budget target for the relevant financial year, but also include personal objectives for the year relevant to each Director.
For Nick Wharton and David Stead 100% of the annual bonus is calculated according to the performance against budget but may be adjusted at the discretion of RemCo depending on an individuals performance against personal objectives.
For Will Adderley, 50% of the annual bonus is calculated according to the performance against budget and 50% is awarded for performance on strategic projects which are an important focus of his time.
The prospects for the market and the Company are considered when setting the budget EPS target for the year.
In addition we have regard to both market consensus expectations for EPS and individual broker forecasts.
Table 5 bonus parameters EPS performance Percentage of maximum percentage of target bonus payable Threshold 95% 5% Target 100% 40% Maximum 105% 100% For the year ended 30 June 2012, the EPS budget target set by the Committee was 32.9p, an increase of 12.3% over the prior year.
Market consensus for the period at the date the target was set was 32.6p.
Reported EPS of 35.1p was 6.7% above target.
After due consideration of job performance, the committee awarded an annual bonus to Nick Wharton of 400,000, to Will Adderley of 265,000 and to David Stead of 258,800.
Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP Under the LTIP, Executive Directors are awarded nominal cost share options annually.
These awards will vest three years after date of grant, to the extent that the applicable performance target is met.
If there is a change of control of the Company, any awards under the LTIP that have not yet vested will be exercisable, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee taking into account the period of time that has elapsed since grant of the award, and to the extent that any performance target has been met.
The Remuneration Committee has chosen growth in fully diluted EPS over each three-year performance period as the performance target for the awards under the LTIP.
The committee believes that this measure is closely aligned to the drivers of growth of the business, and that in the long term, EPS performance will be reflected in shareholder value.
The committee is satisfied that capital expenditure controls exercised by the Board are sufficiently rigorous to avoid EPS accretion by means of ineffective investment of capital, and in any event reserves the right to adjust the target in the event of a major capital transaction.
The LTIP is structured as follows awards vest on a straight-line basis between the threshold and maximum points : Business overview Business review Governance Financial statements Dunelm Group plc Dunelm Group plc 42 Annual report and accounts 2012 Annual report and accounts 2012 43 Table 6 LTIP performance parameters Compound Annual Growth in EPS Amount of award to vest Plan period 2009 2012 and 2010 2013 2011 2014 onwards Threshold RPI 3% RPI 3% 25% Maximum RPI 12% RPI 15% 100% The maximum point was increased for awards made from 2011 onwards, in line with the increase In maximum annual award to 150% of base salary.
This was part of an overall review of Executive Directors remuneration.
It was explained fully in last years annual report and approved by shareholders at the AGM in November 2011.
The committee meets after the results for each three-year performance period are available to determine the extent to which performance conditions have been satisfied.
Awards cannot be granted to Executive Directors under the LTIP over Ordinary Shares in excess of 5% of the issued Ordinary Share capital in any rolling 10 year period.
Details of outstanding awards made to Executive Directors under the LTIP and awards made and exercised during the financial year are set out in tables 11 to 14 of this report.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the Companys EPS record over the three-year performance period which ended on 30 June 2012.
Reported fully diluted EPS grew at a compound annual rate of 23.6%.
This is 19.3% above the compound annual growth in RPI over the same period.
Accordingly, 100% of the September 2009 LTIP award will vest in September 2012 representing 123,949 shares in favour of Will Adderley and 85,215 shares in favour of David Stead.
Nick Wharton, who became an Executive Director in December 2010, was not a participant of the 2009 LTIP and therefore does not receive any shares under the 2011 12 vesting.
The 2009 LTIP shares which vested in favour of Will Adderley and David Stead as described above are included in the single number for total remuneration for 2011 12 set out in table 10.
Their value has been calculated using the average share price over the three months preceding the end of the performance period on 30 June 2012, which is 501p.
See table 13 and the note to table 10 below.
Changes in policy Annual bonus range agreed in 2010 11, implemented in 2011 12 As noted in last years report, with effect from 1 July 2011 we amended the bonus range for the annual performance bonus to 95%105% of budget, compared with 93% to 112% previously.
This narrower range is considered to be more appropriate for a larger company, and also harmonises the bonus structure for the Executive Directors with that of the Operating Board.
LTIP quantum approved in 2010 11, implemented in 2011 12 In addition, as mentioned above, with the approval of shareholders at the AGM, the maximum potential annual award of nominal cost options under the LTIP was increased to 150% of base salary, compared with 120% previously.
At the same time the performance target required to achieve the maximum award was made more stretching: compound annual growth rate in EPS over the plan period of between RPI 3% and RPI 15% is now required, compared to RPI 3% to RPI 12%.
These new criteria apply to all awards made in 2011 and future years.
Future LTIP participation by Will Adderley With effect from 1 January 2012, and in response to shareholder concerns about Will Adderley obtaining creeping control of the company through vesting of share incentive awards, Will Adderley has indicated that he no longer wishes to receive further awards under the LTIP.
He will be entitled to receive shares under existing awards, subject to performance criteria being met.
Pension payments We decided to harmonise the pension contributions made to Executive Directors at 10% of basic salary.
This is the entitlement of Nick Wharton.
Previously Will Adderley and David Stead received a fixed contribution of 20,000 per annum, subject to annual review by the Committee.
This change took effect from 1 January 2012, and so the payments will be as follows: Table 7 Executive Director pension entitlements 2012 13 @ 10% base salary Past 2011 12 based on salary from July 2012 Nick Wharton 10% of base salary 40,000 40,800 Will Adderley 20,000 pa 23,250 26,500 David Stead 20,000 pa 22,940 26,400 There have been no other changes to remuneration policy during the year.
Dunelm Group plc Dunelm Group plc 44 Annual report and accounts 2012 Annual report and accounts 2012 45 Remuneration report continued Proposed future changes in policy Claw back From 2012 the committee has decided to introduce a claw back provision under which cash bonus entitlements and unvested LTIP awards made from 2012 onwards will not be paid in certain circumstances.
Claw back will take place at the Remuneration Committees discretion if: Performance to which a bonus or LTIP award relates proves to have been mis-stated: or There has been a mis-calculation in the extent to which performance conditions have been met in respect of previous awards made to the individual that have vested and been exercised: or Where there has been gross misconduct on the part of an individual.
Other share options The Group operates an all-employee SAYE scheme in which Executive Directors are also entitled to participate after having been employed for three months.
Pension arrangements The Remuneration Committee has decided not to use final salary pension plans as a way of remunerating its Executive Directors.
Instead the Group contributes to the Executive Directors personal pension plans.
The Remuneration Committee believes this is an efficient way to assist Executives to prepare for retirement.
When determining overall remuneration levels for an Executive, the Remuneration Committee takes account of contributions to pension plans.
As noted above in the section headed changes in policy, in January we decided to harmonise the sum paid by the company on a Directors behalf into a personal pension at 10% of salary.
Share ownership requirements Executive Directors are required to build a shareholding equal to at least twice their base salary over time and shares vesting under the LTIP should be held for this purpose.
Below Board level, members of the Operating Board are required to own shares equal to at least one times their base salary, to be accumulated over time: and other members of senior management in receipt of discretionary share incentives are required to build up a holding equal to 50% of their salary over time.
Non-Executive remuneration policy Non-Executive Directors remuneration is determined by the Executive Directors.
The Non-Executive Directors do not receive bonuses or participate in any incentive plans.
They are paid annual fees which reflect additional responsibilities taken when chairing a committee of the Board.
Fees were reviewed and amended in the light of market practice in July 2010.
The next review will be in July 2013.
Service contracts In accordance with the Groups policy, the service contracts of the Executive Directors have no fixed term, the notice period for termination is 12 months from either party and payments on termination are restricted to a maximum of the value of salary for the notice period.
The Remuneration Committee will apply mitigation rigorously in respect of any post remuneration payment.
The Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment for an initial period of three years with a provision for termination of one months notice from either party, or three months notice from either party in the case of Geoff Cooper, the Chairman.

The package for new appointments is formally presented to the committee for approval.
In conducting its assessment of senior executive remuneration the committee pays particular regard to whether any individual is incentivised to take risks inappropriate to their role and responsibilities.
In the finance function, managers are not remunerated against individual financial performance, but against corporate performance and personal qualitative objectives.

At the date of this report options have been granted over 1.15% of the Companys issued share capital.
Performance graph The graph below shows the Groups performance over 5 years, measured by total shareholder return, compared with the FTSE General Retail Index and the FTSE 250.
The Remuneration Committee has chosen these indices for comparison because they provide a range of comparator companies which have similar market capitalisation, which are in the same sector and which face similar market and economic challenges in the long term.

The realisable gain on LTIP awards vesting in the relevant financial period is calculated using the LTIP award whose performance period ends on the last day of the financial period being reported on so for 2011 12, the LTIP award used is the 2009 award, with a performance period of July 2009 to June 2012 inclusive.
The realisable value of the award is then calculated by multiplying the number of shares which will vest after applying the performance criteria, by the average share price for the three months ended on the last day of the performance period.
Directors interests in share options Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP As at 30 June 2012, the Directors beneficial interests in options granted under the LTIP, which unless otherwise noted will vest only if EPS performance conditions are met, are as follows: Table 11 Directors interests in LTIP End of Market price of Share options at performance shares at date of Director Date of award Nature of award 30 June 2012 period award 1 Nick Wharton Dec 2010 One-off joining award 198,807 Nov 2015 503p Dec 2010 2010 13 LTIP 120% quantum 55,666 Jun 2013 503p pro-rata to time served Nov 2011 2011 14 LTIP 150% quantum 139,211 Jun 2014 431p Will Adderley Sep 2009 2009 12 LTIP 120% quantum 123,949 Jun 2012 316p Dec 2010 2010 13 LTIP 120% quantum 72,614 Jun 2013 503p pro rata salary 2010 11 Nov 2011 2011 14 LTIP 150% quantum 92,227 Jun 2013 431p David Stead Sep 2009 2009 12 LTIP 120% quantum 85,215 Jun 2012 316p Dec 2010 2010 13 LTIP 120% quantum 60,835 Jun 2013 503p Nov 2011 2011 14 LTIP 150% quantum 90,070 Jun 2014 431p 1 The nominal cost options over 198,807 shares made to Nick Wharton on 1December2010 can only vest if he remains an employee for five years.
There is no vesting entitlement if Nick leaves the company, for any reason, before 1December2015.
This award was made in compensation for LTIP benefits left behind with Nicks previous employer and there are no other performance conditions attached to it.
LTIP options exercised during the period TheSeptember2008 award was in respect of the three-year performance period to 2July2011, over which the compound annual fully diluted growth in EPS was 21% 19% above RPI.
Accordingly, 100% of the conditional nominal cost options awarded inSeptember2008 vested inSeptember2011.

Will Adderley waived his entitlement to exercise his options under this scheme and they lapsed on 30 June 2012.
The table above sets out the entire history of SAYE options granted to and exercised by Directors.
The Directors do not have entitlements under any other share based incentive plan.
Total remuneration figure In line with developing requirements to set out total remuneration in a transparent way as a single number we have included a Total Remuneration figure for each Executive Director in Table 10.
This total includes all rewards that the Director received or will receive pertaining to the year being reported.
In the case of Dunelm our simple remuneration structure means that the total remuneration includes: base salary, value of benefits, pension contribution, cash bonus relating to the year, the actual value of SAYE options vesting and exercised in the year and the value of the gross LTIP shares vesting in respect of the performance period ended in the year, calculated using the average share price over the three months ended on the last day of the performance period which we refer to in the tables as realisable value.
Total remuneration earned by the Executive Directors in 2011 12 was 3.0m and by the Non-Executive Directors was 0.2m.
The total remuneration of all Directors was 3.2m.
