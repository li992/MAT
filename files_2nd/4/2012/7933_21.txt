Imperial Tobacco Group PLC|Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Strategic Review Performance Risk Governance Financials 80 Directors Remuneration Report continued Annual Bonus Our shareholders and other stakeholders place signi cant weight on our annual performance.
We, therefore, think it is appropriate tohave a major element of Executive Directors remuneration targeted at incentivising delivery of the Groups annual objectives and enhancing performance against key financial and nonfinancial targets.
For the financial year ended 30 September 2012 the potential maximum bonus was 200 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive, 150 per cent for the Finance Director and 125 per cent for the Corporate Affairs Director pro rata from date of appointment.
Bonus targets constituted stretching EPS 50 per cent of maximum, net revenue 20 per cent of maximum, volume growth 12.5 per cent of maximum, cash conversion 7.5 per cent of maximum and nonfinancial metrics 10 per cent of maximum.
During the year we delivered adjusted EPS of 201.0 pence resulting in 58 per cent of this element vesting.
We consider the other targets to be commercially con dential, however, they were met in part, with 44.4 per cent of these elements vesting overall.
Any annual bonus earned up to 100 per cent of base salary is paid in cash and is eligible for investment in our SMS SMS Eligible Bonus.
Any bonus payable in excess of this level is used to purchase shares in the Company which the Director is required to retain for a minimum of three years.
These shares are not eligible for investment in the SMS.
Annual bonuses forExecutive Directors and certain key executives are subject to claw back during the three years following the end of the financial year in which they are earned.
Claw back would be applied in the event of gross misconduct by the employee ormisstatement of results where this had the effect of increasing the level of bonus that would otherwise have been paid.
No element of the annual bonus is guaranteed.
Share Matching Scheme The purpose of the SMS is to encourage the Groups senior managers, including Executive Directors, to hold shares in the Company.
Under the SMS, at the discretion of the Committee, senior managers are invited to invest any proportion of their SMS Eligible Bonus in our shares.
If those shares are held in an employee nominee facility forthree years and the participant remains an employee within the Group, they will be matched on a one-for-one basis.
For our Executive Directors and our most senior managers we apply a performance criterion, as shown below, measurement of which is based on the same protocol as that applying to the LTIP.
There is no opportunity to re-test.
Employees can exercise their vote in respect of shares held in the employee nominee facility by giving written instructions to the nominee.

Under the rules of the SMS, should Imperial Tobacco Group PLC be acquired the performance period would end on the date of acquisition.
Any outstanding awards would vest on a time pro rata basis subject to the achievement of the applicable performance criterion.
Long Term Incentive Plan The LTIP is a conditional award of shares to Executive Directors and other senior management.
These awards vest three years after grant dependent upon satisfaction of performance criteria over the period.
All grants are at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and no employee has a right to receive an award.
Awards are equivalent to 200 per cent of base salary for the Chief Executive, 150 per cent for the Finance Director and 125 per cent for the Corporate Affairs Director, with awards at lower levels for other senior managers.
Current Structure The performance criteria for all awards is split into three elements which operate independently and can vest regardless of the performance in respect of the other elements.
The three elements are: EPS Growth Element The performance criterion for 50 per cent of the award is based on average growth in adjusted EPS based on anagreed protocol, after adjusting for in ation over the period of the award Real Annual EPS Growth.
At the Committees request, our Auditors perform agreed upon procedures on the calculations.
If Real Annual EPS Growth equals 3 per cent, 12.5 per cent of this element vests.
This element vests in full if Real Annual EPS Growth equals or exceeds 10 per cent.
Between these two points this element vests ona straight-line basis.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC|Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Governance Overview Strategic Review Performance Risk Financials 81 TSR Relative to FTSE Element A further 25 per cent of the award has a performance criterion based on a sliding scale depending on TSR relative to the FTSE 100 Index.
No vesting of this element occurs unless the Companys TSR ranks it in the top 50 per cent of the companies in this index.
Atthis performance threshold 30 per cent of this element vests.
This element vests in full if the TSR ranks the Company in the top 25 per cent of the index.
Between these thresholds this element vests on a straight-line basis.
TSR Relative to Bespoke Comparator Group Element The final 25 per cent of the award has a performance criterion based on a sliding scale depending on TSR relative to a bespoke comparator group comprising 12 tobacco and alcohol companies.
No vesting of this element occurs unless the Companys TSR exceeds that of the bottom six companies in the bespoke comparator group.
At this performance threshold, 30 per cent of this element vests.
This element vests in full if the TSR ranks the Company in the top three.
Between these thresholds this element vests on astraight-line basis.
The bespoke comparator group for the November 2011 award was: AB InBev Altria Group Inc. British American Tobacco PLC Carlsberg A S Diageo PLC Heineken N. V. Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Japan Tobacco Inc. Philip Morris International Inc. Pernod Ricard S. A. Reynolds American Inc. SABMiller PLC To ensure our Executive Directors and senior managers are incentivised to drive our underlying performance and to ensure that corporate actions or uctuations in exchange rates do not unduly affect comparative underlying performance, the Committee has agreed the following protocols: if a company in the bespoke comparator group is delisted during the performance period it will be replaced from the start of the performance period, in an agreed order, by Lorillard Inc or Molson Coors Brewing Company: if a company in the bespoke comparator group undertakes a rights issue during the performance period a cash neutral approach of selling a portion of rights to take up the balance of the rights commonly known as tail swallowing will be applied: and to remove the undue in uence of exchange rate uctuations, TSR calculations are measured in the currency in which each company is listed.
The TSR calculations, performed independently by Alithos Limited, use the share prices of each bespoke comparator group company, averaged over a period of three months, to determine the initial and closing prices.
Dividend payments are recognised on the date shares are declared ex dividend.
The Committee considers this method gives a fairer and less volatile result as improved performance has to be sustained for several weeks before it effectively impacts on the TSR calculations.
During the year the Committee reviewed the performance criteria, award policy, bespoke comparator group and vesting schedules for LTIP awards and decided to retain these performance criteria pending the introduction of the revised remuneration arrangements from 2013 onwards.
On vesting, a participants option to acquire the relevant number of shares may be exercised at any time up to the seventh anniversary of the date the award vested.
The vesting process in a number of jurisdictions outside the UK is, however, amended to comply with local securities and tax legislation.
The performance period is set prior to the granting of each annual award and there is no opportunity to re-test if any of the performance criteria are not achieved.
Under the rules of the LTIP, should the Company be acquired the performance periods for outstanding awards would end on the date of acquisition.
Anyoutstanding awards would vest on a time pro rata basis subject to the achievement of the applicable performance criteria.
The Committee has absolute discretion to vary, but not increase, the extent to which any awards vest.

Annually we offer as many employees as practicable, together with our Executive Directors, the opportunity to join the Sharesave Plan.
Options over shares are offered at a discount of up to 20 per cent to the closing mid-market price of our shares on the London Stock Exchange on the day prior to invitation.
The Sharesave Plan allows participants to save up to 250 per month over a period of three years, and in the UK only three or five years, and then exercise their option over shares.
In common with most plans of this type, no performance conditions are applied.
Executive Directors Pensions Since 6 April 2006 A day the Groups UK pension policy, which applies to all current Executive Directors, provides the option to maintain membership of or, in respect of new employees, join the UK Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund the Fund or receive a salary supplement in lieu of membership of the Fund.
The Executive Directors are all members of the Fund, the principal fide ned bene t scheme operated by the Group.
For members who joined prior to 1 April 2002 the Fund is largely non-contributory with a normal retirement age of 60.
The Fund allows members to achieve the maximum pension of two-thirds of their salary at normal retirement age, usually after 32 years service.
Pension commutation to enable participants to receive a lump sum on retirement is permitted.
For death before retirement, a capital sum equal to four times salary is payable together with a spouses pension of two-thirds of the members expected pension at retirement.
For death in retirement, a spouses pension of two-thirds of the members pre-commutation pension is payable.
Dependant children will also receive allowances.
Pensions in payment increase annually by the lesser of 10 per cent and the increase in the Retail Prices Index, together with an option under the rules to surrender part of a pension in order for the annual increase to be in line with the increase in the Retail Prices Index to a maximum of 15 per cent.
New members of the Fund after 30 September 2010 accrue pension bene ts in the Fund on a fide ned contribution basis.
Members who joined the Fund prior to 1 October 2010 continue to accrue pension bene ts in the Fund on a fide ned bene t basis, as set out above.
All Executive Directors accrue pension bene ts on the fide ned bene t basis.
From 6 April 2006 a new tax regime was introduced by HM Revenue & Customs HMRC which abolished most of the detailed limits previously imposed on pension schemes and replaced them with a simpli ed approach.
Each member now has a Lifetime Allowance LTA, 1.5 million for retirements in the tax year 2012 2013 and a tax, called the lifetime allowance charge, is levied at retirement if the value of their pension bene t from all sources exceeds this amount.
For any member whose total bene t value on 6 April 2006 exceeded the LTA, transitional arrangements allowed them to register the higher value so that they would not be subject to a large retrospective LTA charge.
To qualify for this enhanced protection the member was required to opt out of Fund membership in respect of future service accrual in order to retain a final salary linked pension entitlement in respect of past service.
All Executive Directors earn bene ts on the standard scale with a normal retirement age of 60.
Other than Mrs A J Cooper and Mr M R Phillips, each of the current Executive Directors has opted out of Fund membership in respect of future service accrual as a result of registering for enhanced protection with HMRC.
The detailed HMRC rules governing enhanced protection mean that it may not be permissible, in some rare circumstances, for the full final salary linked pension based on service up to 6 April 2006 to be paid from the Fund.
In this event an additional pension will be paid by the Company through an unfunded unapproved retirement bene t scheme UURBS so that the full accrued bene t may be provided.
Mr R Dyrbus is in receipt of a salary supplement of 35 per cent of salary, which is in lieu of future pensionable service accrual and arises because his accrued pension on 6 April 2006 was well below the maximum pension of two-thirds of salary.
Mrs A J Cooper and Mr M R Phillips are also in receipt of a salary supplement.
Prior to 6 April 2006 their pension bene ts were limited by the effect of HMRCs earnings cap.
Although this cap was removed as from 6 April 2006, the Fund did not disapply it in respect of past pensionable service but maintained its own earnings cap going forward.
For service from 6 April 2006 onwards and for pensionable salary in excess of the Funds earnings cap, the standard Fund bene t is a pension at the lower accrual rate of 1 60ths with a 50 per cent spouses pension and member contributions of 5 per cent of this top slice of salary are payable.
As an alternative to extra pension accrual on this top slice of salary through the UURBS, Mrs Cooper and Mr Phillips each receive a salary supplement of 12 per cent of this amount.
In each case these salary supplements have been calculated by the independent actuaries to re ect the value of the bene ts of which they are in lieu and are discounted for early payment and for employers national insurance contributions.
The supplements are non-compensatory and non-pensionable.
The table on page 91 provides the information required by both the Listing Rules and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 the Regulations and gives details for each Executive Director of: the annual accrued pension payable on retirement calculated as if he she had left service at the year end any potential UURBS entitlement is included : the increase in accrued pension during the year, excluding any increases for in ation in respect of the disclosure required under the Listing Rules: and the transfer value of the increase in accrued pension calculated in accordance with the latest Regulations.
None of the Executive Directors have made additional voluntary contributions.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC|Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Governance Overview Strategic Review Performance Risk Financials 83 Directors Service Arrangements Executive Directors Service Agreements The Companys policy is that Executive Directors service agreements are terminable on no more than one years notice and there isno entitlement to the payment of a predetermined amount on termination of employment in any circumstances.
The service agreement for Mr R Dyrbus was, however, entered into at the time of the demerger of the Company from the Hanson Group in 1996 and theprovisions dealing with compensation on termination following a change of control in his service agreement re ect those arrangements.
There are no liquidated damages provisions for compensation on termination within Executive Directors service agreements, except for those set out in the table below.
The Executive Directors service agreements do contain provisions for payment in lieu of notice but these are at the Companys sole discretion.
The Company is unequivocally against rewards for failure.
Apart from the limited respects referred to above, the circumstances of the termination and an individuals duty and opportunity to mitigate losses are taken into account in every case.
Our policy is to stop or reduce compensatory payments to former Executive Directors to the extent that they receive remuneration from other employment during the compensation period and that any such payments would be paid monthly in arrears.
Under the rules of our SMS and LTIP, outstanding awards vest if a participant leaves for speci ed reasons, including death, redundancy, the business or company in which the participant is employed ceasing to be part of the Group or on a change of control.
In these circumstances a participants awards vest on a time pro rata basis subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance criteria with the balance of the awards lapsing.
If, however, thetermination of employment is not for one of thespeci ed reasons and the Committee does not exercise its discretion to allow an award to vest a participants full awards lapse.

Policy in Respect of External Board Appointments We recognise that external non-executive directorships are bene cial for both the Executive Director concerned and the Company.
Each serving Executive Director is restricted to one external non-executive directorship and may not serve as the chairman of a FTSE 100 company.
At the discretion of the Board, Executive Directors are permitted to retain fees received in respect of any such non-executive directorship.
Mrs A J Cooper is a Non-Executive Director of Inchcape PLC and was permitted to retain the 50,000 fees received from this position in the financial year.
Policy for Non-Executive Directors Within the 2.0 million limit set out in our Articles of Association, the Board determines the remuneration policy and level of fees for our Non-Executive Directors and, after recommendation by the Remuneration Committee, our Chairman.
In addition to base fees, additional fees are paid to our Senior Independent Director and the Chairmen of our Audit and Remuneration Committees.
These fees are reviewed, but not necessarily increased, on an annual basis after taking account of market practice, with reference to the same comparator group as used for Executive Directors, together with the need toattract and retain high calibre individuals.
With the exception of reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with their directorship of the Company, Non-Executive Directors receive no other material pay or bene ts.
They are not eligible for bonuses, retirement bene ts or to participate in the Groups employee share plans.
To align Non-Executive Directors interests with those of our long-term shareholders, annually a proportion of their fees is applied to the purchase of shares in the Company, but not at a level that we believe could compromise their judgement or independence.
These shares are held by a nominee during the term of their directorship.
Non-Executive Directors Letters of Appointment The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors do not have service agreements but the terms of their appointment, including the time commitment expected, are recorded in letters of appointment which are available for viewingat our registered of ce during normal business hours and both prior to and at the AGM.
In line with our annual review policy the Chairmans and Non-Executive Directors terms of appointment were reviewed and con rmed by the Board on 31 January 2012.
Under the terms of our Articles of Association, all Directors are subject to annual re-election by shareholders.
There are no provisions regarding notice periods in their letters of appointment which state that theChairman and Non-Executive Directors will only receive payment until the date their appointment ends and, therefore, nocompensation is payable on termination.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC|Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Strategic Review Performance Risk Governance Financials 84 Directors Remuneration Report continued Revised Remuneration Policy and Practice The Committee continues to view its primary responsibility as ensuring that the Company can recruit, motivate and retain high quality management to run its business in the best interests of long-term shareholders.
We believe that it is important to ensure that management is competitively rewarded in relation to peers and the other opportunities available to them whilst ensuring we do not pay more than is necessary.
Striking the right balance in nding a fair outcome in setting a competitive level of total remuneration is a matter of judgement.
In forming this judgement the Committee considers pay data at comparator companies of similar scale and operating in a similar sector.
Comparisons with other companies, however, do not determine what remuneration the Company offers but, at most serve, to fide ne a playing eld within which an individuals rewards need to be positioned.
In determining that positioning, the primary factors taken into account will be the scale of the challenges intrinsic to that individuals role: their ability and experiences and fundamentally their performance.
The policy is to offer packages that are signi cantly weighted towards performance based elements with measures that re ect individual, functional and corporate performance.
The aim is to set targets that are both stretching and achievable.
Following a review of Executive Directors Remuneration and consultation with the Groups major shareholders and investor representative bodies, the Committee has revised the policy for Executive Directors as summarised below.
The review concluded that the Groups remuneration policy has served both it and its long-term shareholders well and, therefore, the revised policy does not change the overall structure of our remuneration packages: the balance of xed and variable pay or the level of awards under the annual bonus, SMS or LTIP.
With the exception of the SMS and LTIP, the revised policy was introduced for the financial year to 30 September 2013.
The proposed amendments to the SMS and LTIP will, subject to shareholder approval at the forthcoming AGM, be introduced in the financial year commencing 1 October 2013.
Base Salary Base salaries for the financial year ending 30 September 2013 were reviewed by the Committee in September 2012 in accordance with the revised policy.
The Finance Directors base salary was increased to 664,500 from 654,500 and, having been appointed during the year, the Corporate Affairs Directors base salary was not reviewed.
Upon the Chief Executives appointment the Committee decided to set her base salary at a level below that of her predecessor and that indicated by the Groups remuneration policy, with the intention of increasing it over time, subject to performance.
Having reviewed her performance during the year, including with reference to the 2012 Board evaluation, an increase above the 3.0 per cent average for our wider UK management population was approved to continue to bring her base salary closer to that indicated by her performance, the Groups size, international pro le and the critical importance of the role.
As a result, the Chief Executives base salary was increased by 7.0 per cent to 920,000 from 860,000.
The percentage increases for senior executives base salaries effective both 1 October 2011 and 1 October 2012 were generally lower than the average for other employees of the Group located in the same region.
Summary of Changes to Remuneration Policy and Practice We have made the following changes to our method of determining pay levels: the playing eld for the value of total remuneration is assessed against two comparator groups, one being companies from FTSE size peers including pharmaceutical companies and the other being international sector peers: and base salary to be assessed primarily against the same comparators as total remuneration and in addition secondary reference to FTSE 30 and FTSE 50 both excluding financial sector companies We propose the following changes to our incentive plans: increase weighting on revenue growth and reduce weighting on EPS: set long-term financial targets including EPS on a nominal basis rather than relative to in ation: and where the same performance criteria are used in the SMS and LTIP similar vesting schedules and targets will be used: dividends will be rolled up on vested SMS and LTIP shares and paid on vesting.

Imperial Tobacco Group PLC|Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Strategic Review Performance Risk Governance Financials 86 Directors Remuneration Report continued Performance Criteria When setting the performance criteria the Committee has taken account of the Groups long-term plan and analysts forecasts.
The proposed vesting schedules for the initial awards are set out below.
For both the EPS and Net Revenue targets, the revised policy will use growth in absolute terms rather than relative to in ation.
As an international Group with the majority of sales coming from outside the UK, the measurement of financial performance relative to UK in ation has become less relevant as this does not re ect the Groups footprint and, therefore, in ation relevant to the Group as a whole.
Performance Criterion Net Revenue Growth elements Vesting of awards on these elements would occur as per the vesting schedule below: Compound annual growth in net revenue Shares vesting as a percentage of element Less than 3% per annum Nil 3% per annum 25% 3% to 7% per annum Between 25% and 100% pro rata 7% per annum or higher 100% In order to ensure that Net Revenue growth is not overly incentivised at the expense of pro tability, an EPS underpin will apply in respect of the Net Revenue growth elements for the Executive Directors.
This will require that a minimum level of EPS growth will have to be achieved in order for any awards under the Net Revenue growth element to vest.
Performance Criterion EPS elements Vesting of awards on these elements would occur as per the vesting schedule below: Compound annual EPS growth Shares vesting as a percentage of element Less than 5% per annum Nil 5% per annum 25% 5% to 10% per annum Between 25% and 100% pro rata 10% per annum or higher 100% In order to ensure that EPS growth is not achieved without due regard to the capital required to achieve such growth, an underpin based on Return on Invested Capital ROIC will apply in respect of the EPS elements for the Executive Directors.
ROIC is a measure of pro tability versus the Companys total utilised capital including goodwill and so is particularly useful to incentivise an appropriate approach towards acquisitions.
The ROIC underpin will require that a minimum level of ROIC will have to be achieved in order for any awards under the EPS growth element to vest.
Performance Criterion TSR element The performance criterion for the TSR element will be based on a single comparator group including over 40 companies across a broadly fide ned consumer goods sector.
Vesting of awards on this element would occur as per the vesting schedule below: Shares vesting as percentage of number relating to Relative TSR performance relative TSR performance condition Below median of peer group Nil At median of peer group 25% Between median and upper quartile Between 25% and 100% pro rata Above upper quartile 100% Overall Balance of Measures for Variable Pay The combined effect of the revised performance criteria is to rebalance the focus of the financial metrics of variable pay towards top line growth.
For long-term incentives SMS and LTIP, based on the Chief Executives remuneration, this will result in the weighting shifting from one third TSR and two thirds EPS to one third TSR, one third EPS and one third Net Revenue growth.
For the financial year ending 30 September 2013 the performance targets for the annual incentive will be 50 per cent EPS, 20 per cent Net Revenue growth, 15 per cent volume growth and 15 per cent nonfinancial.
