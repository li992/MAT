Levels of remuneration are set to be sufficient to meet these objectives but should not be excessive.
There should be strong alignment with attainment of performance objectives and the delivery of shareholder value.
The Committee considers it important that a significant proportion of executive directors potential total remuneration is dependent on attainment of demanding performance related short and longer term targets.
This is demonstrated by the percentage of basic salary potentially payable as cash or share awards under the annual cash bonus scheme and LTIPs respectively.

Awards under the 2010 Plan were subject to a three year performance period.
Prior to any vesting, the Remuneration Committee needs to be satisfied that the recorded TSR performance is a genuine reflection of the Companys overall underlying financial performance.
The LTIP award conditions are summarised in the table below: Vesting requirements 1 1 Performance measure Percentage of award 0% 25% 100% TSR ranking in peer group 50% Below 50th percentile 50th percentile Above 75th percentile EPS growth 50% Below RPI 10% RPI 10% RPI 25% 1.
Proportionate vesting between these points.
It is the intention of the Committee, when considering whether to make awards under the LTIP each year, to review both the size of awards and the performance conditions to ensure that, at the time of an award, they are appropriate and challenging taking into account any guidelines issued by organisations representing the interests of institutional shareholders or any other relevant guidelines issued from time to time.
The maximum award permitted is 150% of the basic annual salary, however there is currently no intention to exceed 100% of basic annual salary for any participant.
The LTIP grant comparator group of companies applying to the 2010 and 2011 LTIP awards are as set out below.
From the 2012 LTIP award, the Committee decided to replace the TSR comparator group with a larger group made up of the FTSE 250 excluding all financial services, insurance companies and investment trusts.
The original comparator group for the awards granted in 2012 consisted of 172 companies including Rotork plc.
As at 31 December 2012, 172 companies including Rotork plc remain in the comparator group.
Vesting requirements remain unchanged and are described in the table above.
The Committee made this change as the number of companies within the original TSR group was diminishing and suitable replacement within a narrow grouping of industrial stocks was becoming increasingly challenging.

The other points plotted show values at intervening financial year ends.
The graph measures the Companys performance against other companies in the FTSE Industrial Engineering sector by showing the TSR on a holding of ordinary shares in the Company compared with the average total shareholder return of other companies in its sector being the sector within which the Company is quoted on the London Stock Exchange and which is therefore considered the most appropriate index over the five year period to 31 December 2012.

The policy requires executive directors to achieve a minimum holding of ordinary shares in the Company equivalent to 150% of basic salary for executive directors.
Executive directors are required to make use of vesting LTIP shares to meet this minimum target.

The figures shown for the increase in accrued pension over the year exclude any increase for RPI inflation.
The accumulated accrued pension is that which would be paid annually on retirement from normal pension age, based on service to 31 December 2012, except for GM Odgen who became a preserved member of the Rotork Pension and Life Assurance Scheme on 5 April 2012.
A lump sum death benefit of four times basic annual salary is payable on death in service.
A dependants pension of one-half of prospective pension is payable on death in service, and of one-half of pre-commutation pension on death in retirement.
Post-retirement increases are applied at RPI up to a maximum of 5% per annum, except that for pension benefits in respect of pensionable service up to 15 May 2000 the minimum inflationary increase is 4.5% per annum.
The Pensionable Salary used to calculate benefits in the defined benefit scheme for JM Davis and PI France is restricted to a Scheme specific earnings cap which is currently 129,600.
The figures shown for RH Arnold are in respect of his membership of the Rotork Controls Inc. pension scheme and a supplemental executive retirement plan so that, in aggregate, the pension arrangements for RH Arnold will provide a pension of at least 60% of uncapped basic salary at age 65.

The figures shown for the increase in accrued pension over the year incorporate the increase for RPI inflation.
GM Ogden became a preserved member of the Rotork Pension and Life Assurance Scheme on 5 April 2012 and therefore these figures are based on service up to this date.
The transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the relevant Technical Actuarial Standards TASs published by the Board for Actuarial Standards.
The increase in accrued pension and the increase in transfer value over the year for RH Arnold are affected by movements in the US dollar relative to sterling.
In US dollars, the accrued pension for RH Arnold increased from $179,195 pa at 31 December 2011 to $189,555 pa at 31 December 2012 and the transfer value increased from $2,503,000 at 31 December 2011 to $2,649,000 at 31 December 2012.
The transfer value of accrued pension for RH Arnold reflects the benefits provided by the US scheme together with a US valuation of these benefits and is therefore not directly comparable with the transfer values for directors in the UK scheme.
