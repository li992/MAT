Remuneration policy The Board believes that the remuneration packages of the executive directors should encourage them to drive long-term shareholder value.
The market, particularly in the US, is very competitive for high quality talent.
When setting remuneration to attract and retain talent, the Board takes account of the external market and Group and individual performance.
It is our intention to reward success.
The policy is for a significant proportion ofexecutive directors total remuneration to be capable of being earned from variable, performance-based incentives, through annual bonuses and share-based incentives.
The objective of this policy is to provide rewards and incentives for success.
More than half of an executive directors potential remuneration is variable and can only be earned by good corporate performance.
The Boards policy in relation to non-executive directors continues to be to pay fees that are competitive with the fees paid by comparable quoted companies.
Non-executive directors fees are determined by the Board as a whole within the limits set out in the Companys Articles of Association.
Non-executive directors are not eligible for performance bonuses or pension contributions and do not participate in the equity incentive plans, save in respect of Allan Leightons Appointment Share Award which was a one-off exception to the policy.
