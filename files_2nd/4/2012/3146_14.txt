For the Chairman a maximum annual bonus opportunity is 175% and for other executive director, whose performance criteria are strongly linked to the completion of Stage 4, a multi-year project, no annual bonus opportunity has been xed.
Share Ownership Requirement To encourage ownership of shares Although the Company has no formal and thereby create a link of interest policy, executive directors are encouraged between shareholder and executive over time, to acquire shares of a value of not less than 100% of their base salary.
This is consistent with the market practice for the FTSE 250.
Executive directors already exceed this requirement.
Long Term Incentive To link an executives interest to the The current intention is to make no longer term share performance further awards under the loan funded schemes.
For management, but not directors, the Company has introduced a deferred bonus scheme as part of the annual bonus.
The Company can require up to 100% of a bonus to be deferred into shares.
Such shares will then be released as to a third at the end of each of 12, 24 and 36 month period.
For the executive directors the Committee is of the view, following the review, that the existing shareholdings of the directors already create sufficient union of interest between executives and shareholders.
