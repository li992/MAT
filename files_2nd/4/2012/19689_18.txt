81 St. Modwen Properties PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Directors Remuneration Report lESlEy JaMES Chairman of the Remuneration Committee ChairManS SuMMary StatEMEnt I am pleased to present the Report on Directors Remuneration.
This sets out the remuneration paid to the directors in the financial year th ended 30 November 2012 and the policy for the forthcoming year.
The focus on executive pay over the last 12 months has increased to unprecedented levels.
In the first half of 2012 the UK Governments Department for Business Innovation & Skills BIS responded by announcing a far reaching programme of legislative reforms in remuneration practice.
These proposals change the way that we will be required to report to you on directors remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee the Committee endorses, in principle, the BIS proposals and has agreed to adopt some of the key requirements early in advance of the formal regulations coming into force.
The report therefore follows a new structure this year and includes this summary statement which the Committee hopes you will find helpful and informative.
Despite the challenging economic climate, 2011 12 has been another strong year for St. Modwen.
As described in the Business th Review, the results for the year ended 30 November 2012 demonstrate the strength of the Company and the robustness ofits strategy and business model.
Our growing exposure to residential development and our ability to take advantage of the resilient market in London and the South East has helped us to deliver an increase in shareholders equity net asset value NAV per share of 8% over the year to251p and a 10% increase in dividends to 3.63p per share.
These results would not have been possible without the considerable and consistent efforts of each employee, including the executive directors.
Remuneration in 2011 12 In 2011 12, the executive directors had the opportunity to earn a bonus of up to 125% of base salary.
As a result of strong individual performance, aligned with corporate performance that was ahead of budget and market expectations, the annual bonus pay out for 2011 12 awarded to each executive director was 112.5% of base salary 2010 11: between 112.5% and 118.75%.
st st During the year the 2009 Performance Share Plan awards measuring performance from 1 June 2009 to 31 May 2012 vested at 45.64%.
50% of this award was based on absolute growth in NAV per share, with a requirement of 20% growth over the three year period to deliver full vesting.
Over the relevant period growth was 18.25% resulting in the 45.64% vesting level.
The remainder of the award was dependent on the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR performance relative to the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index.
Unfortunately, the Company underperformed the Index over this period resulting in this portion of the award lapsing.
th The performance period for the 2010 Performance Share Plan awards ended on 30 November 2012.
These awards were subject to the same performance conditions as the 2009 awards.
To reflect the absolute growth in NAV per share of 27.53% over the three year performance period, awards will vest at 45.89%.
The portion of the award dependent on TSR performance relative to FTSE 350 Real Estate Index will lapse as the Company underperformed the Index over the period.
Remuneration policy for 2012 13 We believe that the remuneration policy and incentive framework currently in place is working well to support the Companys strategy in the current economic environment, is helping to retain and motivate our management team and is helping to drive strong returns for our shareholders.
We were pleased to see the vast majority of our shareholders supporting our Directors Remuneration Report at the 2012 AGM 99% in favour and the Committee is proposing that the remuneration policy and structure of the incentive arrangements for 2012 13 remain largely unchanged from those applied in 2011 12.
We look forward to hearing your views in the future and hope to receive your continued support at the AGM.
On behalf of the Board Lesley James Chairman of the Remuneration Committee th 4 February 2013 Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Business Review Overview 82 St. Modwen Properties PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Directors Remuneration Report continued ForMat oF rEportinG The Directors Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 the 2006 Act, Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 Statutory Instrument 2008 410 the Regulations, the Listing Rules and Disclosure Rules of the Financial Services Authority, the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code June 2010 and best practice guidelines.
Furthermore, in response to the UK Governments proposed legislation regarding the reporting of directors remuneration and changes to associated shareholder voting expected to come into force in October 2013 the Proposed Regulations, the Directors Remuneration Report has been split into two distinct sections: a Policy Report from page 82 and an Implementation Report from page 88.
The Policy Report provides details of the Companys forward looking remuneration policy for 2012 2013 and the Implementation Report describes how the 2011 12 remuneration policy was implemented during the course of the year.
The entire th Directors Remuneration Report will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at the AGM on 27 March 2013.
It is anticipated that, in line with the Proposed Regulations, the Policy Report will be put to a binding shareholder vote and the Implementation Report to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM.
The Regulations require the auditor to report to the Companys shareholders on the audited information within the Directors Remuneration Report and to state whether, in their opinion, those parts of the report have been prepared in accordance with the 2006 Act.
The auditors opinion is set out on page 99 and the sections of the report which have been subject to audit are clearly marked.
rEMunEration poliCy rEport st This part of the Directors Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policy for the Company with effect from 1 December 2012.
How the Remuneration Committee sets the remuneration policy The primary objective of the Companys remuneration policy is to attract, retain and motivate high calibre senior executives through competitive pay arrangements which are also in the best interests of shareholders.
These include performance-related elements with demanding targets in order to align the interests of directors and shareholders and to reward appropriately financial success.
The policy is structured so as to be aligned with key strategic priorities and to be consistent with a Board-approved level of business risk.
In setting the remuneration policy for the executive directors, the Committee takes into consideration the remuneration practices found in other UK companies with similar market capitalisation and operating in the same sector.
It also ensures that the remuneration arrangements for executive directors are compatible with those for other senior executives.
The overall aim is that executive directors remuneration should be market competitive relative to comparable companies with a significant element being performance related and, therefore, only payable if stretching short-term and long-term performance targets are achieved.
The Committee considers shareholder feedback received in relation to the Directors Remuneration Report each year at a meeting immediately following the AGM.
This feedback, plus any additional feedback received from time to time, is then considered as part of the Committees annual review of remuneration policy.

However, the Committee retains flexibility to offer remuneration on appointment outside the above policy in order to facilitate the recruitment of high calibre individuals.
Further detail on the elements of the remuneration policy can be found on pages 85 to 87.
On the basis of expected value of long-term incentives and achievement of on-target performance against objectives for the annual bonus arrangements, the total annual remuneration excluding pension benefits of each executive director under the remuneration policy is weighted between performance-related and non performance-related elements, valued as at the time of award of long-term incentives, at around 60% and 40% respectively.
85 St. Modwen Properties PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Remuneration policy for executive directors in detail Base salary Base salaries are reviewed though not necessarily increased annually having regard to market conditions, benchmark data and other relevant factors such as pay increases for the Groups employees, internal relativities and individual performance.
The Committee is mindful of institutional investors concerns on the upward ratchet of base salaries and does not consider benchmark data in isolation.
In line with the average salary increase awarded to the Groups employees, the executive directors received an annual salary increase of st 2.5% with effect from 1 December 2012.
Base salaries payable from this date are as follows: Executive director Salary Bill oliver 456,978 Steve Burke 301,522 Michael Dunn 274,495 Annual bonus In 2012 13, the executive directors will have the opportunity to earn a bonus of up to 125% of base salary.
The structure of the bonus plan is consistent with the structure operated in the previous year: Bonus payments determined by achievement of a mixture of corporate measures and personal targets.
The corporate measures selected are consistent with and complement the budget and strategic plan for the year.
NAV performance has the largest weighting amongst the corporate measures and other measures include profit, dividend growth and gearing levels.
Notwithstanding performance against individual targets, the Committee will retain an overriding discretion to ensure that overall bonus payouts reflect its view of corporate performance during the year.
Payment of the bonus will be conditional upon the executive directors undertaking to invest at least one third of the bonus received, after payment of income tax and national insurance, in the Companys shares and to retain those shares for a minimum period of three years.
All bonuses paid are subject to potential clawback, at the Committees discretion, for a period of four years following the end of the bonus year in the event that a later restatement of accounts occurs or there is other discovered misconduct which, if known at the time, would have meant that a lower or nil bonus would have been paid.
Payment of bonus will not be dependent on achievement of any single target in isolation, since the measures and targets are all of key importance to the short and longer-term health of the Company and the Committee does not wish to distort behaviour by focusing on a single element.
The executive directors performance will be assessed individually by the Committee against the measures and targets, relying on audited information where appropriate, and having regard to the value which has been created for shareholders.
Long-term incentives Performance Share Plan PSP In 2012 13, PSP awards granted to the executive directors will be over shares worth 125% of salary.
Awards are subject wholly to TSR-related performance targets measured over three financial years, with 50% of the award based on relative performance and 50% based on absolute growth.
The Committee believes that this combination provides strong alignment with the interests of shareholders and complements the focus on operational performance measures in the annual bonus plan.
In respect of absolute TSR performance, TSR growth over the three year performance period of 20% will earn 12.5% of the shares awarded and growth of 50% will earn 50% of the shares awarded, with straight line vesting between these points.
For relative TSR performance, TSR equal to the FTSE All-Share Real Estate Investment & Services Index over the three year performance period will earn 12.5% of the shares awarded and TSR of 120% of the Index will earn 50% of the shares awarded, with straight line vesting between these points.
In calculating TSR, a three month average is used at both the start and the end of the performance period to ensure that the calculation is not impacted by potential volatility arising from day-to-day share price fluctuations.
The TSR data and St. Modwens relative positioning is obtained from JP Morgan Cazenove to ensure that performance is independently verified.
Additional Information Financial Statements Corporate Governance Business Review Overview 86 St. Modwen Properties PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Directors Remuneration Report continued Notwithstanding TSR performance, the Committee also has to be satisfied that two underpin conditions are met before permitting the 2012 13 PSP awards to vest, namely: that the extent of vesting under the TSR conditions is appropriate given the general financial performance of the Company over the performance period: and if no dividend has been paid on the last normal dividend date prior to the vesting date or if the Committee believes that no dividend will be paid in respect of the year in which the award vests, the award will not vest at that time and vesting will be delayed subject to continued employment until dividend payments are resumed.
The Committee reviews these performance conditions when determining PSP awards in each year, in order to reflect changes intheoutlook for the sector and the Company, and to ensure that targets remain challenging.
st The PSP includes a clawback facility whereby the value calculated at vesting of any PSP awards that were granted after 1 January 2012 may be reduced where the value of future annual bonus cash payments are insufficient to recover fully any clawback applicable tothe annual bonus arrangements or, at the Committees discretion, within a period of four years following the end of the performance period for an award, there is material misstatement of the accounts or an error in the calculation of any performance condition which resulted in excess PSP awards vesting to the participant or there is other misconduct which, if known at the time, would have meant that a lower or nil award would have vested.
During the year the Company received approval from HM Revenue & Customs HMRC to structure the PSP so as to enable participants to benefit from UK tax efficiencies under HMRC agreed share schemes legislation.
Accordingly awards may be structured as Approved Performance Share Plan awards and comprise an HMRC approved option in respect of the first 30,000 worth of an award and a PSP award for amounts that exceed this limit.
The number of shares that may be delivered under the PSP award will be adjusted at vesting exercise to ensure that the total pre-tax value delivered to participants remains unchanged.
Executive directors may also participate in the Companys Saving-Related Share Option Scheme on the same terms as all otheremployees.
Pension Retirement benefits take the form of a supplementary allowance, expressed as a percentage of basic salary, which may be delivered by means of either a cash payment or as a payment to the defined contribution section of the Companys pension scheme.
As a result of historical contractual commitments, retirement benefits for Steve Burke are also delivered by membership of the defined benefit section of the Companys pension scheme.
Other benefits Benefits in kind comprise mainly the provision of company car, fuel and health insurance.
The level of benefits provided to executive directors is consistent with that provided by other UK listed companies.
These benefits do not form part of pensionable earnings.
Share ownership guidelines In order to reinforce the alignment of their interests with those of shareholders, executive directors are expected to build up a shareholding in the Company over a five year period worth at least 100% of their base salary.
Service contracts All executive directors have service contracts of no fixed term, with notice periods of 12 months from the Company and either 12 months Michael Dunn or six months Bill Oliver and Steve Burke from the individual.
Bill Oliver and Steve Burkes service contracts reflect terms agreed on their appointment to the Company.
For all future recruits notice periods will be 12 months from both the Company and the individual.
No executive director has any contractual rights to compensation on loss of office apart from payment in lieu of notice of salary and benefits, where appropriate.
Rights to outstanding incentive awards would be dealt with by the Committee in accordance with the rules of the relevant scheme.
Unless specifically approved by the Board, executive directors are not permitted to hold external non-executive directorships.
th st The dates of the executive directors service contracts are as follows: Bill Oliver 24 January 2000: Steve Burke 1 January 2006: th Michael Dunn 9 November 2010.
87 St. Modwen Properties PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Remuneration policy for Chairman and non-executive directors The remuneration policy for the Chairman and the other non-executive directors is to pay fees in line with those paid by other UK listed companies of comparable size.

Fees The Chairmans fee is determined by the Board on the recommendation of the Committee and the fees of the non-executive directors are determined by the Board following recommendations by the executive directors.
Neither the Chairman nor the other non-executive directors participate in the annual bonus or long-term incentive arrangements or in the pension scheme, nor do they receive benefits inkind.
A review of the non-executive directors fees was undertaken by the Board in 2012 save in relation to the Chairmans fee which was approved by the Board in 2010 on his appointment.
Following the review, the standard base fee for 2012 13 is 40,000 with additional fees of 9,000 being paid to the Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and 6,000 to the Senior Independent Director.
