Remuneration report The Board presents the remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2012.
Remuneration committee chairmans statement The 2012 AGM season was marked by a few high-profile cases of shareholder unhappiness at a perceived disconnect in some companies between pay and performance, which was branded the shareholder spring in the media.
I am pleased to report that our 2011 remuneration report was well received by shareholders in May 2012 with 99.7% approval.
2012 was a year of little change to remuneration at main Board level.
The committee has however continued to review the structure of directors remuneration packages, and in particular, the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP where the identification of suitable performance targets remains a challenge.
Rathbones has few listed peers, which makes peer comparison difficult, whilst its performance is closely linked to stock market performance, which is a factor management are unable to influence.
During 2012, the committee reviewed changes to the new business incentive arrangements which reward investment managers for the introduction of new clients.
Awards are deferred, linked to revenue earned and are subject to clawback in certain circumstances for example, if a client account is closed within three years.
The Board considers that the Companys remuneration arrangements are consistent with the risk profile of the business.
David Harrel Chairman of the remuneration committee Remuneration committee The Board has delegated the determination of executive director remuneration to the remuneration committee the committee.
The current members of the committee are the independent non-executive directors David Harrel chairman, Kate Avery, Caroline Burton, Oliver Corbett and Kathryn Matthews.
Mark Nicholls was considered to be independent on his appointment as Company chairman and is also a member of the committee.
Caroline Burton chaired the committee until 1 November 2012.
The chief executive attends meetings at the invitation of the committee.
Neither the chairman nor chief executive is present when their own remuneration is discussed.
The committee met on seven occasions in 2012 2011: six.
Details of attendance at meetings are shown on page 51.
Remuneration policy for executive directors The overall aim of the remuneration policy is to support our longer term business objectives and promote behaviours which support value creation for shareholders, whilst at the same time providing a competitive remuneration package which is sufficient to attract and retain directors of the quality needed to manage and develop the Company successfully.
Total reward is designed to include a balance of fixed and variable pay with a high level of deferral.
External data is used to validate rather than to benchmark total reward.
The current remuneration package for an executive director has four main elements: basic salary and benefits, profit share, equity incentives and pension.
The various elements are designed to: align the interests of the directors with shareholders in generating long term shareholder value.
Achieved through participation in: an LTIP with a relative total shareholder return performance condition: and profit share deferrals invested in Rathbone Brothers Plc shares.
align remuneration practices with effective risk management.
Achieved by the use of: profit share based on profit before tax rather than an income or contribution based bonus: and deferred awards LTIP and partial deferral of profit share.
The committee also ensures that up-to-date, best practice contracts are adopted.
The committee is satisfied that the incentive structure does not increase environmental, social and governance risks by inadvertently encouraging irresponsible behaviour.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2012 Report and accounts 2012 5353 Remuneration report continued The elements of remuneration packages are summarised below.
Total executive director reward for 2012 Table 1.
P D G Chavasses paid salary reflects a short sabbatical taken during the year.
His full year salary was 249,000 2 This is the cash equivalent of deferred share awards at the date of the award.
Deferred share awards vest after three years 3 Benefits include medical insurance and the value of SIP free shares and matching shares 4 During the year, retirement benefits accrued under money purchase schemes in relation to three directors 2011: three Basic salary and benefits An executive directors basic salary is determined by the committee.
Any change is implemented on 1 January of each year or when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the committee considers salaries throughout the Group as a whole and the information obtained on comparable companies in the financial sector as provided by the advisers to the committee.
The views of the chairman and chief executive are also taken into consideration when considering the salaries of other directors.
Salaries were increased by 3.0% on 1 January 2012 in line with the increase given to most employees.
The only exception was Richard Lanyon whose salary was unchanged in view of his retirement from the Board on 10 May 2012.
Following the Board restructuring on 1 January 2013, the salaries of the executive directors Andy Pomfret, Paul Chavasse and Paul Stockton were increased by 2.5%.
In addition Rathbones provides a range of benefits including life, private medical and permanent health insurance.
54 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2012 Remuneration report continued Profit share The current profit sharing scheme was introduced on 1 January 2010.
Awards to all executive directors are made from a pool of profits of 3% 5% of Group profit before tax with an expectation that in a normal year the percentage is around 4%.
An additional profit share payment of 61,000 was made to Richard Smeeton in 2011 as a result of his giving up legacy entitlements.
The committee has the discretion to adjust the calculation of Group profit before tax for the purposes of the profit share to ensure that it appropriately reflects underlying business performance.
No adjustments were made in 2012 or 2011.
Awards to individual directors are determined by the committee following recommendations by the chief executive and chairman, having due regard of the performance of the director, the results of the business for which the director has responsibility where relevant and market data where this is available.
Awards are capped at 200% of basic salary.
Awards are made in both cash one third and deferred shares two thirds with interim, on account awards payable during the financial year, and final awards made shortly after the announcement of the Groups results for the year.
The proportion paid in cash may be increased at the request of the participant but this will cause the overall award to be reduced such that the total will be reduced by a maximum of one third if 100% of the award is taken in cash.
No executive directors chose to increase the cash element of the award in 2012 or 2011.
No performance criteria are attached to the deferred share awards.
The committees view is that share price movements reflect the performance of the business and therefore further performance conditions are not necessary.
Half of deferred share awards will lapse if a director is a bad leaver.
Deferred shares attract the monetary equivalent of declared dividends over the deferral period from the end of the financial year of the award.
Awards vest on the third anniversary of the financial year end at which point a nil paid option will be granted over the deferred share award including a further number of additional shares representing the value of dividends received and reinvested in relation to vested shares.
This option may be exercised within seven years of grant.
The final deferred share award for 2011 was made on 20 March 2012.
An interim deferred share award for 2012 was made on 25 September 2012.
Awards were also made following dividend payments in May and October.
The final award for 2012 will be made following the announcement of the 2012 results on 20 February 2013.
Awards are limited to 75% of salary other than in exceptional circumstances when the committee considers that a 100% limit would be appropriate.
At the end of each plan cycle, the Companys performance is assessed against the performance targets for that cycle.
The extent to which the targets have been achieved determines the actual number of shares if any attributable to each participant.
A new LTIP was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 11 May 2011 and came into effect for the 2011 13 plan cycle.
The performance conditions for the earlier plan cycles are as follows: Performance targets 2009 11 and 2010 12 plan cycles Table 3.
LTIP performance targets 2009 11 and 2010 12 plan cycles % of award a Total Shareholder Return TSR over the plan cycle 50% b Earnings per Share EPS growth over the plan cycle 50% a TSR TSR ranking relative to the constituents of the FTSE All Share Index Vesting of award TSR element Below the 50th percentile 0% Between the 50th and 75th percentiles Straight line increase At or above the 75th percentile 100% b EPS EPS growth over the plan cycle Vesting of award EPS element Less than 15% 0% 15% 25% Over 15% but less than 37.5% Straight line increase 37.5% or over 100% 2011 13 and future plan cycles A combination of two performance targets will continue to be used.
Whilst the EPS performance target will continue unchanged, changes to the TSR performance target were approved as detailed below in table 4.
LTIP TSR performance target 2011 13 and future plan cycles TSR over the plan cycle 50% Rathbone Brothers Plc Total Return Index TRI relative to the FTSE All Share TRI Vesting of award TSR element Below the percentage change in the FTSE All Share TRI 0% Equal to the percentage change in the FTSE All Share TRI 25% Greater than the percentage change in the FTSE All Share TRI by 0.1% to 9.9% Straight line increase Equal to or greater than the percentage change in the FTSE All Share TRI plus 10% 100% As mentioned earlier in this report, the LTIP performance targets are under review.
Whilst they have limitations, the current combination of EPS and TSR are commonly used and ensure not only a focus on a key financial driver via EPS, but also alignment of shareholder interests via TSR, reflecting both the change in the share price and dividends, assuming that they are reinvested.
If a participant ceases to be employed for good leaver reasons, the award shall normally continue in effect and vest on the original date set for vesting, but with the award based on the performance during the plan cycle as a whole, reduced pro rata to reflect the fact that the participant was not an executive director for the whole plan cycle.
In all other circumstances, any provisional award would lapse on cessation of employment.
Vesting of historic awards 2009 11 plan cycle The TSR for the three year period was 46.2%, which ranked the Company at the 40th percentile relative to the constituents of the FTSE All Share Index.
No awards were therefore made from either element of the plan.
56 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2012 Remuneration report continued Equity incentives continued 2010 12 plan cycle The TSR for the three year period was 84.0%, which ranked the Company at the 80th percentile relative to the constituents of the FTSE All Share Index resulting in an award of 100% of the TSR element of the plan.
Continuing basic EPS increased from 46.87p in 2009 to 67.00p in 2012, an increase of 43.0%, resulting in awards of 100% of the EPS element of the plan.
The market value of the Rathbone Brothers Plc shares at the date of the awards was 8.23 compared with a market value at 31 December 2012 of 12.99.
2011 13 and 2012 14 plan cycles Details of the awards for the 2011 13 and 2012 14 plan cycles are set out in table 5.
The market value of Rathbone Brothers Plc shares at the date of awards for the 2011 13 plan was 10.825 and for the 2012 14 plan was 12.61.
Were the maximum possible awards to be made in shares to current and former directors as shown in table 5, 214,683 ordinary shares 2011: 257,231 would be awarded, representing 0.5% 2011: 0.6% of the issued share capital at 31 December 2012, excluding shares held in treasury.
In practice, awards under the LTIP are intended to be satisfied using market purchased shares.
Expected actual awards are difficult to predict with any accuracy.
This allows all employees to purchase shares in the Company and currently these are matched on a one-for-one basis by the Company.
Performance-related SIP shares are also offered to employees if there is year on year EPS growth over the rate of inflation.
SIP shares are included in the table of directors share interests on page 46.
Executive directors may also participate in the Rathbones SAYE scheme on the same terms as all other employees.
Details of grants to directors are shown in table 6.
It is anticipated that a further grant will be made in March 2013 following the announcement of the 2012 results.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2012 57 Remuneration report continued Equity incentives continued Table 6.
While it remains best practice to do so, treasury shares will be treated as newly issued shares for the purposes of dilution calculations.
The Company satisfies the various equity-based schemes it operates using a combination of market purchased, newly issued and treasury shares.
Total shareholder return TSR Chart 1 shows the Companys TSR against the FTSE All Share Index.
TSR is calculated assuming that dividends are reinvested on receipt.
The FTSE All Share Index has been selected as a comparator as it is a suitably broad market index and has been used as a performance comparator for LTIP plan cycles since 2005 07.

Prior to 1 April 2006, the accrual rate was 1 60th for each year of membership.
With effect from 1 April 2006, employees were given the choice of either remaining on a 1 60th accrual rate but increasing their contribution rate from 5% to 6.5% at 1 April 2006 and to 8% from 1 January 2008 or switching to a 1 70th accrual rate for future pensionable service but continuing to contribute at 5%.
With effect from 1 July 2009, future service benefits are based on career average revalued earnings CARE with a normal retirement age of 65 rather than 60.
Details of the Companys contributions are set out in note 26 to the consolidated financial statements.
Since 1 April 2002, new employees have been offered membership of a Group defined contribution plan, established with Scottish Widows.
In the case of certain directors and senior staff, the Group contributes to their personal pension arrangements.
58 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2012 Percentage Remuneration report continued Pension arrangements continued Paul Chavasse, Andrew Morris and Richard Smeeton are members of the Rathbone 1987 Pension Scheme.
Richard Lanyon transferred out of this scheme on 15 March 2011 and has since been paid 10% of salary in lieu of pension scheme contributions.
Ian Buckley, Richard Lanyon, Andy Pomfret and Paul Stockton participate in the scheme for death in service benefits only.
Richard Smeeton is also a member of the Laurence Keen Retirement Benefits Scheme for service prior to 1 October 1999.
Ian Buckley and Andy Pomfret have arrangements under self-invested personal pension schemes whilst Paul Stockton is a member of the Group defined contribution plan.
The changes in pension entitlements arising in the year, required to be disclosed by the UK Listing Authority, are shown in table 7.
There have been no changes in the terms of directors pension entitlements during the year.
There are no unfunded pension promises or similar arrangements for directors.
The increases in transfer values are mainly due to changed assumptions for inflation, post-retirement discount rates and future mortality.

The Increase in transfer value less directors contributions figures are therefore negative There is no undertaking or expectation for any other pension benefit to be arranged for any director by the Company.
Service contracts for executive directors The Company has service contracts with its executive directors which were reviewed and modernised in 2011.
Following his appointment as head of investment management, Paul Chavasses notice period was increased from 6 to 12 months.
It is Company policy that such contracts should not normally contain notice periods of more than 12 months.
Details of the notice periods in the contracts of employment of executive directors serving during the year are as shown in table 8.
Executive directors service contracts Executive Director Date of contract Notice period I M Buckley 24 October 2011 6 months P D G Chavasse 15 November 2011 12 months A T Morris 26 October 2011 6 months A D Pomfret 13 October 2011 12 months R I Smeeton 9 December 2011 6 months R P Stockton 14 October 2011 6 months There are no provisions within the contracts to provide automatic payments in excess of payment in lieu of notice upon termination by the Company and no pre-determined compensation package exists in the event of termination of employment.
Payment in lieu of notice would include basic salary, pension contributions and benefits.
There are no provisions for the payment of liquidated damages or any statements in respect of the duty of mitigation.
Compensation payments will be determined on a case by case basis in the light of current market practice.
Compensation will include loss of salary and other contractual benefits but mitigation will be applied where appropriate.
In the event of entering into a termination agreement, the Board will take steps to impose a legal obligation on the director to mitigate any loss incurred.
There are no clauses in contracts amending employment terms and conditions on a change of control.
Executive directors contracts of service, which include details of remuneration, will be available for inspection at the AGM.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2012 59 Remuneration report continued Shareholdings New executive directors are encouraged to build up and maintain a shareholding at least equivalent to the value of one years basic salary within five years of taking up their appointment.
External appointments Executive directors are encouraged to take on external appointments as non-executive directors, but are discouraged from holding more than one other position in a quoted company given the time commitment.
