The Committee continues to review external developments and to ensure the direct link between business performance and reward is maintained.
REPORT In 2012, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills held a consultation on Directors pay with the aim of strengthening the link between Directors pay and performance and increasing transparency in this area.
Although the resulting regulations are only applicable from the 2013 reporting year onwards and we expect the format of the 2013 remuneration report to change signicantly, this report complies with a number of those regulations.

The Committee retains discretion in structuring Executive Directors contracts where appropriate.
Non-Executive Directors The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment, which set out their duties and anticipated time commitment to the Company.
They are required to disclose any changes to their other significant commitments to the Board.
The Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an initial term of three years.
The appointments may be extended for further three-year periods on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee and subject to the Boards agreement.
The Non-Executive Directors letters of appointment contain a three-month notice period and the Chairmans contains a six-month notice period.
Further details are set out in Chart 4 below.
The fees payable to Non-Executive Directors are set by reference to those paid by other companies and the time commitment and responsibilities of the role.

POLICY ON TERMINATION PAYMENTS The Company retains the right to terminate the service contract of any Executive Director subject to contractually agreed payments in lieu of notice which are limited to annual salary plus any specified benets.
Payments are normally phased over the 12-month notice period, based on the principle of a Directors duty to seek alternative employment and thereby mitigate their loss.
In determining compensation, the Committee will take into account best practice, the provisions of the Code and will take legal advice on the Companys liability to pay compensation.
POLICY ON EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS With the support of the Chairman and Chief Executive, the Executive Directors are normally only permitted to take one non-executive directorship outside the Group, as these roles can broaden the experience brought to the Board.
Such appointments require Board approval and the time commitment the appointment will require is taken into consideration.
Executive Directors may retain fees for external appointments.
