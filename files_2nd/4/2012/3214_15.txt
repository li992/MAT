Directors Report Business Review Directors Report Governance Financial Statements Directors Report Appendix Shareholder Information Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 65 Governance Remuneration Report i Retirement benefits Centrica Pension Plan CPP The CPP is a funded, HMRC-registered, final salary, contributory occupational pension scheme.
Members contributions are payable at the rate of 6% of pensionable earnings.
Contributions made by the Executive Directors who are also members of the Centrica Unfunded Pension Scheme CUPS are payable at the rate of 6% of their total pensionable earnings above the scheme earnings cap.
No discretionary practices are taken into account in calculating transfer values.
Centrica Unfunded Pension Scheme CUPS All registered scheme benefits are subject to HMRC guidelines and the Lifetime Allowance.
The CUPS defined benefit section provides any additional benefits in excess of the maximum amount that could be provided through the CPP on the members uncapped pensionable earnings.
Pensionable pay increases are limited to pay reviews up to a maximum of 2% per annum with effect from 1 March 2012 for members of the CPP and CUPS defined benefit section.
The CUPS defined benefit section was closed to new members in October 2002.
The CUPS defined contribution section provides benefits for individuals not eligible to join the CUPS defined benefit section and for whom registered scheme benefits are expected to exceed the Lifetime Allowance.
The CUPS defined contribution section is offered as a direct alternative to a cash salary supplement.
CUPS is unfunded but the benefits are secured by a charge over certain Centrica assets.
An appropriate provision in respect of the accrued value of these benefits has been made in the Companys balance sheet.
ii Economic profit EP EP is adjusted operating profit after share of joint venture interest less a tax charge based on the tax rate relevant to the different business segments and after deduction of a capital charge.
The capital charge is calculated as capital employed multiplied by the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
Where appropriate, expenditure on assets and related costs that are not yet in use pre-productive capital is excluded from capital employed.
The absolute target range has been set in the context of increasing capital intensity and a significantly higher taxation environment for upstream profits driven by UK policy and geographic expansion.
iii Earnings per share EPS EPS is the Companys fully diluted earnings per share adjusted for exceptional items and certain re-measurements.
iv Non-financial KPIs The non-financial KPI dashboard is designed to reward sustained high performance over the entire three-year performance period.
The measures are: lost time injury frequency rate: process safety: British Gas Net Promoter Score NPS : Direct Energy NPS: and employee engagement.
For each measure three performance zones have been established, represented by the following indicators: High performance zone Median performance zone Low performance zone The detail for 2012 is shown on page 72. v Total shareholder return TSR TSR is calculated as the annualised percentage increase in the Net Return Index of the Company above the Net Return Index of the FTSE 100 over the three-year performance period.
The Net Return Index reflects movements in the share price and dividends re-invested over the performance period.
In the opinion of the Directors, the FTSE 100 is the most appropriate index against which the TSR of Centrica plc should be measured as it is an index of similar sized companies.

The accrued pension is that which would be paid annually on retirement at age 62, based on eligible service to, and pensionable earnings at, 31 December 2012.
The pension accrual rates for 2012 for Phil Bentley and Chris Weston were 2.65% and 2.22% of final pensionable earnings respectively.
The increase in accrued pension has been adjusted to exclude inflation by revaluing the accrued pension as at 31 December 2011 by the rate of inflation 2.6% and deducting this from the accrued pension as at 31 December 2012.
The rate of inflation used for pension increases under both the CPP and CUPS was 2.6%, the annual rate to 30 September 2012 the rate of inflation used for pensions in deferment from 1 January 2011 reference the Consumer prices index with a cap of 2.5% for pension accrued after 29 February 2012.
As previously reported, under the terms of his contract of employment, the transfer value calculations in respect of Phil Bentley as at 31 December 2012 reflect his entitlement to retire on an unreduced pension at age 58 which vested on 14 January 2012 the transfer value as at 31 December 2011 is based on an assumed retirement age of 62.
If the pension at 31 December 2012 was provided on the basis of a Normal Retirement Age of 62 the transfer value would amount to 4,254,000, the difference in transfer value less contributions would amount to 574,000, and the transfer value of the increase in accrued pension excluding pension contributions would amount to 165,900.

Termination arrangements for Phil Bentley As announced on 27 February 2013, Phil Bentley will be stepping down from his role as Managing Director of British Gas, and therefore as an Executive Director, on 30 June 2013 and he will leave the Company by 31 December 2013.
Phil Bentley will continue as Managing Director of British Gas until 30 June 2013 and therefore will stand for re-election as a Director at the Companys Annual General meeting in May for the interim period.
From 1 July to 31 December 2013 he will cease to be a Director but will remain as an employee.
Phil Bentley will be paid according to his current contractual arrangements including pro rata performance bonus awards through to the expiry of his accrued vacation on 31 July 2013.
Thereafter he will be paid a basic salary and all bonus earning opportunities will cease.
He will not participate in any new long-term awards to be made in 2013.
In the event that he takes up new full time employment after the handover he may be released from his employment, in which case all remuneration will cease at that time.
On completion of his employment he will have been deemed to have worked his contractual notice period and no lump sum will be paid in lieu of notice.
Phil Bentley is classified as a good leaver and is therefore entitled to all accrued allocations that have been earned during his employment under the long term incentive plans in the normal way.
The value of the long term incentive plans will be time apportioned and will remain subject to the performance conditions and therefore the actual number of shares which will vest will be lower than the maximum potential.
The actual value of the awards will be determined at the end of the performance measurement period.
Phil Bentley will leave with a pension entitlement consistent with his contractual rights which reflects his length of service and includes accrued rights transferred in from his prior employment commencing in September 1980.
Under the pension arrangements he is entitled to retire at age 55 on a reduced pension, or at age 58 on an unreduced pension.
Based on the contributions at 31 December 2012 and assuming he retires at age 58, he will become entitled to an annual pension from the Company of approximately 226,200.
