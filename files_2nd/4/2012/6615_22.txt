The remuneration is the difference between the amount the Executive Director is required to pay to buy the shares or ADS and the total value of the shares or ADS on the vesting date.
If the Executive Director chooses not to exercise the options on the vesting date, any subsequent increase or decrease in the amount realised will be due to movements in the share or ADS price between the vesting date and the date of exercise.
This increase or decrease in value is the result of an investment decision by the Executive Director and, as such, is not recorded as remuneration.

132 GSK Annual Report 2012 Remuneration report Deferred Annual Bonus Plan awards Deferred Annual Bonus Plan DABP awards in the form of nil-cost options are made to Executive Directors annually based on the individuals voluntary bonus deferral election.
The company will match shares or ADS up to one-for-one depending on the companys performance during a three year performance period.
Once an award vests, the Executive Director may choose to exercise the award at any time up to 10 years from the date of grant.
The amount of remuneration receivable in respect of the matching shares or ADS is calculated using the share or ADS price on the date the relevant DABP award vests.
If the Executive Director chooses not to exercise the nil-cost options on the vesting date, any subsequent increase or decrease in the amount realised will be due to movements in the share or ADS price between the vesting date and the date of exercise.

The Directors hold these awards under the various PSP plans referred to in Note 42 to the financial statements, Employee share schemes.
The amount of remuneration receivable in respect of performance shares is calculated using the share or ADS price on the date the relevant PSP award vests.
The PSP awards made to Sir Andrew Witty in 2012 and 2013 have three year performance periods.
However, the deeds of award specify that 25% of the awards will be subject to a further two year vesting period five years in total.
During this two year period, there are no additional performance criteria and the awards will only lapse if Sir Andrew is dismissed for cause.
The remuneration in respect of these awards will therefore be considered to be realised in full following the determination by the Remuneration Committee of the vesting levels of the initial 75% of the awards i. e. full remuneration will be recognised at the end of the three year performance periods.
These awards are subject to performance criteria relevant to employees below the CET.

The Committee adjusted the comparator group for relative TSR by removing ScheringPlough and Wyeth following their fide-listings during 2009 and revised the vesting schedule accordingly.
From 1 January 2013, Abbott Laboratories separated into two publicly traded companies.
The Committee concluded that neither of these companies was a relevant comparator for performance purposes and that they should be excluded from the TSR comparator group for both outstanding and future awards.
The vesting schedule has been revised accordingly and now comprises GSK and nine other companies.
The revised comparator group is set out on page 115.
Dividends are reinvested on the performance shares or ADS awarded to Executives throughout the performance period and up to the date of the final award.
Under the terms of the PSP, US participants may defer receipt of all or part of their vested awards.
