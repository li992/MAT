In the opinion of the directors, the FTSE100 Index is the most appropriate index against which to measure the Companys TSR, as it is an index of which Old Mutual plc is a member and is located where the Company has its primary listing.

The following are the guiding principles that the Committee has applied during 2012 and intends to apply during 2013: To take account of appropriate benchmarks, while using such comparisons with caution and recognising the risk of an upward ratchet of remuneration levels with no corresponding improvement in performance.
Large UK insurers and members of the UK FTSE100 Index, with particular reference to a subset by market capitalisation, provide the benchmarks for UK-based executive directors To be sensitive in determining, reviewing, monitoring and approving matters under its remit in relation to pay and employment conditions around the Group, where relevant To make a significant percentage of total maximum potential rewards in the form of share-based incentives in order to align the executive directors interests closely with those of shareholders To provide an opportunity for remuneration packages to be in the upper quartile of the comparator group through payments under short-term and long-term incentive schemes if superior performance is delivered To focus attention on the main drivers of shareholder value by linking performance-related remuneration to clearly defined objectives and measurable targets To design remuneration arrangements that will attract, retain and motivate individuals of the exceptional calibre needed to lead the Groups development.
The Committee has regard to risk-related metrics in reviewing and evaluating the executive directors short-term performance and receives and considers a report from the Group Chief Risk Officer.
It also has discretion to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance ESG issues, to the extent relevant, when setting their remuneration.
It ensures regulatory requirements relating to remuneration matters are met and that remuneration policies are consistent with, and promote, effective risk management.
The Committees policy is influenced by the need to be competitive with other international financial services groups, while avoiding any excess.
This includes its approach to setting the fixed elements of remuneration at or below median.
It reviews this policy regularly and continues to consider it to be appropriate.
Following the removal of compulsory retirement ages in the UK, it is the Companys policy to have employment contracts without a specified duration.
Notice periods are between six and twelve months and mitigation is applied to any termination payments that have to be made under contract.
Overview of executive directors remuneration The Committee reviews the structure of the executive directors remuneration packages annually to satisfy itself that the balance between fixed and variable remuneration and short-term and long-term incentives and rewards remains appropriate.
The overall make-up of the remuneration packages for the executive directors is as follows: Element Description Reviewed each January, taking into account market benchmarks and the level of increases awarded to all Group Basic salary employees.
The policy is to pay a benefit allowance and pension contributions to a total value of 35% of basic salary.
Life cover of 1m and disability cover capped at an annual basic salary of 140,000 are also provided.
From 1 April 2013, changes to benefits will come into effect as follows: i Life cover will increase to 1.25m, with an option to increase cover to 6x base salary, subject to the insurers underwriting process and approval: ii disability cover will be capped at an annual basic salary of 120,000 for a maximum of five years: and iii single private health Benefits cover will be provided.
These changes align to updated provisions for all UK employees.
Payable subject to achievement of agreed financial targets and agreed scorecard objectives.
The policy is currently to make a maximum award of 150% of basic salary, half in cash and half deferred in Company restricted Short-term incentives shares for three years.
Deferred awards are subject to claw-back.
The policy is currently a maximum award of 250% of basic salary.
Vesting is subject to agreed performance Long-term incentives targets as set out in the section of this report entitled Long-term incentives.
Awards are subject to claw-back.
The following chart depicts the overall make-up of the executive directors respective remuneration packages for 2013, assuming on-target delivery on short-term incentives and an expected value for long-term incentives: Julian Roberts Philip Broadley 0 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Basic Salary Benefit Allowance Cash Short-Term Incentive Deferred Short-Term Incentive Long-Term Incentive 103 REMUNERATION REPORT continued Executive directors remuneration in 2013 Basic salary and benefits With effect from 1 January 2013, Julian Roberts basic salary was increased by 1.7%, from 870,000 to 885,000, and Philip Broadleys basic salary was increased by 1.7%, from 580,000 to 590,000.
These increases were below the average increases for other employees across the Group, ranging from 2% for staff in the UK to in excess of 5% in South Africa other business units in Europe and US falling within this range, in line with the local market.
Before making the decision on the increases for the executive directors, the Committee considered the salary increases for other employees in the Group as set out above.
Benefits equivalent to 35% of basic salary will continue to be payable either as contributions to agreed benefits or monthly in cash.
Life cover and disability cover will continue to be provided and, with effect from April 2013, single private health cover will be provided.
Pension and flexible investment plans The Company offers a pension plan and has introduced an Employee Flexible Investment Plan, which has been approved for its UK-based employees.
Julian Roberts and Philip Broadley qualify to participate in both plans, but have indicated that they will not be contributing to either during 2013 and that they intend to opt out of pension auto-enrolment when that is introduced later this year.
The Company will therefore not be making contributions to any such schemes on their behalves.
Short-term incentives for 2013 The short-term incentive policy to be applied during the year is described on page 103 above and there have been no changes to the policy from 2012 to 2013.
The respective weightings attached to Group metrics and scorecard objectives, shown as a percentage of basic salary, for the executive directors short-term incentives for 2013, are as follows: Julian Roberts Philip Broadley Elements as % of salary Maximum % Maximum % Group targets EPS in constant currency 56.25 37.50 RoE 56.25 37.50 Group targets sub-total 112.50 75.00 Scorecard objectives 37.50 75.00 Total 150.00 150.00 In addition to Group targets, the executive directors, as with all senior executives, are measured annually against a balanced scorecard.
In his role as Group Finance Director, Philip Broadley is responsible to the Board for all financial matters, including management control over the Group Internal Audit, Compliance and Risk functions.
The scorecard elements of his short-term incentives therefore have a higher weighting than for the Group Chief Executive and line management executives, as there is more emphasis on the financial risk, governance and capital management objectives that are crucial to success in his role.
Long-term incentives for 2013 The Company will continue to align leadership incentives with the delivery of a shared Group vision, strategy and desired culture through agreed values and behaviours.
In South Africa, this will focus on the retail segment as well as successful expansion into sub-Saharan Africa, through the combined efforts of Nedbank, OMSA and Mutual & Federal.
In Old Mutual Wealth, the main strategic opportunities are in delivering cost efficiencies, building an integrated, modern wealth management business in the UK and in selected international markets supported by a successful asset management business and managing the remaining European businesses for value.
In the US, the focus will be on the improvement of USAMs performance in terms of margin and net client cash flow and the effective management of risk and liabilities in Old Mutual Bermuda.
Previously, under OMSIP, part of the executive directors long-term incentives was linked to Rationalising Objectives relating to strategic initiatives to be undertaken by the Group between 2010 and 2012, however, for awards made in 2012 there was no strategic element.
Some shareholders have expressed concern about this and suggested that there should be both a strategic element and a returns measure in the long-term incentive plan.
To address these concerns, we have expanded the core set of measures, as set out below, by adding a strategic element and a return on equity measure.
The outcome of the measures will be subject to the TSR-multiplier mechanism implemented in 2012.
The resultant change from awards granted in 2012 is illustrated below: 2012 Long-term incentives Cumulative AOP multiplied by relative TSR performance Threshold Maximum AOP bn 2.9 3.5 % Vesting 0% |Interpolated| 100% R elative TSR performance calculated 50% against the FTSE100 Index and 50% against the JSE ALSI as set out on page 111.

Annual culture survey results compared to prior years results and to international standards Measured at Group and business level for improved scores where needed or maintenance where levels in 2012 are high.
The Committee will apply its discretion in determining the final outcomes in relation to the 2013 long-term incentives, and in this regard: The Committee will receive a report from the Chief Risk Officer to confirm that the performance of the Group has been achieved within the stated risk appetite.
Where the risk appetite has been breached, the Committee will have discretion to reduce the level of vesting accordingly The Committee will exercise its discretion to make adjustments where there is a significant negative impact on underlying financial performance which is not adequately reflected in AOP results for example, where LTIR adjustments create any inconsistency between AOP and IFRS basic earnings Where the Group undergoes a significant change, such as a large disposal, acquisition or restructuring, the Committee will review the targets to assess whether they need adjusting to reflect the change, or whether they should be replaced altogether.

Summary of 2012 remuneration The following table shows the value of remuneration earned by the executive directors in 2012.
It reflects the gross pre-tax value of salary and benefits earned in the year, based on the short-term incentives to be paid in cash and shares in 2013 in relation to 2012 performance and an estimated market value, on the date of vesting, of any long-term incentive shares or share options where targets were determined to have been met during the year.
This analysis is consistent with the one number determined by BIS as part of its proposals for more detailed future reporting requirements.

Measurement criteria for each initiative were agreed to be: Total value released relative to available benchmark transactions Quality of execution including risk, reputational and other non-financial impacts Amount available to reduce debt from the proceeds of rationalising, in the context of the Companys stated target of 1.5bn of debt reduction.
Over the course of the three-year measurement period, the Company undertook a number of key initiatives to accomplish the goals of restructuring.
The Committee evaluated the following initiatives: 1.
The sale of the US Life business 2.
The attempted sale of Nedbank 3.
The restructuring and proposed initial public offering IPO of the US Asset Management business 4.
The sale of the Nordic business 5.
The restructuring of the Companys LTS business.
In evaluating each initiative against the three criteria, the Committee reviewed relevant quantitative and qualitative information.
The information was presented to the Committee and discussed fully before a decision was made regarding the percentage level of achievement.
The evaluation of each initiative is discussed below: 108 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 How we govern our business How we What Where we have Our risks Financials we do are going performed How we govern our business Sale of the US Life business As disclosed in the 2011 Remuneration Report, the Committee evaluated this initiative as 100% achieved against the three criteria.
Factors considered were the total proceeds of sale, the fact that all proceeds were available to pay down debt, the significant reduction in risk achieved by removing this business from the Group and the fact that this sale was achieved in an environment where virtually no other comparable transactions took place.
Sale of Nedbank In 2010, a preliminary agreement was reached for the sale of Nedbank, but the transaction did not complete.
Therefore, the Committee concluded that 0% was achieved.
Restructuring and proposed IPO of the US Asset Management business A stated objective of management was the restructuring and IPO of the US Asset Management business.
During the period, a number of initiatives related to this objective took place: Sale of OMCAP to Touchstone Investments Sale of Dwight to Goldman Sachs Management buy-outs of Lincluden, 300 North Capital, 2100 Xenon, Larch Lane Advisors, Ashfield Capital Partners and Analytic Investors.
No IPO was launched during the period.
In assessing these actions, the Committee considered the proceeds from these sales and buy-outs, the impact on significantly improved operating profits and margins achieved by removing these businesses, the impacts on net client cash flows into USAM, any ongoing commitments to the businesses sold and the overall readiness of the resulting business for a successful IPO, if and when a decision is made to proceed.
These IPO readiness factors were weighed against the fact that an IPO had neither been attempted nor achieved.
The Committee assessed the totality of these actions against the three criteria and concluded an evaluation of 50% achievement.
Sale of the Nordic business The Company sold its Nordic business to Skandia Liv in March 2012 for 2.1 billion.
This enabled a Special Dividend of 18p per share or its equivalent in other applicable currencies to be paid to the Companys shareholders as well as a material reduction in Group debt.
In evaluating this initiative, the Committee reviewed various factors including the total proceeds of the sale, the fact that the sale enabled a Special Dividend to be paid and a significant reduction to take place in Group debt, the premium value received above standard valuation metrics, the successful completion of the transaction in an environment where few, if any, comparable transactions were achieved and the successful transitional arrangements achieved in separating the businesses.
The Committee evaluated this initiative against the criteria and concluded an evaluation of 100% achievement.
Restructuring of the Companys LTS business Over the period, the Company undertook a number of initiatives to restructure the Companys LTS business to streamline, simplify and align its structure for future profitability.
These initiatives included: Sale of the Finnish business Closure of the Swiss, German and Austrian operations to new business Combining Skandia Investment Group with Old Mutual Asset Managers UK to create Old Mutual Global Investors OMGI Merging of businesses in Retail Europe into Wealth Management, to streamline operations, align legal structures and achieve cost synergies Completion of the Zimbabwe indigenisation programme Elimination of significant inter-company debt between South Africa and the Company and also within the European entities to simplify the Groups financial structure.
The number of different initiatives led the Committee to consider a variety of factors including proceeds from the Finnish sale, the reduction in risk from closing to new business in Europe, the cost synergies achieved through streamlining and alignment under Wealth Management now Old Mutual Wealth, the release of capital resulting from the Zimbabwe indigenisation and the flexibility achieved through the simplification of financial structures.
The Committee evaluated these initiatives against the three criteria and concluded an evaluation of 50% was achieved.
Weighting of rationalising initiatives The various initiatives were then weighted by the Committee based on their contribution toward the original objectives to streamline the Company, unlock value and reduce debt.
The Committees decisions on weightings and achievement are summarised below: Initiative Weight Achievement Total Sale of the US Life business 22.50% 100.00% 22.50% Sale of Nedbank 10.00% 0.00% 0.00% Restructuring and proposed IPO of the US Asset Management business 12.50% 50.00% 6.25% Sale of the Nordic business 37.50% 100.00% 37.50% Restructuring of the Companys LTS business 17.50% 50.00% 8.75% Total 100.00% 75.00% 109 REMUNERATION REPORT continued Final assessment against objective of 1.5bn debt reduction target and any new information As outlined in the plan, an overall objective of the initiatives was to provide proceeds to reduce Group debt by 1.5bn.
The Committee retained discretion to reduce the vesting level of the award if this overall objective was not met, or if any other new information arose to suggest a different performance assessment.
The debt reduction objective was fully achieved in September 2012 and no new information regarding achievement of any of the initiatives arose, which materially impacted earlier assessments.
Therefore, the Committee concluded that no reduction was appropriate and the overall achievement of the OMSIP Rationalising Objectives was 75%.
2011 OMSIP awards The 2011 awards used the same financial targets as the annual awards granted in 2010, relating to key financial goals, split equally between the financial performance of the Companys LTS business post-restructuring and absolute TSR targets, as set out below.
The awards made to the executive directors under the OMSIP in 2011 had a face value of 250% of basic salary at the time of award, and will vest 50% in 2014 and 50% in 2015.
LTS business performance 50% Metric Weight Below threshold Threshold Maximum 1 IFRS AOP growth 40% 42% 42% 103% 2 RoE 40% 15% 15% 18% 3 Average ratio of NCCF AUM 20% 2% 2% 6% Vesting % 0% 20% 100% Straight-line interpolation between threshold and maximum.
1 Growth in AOP excluding Long-Term Investment Return on a constant currency basis over a four-year performance period.
2 IFRS AOP over aggregate equity allocated to the Companys LTS business in the final year of the performance period.
3 The ratio of the Net Client Cash Flow NCCF over Assets under Management AUM will be calculated on a simple average basis over the full three years.
Absolute TSR 50% TSR will be measured on an absolute basis, 50% in rand and 50% in sterling, and will be averaged at the start Q4 2010 and end Q4 2013 of the three-year performance period.
Old Mutuals TSR growth will then be compared with the vesting schedule set out below to determine the outcome: Metric Below threshold Threshold Maximum Annual growth in absolute TSR % p. a.
10% 10% 20% Vesting % 0% 20% 100% Straight-line interpolation between threshold and maximum.
The Committee must be satisfied that the Companys TSR performance reasonably reflects its underlying financial performance over the period.
Threshold performance is aligned with Old Mutuals cost of equity and the maximum is aligned with performance in excess of the historic upper-quartile performance within the insurance sector.
The 2011 OMSIP award will vest based on performance over the period 2011 to 2013 for AOP over the four-year period 2010 to 2013 and the Committee will report the outcome in 2014.
2012 Long-term incentives The primary target for long-term incentive awards made in 2012 was based on cumulative growth over three years in post tax AOP on a constant currency basis.
This was chosen to incentivise significant growth in operating profit across the Groups principal business units.
An adjustment to this outcome will be made based on the relative TSR over the three-year period, calculated 50% against the FTSE100 Index and 50% against the JSE ALSI.
This takes into account relative performance against other listed companies.
TSR will be averaged at the start Q4 2011 and end Q4 2014 of the three-year performance period.
In addition, discretionary downward adjustments to the formulaic outcome on the AOP metrics will be considered by the Committee where: There are any negative financial impacts or underperformance in the Group not adequately reflected in AOP, giving the Committee discretion to take broad performance into account: or There is underperformance in the management of Group risk or the agreed risk appetite levels are exceeded.
This enables the Committee to factor in the requirement of the FSA and ABI to take account of company risk as a factor in performance measurement.
110 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 How we govern our business How we What Where we have Our risks Financials we do are going performed How we govern our business The level at which the awards vest will be determined by reference to the total aggregate AOP in constant currency achieved over the three-year period, shown in the table below: AOP targets aggregated over three years Threshold Maximum AOP bn 2.9 3.5 % Vesting 0% |Interpolated| 100% Multiplied by Relative TSR Performance Relative TSR vs. index Multiplier Threshold 4% or more below index 0.85 Target equal to index 1.00 Maximum 4% or more above index 1.15 R elative TSR performance calculated 50% against the FTSE100 Index and 50% against the JSE ALSI against the above ranges, with a multiplier being set on a straight-line basis between the points.
The awards for the executive directors, inclusive of the maximum TSR multiplier above, were equal to 250% of basic salary at the date of award.
The Company undertakes the performance measurement and submits a report to the Committee advising the results for each specific award.
The Committee obtains external audit sign-off from KPMG Audit plc and Strategic Remuneration as part of its oversight procedures.

111 REMUNERATION REPORT continued Chairmans and non-executive directors remuneration The Companys policy on remuneration for non-executive directors is that this should be: Fee-based Market-related Not linked to share price or Company performance.
The annual fees payable to the Chairman and to other non-executive directors in 2012 and 2013, by role, are set out below: 2013 2012 Chairman 360,000 350,000 Non-executive directors Base fee 57,000 55,000 Senior Independent Director additional fee 10,000 10,000 Additional fees payable for Committees Board Risk Committee Chairman 25,000 25,000 Member 8,000 8,000 Group Audit Committee Chairman 30,000 30,000 Member 10,000 10,000 Nomination Committee Member 3,000 3,000 Remuneration Committee Chairman 25,000 20,000 Member 8,000 6,000 None of the non-executive directors of the Company including the Chairman contributed to any Group pension fund during 2012 or had any accrued pension fund benefits in any Group pension fund at 31 December 2012.
Employee share plans A summary of the employee share plans currently operated by the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries can be found on the Old Mutual plc website.
Change of control Under the rules of the Company share plans in which the executive directors are participants, in the event of a change of control of Old Mutual plc: Forfeitable shares awards and share options granted under the Old Mutual plc Share Reward Plan SRP would vest in full as awards granted under the SRP represent deferred short-term incentive awards that have already been earned Performance shares and share options granted under the Old Mutual plc Performance Share Plan PSP would vest: i to the extent that the performance criteria to which such awards or options are subject have been met: and ii on a pro-rata basis to reflect the reduction in the length of the original performance period, although the Committee does have discretion to disapply the length of service pro-rating for compassionate reasons Share options granted under the Old Mutual plc 2008 Sharesave Plan SAYE would become exercisable to the extent of the savings accumulated.
The Committee has reviewed the operation of the share incentive schemes, including how discretion is exercised and the grant levels currently applicable, and considers these to be appropriate to the Companys circumstances and prospects.
112 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 How we govern our business How we What Where we have Our risks Financials we do are going performed How we govern our business Employee Share Ownership Trusts The Group operates a number of Employee Share Ownership Trusts ESOTs through which it collateralises some of its obligations under its employee share plans.
At 31 December 2012, 149,255,489 shares in the Company were held in ESOTs as show below, and 119,125,003 shares in the Company were held under award to be settled by these ESOTs.
Trust Country Old Mutual plc shares held in trust Capital Growth Investment Trust Zimbabwe 1,104,238 Mutual & Federal Broad-Based Trust South Africa 3,185 Mutual & Federal Management Incentive Trust South Africa 15,890,544 Mutual & Federal Senior Black Management Trust South Africa 4,177,723 Mutual & Federal Namibia Broad-Based Trust Namibia 2,682 Mutual & Federal Namibia Management Incentive Trust Namibia 143,842 Mutual & Federal Namibia Senior Black Management Trust Namibia 144,605 Old Mutual plc Employee Share Trust Guernsey 34,607,097 OMN Broad-Based Employee Share Trust Namibia 443,731 OMN Management Incentive Trust Namibia 1,316,368 OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Trust South Africa 12,753,368 OMSA Management Incentive Trust South Africa 58,543,158 OMSA Share Trust South Africa 20,124,948 Total 149,255,489 The strategy for all non-Black Economic Empowerment BEErelated ESOTs has historically been to ensure that sufficient shares were acquired to match at least 90% of the obligations of each share incentive grant.
However, as a result of the requirements of the Companys BEE transactions in South Africa and Namibia, it was necessary to place shares allotted as part of the transactions in the relevant BEE employee share trusts immediately, in order to cover the total annual share grant allocations likely to be made to black participants in terms of the BEE transactions up to 2014 and 2016 respectively.
The general practice of the ESOTs save for BEE-related trusts is not to vote the shares held at shareholder meetings, although beneficiaries of restricted share awards or forfeitable shares awards may in principle give directions for those shares to be voted.
However, with respect to the OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Trust, the OMSA Management Incentive Trust, the OMN Broad-Based Employee Share Trust, the OMN Management Incentive Trust, the Mutual & Federal Management Incentive Trust, the Mutual & Federal Senior Black Management Trust, the Mutual & Federal Broad-Based Trust, the Mutual & Federal Namibia Management Incentive Trust, the Mutual & Federal Namibia Senior Black Management Trust and the Mutual & Federal Namibia Broad-Based Trust, the trustees may, because of BEE considerations, vote any unallocated shares held in these trusts as well as those shares held in respect of any unexercised share options.
The beneficiaries of any restricted shares allocated by these BEE employee share trusts are entitled to vote their relevant shares.
Share options excluding nil-cost options granted under the Old Mutual UK Sharesave Plan, SAYE, the SRP and the PSP are currently intended to be settled by the issue of new shares rather than using shares held in an ESOT and there were, at 31 December 2012, 17,457,883 such shares held under option.
In respect of the vesting of share options on 8 April 2012, certain unapproved share options originally granted to UK employees in 2009 were cash-settled on exercise rather than being settled with newly-issued shares.
Dilution limits For the purposes of calculating dilution limits, any awards that are satisfied by transfer of pre-existing issued shares such as shares acquired by market purchase through ESOTs and any shares comprised in any share option that has lapsed or has been cash-settled are disregarded.
The Company has complied with these limits at all times.
At 31 December 2012, the Company had 1.61% of share capital available under the 5%-in-10-years limit applicable to discretionary share incentive schemes and 5.83% of share capital available under the 10%-in-10-years limit applicable to all share incentive schemes.
Nedbank Group Limited share incentive schemes The Companys separately listed subsidiary, Nedbank Group Limited, has its own share incentive schemes, which are under the control of the Remuneration Committee of its board and are not further addressed in this report.
Neither of the executive directors of the Company has any interest under any of the Nedbank Group Limited share incentive schemes.
113 REMUNERATION REPORT continued Directors interests under employee share plans The following share options and rights over shares in the Company granted under various employee share schemes were outstanding at 1 January and 31 December 2012 in favour of the executive directors.

Mr Broadley sold all of these shares.
3 Awards are subject to a claw-back provision under which the Committee may reduce the number of shares under option or award if financial results or business performance for which the director is responsible are found to have been materially incorrect or misleading or if undue risk was taken, resulting in financial loss to the Company.
4 These awards were consolidated on a 7-for-8 basis on 23 April 2012 as a result of the Special Dividend and share consolidation approved by shareholders.
5 As a result of the EPSand RoE-based performance targets being met, the share options and forfeitable shares awards granted under the PSP on 8 April 2009 vested on 8 April 2012.
6 Mr Broadley exercised these options on 10 April 2012 and retained 174,606 shares.
7 On 10 April 2012, 825,177 shares were released to Mr Broadley in respect of his joining and long-term incentive forfeitable shares awards granted on 8 April 2009.
8 The Committee concluded that the overall achievement of the OMSIP Rationalising Objectives was 75% and the appropriate number of shares held under option will vest.
9 An overall achievement of 85.9% was determined for the 2010 OMSIP Financial Objectives and the appropriate number of shares held under option will vest.

16 The SAYE option price was determined 20% below the average of the Companys share price between 16 and 18 March 2009.
The Companys share price at the date of grant 9 April 2009 was 63.3p.
Company share price performance The market price of the Companys shares was 178.2p at 31 December 2012 and ranged from a low of 137.8p to a high of 179.6p during 2012.
Executive directors shareholding requirements The Group Chief Executive is expected to build up a holding of shares in the Company equal in value to at least 200% of his basic salary within five years of appointment and the equivalent figure for other executive directors is 150% of their basic salaries.
For the purposes of the calculations, share options and forfeitable shares awards are excluded.

Further information Terms of engagement executive directors The terms of engagement of the executive directors are considered by the Committee to provide a proper balance of responsibilities and security between the parties.
The following is a summary of the main provisions: Provision Service contract Contract dates Julian Roberts 23 January 2009, as amended on 22 November 2011 Philip Broadley 10 November 2008, as amended on 22 November 2011 Notice period Julian Roberts 12 months by either the Company or the director Philip Broadley 12 months by the Company and 6 months by the director Compensation for loss of office Tailored to reflect the Companys contractual obligations and the obligation on the part of the employee to mitigate loss Compensation payable on early termination No contractual provision Terms of engagement Chairman and non-executive directors Patrick OSullivan entered into an engagement letter with the Company in August 2009 as amended in December 2011 setting out the terms applicable to his role as Chairman from January 2010.
Under these terms, subject to: a 12 months notice at any time given by either the Company or Patrick OSullivan, b his being duly re-elected at Annual General Meetings, and c the provisions of the Companys Articles of Association relating to the removal of directors, his appointment was for an initial term of three years, renewable thereafter for a further three years subject to the same provisos, followed by up to three additional one-year terms.
Mr OSullivans term of engagement has now been extended for a second three-year term with effect from 1 January 2013.
The other non-executive directors are engaged on terms that may be terminated by either side without notice.
However, it is envisaged that they will remain in place initially for two successive three-year terms, in order to provide assurance to both the Company and the non-executive director concerned that the appointment is likely to continue.
The renewal of non-executive directors terms for successive three-year cycles is not automatic, with the continued suitability of each non-executive director being assessed by the Nomination Committee.
Non-executive directors engagements are extended on an annual basis for a maximum of three years from the end of their second three-year cycle.
115 REMUNERATION REPORT continued Terms of engagement Chairman and non-executive directors continued All directors including the executive directors are required to stand for election or re-election annually at the Companys Annual General Meeting.

Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Parent Company financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements on the same basis.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period.
In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company financial statements, the directors are required to: Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent State whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU: and Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Companys transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors Report, Directors Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that comply with that law and those regulations.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Companys website.
