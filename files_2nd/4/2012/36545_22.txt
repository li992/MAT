Strategic review Governance Remuneration report Financial statements Other information remuneration report the alignment of perFormance & rew ard is fundamental to our policy Dear Shareholder It is with pleasure that I introduce the Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2012.
This report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and approved by the Board.
The Remuneration Committee has kept abreast throughout 2012 of the increased focus on executive pay and reward.
The Committee reviewed the proposals and responded to the consultation papers on executive remuneration and narrative reporting issued by the Department for Business Innovation and Skills.
We will continue to monitor developments related to executive remuneration in 2013.
Whilst it is currently anticipated that any changes will only take effect for the Company from next year, this years report seeks to further improve the level and transparency of disclosure and better demonstrate the link between pay and performance.
In February 2012, the Company announced that it would be a specialist retail REIT.
To achieve this we would sell our office assets and reinvest in our chosen sectors.
We also made clear our focus on reducing costs, leveraging our operating platform and growing income streams.
In line with the Companys remuneration policy to ensure it continues to motivate its leaders and create an opportunity to increase remuneration for demonstrably superior performance, the Committee set stretching bonus targets.
These comprised financial targets to grow earnings per share, outperform the industry benchmark for total property returns, grow net rental income and reduce operating costs.
Detailed personal objectives for the Executive Directors were designed to ensure delivery of the specific steps required to be taken to deliver the targeted financial performance.
Shareholders will have read earlier in this report about the financial results for the Company for 2012 and also the sale of the offices and reinvestment of those proceeds.
The Committee reviewed the Companys performance against the objectives it had set and I hope that shareholders will agree with our assessment that in light of the Companys excellent performance the Executive Directors have earned the bonuses we have awarded to them.
During 2012, the Committee also reviewed the Long Term Incentive Plan award that had been granted in 2009.
Despite a relatively strong performance against the established performance conditions, those conditions had not been met and the Committee determined that there should be no vesting.
Mindful of the Companys continuing desire to focus on cost control and in light of the challenging economic environment, there will be no increase in base salary for Executive Directors.
In December 2012 the Company announced the appointment of Jean-Philippe Mouton to the Board and prior to his appointment the Committee reviewed his role and responsibilities.
In accordance with our policy, benchmark information was considered by the Committee and Jean-Philippe has joined the Board on a base salary of 400,000.
The remainder of his remuneration is structured on a basis entirely consistent with the rest of the Executive Directors.
The Committee also reviewed the Chairmans fee, which was last increased in April 2010.
The Committee has decided that the appropriate fee for the Chairmanship of the Company is 320,000 and David Tyler will, assuming he is elected at the Annual General Meeting, receive this fee.
In the meantime, and in light of this review, we decided that the current Chaimans fee should also be increased to 300,000 with effect from 1 January 2013.
The review of Non-Executive Director fees has been deferred until the summer of 2013.
I hope that you find this report helpful in understanding the Companys remuneration practices.
I recommend the report to you and hope that you will support the resolution to approve the Directors Remuneration Report at the Annual General Meeting in May.

HAMMERSON ANNUAL REPORT 2012 63 Strategic review Governance Remuneration report Financial statements Other information The Committee and its composition The Committees responsibilities are set out in its terms of reference which are available on request to shareholders and on the Companys website.
The terms of reference are reviewed and amended annually by the Board, and were most recently reviewed and updated in December 2012.
From 1 January 2012 to 3 February 2012, the Committee comprised Anthony Watson Chairman of the Committee, Terry Duddy and John Nelson, Chairman of the Company.
Provision D. 2.1 of the UK Code provides that the remuneration committee of a larger FTSE listed company should comprise at least three independent non-executive directors excluding the chairman of the company.
Therefore, during this period, the Committees composition was not fully compliant with the recommendations of the UK Code as it only comprised two independent NonExecutive Directors, excluding the Chairman of the Company.
However, it was considered that the high level of experience offered by Anthony Watson, Terry Duddy and John Nelson would ensure proper governance pending the appointment to the Committee of Judy Gibbons in February 2012.
During 2012, six Committee meetings were held, at which all Committee members were present.
John Nelson was considered independent on his original appointment to the Board and the Board considers the other members of the Committee to be independent.
No Director has any involvement in discussions about his her own remuneration.
David Tyler was appointed to the Committee on 12 January 2013.
The Chairman of the Committee reports on the Committees activities to the Board at the meeting immediately following the Committee meeting.
Advisers The following advisers provided services to the Committee during the year: FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP FIT which is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group, the professional association for remuneration consultants, and complies with its code of conduct were appointed by the Committee as advisers on 17 August 2011.
Since then, they have provided advice on reward structures and levels.
FITs terms of engagement are available on request to shareholders and on the Companys website.
These terms specify that, in order to avoid any conflict of interest, FIT will only provide advice expressly authorised by or on behalf of the Committee.
Where instructions are taken on behalf of the Committee from employees of the Company, FIT will ensure that the Committee is kept informed of the broad scope of such matters.
The fees paid to FIT during 2012 were 62,625 excluding VAT 2011: 42,425 excluding VAT this amount is for the period from 17 August 2011 to 31 December 2011 only.
A further 56,609 excluding VAT was paid to Aon Hewitt, who were the advisers for the year up to 16 August 2011.
FIT did not provide any other services to the Company during 2012.
Herbert Smith Freehills LLP provided advice to the Committee throughout the year, and also provided other legal services to the Company throughout the year.
The Chief Executive and Group HR Director attend all meetings of the Committee by invitation, except when their own remuneration is being discussed, to provide information and advice.
The Company Secretary is the Secretary to the Committee.
64 HAMMERSON ANNUAL REPORT 2012 Strategic review Governance Remuneration report Financial statements Other information Remuneration policy The Committees objective is to determine an appropriate remuneration policy for recommendation to the Board that: Ensures that the Company continues to attract, retain and motivate quality leaders, capable of making a major contribution to the Companys success.
Having regard to the views of investors, generally provides for around market median -10% base salary but with the opportunity to increase total potential remuneration for demonstrably superior performance through variable remuneration in the form of bonus and longterm incentives.
Remuneration for Executive Directors takes account of performance through an annual performance-related bonus scheme the Annual Incentive Plan or AIP and, for longer-term performance, through awards under a Long-Term Incentive Plan the LTIP.
In implementing the policy, following its approval by the Board, the Committee takes into account remuneration packages available within other comparable companies whilst remaining mindful of the need to treat comparisons with caution, the Companys overall performance, internal relativities, achievement of corporate objectives, individual performance and published views of institutional investors and their representative bodies.
In line with the current policy, the Executive Directors total target remuneration is structured to reward corporate and individual performance.
Over two-thirds of the Executive Directors total target remuneration excluding pension and fixed benefits is performance related, which is considered to be appropriate.
Review of the year During 2012 the Company adopted a cautious approach to executive remuneration in light of continuing challenging market conditions.
During the year, the Committee met to consider the following matters: A review of the Companys remuneration policy in light of regulatory and market developments and guidelines.
A salary and bonus review for the Executive Directors and senior executives.
Performance measures and targets for the AIP and the LTIP.
A review of the level of achievement of the performance conditions attached to the awards made in 2009 under the LTIP.
The structure of the Companys share plans and share-based grants and, accordingly, awards under the Companys share plans.
Arrangements under the Companys defined benefit pension scheme.
Proposed remuneration for Jean-Philippe Mouton, who was appointed a Director of the Company with effect from 1 January 2013.

HAMMERSON ANNUAL REPORT 2012 67 variable long-term perFormance related Short-term perFormance related Strategic review Governance Remuneration report Financial statements Other information exeCutive DireCtOrs remuneratiOn Fixed, non perFormance-related elementS oF remuneration Base salary There were no increases in base salary for Executive Directors in 2012, an approach that was consistent with salary reviews for employees at senior management level throughout the Group.
As announced on 13 December 2012, Jean-Philippe Mouton, Managing Director of Hammerson France, would be appointed as an Executive Director of the Company with effect from 1 January 2013, with a base salary of 400,000.
In January 2013, the Committee completed its annual review of remuneration for the remaining Executive Directors and, in view of the prevailing economic climate and market conditions, no salary increases for 2013 have been recommended for them.
This approach is consistent with reviews for employees at senior management level throughout the Group.
Accordingly, base salaries for Executive Directors for 2013 will be as follows: Salary for 2013 David Atkins 585,000 Peter Cole 420,000 Timon Drakesmith 400,000 Jean-Philippe Mouton 400,000 Pensions Timon Drakesmith has elected not to participate in the Companys defined contribution pension scheme.
In accordance with his service agreement, he receives instead a salary supplement of 20% of his base salary which is paid, by way of an employer contribution, into an approved SIPP.
The amount paid by the Company for the year ended 31 December 2012 was 80,000.
The salary supplement does not qualify for AIP purposes or entitlements under the LTIP.
David Atkins and Peter Cole participate in the Hammerson Group Management Pension and Life Assurance Scheme the Scheme, the Companys defined benefit pension scheme, as outlined in the table on page 66 and more fully described in note 6 to the accounts on pages 96 to 97.
Pension entitlements are based on base salary.
Therefore neither David Atkins nor Peter Cole have made any contributions during the year.
For the year ended 31 December 2012, David Atkins will receive a cash supplement of 69,744 2011: 64,908 for pension benefits that exceed the annual allowance of 50,000.
This supplement in lieu of pension will be subject to Income Tax and National Insurance Contributions and will not qualify for AIP purposes or entitlements under the LTIP.
Peter Cole has not been affected by the annual allowance restriction and will not be receiving a cash supplement.
David Atkins pension under the Scheme is based on a 1 60th accrual rate.
This is the rate of accrual received by all members of the Scheme who joined after 1 July 1994.
Peter Cole joined the Scheme before 1 July 1994.
His pension has been accruing at a rate which would provide him with a pension of two-thirds of final salary at retirement should he continue to work for the Company until age 60.
This is equivalent to an accrual rate of 1 45th.
The following two tables set out information on Directors defined benefit pension entitlements and transfer values.
In the table below, for each Director, the total accrued benefit at 31 December 2012 represents the annual pension that is expected to be payable on eventual retirement, given the length of service and salary of each Director at 31 December 2012.
The increase in accrued benefit earned during the year represents the increase in this expected pension, including the effect of inflation, when compared with the position at 31 December 2011.
The increase in accrued benefit during the year excluding the effect of inflation over the year is also shown.

The transfer values of the accrued entitlement represent the value of assets that the Scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the Schemes liability in respect of the Directors pension benefits.
They do not represent sums payable to individual Directors and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
For each Director, the increase in transfer value of accrued benefits under the requirements of Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 is the transfer value of the total accrued benefit at 31 December 2012 less the corresponding transfer value at 31 December 2011.
The transfer value of the increase in accrued benefits under the Listing Rules is the transfer value at 31 December 2012 of the increase in accrued benefits during the period excluding inflation.
The transfer values disclosed below do not represent the sum paid or payable to the individual Director.
Instead, they represent a potential liability of the Scheme.

Fixed benefits: all employee share plans The Company operates a Savings-Related Share Option Scheme Sharesave and a Share Incentive Plan SIP, both of which are approved by HM Revenue and Customs, for all eligible UK employees.
Executive Directors are entitled to participate in both of these plans on the same terms as other eligible UK employees.
Sharesave is more fully described in note 25 to the accounts on pages 120 to 121.
The table below demonstrates movements under the Sharesave during 2012 for Executive Directors, and options outstanding as at 31 December 2012.

The middle market price of the ordinary shares of the Company, as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List, was 488.30 pence per share on 31 December 2012 and the range during the year was 354.50 pence per share to 497.00 pence per share.
Under the SIP, all eligible UK employees may receive free shares up to a value of 3,000 each year.
Furthermore, eligible employees can purchase partnership shares up to a value of 1,500 each tax year, which the Company will match through the award of two matching shares for every partnership share purchased.
Dividends on shares held under the SIP are used to purchase additional shares.
The Executive Directors interests in ordinary shares of the Company under the SIP as at 31 December 2012 are as follows: Cost to Company of Total SIP shares Partnership shares Matching shares Free shares Dividend shares Total SIP shares shares awarded in 1 2 1 January 2012 purchased awarded awarded purchased 31 December 2012 2012 David Atkins 8,011 728 267 9,006 3,943 Peter Cole 9,205 728 306 10,239 4,095 Timon Drakesmith 592 1,184 19 1,795 7,327 1 The free shares were awarded on 20 April 2012 at a price of 412.00 pence per share.

HAMMERSON ANNUAL REPORT 2012 69 Strategic review Governance Remuneration report Financial statements Other information variable, perFormance-related elementS oF remuneration Annual Incentive Plan The annual performance-related bonus operates under the Annual Incentive Plan the AIP and is structured so that 60% of the bonus award is paid in cash and 40% is awarded in shares.
The vesting of the shares is deferred for two years.
From 2012, the share award has been made in the form of nil-cost options and, following vesting, there is a five year exercise period.
The Committee has reviewed the AIP structure for 2013 which will be paid in 2014, and determined that it will remain broadly the same as for 2012.
The Committee believes that this structure continues to align performance and reward, ensures that the AIP remains valued by the participants, is consistent with current best practice and is aligned with the interests of shareholders.

70 HAMMERSON ANNUAL REPORT 2012 Strategic review Governance Remuneration report Financial statements Other information The personal objectives attached to the 2012 award for each of the Executive Directors focused on the following areas: David Atkins: To improve the investment proposition and underlying performance of the business with particular focus on Group earnings per share and Total Shareholder Return.
To drive the repositioning of the retail-focused business including specific tactical steps around resourcing.
Peter Cole: To effect the sale of the London Office portfolio and invest the sale proceeds into retail property.
Timon Drakesmith: To improve the Companys rating from an equity capital markets view point.
To maintain a strong focus on cost management, including restructuring many of the Companys financial instruments in order to reduce the Companys interest payments.
To grow the Companys position within Value Retail.
In February 2013, the Committee determined the level of achievement of the 2012 performance targets.
The Executive Directors all scored very highly on their personal objectives, whilst ensuring that the Group financial targets were achieved.
This has resulted in the bonus payments as shown in the remuneration table on page 63.
For the 2012 AIP award the adjusted earnings per share target was achieved, for Executive Directors, to a level of 100% and the Total Property Return target was achieved to a level of 100%.
This, together with individual achievement against operational targets and personal objectives, resulted in an average payment to Executive Directors representing approximately 90% of the maximum potentially payable.
This compares with an average payment of 53% of the maximum potential in respect of the 2011 award.

The market price per share at vesting was 403.80 pence per share.
The market price on award was 384.90 pence per share for the award made in 2010, 461.40 pence per share for the award made in 2011 and 406.30 pence per share for the award made in 2012.
HAMMERSON ANNUAL REPORT 2012 71 Strategic review Governance Remuneration report Financial statements Other information Long-Term Incentive Plan The Committee reviews the structure of the LTIP awards, as well as the performance measures and conditions attached to the awards, on an annual basis.
Since 2011, the awards have incorporated a balance of relative and absolute measures, and the Committee believes that this balance is still appropriate.
The structure of the 2013 awards will remain the same as the 2012 awards.
However, the relative performance measures will be adjusted to reflect the Companys change in strategy to focus on the retail property sector: the comparator group for the Total Shareholder Return TSR measure will focus on major European retail property companies and the Total Property Return TPR measure will compare performance against a retail only property index.
With regard to the absolute performance measure, Absolute Net Asset Value Absolute NAV which was introduced in 2011 will be replaced with Earnings per Share EPS to align further the interests of Directors and shareholders.

This will ensure there is no vesting gap in 2014 and, overall, will result in only a modest reduction in potential awards vesting to Executive Directors in the three-year period from 2014 to 2016 assuming a consistent level of performance is achieved.
