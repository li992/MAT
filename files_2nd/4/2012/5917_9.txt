relation to Directors remuneration and to the guidance of investor relations bodies.
Whilst the new regulations governing the reporting and shareholder approval of executive remuneration do not come into force until Ferrexpos 2013 financial year, we have incorporated a number of changes this year to help make our Remuneration Report clearer and easier to understand.
In summary, this report is divided into two distinct sections: the first A outlines Ferrexpos forward-looking remuneration policy, setting out components of pay, how they are linked to the business strategy, and incentive opportunities for the Executive Directors.
The second B reviews how the policy was implemented in 2012 and includes a table showing a single figure of total remuneration for Executive Directors.

Executives will be encouraged to retain their vested LTIP shares on an after-tax basis until the applicable guideline level is achieved.
Pay-for-Performance: Scenario Analysis The CEO does not participate in any incentive plan, for reasons stated in the introduction to this report.
Under all scenarios, therefore, his remuneration, which is donated to charity, remains as set out in Section B of this report.
For the remaining executive director, the graph below provides estimates of the potential future reward opportunity and the potential split between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: Below threshold, Target and Stretch.
CFO Salary Stretch 29% 2% 8% 44% 17% Pension Benets STIP LTIP Target 41% 3% 10% 41% 5% Below 75% 6% 19% threshold 0 CHF 000s 500 1,000 1,500 2,000 2,500 58 Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 overview business review governance financial statements In illustrating potential reward opportunities the following assumptions have been made: Scenario STIP LTIP Fixed pay Stretch Maximum STIP 150% Performance warrants 1 of salary full vesting Target On target STIP 100% Performance warrants Latest known base 1 of salary salary, pension, benefits threshold vesting 20% Below threshold No STIP payable Threshold not achieved nil 1 Excludes increase in value arising from share price growth.
Potential reward opportunities illustrated above are based on the policy which will apply in 2013, applied to the base salary in force at 1 January 2013.
For the STIP, the amounts illustrated for the CFO are those potentially receivable in respect of performance for 2013.
For the LTIP awards, the award opportunity for the CFO is assumed to remain the same number of shares as in 2012 i. e. 120,000 shares for the CFO and the face value is estimated using the average share price over Q4 2012 of 215 pence.
It should be noted that the LTIP awards do not normally vest until the end of three years following the beginning of the year in which they were granted.
Employee Context In making remuneration decisions, the Remuneration Committee also considers the pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group.
Prior to the annual pay review, the Remuneration Committee receives a report from the CEO setting out changes to broader employee pay.
This forms part of the basis for determining Executive Director remuneration.
Remuneration of Senior Executives Below the Board The policy and practice with regard to the remuneration of senior executives below the Board is consistent with that for the Executive Directors, except that they may participate in local, discretionary plans.
Senior executives participate in the LTIP with the same performance measures applied as for Executive Directors.
In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment, long-term incentive awards may be granted without performance conditions to participants below the Board.
Details of Executive Directors Service Contracts The Executive Directors are employed under contracts of employment with Ferrexpo AG, a Group company.
The Remuneration Committee sets notice periods for the Executive Directors at 12 months or less, which reduces the likelihood of having to pay excessive compensation in the event of poor performance.
The principal terms of the Executive Directors service contracts which have no fixed term are as follows: Mr Zhevagos service contract with the Company is terminable on not less than six months notice to be given by the Company or by the executive.
Mr Mawes service contract with the Company is terminable on not less than 12 months notice to be given by the Company or not less than six months notice to be given by the executive.
Notice period From From Executive Director Position Date of contract employer employee K Zhevago CEO 1 November 2008 6 months 6 months C Mawe CFO 7 January 2008 12 months 6 months Exit Payments Policy The policy on termination payments is to pay no more than what may be stipulated in an individuals service contract.
The Executive Directors service contracts contain a provision exercisable at the option of the employer to pay an amount on early termination of employment equal to the respective notice period.
If the Company elects to make such a payment which in practice it will do if the speed and certainty afforded by this provision are thought to be in the best interests of shareholders, the Executive Director will be entitled under his contract to receive all components of his remuneration, allowances and expenses for the extent of the notice period including only in the case of Mr Mawe the STIP, which reflects the practice in the Company at the time when Mr Mawe was appointed.
It is the Remuneration Committees policy to review contractual arrangements prior to new appointments in the light of developments in bestpractice.
Unvested LTIP awards held by leavers normally lapse.
However, if the individual is considered a good leaver e. g. for reasons of death, ill-health, injury or disability: his employing company ceasing to be a member of the Group: the business or part of the business in which he is employed being transferred to a transferee which is not a member of the Group: or any other reason which the Remuneration Committee in its absolute discretion permits, any outstanding LTIP awards will be pro-rated for time and performance.
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to alter these provisions as permitted by the relevant Plan Rules on a case-by-case basis following a review of circumstances, in order to ensure fairness to both shareholders and participants.
59 Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 Remuneration Report continued External Appointments It is the Boards policy to allow the Executive Directors to accept directorships of other quoted companies provided that they have obtained the consent of both the Chairman of the Board and Kostyantin Zhevago.
Any such directorships must be formally notified to the Board.
Details of external directorships of quoted companies held by Executive Directors, along with fees retained, are as follows: Fees Executive Director Company Role s held retained 1 K Zhevago New World Resources plc Non-executive Director Nil C Mawe 1 The fee is donated to various charities Relative Importance of Spending on Pay The graph below shows Ferrexpos profit after tax, dividend, and total employee pay expenditure this includes pension, variable pay, and social security for the financial year ends 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2012, and the percentage change.

Part B: Remuneration in 2012 The following section provides details of how the remuneration policy was implemented during the year.
Remuneration Committee Membership in 2012 The Remuneration Committee is composed of five independent Non-executive Directors.
Lucio Genovese is the Chairman of the Committee, and its other members are Michael Abrahams, Oliver Baring, Wolfram Kuoni and Ihor Mitiukov.
The Remuneration Committee met five times during the year.
Attendance at meetings by individual members is detailed in the Corporate Governance Report on page 52.
A summary of the topics discussed at each meeting in 2012 is detailed below: Review of remuneration of Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee LTIP performance and the Companys performance compared to its peers General market considerations surrounding executive remuneration packages and structure Performance evaluation of the Committee The CEO usually attends meetings of the Remuneration Committee at the invitation of the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, and the Company Secretary acts as secretary to the committee.
No Director is present when his own remuneration is being discussed.
60 Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 overview business review governance financial statements Advisers The Remuneration Committee retains Kepler Associates to provide advice on remuneration policy, with particular emphasis on the structure of long-term incentives for senior management.
Other than advice to the Remuneration Committee no other services were provided by Kepler Associates to the Company.
The fees paid to Kepler Associates in respect of work carried out in 2012 totalled GBP31,000.
The CEO provides guidance to the Remuneration Committee on remuneration packages of senior executives employed by the Group but not in respect of his own remuneration.
Single Total Figure of Remuneration The table below sets out in a single figure for each currency of payment the total remuneration received by each Executive Director for the year ending 31 December 2012 and the prior year.
See also table on page 62 below, showing how STIP targets were met in the year.
K Zhevago CEO C Mawe CFO All figures shown in currency of payment 2012 2011 2012 2011 1 Salary US$240,000 US$240,000 CHF632,000 CHF626,000 2 Benefits US$49,000 US$100,000 CHF168,000 CHF168,000 3 Pension CHF2,000 CHF2,000 CHF48,000 CHF48,000 4 STIP CHF650,000 CHF820,000 5 LTIP 229,000 269,000 6 Dividends 6,000 7,000 Total US$289,000 US$340,000 CHF1,498,000 CHF1,662,000 plus CHF2,000 plus CHF2,000 plus 235,000 plus 276,000 The figures have been calculated as follows: 1 Base salary: amount earned for the year 2 Benefits: the taxable value of benefits received in the year accommodation allowance 3 Pension: increase in transfer value over the year, less Directors contribution.
Other formulas such as 20 times the increase in the value of accrued benefit over the year are not considered appropriate since this is not a classic Defined Benefit scheme see Pensions below, and for expatriate staff the pension is repaid as a lump sum on leaving the country 4 STIP: this is the total bonus earned on performance during the year 5 LTIP: the market value of shares that vested on performance to 31 December of the relevant year 2012: 91% vested on performance, 2011: 100% vested on performance and share price on 31 December 2012 of 251.2 pence and 31 December 2011 of 268.8 pence 6 Dividends: the total value of dividends earned during the vesting period on LTIP shares vesting on 31 December, paid in cash Base Salary Base salaries are reviewed annually, with reference to the individuals role, experience and performance: business performance: salary levels at relevant comparators: and the range of salary increases applying across the Group.
During the year the Committee considered pay levels against international mining comparators and other FTSE-listed companies of similar size.
Following this review the Committee decided to increase Mr Mawes salary by 1% from CHF626,160 to CHF632,424 with effect from 1 January 2012.
Mr Zhevagos salary, which he donates to Ukrainian charities, remained unchanged at US$240,000.
A further change has been made for 2013, as set out below.
Base salary at: Executive Director Position 1 January 2013 1 January 2012 Increase K Zhevago CEO US$240,000 US$240,000 C Mawe CFO CHF638,748 CHF632,424 1% The increase to the CFOs base salary for 2013 of 1% is in line with the average increase across the Group outside the relatively high-inflation environment of Ukraine of 1%.
The CEOs salary remained unchanged.
Pensions The Group does not operate a separate pension scheme for Executive Directors.
Chris Mawe and Kostyantin Zhevago are members of the Ferrexpo AG pension plan which is a mandatory insurance scheme under Swiss law, provided for all employees of Ferrexpo AG, to which the Company contributes an average of 6% of their annual base salaries.
Pension benefits earned by the Directors in the year ended 31 December 2012 were: Transfer value Transfer value Accrued Accrued Transfer value of accrued of accrued Increase in benefit at benefit at Increase in of net increase pension at pension at Directors transfer value 31 December 31 December period net of in accrual over 31 December 31 December contributions in less Directors CHF000 Age 2012 2011 indexation period Forex effect 2012 2011 2012 contributions Forex effect K Zhevago 39 56 41 4 11 0 24 18 4 2 0 C Mawe 51 648 495 56 97 0 348 275 25 48 0 61 Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 Remuneration Report continued Benefits Under his service agreement, Kostyantin Zhevago is entitled to 25 working days paid holiday per year.
He is also entitled to furnished accommodation in Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe if necessary for the performance of his duties which cost US$49,480 in 2012, and up to US$5,000 per annum for professional tax advice.
Under his service agreement, Chris Mawe is entitled to 25 working days paid holiday per year.
Ferrexpo AG also provides him with CHF167,790 of accommodation allowance per annum.
STIP The STIP applies to the members of the Executive Committee, excluding Mr Zhevago.
The STIP is a discretionary annual bonus scheme.
For 2012, the maximum STIP opportunity for members of the Executive Committee ranged up to 150% of salary.
Key performance indicators KPIs for 2012 were set at the start of the year for each member of the Executive Committee and were weighted to reflect the contribution of each executive to the achievement of that KPI.
KPIs during the year related to financial performance EBITDA and NOPAT, operational performance pre-stripping, production and sales volumes, safety behavioural safety initiatives and improvements in lost-time accident statistics, and personal and project performance.
Financial KPIs were adjusted, as in previous years, to take account of market and raw material cost price developments, as appropriate, to the extent that these were not under the direct control of management.
Adjustments were at the full discretion of the Committee.
The level of achievement against each of KPIs for FY2012 as determined by the Committee in the case of the relevant Executive Director is set out in the table below: Max Actual Weighting FY2012 bonus as bonus as KPI for CFO assessment % of salary % of salary Financial EBITDA Just below stretch 23% 22.5% 33.75% NOPAT Just below target 4% Operational Production Just below target 16% 22.5% 33.75% Sales volume Between threshold and target 2% CSR 10% Just below target 15% 8% Development Projects, Projects weighting 10% below target 7.3% Personal and 45% Personal and governance weighting 35% 67.5% 42.5% governance between target and stretch Total 100% 150% 102.8% No payment is made under the STIP if performance is below threshold.
For the CFO, threshold performance earns a bonus of 50% of salary, target performance 100% of salary and stretch performance 150% of salary.
The Companys overall performance in 2012 was assessed as being slightly above target.
Taking account of this, and individual performance, the Committee made an award to the CFO under the STIP of CHF649,935, equivalent to 102.8% of salary in respect of 2012.
The outcome of the KPIs for other members of the Executive Committee under the STIP, as determined by the Remuneration Committee, ranged between 59.9% and 91.1% of salary depending on the achievement of the relevant KPIs, which were weighted towards the responsibilities and targets of the executive concerned.
The STIP framework for 2013 is in line with the principles of the 2012 framework.
CSR, projects and personal KPIs continue to be set as in previous years.
Weightings for the CFO in 2013 are shown in the table below: Weighting KPI for CFO Financial EBITDA, NOPAT 22.5% Operational Production, Sales volume 20% CSR 10% Personal, Projects, Governance 47.5% Total 100% LTIP The LTIP framework was approved by shareholders at the 2008 AGM.
The LTIP provides for annual awards of performance shares and options up to an aggregate limit of 200% of salary in normal circumstances.
Total outstanding awards granted under the Plan from its inception in 2008 until the end of 2012 are equivalent to 0.20% of issued share capital.
Actual awards are made on the basis of a similar number of shares to participants at comparable levels in the organisation.
The award granted to the CFO in 2012 did not exceed 100% of salary.
As mentioned earlier, the CEO does not participate.
Awards are in the form of performance shares which vest according to the extent to which Ferrexpos three-year TSR matches or outperforms that of a comparator index.
62 Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 overview business review governance financial statements Relative TSR is the primary long-term incentive measure as the Remuneration Committee continues to believe this is the most objective external measure of the Companys success over the longer term.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the constituents of the comparator index and their weightings prior to the grant of 2012 LTIP awards and dropped Brockman Resources which was acquired by Wah Nam International Holdings in July 2012.
The constituents of the index for the last three cycles are summarised in the table below: Weighting 2010 2011 2012 Focused iron ore miners 40% Atlas Iron Brockman China Vanadium Cliffs Fortescue Metals Gindalbie Metals Kumba Iron Ore MMX Mineracao Mount Gibson Northern Iron Global diversified miners 50% Anglo American BHP Billiton Rio Tinto Vale Xstrata Single commodity emerging market miners 10% African Rainbow Minerals Alcoa Alumina Aluminium Corp of China Antofagasta Boliden ENRC Eramet First Quantum Minerals Freeport McMoRan Industrias Penoles Katanga Mining Kazakhmys KGHM Polska Miedz Lundin Mining Norilsk OZ Minerals Peabody Energy Teck Cominco Vedanta Resources TSR is calculated on a common currency basis to ensure that comparisons with international comparators listed overseas are fair.
As described in previous reports, the TSR share-price averaging period was extended from three to six months for LTIP awards granted in 2011 onwards to help improve the comparison of the management long-term incentive in relation to potential short-term movements in Ferrexpos share price or the share price of comparator companies.
The Committee has discretion to review the comparator index if any of the constituent companies is affected by corporate events such as mergers and acquisitions.
The Committee also reviews the constituents and their weightings prior to the start of each LTIP cycle in order to ensure that they remain appropriate.
In the event that the pending acquisition of Xstrata by Glencore completes, the Remuneration Committee intends to replace Xstrata with the combined entity.
63 Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 Remuneration Report continued No performance shares will vest if Ferrexpos TSR underperforms the comparator index.
20% will vest if Ferrexpos TSR is equal to Index TSR: full vesting will occur only if Ferrexpos TSR exceeds the Index by at least 8% p. a. : there will be straight-line pro-rata vesting in between those points.
In addition, for any shares to vest, the Committee must be satisfied that the recorded TSR is a fair reflection of Ferrexpos underlying business performance.
The vesting parameters are illustrated below: Dividends will accrue on performance shares over the vesting period, and be paid on shares that vest.
In the event of a change of control, awards will be pro-rated for time and performance.
The Committee will retain discretion to vary this treatment if it deems it to be in shareholders interests to do so.
2010 LTIP Award Vesting The performance period for the 2010 LTIP awards ended on 31 December 2012.
Ferrexpos TSR performance relative to the weighted index was measured by Kepler Associates.
From 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2012, Ferrexpos TSR performance was 25.4% and Index TSR was 2.1%.
This outperformance of 7.1% p. a. of Index TSR resulted in 91% of 2010 LTIP awards vesting for TSR.
The Remuneration Committee has considered the Companys overall performance and determined that the recorded TSR outperformance was a fair reflection of Ferrexpos underlying performance over the performance period and has therefore determined, in accordance with the rules of the plan that 91% of the 2010 LTIP awards vested.
2012 LTIP Awards Granted In April 2012 Chris Mawe was granted an award of shares under the LTIP over 120,000 LTIP shares.
The three year performance period over which TSR performance will be measured began on 1 January 2012 and will end on 31 December 2014.
The constituents and weightings of the comparator index are discussed on page 63.
At the date of vesting 31 December 2012 the market price of a share was 251.2 pence.
Exit Payments Made in Year No Executive Directors left during the year.
64 Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 overview business review governance financial statements Non-executive Directors Including the Chairman Neither the Chairman nor any of the Non-executive Directors has a service contract with the Company: however, each has entered into a letter of appointment with the Company.
The Non-executive Directors are each appointed for an initial period of three years, and their appointments may then be renewed on a three-yearly basis, subject to re-election when appropriate by the Company in general meeting: in 2011 the Company adopted the practice of annual re-election of all Directors.
Unless otherwise determined, neither the Company nor the Director concerned may give less than three months notice of termination of the appointment.
The Non-executive Directors fees are reviewed each year in light of the time commitment and level of involvement that Non-executive Directors are required to devote to the activities of the Board and its committees, market practice, and surveys by Kepler Associates.
The current fees are: Role Fee Chairman fee US$500,000 Non-executive Director base fee US$150,000 Committee chairman fee US$40,000 The Chairmans fee and the Non-executive Directors fees were last increased in 2011.
