Directors remuneration report Dear Shareholder, I am pleased to introduce the Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 March 2012 which has been prepared bythe Remuneration Committee the Committee and approved by the Board.
2011 12 has presented a challenging external environment for Burberry given economic conditions and world events.
Theglobal economic outlook remains uncertain.
The level of executive pay has been under intense scrutiny with various reform proposals made across the political spectrum.
The Committee understands the public concern where pay is awarded in the absence of good performance, but it believes that management should be rewarded where there has been genuine achievement and exceptionally where there has been exceptional performance.
We believe that this approach is in the best interests of Burberry and its shareholders.
Against this backdrop, Burberry has continued its strong growth trajectory, with another year of record profits.
This sustained growth is the result of our strategic investment in the Brand.
Shareholders have had exceptional returns.
In the five years to 31 March 2012, Burberrys share price has increased by 129% and Adjusted profit Before Tax grew by 192m.
An investor with 100 Burberry shares worth 653 on 1 April 2007 would at 31 March 2012 have a shareholding worth 1,676 which represents a 157% return on investment assuming dividends are reinvested in Burberry shares.
The Committee aims to ensure that directors and senior executives remuneration is globally competitive so as to attract and retain high calibre individuals and is strongly aligned to performance and a sustainable increase in shareholder value.
Taking allthe factors into account and the overall levels of reward delivered in the year, the Committee did not make grants to senior executives under the Burberry Senior Executive Restricted Share Plan the RSP in 2011 12, nor did it increase the Chief Executive Ofcers base salary.
In addition, the performance condition for the vesting of the matching shares under the Burberry Co-Investment Plan the CIP was increased so as to be made more challenging.
The Groups remuneration policy is set out on page 85 and the current intention is that this will continue to be the policy for the coming year.
However, the Committee reviews the policy on a regular basis, taking into account the performance and growth of the business and the global luxury goods sector.
The Committee also considers the Groups policy against regulatory developments, shareholder expectations and global market practice.
I have decided to step down as Chairman of the Committee, after five years in that position.
I believe that it is important for the Committee to be refreshed from time to time to continue to demonstrate its ongoing independence.
While I will continue to serve as a member of the Committee, Ian Carter will suceed me as Chairman with effect from the close of the Groups Annual General Meeting in July.
I would like to thank shareholders for their support and I am sure that under Ians chairmanship the Committee will continue its responsive and responsible approach to remuneration which has served shareholders well.

The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Groups website at burberryplc.
The Board reviewed the performance of the Committee in the year.
This review concluded that the Committee operated independently and effectively.
The Board believes that the collective experience of its members enables the Committee to give a balanced view on remuneration matters.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is a matter for the Board as a whole.
No director is involved in any discussions as to their own remuneration.
During the year, the Committee met formally on two occasions.
Details of attendance at those meetings are set out in the Corporate Governance report on page 76.
84 Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011 12 At the invitation of the Committee, except where their own remuneration was being discussed, Angela Ahrendts Chief Executive officer, Stacey Cartwright Executive Vice President, Chief Financial officer, Michael Mahony Chief Corporate Affairs officer & General Counsel, Anne-Soline Thorndike Vice President Reward and Recognition and Catherine Sukmonowski Company Secretary attended Committee meetings during the period under review and provided advice thatmaterially assisted the Committee.
In 2011, the Committee appointed Towers Watson as advisor.
Towers Watson provides advice on the ongoing operation ofemployee and executive share plans together with advice on executive remuneration.
A term of the engagement between theCommittee and Towers Watson is that any additional consulting services provided by Towers Watson to management are reported on a regular basis to the Committee.
Where an actual or potential conict may occur, such work is agreed by the Chairman of the Committee prior to commencement.
Since appointment, Towers Watson has provided market benchmarking information to management in relation to a small number of roles which fall below the remit of Committee review.
Towers Watson is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group, which is responsible for the development and maintenance ofthe voluntary Code of Conduct that clearly sets out the role of executive remuneration consultants and the professional standards by which they advise their clients.
Remuneration Policy The Committee believes the Groups remuneration should be internationally competitive and strongly linked to performance, taking into account the global markets in which it operates.
The Groups remuneration policy is based on the following principles: Shareholder value: remuneration should be closely aligned with long term value creation for shareholders through thoughtful selection of performance measures as described on the following pages, emphasis on variable pay and delivery of a significant proportion of remuneration in shares, some of which are expected to be retained in accordance with the Groups shareholding policy: Linked to success of the business: the overall remuneration framework should provide a balance between short and long term business objectives.
Variable pay for executive directors includes 1 an annual cash bonus based on Adjusted profit Before Tax as per the audited income statement Adjusted PBT, and 2 long-term share-based incentives linked primarily to increases in shareholder value and growth in Adjusted PBT: and Competitive in the global talent market: total remuneration should be sufficient to attract, motivate and retain exceptional talent within the global luxury goods sector.
Total remuneration for executive directors and other senior executives is therefore benchmarked against Burberrys main global competitors and comparable UK companies.
The Committee recognises that, for each executive, the relative importance of each of these benchmarks may be different.
Benets are based on competitive market practice for each executive, depending on individual circumstances.
The principle of shareholder alignment is reected throughout the organisation through our all employee share plans, which are where possible extended to all eligible Burberry employees globally.
During its deliberations on executive remuneration, the Committee considered the reward framework for all employees worldwide, ensuring that the principles stated therein are consistent with the executive remuneration policy.
Merit increases awarded to executives also occur within the broader all employee structure, and executive share plans are extended through the organisation to senior executives and high potential employees where appropriate.
Details of the remuneration policy for the Chairman and non-executive directors are set out on page 91.
Remuneration structure Remuneration is structured such that for executive directors and other senior executives, performance-related elements represent the majority of total potential remuneration.

In a year of target performance, the ratio is 1:1.
This is a critical retention tool.
Below target performance, the match does not operate.
Matching shares are subject to a performance condition.
25% of the award may vest if growth in Adjusted PBT achieves 5% per annum over the three year period, with full vesting where Adjusted PBT exceeds 10% per annum over the three year period with vesting occuring on a straight line basis between these points.
Restricted Share Plan 3, 4 and 5 The level of vesting is determined at the end of a three year performance period: To focus executives on years Adjusted PBT growth: currently 25% vesting for growth of 5% per annum through sustainable long-term to 100% vesting for growth of 15% per annum.
For senior executives, TSR against a comparator group: 25% vesting for median TSR rising to 100% vesting for TSR equal to the upper quartile.
TheTSR group for this award comprised, Coach, Compagnie Financire Richemont, Este Lauder, Fossil, Geox, Herms International, Hugo Boss, Inditex, Liz Claiborne, Luxottica Group, LVMH Mot Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Nike, Nordstrom, Polo Ralph Lauren, PPR, Saks, Swatch, Tiffany & Co, andTods.
The Committee chose TSR relative to a group of Burberrys peers because itfeltthat this is an objective measure of the Groups success and aligns with shareholder interests.
Growth in Adjusted PBT was chosen as it continues tobe the primary measure used by management and the Committee believes strong growth in pre-tax profit is key to delivering superior shareholder returns.
Once the level of performance has been determined, vesting is phased: half of the award vests on the third anniversary of grant, 25% on the fourth, and the remaining award on the fifth.
