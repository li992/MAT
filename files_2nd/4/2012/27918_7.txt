The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Report of the Board to the shareholders on directors remuneration INTRODUCTORY CHAIRMANS LETTER Dear shareholder The year ended 30 September 2012 has seen the Group make good progress which has contributed to a signi cant increase in pro ts.
The Committee has sought to re ect this performance in a responsible manner in the decisions it has made in the year.
During the year the Committee conducted a review of all aspects of its policy on executive director remuneration.
This concluded that the current policy remains broadly appropriate save that the performance metrics used for future awards of long-term incentives LTIs should be altered.
As a result, future awards of LTIs will have a reduced weighting on relative Total Shareholder Return TSR, whilst an Earnings Per Share EPS performance condition will be introduced.
The Committee also reviewed its terms of reference in light of current best practice and a revised version of the Committees terms of reference is available on request from the Company Secretary.
The key decisions made by the Committee during the year are as follows: Salaries for 2013 have been increased by 3%, broadly in line with increases to other employees Performance bonuses of 175% of salary for Mr Terrington and Mr Keen, 125% of salary for Mr Heron and 200% for Mr Woodman have been awarded Awards of performance shares over shares with a market value of 200% of salary, vesting of half of which is subject to a relative TSR performance condition measured against the constituents of the FTSE-250 index excluding investment trusts and vesting of half of which is subject to an EPS performance condition measured against a retail price index related target, will be awarded shortly The Committee consulted with major shareholders prior to nalising the decisions above and received broad support The existing Performance Share Plan will expire in 2013 and the Committee is asking shareholders to approve a replacement plan at the AGM in 2013, details of which are given in the notice of AGM being sent to you with these accounts.
The Board is aware of and supports the requirements for additional remuneration related disclosures announced by BIS earlier this year and will seek to comply with the revised requirements when they are nalised.

Remuneration committee During the year, the Committee consisted of Alan Fletcher who chaired the Committee, Peter Hartill, Edward Tilly, Terence Eccles until his resignation from the Board on 31 March 2012, Christopher Newell until his resignation from the Board on 31 October 2011 and Fiona Clutterbuck following her appointment to the Board on 12 September 2012, all of whom were independent non-executive directors, and the Chairman of the Company, Robert Dench.
None of the non-executive directors who sit on the Committee has any personal financial interest other than as a shareholder, con ict of interest arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Chairman of the Company does not participate in discussions on his own remuneration.
The Committee determines the Companys policy on executive remuneration and speci c compensation packages for each of the executive directors and the Chairman.
No director contributes to any discussion about his own remuneration.
The Committee also reviews the level and structure of remuneration of senior management.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on request from the Company Secretary.
In determining the directors remuneration for the year, the Committee consulted Mr N S Terrington Chief Executive about its proposals.
The Committee also retains New Bridge Street NBS, a brand of Aon Hewitt Limited part of AON plc, as its independent advisor on remuneration matters.
NBS also advised the Company on various sundry remuneration matters during the year, which did not con ict with its advice to the Committee.
Aon Hewitt provided administration services to the trustees of the Group Retirement Bene ts Plan during the year.
Report of the Board to the shareholders on directors remuneration 25 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Remuneration policy for the Chairman and executive directors The Companys policy is to ensure that the Chairman and the executive directors are fairly rewarded for their individual performance, having regard to the importance of retention and motivation.
The performance measurement of the Chairman and the executive directors and the determination of their annual remuneration packages are undertaken by the Committee.
In forming and reviewing remuneration policy the Committee has given full consideration to the UK Corporate Governance Code and has complied with the Codes provisions relating to directors remuneration throughout the year.
Moreover, the Committee has given due regard to the link between remuneration and strategy, seeking to ensure that the remuneration structures in place do not encourage excessive risk or activities that are not in line with the agreed strategy.
The remuneration packages of the individual directors are assessed after a review of their individual performances and an assessment of comparable positions in the financial sector and within a group of pan-sectoral comparators comprising a number of FTSE-250 companies with market capitalisations similar to the Groups, there now being no directly comparable financial services businesses in the UK.
The executive directors receive a combination of xed and performance-related elements of remuneration.
Fixed remuneration consists of salary, bene ts in kind and pension scheme contributions see under Pension contributions below.
Performance-related remuneration consists of participation in the annual bonus plan, the award of shares under the PSP and invitations to participate in the award of shares under the MSP from time to time.
The performance-related elements of remuneration are intended to provide a signi cant proportion of executive directors potential total remuneration.
No award will be made under the MSP in the year to 30 September 2013.
The Committee pays due regard to the levels of remuneration within the Group when determining the remuneration of executive directors and other senior employees.
It also seeks to ensure that the incentive structure for senior management does not raise environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
Salary The Chairmans fees and executive directors salaries are determined by the Committee at the beginning of each year.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers remuneration levels within the Group as a whole, individual and business performance during the year and in the past has relied on objective research which gives up-to-date information on comparable FTSE-250 companies.
Directors contracts of service will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
In view of the progress made by the Group during the year, the Committee has agreed that the Chairmans fee and executive directors salaries will be increased by 3% from 1 October 2012.
This is in line with increases for the Groups wider workforce.
The current salaries of the executive directors with effect from 1 October 2012 are as follows: Mr Terrington 434,750 Mr Keen 325,500 Mr Heron 231,750 Mr Woodman 231,750 Pension contributions During the year the executive directors were members of the Group Retirement Bene ts Plan the Plan, to which the Company contributes at the same rate as for all members.
Dependants of executive directors who are members of the Plan are eligible for a dependants pension and the payment of a lump sum in the event of death in service.
The pension arrangements provide for a pension of 1 37.5 of basic annual salary to a maximum of 2 3 for every year of eligible service.
Where pension contributions are capped, additional payments are made to enable further provision.
Prior to the beginning of the year, Mr Terrington and Mr Heron suspended their contributions to the Plan, and the accrual of bene ts.
This followed an offer to each director affected by the 2006 A-Day changes of the opportunity to terminate permanently further contributions in exchange for a cash supplement calculated to equate to the cost of the Companys contributions towards the executives future service bene ts had he stayed within the Plan for his future service accrual, whilst retaining the salary linkage in respect of past service.
26 Report of the Board to the shareholders on directors remuneration The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Following an offer by the Company to senior employees to contain the volatility of costs associated with the provision of bene ts under the Plan, Mr Keen and Mr Woodman each ceased pension accrual prior to the beginning of the year in return for a cash supplement calculated to equate to the cost of the Companys contributions towards future service bene ts had he stayed with the Plan for his future service accrual.
The changes in pension entitlements arising in the financial year, the disclosure of which is required by the Financial Services Authority, are given on pages 32 and 33.
There have been no changes in the terms of directors pension entitlements during the year.
There are no unfunded promises or similar arrangements for directors.
Performance bonuses The purpose of the bonus is to provide a meaningful cash incentive focused on improving the performance of the Company through the achievement of a number of predetermined objectives.
The bonus payable to executive directors under the bonus scheme is capped at 200% of salary.
100% of salary is awarded for delivery of the base business plan and agreed objectives, with achievement of the planned pro t level forming a major element.
Up to 50% additional award might be given for achievement of signi cantly higher pro ts than planned, together with other notable successes over and above the agreed objectives.
Up to a further 50% might be awarded for performance in excess of the stretch this could only be achieved for exceptional performance.
To determine the bonus payable, the Committee assessed performance against a number of objectives which were set at the start of the financial year.
Mr Terrington and Mr Keen were assessed against a balanced scorecard of strategic, financial and operational targets, including operating pro t, cash generation, cost control, the development of the Groups new lending business, borrower retention and the development and delivery of new strategies to enhance existing income streams.
These performance measures are designed to promote the long-term success of the Company by linking to the strategy and speci c risk factors faced by the Company.
Mr Heron was assessed 50% against the balanced scorecard and 50% against speci c new business related objectives.
Mr Woodman was assessed 50% against the balanced scorecard and 50% against objectives related to the development of new income streams, such as acquisitions and servicing contracts.
In determining bonus levels the Committee has considered the performance of the executive directors and of the Company in relation to the adverse economic and market conditions prevailing during the year.
The directors have exceeded their target bonus objectives to deliver the Groups strategy including, inter alia, revenue generation, portfolio acquisitions and third party servicing contracts, the effective and ef cient management of the extant book including optimising value by maintaining low redemption and arrears rates, maximising cash ow and the development of new lending and refreshing the Groups systems capabilities to increase business capacity, competitiveness and broaden capabilities.
A bonus of 175% of salary has been earned by each of Mr Terrington and Mr Keen for the year.
This bonus re ects very strong individual performance and the exceeding of stretch company performance targets in terms of pro ts, cash generated, arrears performance, portfolio acquisition and servicing contracts and customer retention.
A bonus of 125% of salary has been earned by Mr Heron following strong individual performance, the building up of business volumes during the year whilst concentrating on high quality borrowers and improving the processing ef ciency within the new lending business.
A bonus of 200% of salary has been earned by Mr Woodman, re ecting outstanding performance in addition to delivering the successful completion of attractive portfolio acquisitions during the year.
Bonus amounts in excess of 50,000 are subject to compulsory 25% deferral, whereby the deferred amount less any clawback in the event of misstatement or misconduct, which can be applied by the Committee in certain speci c circumstances, is payable in shares after three years.
In the case of Mr Woodman, this provision applies to his bonus up to and including 150%, with the amount in excess of 150% being subjected to a 50% deferral.
The Chairman and non-executive directors are not entitled to receive a bonus and do not participate in the PSP or the MSP.
Report of the Board to the shareholders on directors remuneration 27 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Share awards Executive directors are eligible for awards under the PSP and are entitled to participate in the Paragon UK Sharesave Plan 2009, on the same terms as other employees.
Paragon Performance Share Plan PSP The PSP has an annual award limit to an individual of shares worth 200% of salary.
Awards under the PSP are made from time to time at the discretion of the Committee and during the year the executive directors were granted awards over shares equal to 200% of salary.
Awards over shares with a market value of 200% of salary will be granted to the executive directors in the year to 30 September 2013.
PSP awards which were granted on or after 21 May 2009 are subject to a performance condition comparing the rank of the Companys TSR against a comparator group of companies comprising the constituents of the FTSE-250 on the date of grant over the three years commencing on the date of grant.
25% of awards vest for median performance, increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for upper quartile performance.
The FTSE-250 was chosen because it is a broad-based index and because of the lack of comparable listed financial services organisations at the current time.
The performance conditions are reviewed prior to each future grant to ensure that they remain the most suitable in the Companys prevailing circumstances.
The Committee believed that at the time of the grants TSR re ected the best measure to align the performance conditions applied with the best interests of the shareholders.
Following discussions with shareholders, the Committee has determined that for awards granted during the financial year ending 30 September 2013, 50% of awards will be subject to the TSR test and 50% will be subject to an EPS test.
In addition, prior to any awards vesting, the Committee must be satis ed that the requirements of a financial underpin test have been met.
Whilst the use of TSR as the sole performance measure for grants in prior years was considered by the Committee to be an appropriate measure to re ect the Companys objectives, with the business now on a stable footing and improved visibility of future earnings, the Committee now intends to include a financial measure.
The EPS test will apply such that 25% of EPS tested awards will vest where EPS growth is equal to the increase in the retail price index plus 3%, increasing on a straight line basis to full vesting for EPS growth equal to the increase in the retail price index plus 7% or more.
EPS is considered appropriate as the second condition as the activities of the Company in developing its new lending and other income streams should result in improvements to pro tability and including a pro t measure such as EPS will be re ective of long term performance.
It also provides a balance to relative TSR, which is a measure of market expectations of future performance.
Awards are structured as nil cost options with a ten year life.
Paragon Matching Share Plan MSP Under the terms of the MSP, executive directors and senior management may, at the discretion of the Committee, be invited to invest in shares in the Company out of their after-tax cash bonus.
Assuming that the executives decide to invest, the shares acquired must remain held by the executives for three years.
At the end of the three-year period and, subject to satisfaction of performance criteria determined by the Committee, the executives will receive a match in shares on a two-for-one basis related to the number of shares which could have been purchased with the pre-tax equivalent of the bonus invested.
Executive directors will normally be invited to invest the after-tax equivalent of up to 25% of salary: at such a level, their award is over free performance-linked matching shares worth 50% of salary.
The MSP provides the facility to increase the level of potential investment up to the after-tax equivalent of 50% of salary should the Remuneration Committee feel in future years that this would be appropriate.

Mr N S Terrington, Mr N Keen, Mr J A Heron and Mr R J Woodman were members of the Group fide ned bene t pension plan during the year.
The amounts shown below describe their entitlement in accordance with paragraph LR 9.8.

The pension entitlements for Messrs Terrington and Heron continue to be linked to pensionable salaries, while Messrs Keen and Woodman elected on 1 April 2011 that their bene ts would no longer be linked to pensionable salaries and their accrued pension gures have, therefore, been calculated based on a date of leaving of 1 April 2011 with deferred pension revaluation, where relevant.
The increase in accrued pension during the year and transfer value of the increase excludes any increase for in ation.
The transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the Occupational Pensions Schemes Transfer Values Regulations 1996 and the Occupational Pensions Schemes Transfer Values Amendment Regulations 2008, in force from 1 October 2008.
Members of the plan have the option to pay Additional Voluntary Contributions: neither the contributions nor the resulting bene ts are included in the above table.

32 Report of the Board to the shareholders on directors remuneration The Paragon Group of Companies PLC The pension entitlements for Messrs Terrington and Heron continue to be linked to pensionable salaries, while Messrs Keen and Woodman elected on 1 April 2011 that their bene ts would no longer be linked to pensionable salaries and their accrued pension gures have, therefore, been calculated based on a date of leaving of 1 April 2011 with deferred pension revaluation, where relevant.
The contributions shown are those paid or payable by the directors under the terms of the plan.
No contributions have been paid in the year by the directors, as they had all elected to cease future pensionable service in the plan before the start of the year.
The increases in transfer values as shown in the final column largely re ect the changes in assumptions underlying the transfer value basis as at 30 September 2012 and 30 September 2011, due to changes in financial conditions.
The increases also allow for the fact that the accrued pension is a year closer to the assumed date of payment.
The transfer value at 30 September 2012 has been calculated on the basis of the Occupational Pensions Schemes Transfer Values Amendment Regulations 2008.
The trustees are responsible for the assumptions and calculation of transfer values, having taken advice from the scheme actuary.
The transfer values disclosed above do not represent a sum either paid or currently payable to the individual director by the Group or the scheme.
Instead they represent a potential liability of the pension scheme should the director request a transfer, calculated at the balance sheet date.
During the year the Group made contributions in respect of further pension provision of 150,000 2011: 134,000 for Mr N S Terrington, 192,000 2011: 157,000 for Mr N Keen, 78,000 2011: 67,000 for Mr J A Heron and 61,000 for Mr R J Woodman following his appointment.
