Remuneration report A letter from the Remuneration Committee Chairman Dear fellow shareholder, On behalf of the Board and the Remuneration Committee, I present the Xstrata plc 2012 Remuneration report.
Last year, we revised the format and content of the Remuneration report to provide a clear explanation of our rationale for determining remuneration policy, annual awards and longer-term incentives, a format that we have continued in this years report.
2012 has been a year of particular significance for our shareholders due to the proposed merger with Glencore which was approved by shareholders on 20 November 2012.
However, the Remuneration Committee has considered and determined all elements of remuneration solely in the context of assessing the Groups achievements and, where relevant, individual performance on a standalone basis during 2012.
Our remuneration policy continues to aim to attract, retain and motivate the high-performing individuals we rely on to deliver our business strategy and create long-term value.
We believe that performance-related pay should incentivise exceptional performance and that rewards should be closely linked to and commensurate with performance.
As a result, performance-related pay represents a significant portion of total pay for all managers across Xstrata.
For executive directors, at risk performance-related pay typically represents more than 80% of total available remuneration.
We measure performance against a broad range of health and safety, sustainability, financial and operational criteria.
We benchmark our remuneration against the global mining industry and our primary peer group, as well as global FTSE 100 companies.
Further detail regarding our remuneration policy is set out in the following pages.
It is the Remuneration Committees intention to continue to apply this remuneration policy in the future for as long as Xstrata remains an independent, listed company.
During 2012, we considered executive salary increases and 2012 individual performance bonuses with due consideration for a background of heightened focus on executive pay and current market conditions for global mining companies.
We made grants of awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan and administered vesting of awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan and Added Value Plan but did not make any changes to plan design of long term incentives arrangements.
Full details regarding these activities during 2012 are set out in the following pages.

For the financial year ending 31 December 2012, Xstratas ROCE must be at least equal to Xstratas average cost of borrowing in order for any bonus pool to be available.
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to vary the basis of calculation and performance targets in future years.
At the end of the financial year, the Remuneration Committee also actively considers whether the proposed bonus pool is appropriate in light of other key financial and non-financial performance measures, which include, but are not limited to health and safety, environmental, sustainability and community performance Performance assessment Individual awards are dependent on a holistic assessment of individual performance criteria, which incorporate and award determination a wide range of financial and non-financial measures, including health and safety, employee development, environment and sustainability, profit and cash generation, volume, project execution and other criteria agreed in advance and evaluated by the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee takes into account the outlook for the business and the broader market environment as well as achievements during the year.
It also makes a judgement on how performance is achieved as well as the outcomes, for example, by assessing the robustness of processes and management actions Terms of payment and The maximum bonus award is 300% of salary.

Awards between 200% and 300% of salary are delivered in restricted shares or nil-cost of awards options deferred for two years.
Regarding awards in respect of 2012 performance and due to the expected imminent completion of the merger with Glencore International plc, the Remuneration Committee determined to defer awards in excess of 100% of salary in cash pending completion.
Deferred awards vest or become exercisable in the event of a change in control, cessation of employment by reason of death, injury, ill health or disability in each of which case they vest or are exercisable immediately or retirement in which case they vest or become exercisable on the normal deferred vesting date.

Last awards made under this plan were in February 2012 now closed to new awards.
Its rules will continue to apply for all outstanding awards granted under it.
We consulted with a number of Xstrata shareholders and shareholder bodies throughout the fourth quarter of 2011 and received a broad range of views and comments on our proposals for a replacement LTIP.
On 7 February 2012, Xstrata and Glencore announced a proposed merger of the two companies to be effected by a Scheme of Arrangement of Xstrata under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006, the terms of which are reflected in a document sent to shareholders in Xstrata dated 25 October 2012, and which was approved by shareholders at a meeting on 20 November 2012.
Consequently, while a revision to our proposed LTIP design was underway following the initial shareholder consultations, we have now postponed plans to consult with shareholders and representative bodies on our revised LTIP design in light of the pending merger with Glencore.
In the event Xstrata remains a standalone company and any a new LTIP is proposed, we will further consult with shareholders in advance Other conditions for Awards vest or become exercisable in the event of a change in control, cessation of employment by reason release of award of death, injury, ill health or disability in each of which case they vest or are exercisable immediately and in full or retirement in which case they vest or become exercisable on the normal vesting date subject to satisfaction of the performance conditions.
No unvested awards will vest or become exercisable in the event of cessation by dismissal for cause.
com 49 Remuneration report continued Plan design Participants Executive directors and the other members of the Executive Committee and those employees with the ability to influence shareholder value.
Style of award An award under the LTIP comprises a conditional award of shares performance shares and a grant of market value share options, the values of which are measured at face value for performance shares and at BlackScholes value for share options.
Awards are structured to ensure an equal weighting between the value of performance shares and share options.
For the 2012 award, the value of one option was independently assessed as 36.3% of the market value of one share.
Performance period Awards vest on the third anniversary of grant, subject to satisfaction of the performance conditions and other award terms.
Performance conditions For executive directors, and assuming other conditions for early release or vesting of awards do not apply as set out below 50% of awards are subject to relative TSR performance measured against a bespoke peer group of companies as shown below: Teck Resources B Anglo American Korea Zinc BHP Billiton GMexico B Impala Platinum MMC Norilsk Nickel Aurubis Freeport-Mcmor.
& GD Peabody Energy Rio Tinto Alcoa Vale Arch Coal Vedanta Resources Eramet For the portion of the award subject to TSR performance there is zero vesting for below median performance, 50% vests for median performance and full vesting occurs for a performance ranking above the 80th percentile, with vesting between median performance and the 80th percentile assessed on a sliding scale basis.
The remaining 50% of the award vests subject to real cost-saving targets.
Annualised cost savings over the three year performance period equal to at least 1% of the operational cost base allow 10% vesting, 2% cost savings delivers 70% vesting and awards vest in full upon achieving 3% or more cost savings.
There is straight-line vesting between each of these points.
Real cost savings are measured in relation to operating costs after adjusting for the effects of inflation, exceptional events items such as natural disasters, excluding depreciation, commodity price-linked costs, effects of currencies on translation of local currency costs and planned life of mine adjustments.
Other conditions for release Awards vest or become exercisable in the event of a change in control, cessation of employment by reason of award of death, injury, ill health or disability in each of which case they vest or are exercisable immediately and in full or retirement in which case they vest or become exercisable on the normal vesting date subject to satisfaction of the performance conditions.
LTIP awards vesting during 2012 The table below sets out the level of vesting for executive directors for the 2009 award series under the LTIP which vested on 13 March 2012: % of real cost % of TSR Annualised % savings element Xstratas TSR rank element vesting real cost savings vesting Total % vesting 2009 award 6th out of 17 38.89% 3% 50% 88.89% Further details of vesting awards are set out on pages 55 to 57 of this report.
Outstanding LTIP awards The outstanding 2010, 2011 and 2012 LTIP awards will vest in full upon a change of control and therefore will vest in full in the event that the Scheme of Arrangement for the merger with Glencore International plc is sanctioned.
Otherwise, the extent to which the 2010, 2011 and 2012 awards may vest overall will depend upon Xstratas TSR ranking and the extent to which the real cost savings targets are met at the end of the respective performance periods in accordance with the plan rules.
com Added Value Plan AVP Purpose Incentivise Chief Executive by providing a share of the long-term value of Xstrata created for shareholders Reward positive growth of Xstrata Create alignment with shareholders by requiring the Chief Executive Officer to maintain a share-holding of 350,000 ordinary shares in order to participate in the AVP Policy Awards made to Chief Executive only Last award made under this plan was in 2009 now closed to new awards Performance measured by means of Xstratas TSR three-year for Phase 1 awards and five-year for Phase 2 awards growth relative to an index of global mining companies Link to strategy Rewards growth in Xstratas value over and above that created by Xstratas peer companies Risk management Reward deferral in shares ensures a focus on long-term sustainable performance and aligns management interests with shareholders Extended performance period smoothes TSR performance Plan design Participant The Chief Executive was the only participant of the AVP, which is now closed to any further awards.
Style of award Reward under the AVP is based upon the growth in Xstratas TSR over the relevant performance period relative to an index of global mining companies that form the TSR index.
Performance period Performance is assessed over periods of three years Phase 1 and, if applicable, five years Phase 2 from the date of award.
Performance condition At the end of a Phase 1 performance period, Xstratas TSR is calculated and compared to the TSR index which determines the added value created for shareholders over the performance period.
If this figure is positive, it is multiplied by a participation percentage which is 0.3% for the 2009 plan cycle to calculate the Phase 1 base reward.
No payments will be made if Xstrata underperforms against the TSR index.
There is a cap which applies to the calculation at the end of the Phase 1 performance period.
If the cap has been applied then the Chief Executive will become eligible for Phase 2 of the plan cycle.
At the end of the Phase 2 performance period, the calculation will be carried out in the same way as at the end of Phase 1, but only to the extent that performance exceeds the applicable cap.
The absolute value received by shareholders is higher when outperforming a rising market than outperforming a market which is static or falling.
Consequently, two modifiers are applied.
Firstly, awards are adjusted in line with the Xstrata share price index.
Secondly, awards are adjusted in line with Xstratas absolute performance.
For the 2009 plan cycle, for absolute TSR of 25% or above, a multiplier of 1 will be applied: and for absolute TSR of -25% or below, a multiplier of 0.5 will be applied.
Between -25% and 25%, straight-line interpolation will apply.
Provided Xstratas TSR is at least equal to the TSR index, the Phase 1 final reward under each plan cycle will be at least $1 million.
The TSR and share price indices are weighted by market capitalisation.
The comparator group for the 2009 open plan cycle comprises relevant global mining firms.
This group is identical to that used for the LTIP described above.
Terms of payment and 50% of the final reward for a phase of a plan cycle is payable in cash or in shares, as determined by the deferral and other Remuneration Committee, as soon as practicable following determination of the final reward for that phase conditions for release by the Remuneration Committee.
Of the remaining 50% of a Phase 1 final reward, 25% shall be deferred for of awards a period of one year and 25% shall be deferred for a period of two years.
In the event of a change of control, all deferred awards vest and become exercisable.
