54 Hays PLC AnnuAl RepoRt & FinAnciAl StAtementS 2012 REmunERAtiOn REpORt DEAR SHAREHOLDER As the new Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to present the report of the Board covering the remuneration practice for the Company for the 2012 financial year and the policy to be applied in 2013.
During the 2012 financial year, we have seen increasing public scrutiny of executive remuneration and concern around pay for failure amidst challenging economic conditions.
The Committee is very aware of its responsibilities in this regard and our remuneration policy is premised on there being a strong link between reward and individual and Group performance.
The remuneration policy applied in 2012 was unchanged from that in 2011.
With the exception of the introduction of malus provisions into the long-term incentive plans operated by the Company, no changes to the remuneration policy are proposed for 2013.
In line with corporate governance principles and emerging pAuL HARRiSOn remuneration market practice, the Committee considers it appropriate to introduce committee chairman malus provisions, which will enable it to reduce or eliminate awards granted under the Deferred Annual Bonus plan DAB and the Performance Share Plan PSP in cases of material misstatement of accounts.

Matching shares were awarded to the directors, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions over a three-year period ending on 30 June 2011.
The number of matching shares was determined by reference to the pre-tax amount of deferred bonus.
On 26 March 2010, in order to enable directors underpinning shares to be held on a post-tax basis and as fully described in the 2010 Remuneration Report, the Committee accepted the waiver of certain deferred rights and awarded vested special awards for no monetary consideration representing the original awards plus dividend equivalent shares accrued up to the date of award of the special awards.
The special awards otherwise continued to be subject to the same restrictions and conditions as applied to the original awards.
The matching awards and associated conditions remained unchanged.
At the end of the restricted period on 18 October 2011, the vested special awards were released.
The market prices per share on the original date of award was 73.5 pence, on the date of award of the vested special award was 108.8 pence, and on the date of release was 73.1 pence.
2 The matching awards vested on 18 October 2011 as to 59.4% of shares under the award, calculated as 78.1% of the Cumulative International Net Fees performance condition one-third of the award, 100% of the Cumulative Cash Conversion performance condition one-third of the award and 0% of the Cumulative Earnings per Share performance condition one-third of the award.
The market prices per share on the date of the award was 73.5 pence and on the date of vesting was 73.1 pence.
3 Together with their vested special award and matching shares see Notes 1 and 2, dividend equivalent shares in respect of the matching share awards were released to the directors in two tranches, on 18 October 2011 when the market price was 73.1 pence per share and on 9 November 2011 following the approval of the 2011 final dividend when the market price was 73.7 pence per share.
The shares released in the second tranche related to 24.1% of the aggregate dividend equivalent shares.
4 The directors were required to defer 70% of their bonuses for the 2008 09 financial year into shares subject to a three-year restricted period.
The award in respect of 45% of the bonus earned was deferred on a pre-tax basis and is addressed in the first table opposite.
