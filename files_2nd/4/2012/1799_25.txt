Our Governance | Remuneration Report Remuneration Report Dear Shareholder I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committees report for 2012 on Directors remuneration.
The Government has recently tabled proposals to reform the way that Directors remuneration is voted upon and reported.
Although the new legislative requirements will not come into effect until October 2013, the Committee hassought to comply with many of the new requirements in the interests of openness and transparency.
Accordinglywe have split this report into two sections: t a Policy Report which sets out the forward looking policy on the remuneration of the executive and non-executive Directors for 2013 t an Implementation Report which discloses how the current remuneration policy has been implemented in the year ended 31 December 2012.
We will be seeking your support for both parts of the report by way of a single advisory vote at the forthcoming AGM.
The Group continues to face challenging trading conditions in many of its traditional construction markets and is taking action to improve operational performance and effectiveness.
Underlying pre-tax profit from continuing operations, which is the measure on which we base performance for the Annual Incentive Plan AIP, decreased 7% to 310 million in 2012, including the benefit of 52 million of gains from PPP disposals.
The Groups financial performance for 2012 has therefore generated outturns from the AIP for the executive Directors of 48% of base salary, which is below target and signicantly lower thanthe 78% of base salary for the previous year.
Furthermore, the 2010 Performance Share Plan awards will lapse infull in April 2013 as the 2009 Performance Share Plan awards did in April 2012.
We believe that this represents a fairlink between reward and performance for the year under review.
We remain committed to ensuring that rewards for executives are closely aligned to the interests of shareholders through having all of our incentive arrangements linked to the achievement of challenging business performance targetsand generation of market beating levels of shareholder return.
We remain comfortable that this is the case.
We are not proposing any major changes to the remuneration policy for the 2013 financial year, although the suite ofperformance metrics used in the Annual Incentive Plan and Performance Share Plan will change for 2013.
More specically, 30% of the annual incentive will be subject to three business strategy metrics with 70% continuing to be subject to profit before tax.
Furthermore the earnings per share performance condition attaching to the Performance Share Plan awards will be removed and replaced with an additional relative total shareholder return condition.
Further details of these changes, which have been made following shareholder consultation, are contained in the Policy Report.
Salaries of executive Directors are due to be reviewed in July 2013 but it has already been agreed that, consistent withmany parts of the Group, executive Directors will not receive an annual increase in 2013.
The Committee encourages dialogue with the Companys shareholders and will consult with major shareholders ahead of any significant future changes to remuneration policy.
We were pleased that the 2011 Remuneration Report received a 97% vote in favour at the 2012 AGM.
Shareholders are invited to approve this report at the AGM on 16 May 2013.
Iain Ferguson Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 82 Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Our Governance Our Governance | Remuneration Report Policy Report This part of the Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policy for the Company with effect from 1 January 2013.
There have been some changes to the performance metrics used in the performance related elements of pay, which the Committee considers provide better alignment with the business strategy.
Further details of these changes are provided on pages 84 and 85.
The Committee, on behalf of the Board, determines the remuneration packages of the executive Directors of the Company and the Chairman and the Companys remuneration policy.
In setting the remuneration policy, the Committee takes into account a number offactors, including: t general trends in pay and conditions throughout the Group t the positioning of remuneration levels against the external market the Committee is, however, aware of the risk of an upward ratchet in remuneration levels through overreliance on comparative survey data t the balance between xed and variable pay more specically, variable pay should form a significant but not disproportionately highlevel of remuneration t the strategy of the business.
In setting the overall remuneration policy, general trends and average increases throughout the Group are taken into account when setting executive Directors reward packages.
A key feature for the executive Directors is that a higher proportion of their remuneration package is delivered through performance related pay, which has a greater linkage to the results of the Group.
The areas covered in this Policy Report comprise: Executive Director remuneration policy for 2013 Page 84 Remuneration scenarios for executive Directors Page 86 Service agreements for executive Directors Page 87 External appointments of executive Directors Page 87 Appointment of non-executive Directors Page 87 Non-executive Directors fees Page 87 Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2012 83 Our Governance | Remuneration Report Executive Director remuneration policy for 2013 The following table sets out a summary of each element of the executive Directors remuneration packages, their link to the Companys strategy, the policy for how these are operated, the maximum opportunity, a description of any performance metrics and any changes since 2012.

The values indicated in the graph show the share price growth plus reinvested dividends from a 100 hypothetical holding of ordinary shares in Balfour Beatty plc and in the index, and have been calculated using 30 trading day average values.
In addition, the graph shows the movements in remuneration earned by the Chief Executive for each year over the same period.

Directors base salaries in 2012 At the annual review of base salaries for the executive Directors on 1 July 2012, base salaries were reviewed as shown below: Base salary at Base salary at Name of Director 1 July 2012 1 July 2011 % uplift Duncan Magrath Note i 425,000 405,000 4.9% Andrew McNaughton Note ii 460,000 430,000 7.0% Anthony Rabin n a 450,000 n a Ian Tyler Note iii 688,000 668,000 3.0% Peter Zinkin Note iii 443,000 430,000 3.0% Notes: i The 4.9% increase was based on market and performance factors.
ii The 7.0% increase was based on market and performance factors plus an element for the additional responsibilities taken on as a result of Andrew McNaughtons additional appointment as Deputy Chief Executive.
iii The 3.0% increase was based on market and performance factors.
As part of the overall succession plan, the Board has recently announced some changes to the management team.
The Chief Executive, Ian Tyler, is leaving the Company in April 2013 and Andrew McNaughton will be succeeding him as Chief Executive, effective from 31 March 2013.
In addition, our Deputy Chief Executive, Anthony Rabin, retired from the Company on 30 June 2012.
Andrew McNaughtons base salary will be 650,000 on appointment, with other elements of his package in line with the policy set out in this report.
In line with contractual entitlements, Ian Tyler will work four months of his 12 months notice period, up to 30 April 2013, to ensure a smooth handover to Andrew McNaughton.
In lieu of the remainder of the notice period, he will receive a payment from the Company equivalent to eight months salary, benets and pension, including phased monthly payments for the four months from September to December 2013, which are subject to offset against earnings elsewhere.
Ian Tyler will be treated as a good leaver under the relevant share plans.
On 30 April 2013, his awards under the Deferred Bonus Plan will vest and a proportion of his Performance Share Plan PSP awards will lapse reecting the proportion of the performance period for each award which had not been completed at that date.
The remainder of his PSP awards will vest in the same proportion, and at the same time, as the awards made to the other participants.
At the annual review of fees for the non-executive Directors on 1 July 2012 the annual fee level for the non-executive Directors excluding the Chairman was increased from 54,000 to 56,000 and for Steve Marshall as Chairman from 258,000 to 265,750.
The annual fee for chairing Board Committees is unchanged at 10,000.
In addition the annual fee for the Senior Independent Director remains at 10,000.
For non-executive Directors based outside Europe the additional allowance for each overseas visit made on Company business remains at 2,500.
In practice, the base salary paid to Peter Zinkin has been reduced due to his participation in the Companys SMART Pensions salary sacrifice arrangement.
The salary reduction in 2012 was 6,773.
This corresponds to hiscontributions to the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund, which are now met directly by the Company as part of this arrangement.
ii The base salaries paid to Duncan Magrath, Andrew McNaughton and Peter Zinkin have been reduced due to their participation in the Companys Share Incentive Plan.
The salary reductions in 2012 were 2,625, 1,125 and 2,625 for Duncan Magrath, Andrew McNaughton and Peter Zinkin respectively.
iii All executive Directors received taxable cash supplements in lieu of some pension provision.
Further details are set out in the section on Directors pensions on pages 94 and 95. iv The performance measure for the AIP was profit before tax and non-underlying items.
The targets were set in January 2012 based on a sliding scale from threshold to target profit and from target profit to maximum.
The profit for the year ended 31 December 2012 resulted in an AIP outturn of 48.2% of base salary for each executive Director.
As Ian Tyler is leaving the business on 30 April 2013, all of his annual incentive will be paid in cash and this amount is shown in the table above.
For the other executive Directors, 50% of this annual incentive is payable in cash and these are the amounts shown in the table above.
The remaining 50% is deferred in the form of ordinary shares in the Company.
The number of shares comprising the deferred element will be determined based on the share price at the award date of 29 March 2013.
Theseshares will be released to the Director on 29 March 2016, providing he is still employed by the Company at that time.
v Hubertus Krossa received a fee of 30,000 included above for his chairmanship of the supervisory board of Balfour Beatty Rail GmbH.

iv See also notes i, ii, iii, iv, vii and xi, to the Directors remuneration table on page 90.
Directors interests in the Annual Incentive Plan in 2012 As detailed in the Policy Report, each executive Director participates in the Annual Incentive Plan, in which performance is measured over a single financial year.
For the year under review, the performance condition which applied to the Annual Incentive Plan and the resulting outturn were as follows: Proportion of total annual Resulting annual incentive available incentive outturn Note i Performance measure % of maximum % of base salary % of maximum % of base salary Threshold: 287m 6.25% 7.5% 40.2% 48.2% Actual: 309.8m profit before tax and Target: 319m 50% 60% Note ii non-underlying items Maximum: 367m 100% 120% Notes: i As Ian Tyler is leaving the business on 30 April 2013, all of his AIP outturn will be paid in cash.
For the other executive Directors, 50% of the AIP outturn will be payable in cash, whilst the remaining 50% will be deferred into shares under the Deferred Bonus Plan.
ii As set out in the rules of the AIP the Committee adjusts the profit before tax gure for acquisitions, divestments and exchange rate movements.
The adjusted profit before tax gure used for the year ended 31 December 2012 was 311.8m.
It is the Companys current intention that awards will be satisfied by shares purchased in the market.
ii For the awards in April 2010, June 2011 and April 2012 the performance periods are the three years ending 31 December 2012, 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2014 respectively.
50% of each award is subject to an earnings per share EPS growth target.
The maximum number of shares subject to this performance condition will only vest if EPS growth exceeds the retail prices index RPI by 36% for the April 2010 award and if EPS growth exceeds 45% for the June 2011 and April 2012 awards.
IfEPS growth exceeds RPI by 6% for the April 2010 award and if EPS growth exceeds 15% for the June 2011 and April 2012 awards, 25% of this part of the awards will vest.
For growth in EPS between these points, vesting will be on a pro rata basis.
No shares will vest from this part of the award if EPS growth exceeds RPI by less than 6% for the April 2010 awards or if EPS growth is less than 15% for the June 2011 and April 2012 awards.
The other 50% of each award is subject to a total shareholder return TSR target under which the TSR of the Company is compared to a comparator group at the start of the performance period.
For the 2010 award, the comparator group was based on a bespoke group of companies as previously disclosed.
For the 2011 and 2012 awards, the comparator group was the FTSE 51150 excluding investment trusts.
The maximum number of shares subject to this performance condition will only vest if the Companys TSR is in the upper quartile of the comparator group.
If the Companys TSR is equal to that of the median of the comparator group, 25% of this part of the award will vest.
No shares from this part of the award will vest if the Companys TSR is below that of the median of the comparator group.
For TSR performance between median and upper quartile, vesting will be on a pro rata basis.
There is no provision for retesting of either of the performance conditions.
iii The average middle market price of ordinary shares in the Company for the three dealing dates before the award dates, which was used for calculating the number of awards granted, was 354p for the 2009 award, 302.63p for the 2010 award, 317.78p for the 2011 award and 277.3p for the 2012 award.
The closing middle market price of ordinary shares on the date of the awards was 352.25p, 302.8p, 312.4p and 271.9p respectively.
iv Anthony Rabin retired from the Company on 30 June 2012.
