Introduction 60 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Remuneration report continued Linkage between remuneration, corporate objectives and shareholder interests continued The Groups remuneration policy is to reward senior management competitively, enabling Ultra to recruit, motivate and retain executives of high caliber, whilst avoiding making excessive remuneration payments.
The remuneration of Executive Directors and senior managers is aligned with corporate objectives and the interests of shareholders.
The linkages between the three elements of the Executive Directors remuneration packages with the Groups objectives and the interests of shareholders are outlined on page 59.
Salaries Base salary levels of Executive Directors are set by reference to: the salaries paid in companies of a similar turnover and market capitalisation.
However, the Companys policy is to set salaries of new Executive Directors by reference to their skills and experience on appointment, rather than by reference to the rate paid to their predecessor or the wider market.
The policy is then to progress salaries towards market rates over the next one to two years, subject to continued performance and development in the role: the individual Directors performance and responsibilities: and remuneration practices across the Group as a whole in order to ensure that a coherent structure applies.
Input is sought from the Chief Executive and the Group Human Resources Director to assist in this process.
Salary increases for Executive Directors are reflective of the levels of salary increases awarded to high performing Group employees.
The Executive Directors salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee and take effect from 1 January.
New Bridge Street prepared data on the total remuneration packages for Executive Directors with similar roles in two comparator groups of companies: 1 A specific group comprising 13 companies of a broadly similar size drawn from the LTIP TSR comparator group: and 2 A general group comprising 38 companies from across all sectors excluding Financial Services with a similar market capitalisation and turnover to the Company.
In addition to the analysis presented by New Bridge Street, the Committee used a number of other published salary surveys.
The Executive Directors salaries have been reviewed by the Committee which has determined that the following levels should be implemented with effect from 1st January 2013: 2013 Salary 2012 Salary % Increase 000 000 % 1 Chief Executive 460 420 9.5 2 Finance Director 305 305 - 3 Marketing Director 205 180 13.9 1 The Chief Executive was appointed in 2011 on a salary of 400,000 per annum compared with his predecessors salary of 466,000 per annum.
This was in line with the Companys policy of setting the salaries of new Executive Directors by reference to their skills and experience on appointment, rather than by reference to the rate paid to their predecessor or the wider market.
The increase in salary reflects a progression towards market rates based on performance and development in the role.
2 Mr Deans salary reflects the fact that he will be employed by the Company for a short period in 2013 and his salary is in line with salary benchmark data.
3 The salary shown is for the incumbent Marketing Director, Mark Anderson, who succeeded Andy Hamment in this role on 1 April 2012.
In line with the Companys policy of setting the salaries of new Executive Directors by reference to their skills and experience on appointment, rather than by reference to the rate paid to their predecessor or the wider market, Mr Andersons salary is below that of his predecessor which was 255,000 per annum.
The Committee anticipates that Mr Andersons salary will continue to progress towards market rates subject to his continued performance and development in the role.
Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 61 Remuneration report continued Annual bonus scheme The basic mechanism of the Executive Directors bonus scheme is the same as that utilised for the Executive Team, although the quantum of the bonus varies between these groups of employees.
Bonus payments in 2012 were based upon the achievement of sliding scale profit before tax and cash flow targets.
These targets are derived from the annual budgets approved by the Board but adjusted where appropriate to provide an appropriate degree of stretch challenge and an incentive to outperform.
Profit and cash are two of the Key Performance Indicators by which the Group is measured.
Please refer to pages 10 and 11 for details.
The maximum bonus for Executive Directors in 2012 was 100% of base salary.
The bonus targets set by the Committee were a maximum of 25% of salary subject to the achievement of a 134.6m profit before tax and loss on fair value movements on derivatives and amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition, and a maximum of 75% of salary subject to achieving an operating cash flow of 168.0m after capitalised development costs, capital expenditure, purchase of long-term incentive plan shares and taking account of movements in working capital.
The actual results for the year fell short of the agreed targets and consequently no bonuses were paid.
The 100% of salary maximum will continue to be operated for 2013 and structure of the bonus schemes will follow the same logic as for 2012 with a maximum of 25% of salary being payable for the achievement of an agreed profit target, and a maximum of 75% being payable for achievement of an agreed operating cash flow target.
The relevant targets are determined by the Remuneration Committee.
A bonus clawback provision was adopted in 2012.
The clawback applies to the bonus scheme, LTIP and Executive Share Option Scheme.
The circumstances in which a clawback may be triggered are i fraud willful misconduct resulting in overpayment of bonus to employees: or ii a material error resulting from fraud willful misconduct in the manner in which the achievement of the bonus targets have been calculated, which results in overpayments to employees.
In practice, the Committees view is, because the majority of the target is linked to operating cash flow, the likelihood of such an event occurring is remote.
Directors Long-Term Incentive Plan and Employee Share Option Plans The Company operates the following three live discretionary share incentive plans which were all approved in 2007: the 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan 2007 LTIP : the 2007 Company Share Option Plan 2007 CSOP : and the 2007 Executive Share Option Scheme 2007 ESOS.
2007 LTIP The sole form of equity-based long-term incentive for Executive Directors is the 2007 LTIP.
They do not receive awards under the 2007 CSOP or 2007 ESOS schemes, which provide incentives for less senior employees.
Under the 2007 LTIP, conditional awards of shares are made annually to Executive Directors and selected other senior executives.
These awards normally vest three years after grant, subject to continued employment and the extent to which a performance condition has been met.
It is the opinion of the Committee that the LTIP scheme has helped to motivate senior executives to drive sustained above-market long-term growth in the Companys profits and to generate excellent returns for shareholders as a result.
It is the Committees normal policy to grant annual LTIP awards to Executive Directors in the form of shares worth 100% of salary.
However, in certain exceptional circumstances the Committee may make awards of up to 150% of salary.
This policy has remained unchanged since 2002, when the Company was a member of the FTSE Small Cap and significantly smaller and less complex relative to its current market positioning.
Whilst the Committee actively avoids making changes to remuneration levels simply to reflect market rates, it is conscious of the need to ensure that senior executives are paid fairly relative to the wider market.
This is to ensure that the Company is able to retain and recruit executives of an appropriate calibre to continue to drive the Companys key objective of achieving above market returns to shareholders over a sustained period.
In this regard, the Committee has agreed, subject to shareholder approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, to amend the LTIP rules to increase the level of award to the Chief Executive from 100% of salary p. a. to 125% of salary p. a.
The other Executive Directors will continue to receive awards of 100% of salary p. a. TSR applies to all awards granted under the 2007 LTIP.
The Committee contends that the use of relative TSR has a number of advantages.
These include: aligning the performance objectives of the Executive Directors more closely with the interests of the shareholders: being an entirely objective measure of relative performance: reflecting the practice most commonly used by other quoted companies: and reducing the complexity and cost of calculating the vesting result.
TSR is one of the Key Performance Indicators by which the Group is measured.
Introduction 62 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Remuneration report continued Detailed structure of TSR performance condition Under the TSR performance condition, TSR is based upon a comparison of the Companys average share price plus reinvested dividends during the quarter immediately prior to the start of the measurement period and its average share price plus reinvested dividends during the last quarter of the three year measurement period.
The resulting TSR is compared with that achieved by a representative comparator group of companies.
The comparator group for measuring relative TSR for the awards made in 2012 was as follows: ARM Holdings Halma QinetiQ Spectris Babcock International Hampson Industries Renishaw Spirax-Sarco Engineering BAE Systems Laird Group Rolls-Royce Spirent Communications Chemring Group Logica Rotork TT Electronics Cobham Meggitt Senior UMECO Dialight Oxford Instruments Serco Group Vitec Group Domino Printing Sciences Psion Smiths Group WS Atkins The Committee carries out a review of the constituents annually with a view to ensuring that it contains appropriate peer companies and is of a suitable size noting that a small group can lead to volatility issues.
During 2012, four of the companies in the comparator group delisted.
This year, the Committee concluded that it is difficult to compile a sufficiently robust set of peers given Ultras wide portfolio of specialisms and that it would be preferable to change the TSR comparator group for future awards to the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
This change will reduce the level of subjectivity in requiring the comparator group to be reviewed each year, and mitigate issues of volatility which can arise when using a smaller chosen group.
The vesting rules under the 2007 LTIP are as follows: Ultras rank within the comparator group Percentage of award that vests Below median 0% Median 20% Upper quartile 100% Between median and upper quartile Pro-rata between 20% and 100% In addition to the main TSR condition, an EPS growth underpin applies to these awards.
The purpose of the EPS underpin is to ensure that, as well as achieving above market returns to shareholders via the primary TSR performance condition, an appropriate level of profit growth is maintained by the Group.
Growth in EPS is one of the Key Performance Indicators by which the Group is measured.
The current underpin is EPS growth of 7% p. a. over the relevant performance period.
Whilst the Board continues to pursue a strong and progressive growth strategy, the Committee considered that current market conditions, inflation and economic expectations had changed.
Consequently it decided to reduce the level of the EPS underpin for future awards to 5% p. a. growth.
The Committee believes that this will ensure that strong financial performance remains a key focus whilst incentivising executives to drive sustainable growth which is in the long-term interests of the Company and its shareholders.
In the event that the underpin is not met over a specific three-year LTIP measurement period, the level of vesting will automatically fall to zero.
Headline EPS will be defined as earnings per share after adjustments to exclude gains or losses on financial instruments and the amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition.
The extent to which awards vest will be verified independently by a third party.
The 2007 LTIP contains clawback provisions for the overpayment of bonuses as described on page 61.
All-Employee Share Plans The Executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the Companys HMRC approved All-Employee Share Ownership Plan AESOP and the Savings Related Share Option Scheme on the same terms as other employees.
Under the AESOP, employees in the UK are offered the opportunity to buy shares up to the value of 1,500 per annum from pre-tax salary.
Shares are then held in trust on behalf of employees until the maturity date or until they leave the Company.
Under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, employees are entitled to save up to 1,200 per annum from net pay towards the purchase of options to buy Ultra shares after a period of either three or five years, depending upon the employees choice.
Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 63 Remuneration report continued Senior Executive share ownership guidelines To support the alignment of interests between senior executives and shareholders, Executive Directors and the Executive Team are encouraged, through share ownership guidelines, to retain shares.
All Executive Directors are to retain at least 50% of the post-tax shares they acquire on the vesting of LTIP awards until a holding equivalent to 100% of base salary is achieved.
Each member of the Executive Team is to retain at least 50% of the post-tax shares they receive on the vesting of LTIP awards until a holding of 50% of base salary is achieved.
Pre-existing shareholdings will be taken into account.

In the event of early termination, it is the Committees policy that the amount of compensation paid to Executive Directors will be considered in the light of all the relevant circumstances, subject to the overriding conditions that: the Committees aim will be to avoid rewarding poor performance: the duty of the relevant Executive Director to mitigate his loss will be taken into account: and no compensation payment can normally exceed one years salary and benefits.
