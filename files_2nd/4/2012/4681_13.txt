Remuneration report Dear Shareholder, On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors Remuneration Report for 2012.
This report explains the groups remuneration policy and provides details of the remuneration paid to Executive and Non-Executive Directors for services to the company during the year.
In response to the UK Governments proposed new legislation regarding the reporting of directors remuneration and changes to the voting rights, we have incorporated a number of changes into this years report in an effort to enhance transparency and clarity.
VERVIEW As the Chairman has indicated in his statement on pages 3 and 4, Devros progress continued in 2012, with improved operational results and ongoing substantial investment to lay the foundations for our future.
The purpose of this letter is to explain decisions made in the course of 2012 in the key areas of base salary, annual bonus and long-term incentive plans against this backdrop.
Base salary Our longstanding policy is for base salaries of Executive Directors to be around mid-market levels.
The Committee is, however, aware of the risk of over-reliance on comparative benchmarking data and carefully reviews all the relevant factors when considering the appropriate base salaries for the Executives.
In recent years, Devro has grown very signicantly, moving from the FTSE Small Cap Index to the FTSE 250 Index.
At the start of 2012, the Committee felt that the Chief Executives base salary no longer reected the increased complexity and breadth of the role and had fallen substantially behind comparable gures.
After securing the support of major shareholders following a consultation exercise, this was increased as shown in the table on page 34.
Annual bonus The Committee believes annual bonus targets should be genuinely challenging, clearly linked to the companys performance and strategy, and designed to align the interests of executives and shareholders.
In 2012, our business plan included profit growth at a time when we were engaged in significant capital projects at each of our manufacturing locations.
"The Committee sought to devise a bonus scheme which would reward the effective management of the business while these projects WERE UNDERWAY 4WO PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS WERE CHOSEN I 0ROlT MEASURED BY %"" 4 AND II PERATING #ASH &LOW h #&v The Committee considers that some measure of earnings should always be part of the annual bonus targets."
Earnings growth is one of the ultimate aims of our strategy, and drives shareholder value.
The company was faced with a number of challenges and headwinds in 2012, and while both operating profit and OCF improved, performance did not meet the targets set.
As a result, no annual bonus was paid.
Full details are set out on page 35.
Long-term incentive scheme The long-term incentive award granted to the Chief Executive in 2010 will vest in full in March of this year.
The performance targets for this award were based on EPS growth and relative Total Shareholder Return.
Both targets were outperformed by a significant margin, reecting the successful execution of the groups strategy over the last three years.
A full explanation of the performance metrics is shown on page 35.
The existing 2003 Performance Share Plan will expire this year.
During 2012 the Committee reviewed the operation of the current plan and agreed to renew it in substantially the same form but taking into account minor changes to bring it in line with current best practice.
The Committee consulted with the companys major shareholders and investor representative bodies regarding the new plan in order to gain support for these proposals.
Details of the new plan in terms of award limits and performance targets are set out in the policy table on page 31.
Shareholders will be asked to approve this plan at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, and more detailed information is set out in the explanatory notes on pages 88 to 90.
Summary Setting executive remuneration in a way which balances all the competing interests is not an easy task.
We are well aware of the broader debate on executive pay.
I believe the Remuneration Committees approach, as set out above and as more fully explained in the attached report, is an appropriate one, intended to properly reward performance in line with the companys growth.
The Board will be submitting this report for approval by shareholders at our Annual General Meeting on 18 April 2013.
