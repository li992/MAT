The objective of our remuneration policy is to retain and incentivise talented individuals to deliver sustained superior returns for our shareholders.
The Committee is responsible for the operation of the Annual Incentive Scheme AIS and Share Appreciation Rights SAR Plan.
The AIS has performance requirements measured over a three year period.
On a trailing three year basis, RITs growth in total net assets did not exceed its benchmark.
Therefore while RITs net assets increased by 194 million over the three year period, no bonus payments have been made to Executive Directors of the Company under this scheme.
The Company continues to operate the SAR Plan.
Individual awards under the SAR Plan are subject to a cap.
There is also an overall limit of 1% of NAV on the aggregate of annual incentive payments and SAR awards in any year.
As no AIS payments were made for the financial year, the total variable pay was well below the prescribed limit.
In the nine month period a private equity carried interest scheme was introduced, providing long-term incentives to executive management and members of the investment team.
This arrangement allows those in the scheme to participate in any outperformance of investments included in the scheme after allowing for all expenses and a hurdle rate of 8% per annum.
We believe that this Remuneration Report provides a clear explanation of the Committees policies and their alignment with shareholders interests.
Those items which are audited are highlighted within the title.
Change of financial year end As stated on page 1, the Company has changed its financial year end to 31 December.
Remuneration information contained in this report is in respect of the nine month period ended 31 December 2012.
Components of Executive Director remuneration The remuneration of the Executive Directors comprises the following: Purpose Key features FIXED PAY Basic salary Reflects market value of Reviewed annually with any changes effective on the individual, their skills, 1 January experience and Benchmarked against asset management sector performance Base salary reviews take into account pay increases for other employees below Executive Director level Pension and other Competitive pension and Defined contribution pension cash allowance only benefits benefits VARIABLE PAY Annual Incentive Rewards superior Annual bonuses are paid from a pool.

Following the Remuneration Committees review after the period end on 31 December 2012, the base salary of the Chairman has been set at 448,640 per annum 31 March 2012: 438,768 per annum.
This represents an increase of 2.25%, which is consistent with the average percentage increases awarded to other employees, which are considered and taken into account by the Committee.
Pensions The Groups defined benefit pension scheme closed to new members in 1997.
Lord Rothschild has no accrued defined benefit entitlement under the scheme and he receives a cash allowance of 20% of base salary, in lieu of pension contributions.
The Group makes payments to defined benefit schemes on behalf of staff.
Other Benefits In addition to base salary, the Executive Directors received a bonus of 1,000 that was paid to all staff in December 2012 December 2011: 1,000.
The Executive Directors are entitled to the use of a company car, private medical and other insurances.
VARIABLE PAY Annual Incentive Scheme As described in the Companys 31 March 2012 Directors Remuneration Report, the Remuneration Committee implemented an Annual Incentive Scheme AIS in the year ended 31 March 2012.
This provides better alignment with the Companys objectives, is more consistent with market practice in the investment management sector and is partly payable in deferred shares.
Under the AIS, a bonus pool is created for participants based on the Companys trailing three year total net asset growth, relative to the growth in the MSCI World Index in Sterling.
The Remuneration Committee has set the participation rate at 5% of such outperformance.
Individual awards made from the pool are based on personal performance, taking account of contribution to investment performance, overall management, development of the Company, adherence to prudent risk management and regulatory compliance controls.
In common with the practice amongst many asset managers, there is no explicit cap on the size of individual awards.
However, the Remuneration Committee applies a cap of 1% of net assets to the aggregate of all incentive payments.
The first 150,000 of any individual award is paid in cash.
Any bonus award in excess of 150,000 is in the form of conditional, deferred shares of the Company.
This helps generate additional incentive for, and alignment with, sustained performance delivered for shareholders.
Any awards paid in deferred shares will vest in two tranches: 50% after a year and 50% after two years, subject to remaining in service.
Therefore while RITs net assets increased by 194 million over the three year period, no bonus payments have been made to Executive Directors of the Company under this scheme for performance to 31 December 2012 31 March 2012: nil.
Certain discretionary awards were made to members of JRCM executive management, based on a rigourous assessment of personal performance in the period.

This is calculated by reference to the Companys share price, including dividend reinvestment.
The Committee considers the MSCI World Total Return Index in Sterling to be the most suitable index for this purpose.
Total Shareholder Return Against Relevant Index 150 RIT Total Shareholder Return MSCI Total Return World Index 125 100 75 50 Dec Dec Dec Dec Dec Dec 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan Audited The J Rothschild Capital Management SAR plan was last approved by shareholders of the Company on 17 July 2008.
The SAR Plan provides for the grant of SARs over a number of shares in the Company.
Following the expiry of a three year vesting period, participants in the SAR Plan are entitled to exercise their SARs and receive a payment equal to the growth in value of the notional shares over the vesting period.
However, the exercise of a SAR is ordinarily subject to the participants continued service over the vesting period and whether the performance condition applying to the SAR is satisfied.
The performance condition applied to SAR awards requires that the increase in the Companys total shareholder return TSR exceeds the growth in the Retail Price Index plus 3 percentage points per annum over the three year performance period.
The performance condition was chosen as a good measure of above-inflation returns to shareholders and is subject to ongoing review by the Committee.
The SAR Plan uses ordinary shares of the Company to settle the share appreciation amount for existing and future awards granted under the SAR Plan.
The Group seeks to hedge its exposure under the SAR Plan by using an Employee Benefit Trust to acquire shares to meet the estimated future liability.
The policy of the Remuneration Committee is to apply a cap on individual annual grants under the SARs Plan of 4x base salary measured as the value at grant of the shares notionally under option.

The lowest closing price of the Companys shares during the period was 1,096p and the highest was 1,310p.
Clawback For awards granted after 1 April 2011, all annual incentive and long-term incentive payments are subject to clawback provisions which provide scope for the Company to recover value from awards in the event of a material mis-statement of the Companys results or in the event of dismissal for gross misconduct.
Executive Shareholding Requirements Executive Directors are expected to build and retain a substantial personal shareholding in the Companys shares.
As at 31 December 2012, these beneficial holdings represented a very significant multiple of base salary for Lord Rothschild.
Directors Service Contracts Lord Rothschild has a service agreement with J Rothschild Capital Management Limited JRCM, dated 29 April 1996.
The service agreement of Lord Rothschild can be terminated on not less than twelve months written notice.
It provides for benefits-in-kind in line with normal company practice, including pension provision, private health insurance and a company car.
The agreement does not specify compensation payable in the event of early termination.
When considering the size of any proposed termination payment, the Committee would take into account a number of factors including the health, length of service, age and the performance of the relevant executive, with a broad aim to avoid rewarding poor performance while dealing fairly with cases where the departure is due to other reasons, such as illness.
A payment of 110,800 was made to Mr Breuer-Weil during the period in lieu of notice.
No vested and unexercised SARs were held by Mr Breuer-Weil on the date of his retirement as a Director.
