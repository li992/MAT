Booker group plc aNNUal rEPOrt & aCCOUNts 2012 rEMUNEratiON rEPOrt this section of the annual report and accounts describes the role and composition of the remuneration Committee established by the Board, the Companys remuneration policy and the arrangements currently in place for remuneration of both Executive and Non-Executive Directors.
Unaudited Information the Committee aims to ensure that the remuneration policies of the Company are in line with the proposals set out by the secretary of state for Business and Enterprise as part of the recent review of executive remuneration conducted by the Department for Business innovation & skills Bis.
among the more prominent objectives set out in that consultation exercise were that: 1 Directors should not be rewarded for failure: 2 incentives for senior management should be more closely linked to performance, thus aligning better the interests of executives and shareholders: and 3 Director rewards should be correlated with those received by other employees of the business.
the Committee believes that the Companys remuneration system conforms with these objectives whilst retaining and attracting individuals capable of promoting the success of the business.
as the Bis consultation process is ongoing the Committee is monitoring developments in this area and will continue to adopt best practice wherever possible.
the Committee believes that it has met these objectives for the period to 30 March 2012 in the following ways:- Base pay: all employees are eligible for an annual pay award.
the average salary increase during the year under review for all employees of the group was 2.9%, and the average base salary increase for Executive Directors was 1.7%.
Bonus: Of the groups 9,375 employees, 6,500 employees are eligible for a bonus payment based on customer satisfaction.
Customer satisfaction is measured independently by calling 35 customers selected at random for each of our 172 branches on a quarterly basis to ask them to rate key areas of service.
in the past year 5,226 employees received a bonus payment.
Of the remaining employees, 1,174 are eligible for a quarterly bonus payment based on achieving productivity and efficiency targets at the site at which they are employed.
1,200 employees excluding the CEO are eligible for a bonus based on increasing group EBitDa year on year.
long term incentives : 2,517 employees are in the 2011 saYE scheme and 900 have PsP options.
Both schemes provide rewards which are based on increasing equity value.
the high number of employees participating in these schemes is a testament to the groups policy of ensuring that the remuneration of senior management is aligned with that of the overall workforce and with the interests of shareholders.
since 2007 when we completed the reverse takeover of Blueheath and became admitted to trading on aiM, the equity value has increased from approximately 300m to over 1,100m.
the value of the PsP options awarded has been equivalent to 2% of the value generated.
alignment between the senior management and shareholders is also signicantly increased by personal shareholdings.
Directors, senior managers and colleagues own in aggregate approximately 10% of the issued share capital of the Company.
the Committee is of the view that, when the above schemes are looked at in combination, we have a structure of reasonable base pay, bonuses which are paid for increasing cash profit and customer satisfaction and long term incentives which are aligned to the creation of shareholder value.
Director pay inflation is running in line with employees, the best paid Director basic salary is circas 36 times the basic salary of the median employee and the average basic salary of the Executive Directors is circa 23 times the basic salary of the median employee.
the Committee believes that this remuneration system is simple to understand, has a proven track record of encouraging strong performance, does not reward failure and reflects the Companys goals of continuing to improve services to customers and to create value for shareholders.
