Please note that the Bank reports in Lari.
All figures provided above in US Dollars have been converted for convenience from Lari to US Dollars using an exchange rate of GEL 1.6567 per US$1.00, being the official Lari to US Dollar exchange rate as reported by the NBG on 31 December 2012 and have been rounded to the nearest US Dollar.
Although the amount of each executives salary is presented in US Dollars in the table above, these salaries are paid in Lari in Georgia and in GBP in the UK, and therefore accounted for in such currencies.
These accounting values in Lari and GBP, for the purposes of the above presentation, have been translated into US Dollars at the 2012 year-end official exchange rate of NBG.
Irakli Gilauris BGH salary was cash only in the amount of US$233,037, and is included in the figure in this table.
For presentation purposes in the table above, the values of the fixed contingent deferred shares are calculated as the full number of grant shares multiplied by US$16.6, which was the market value of a BGH share as at 31 December 2012.
However, for IFRS purposes, grant values of these shares are based on the market values of the same shares at the respective grant dates.
The grant date of the fixed contingent deferred shares was the date of signature of the executives contract, which was 25 May 2010 for Irakli Gilauri and 29 March 2010 for all other executives listed in the table above.
The share price in US Dollars as at 25 May 2010 and 29 March 2010, was US$10.2 and US$10.6, respectively.
Fixed contingent deferred share compensation is subject to a five-year vesting period as described above.

For presentation purposes in the table above, the values of the discretionary shares are calculated as the full number of grant shares multiplied by US$16.6, the market value of a BGH share on 31 December 2012.
The grant date of the discretionary contingent deferred shares for all executives was 15 February 2013, the date of award by the Board.
The share price in US Dollars as at that date was US$21.5.
Discretionary contingent deferred share compensation is subject to two-year vesting as described above.
Because as described in detail above the share-based compensation is deferred and contingent, an economic valuation of the compensation award would discount for those factors.
In that sense, the total value of remuneration is overstated in the above table.
The actual value of the share-based compensation and thus an executives total remuneration in respect of a given year will depend on the number of shares that vest in that year and the value of the shares at the time they vest or are sold, which could be a value greater or lesser than the value of the shares at 31 December 2012.
Other benefits include payments in respect of the Executives medical and life and incapacity insurance.
