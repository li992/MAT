Remuneration Report Although full details are provided in this Report, I thought it would be helpful to summarise how our incentive structures operated during the 2012 financial year.
The business performed well during 2012, reflecting a return to revenue growth in our MSS business, continued strong cash flow generation, well managed costs and a share price which over 2012 increased by over 45%.
As a consequence of this combination, the annual bonus plan financial targets were met.
The Executive Directors also performed well against their personal objectives.
This translated into bonus awards above target levels.
The financial targets for the 2012 Bonus Share Plan share award were achieved in full.
This means that the monetary award will be converted in full to shares which will vest over the next three years which the Committee believes represents a significant element of the retention and future incentive for the participants.
However, the Performance Share Plan award made in 2010 did not vest and has lapsed.
Stephen Davidson The Remuneration Committee is focused on continued Remuneration Committee Chairman shareholder engagement to review how incentive and share plans will operate post-2014.

7 March 2013 The discussion focused on several key areas: The roles and responsibilities of the two individuals fulfilling the roles of the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and their remuneration packages The operation of our existing annual bonus and share plans and shareholders desire to have further information and transparency around financial targets and personal objectives How our incentive plans and remuneration policy should be structured in the light of shareholder and Executive Director feedback, and the market and regulatory developments.
We have set out in this Report, and also in the Corporate Governance statement, our commentary on each of these areas and we hope that this will provide additional clarity and transparency for shareholders.

Consideration of shareholder views When determining remuneration, the Committee considers shareholder views and the guidelines of investor bodies.
During 2012, Stephen Davidson, Chairman of the Committee, Alison Horrocks, SVP Corporate Governance and Company Secretary, and for some meetings, John Rennocks, Deputy Chairman, approached 27 shareholders representing approximately 45% of our shares, and leading proxy agencies, to seek their views on all aspects of the Companys current executive remuneration arrangements.
We are currently reviewing remuneration arrangements in light of this shareholder feedback, and any changes will take place from 2014, subject to key shareholder consultation and approval of the new plans at the 2014 AGM.
The Committee is always open to feedback from shareholders on remuneration policy or individual arrangements, and is committed to consulting shareholders in advance of major changes.
Base salary Base salary is set by the Committee and reviewed annually in July taking account of an individuals performance and experience measured by a formal appraisal by the Committee, market pay levels, a review of salaries against companies of similar size, complexity and type as well as the remuneration arrangements operated throughout the Group.
The next review of base salary for Executive Directors will be with effect from 1 July 2013.
We have already indicated to shareholders that the Committee expects to increase Mr Pearces salary each year to reflect how he develops in the Chief Executive role and the performance of the business.
We expect the level of annual increase for Mr Pearce in July 2013 the next salary review date to be around 10%.
The Committee will determine the levels of future increases considering both his individual and the Companys performance, and will benchmark as well.
His current salary level of 451,000 is well below the median level for Chief Executives of FTSE 50-150 sized companies.
The average annual salary increase across the Inmarsat group of employees made at 1 July 2012 was 2.23%.
The salaries for the Executive Directors for 2012 and 2013 are set out in the table below.
Name 1 January 2012 1 July 2012 1 January 2013 Andrew Sukawaty Executive Chairman 614,744 614,744 614,744 0% increase Rupert Pearce Chief Executive Officer 410,000 451,000 451,000 10% increase Rick Medlock Chief Financial Officer 330,839 340,760 340,760 3% increase Inmarsat plc 51 AnnuAl report And Accounts 2012 Remuneration Report continued Pensions and benefits The Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the Companys defined contribution pension plan arrangements.
None participate in the defined benefit plan.
Pensionable salary is limited to basic salary and subject to a scheme-specific cap, as noted below.
Messrs Pearce and Medlock are members active and deferred, respectively of the defined contribution pension plan for employees who will draw a UK pension: Mr Sukawaty is a member of the US 401k plan and has also made additional one-off employee contributions to the UK defined contribution pension plan.
Mr Sukawaty is entitled to an annual salary supplement equal to 12.5% of the difference between his basic salary and the US Internal Revenue Service capped basic salary in lieu of the employer pension contribution.
With effect from 1 April 2012, Mr Medlock became a deferred member of the defined contribution pension plan and instead receives an annual salary supplement of approximately 15,000, which is equivalent to 12.5% of the capped salary.
The current employer contributions subject to the UK Pension Plan scheme specific cap of 136,200 and 141,000 for the 2012 13 and 2013 14 tax years respectively and US Internal Revenue Service earnings caps as appropriate are: Andrew Sukawaty 12.5% of capped salary was paid in 2012: 18,636 as employer contributions Rupert Pearce 10% of capped salary was paid in 2012: 13,905 as employer contributions Benefits for our Executive Directors include private medical insurance, permanent disability insurance and life assurance.
Annual cash bonus Bonus awards, which are not pensionable, are made to Executive Directors based on Group financial and individual performance.
80% of the bonus is linked to financial performance, as measured through revenue 50% of financial element, operating expenditure 35% and capital expenditure 15%, with an EBITDA underpin.
The remaining 20% of the bonus is linked to personal performance, as appraised against achievement of challenging objectives set by the Committee at the start of each financial year.
Personal performance targets are clearly defined and measurable, and are linked to Group strategic and operational performance.
The Committee reviewed the performance measures and targets in respect of using them for the 2013 bonus, and determined them to remainappropriate.
Examples of personal objectives for the Executive Directors included: Executive Chairman: Manage the transition of work to the Chief Executive and assist him generally in support of business success Manage the Board and Board evaluation process effectively, and Increase business development efforts specifically in China, India and Russia.
Chief Executive: Lead the Group restructuring process through its 2012 milestone Deliver a return to growth for the Groups wholesale MSS business, and Maintain the GX Inmarsat-5 programme on track and to budget and ensure development of further strategic channelrelationships.
Chief Financial Officer: Support the Group restructuring process through its 2012 milestone Play a leading role with shareholders and analysts, and Ensure effective internal financial reporting to support the creation of new Business Units.
In 2012, the corporate financial targets for EBITDA, revenue, operating and capital expenditure were met, however the stretch target for revenue was not achieved.
The revenue target made appropriate allowance for LightSquared revenues.
The target and maximum annual bonus amounts and actual cash bonus which will be awarded to each Executive Director are set out below.

52 Inmarsat plc AnnuAl report And Accounts 2012 2012 Operations Governance Financial statements Share Incentive Plans Awards under all of the Companys share plans including the long-term incentive plans for Executive Directors and senior management will normally be made only during the six weeks following the announcement of the results for any period and exceptionally at other times when the grant of awards will not be prohibited by the Model Code or the Companys own share dealing code.
In any ten-year period, the number of shares which may be issued or placed under option under any executive share plan established by the Company, may not exceed 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company from time to time.
In any ten-year period, the number of shares which may be issued or placed under option, under all employee share plans established by the Company, may not exceed 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company from time to time.
Options and awards granted before the Companys listing on the London Stock Exchange are not counted towards the above limits.
The current level ofdilution for share awards is within the above limits.
The existing share plans reach their ten year maturity in 2015 and we would expect that share plans will be renewed at the 2014 AGM.
The Group operates the following share plans: Inmarsat 2005 Performance Share Plan the PSP The purpose of the PSP is to align executives interests with long-term shareholder value creation through rewarding the delivery of strong TSR and earnings performance.
Executive Directors and certain members of senior management participate in this plan.
Awards are generally made over a specific number of shares, and vest after a three-year performance period with vesting determined by performance targets and employment conditions.
Awards under the plan can be made with a value of up to 200% of base salary with exceptions made for circumstances such as recruitment or retention, where larger awards of up to 300% of annual basic salary may be made.
The Committee will not automatically make share awards up to these maximum levels.
To date, the normal range of awards has been 100%-225%, 100%-150% and 100%-120% of salary for the Executive Chairman, CEO and CFO, respectively.
Awards made in 2012 will vest based 50% on the Companys relative TSR performance against companies within the FTSE350 Index excluding investment trusts and 50% on its EBITDA performance over the relevant three-year performance period.
The Committee believes that using two performance targets represents a good balance of external market performance and delivery of earnings, both of which are key measures of success for the Company.
The constituents of the FTSE350 Index excluding investment trusts continue to represent the most appropriate comparator group against which to measure the Companys relative TSR performance.
Growth in EBITDA was selected to reflect the Companys primary driver of value and we consider that this also remains appropriate for future awards.
Performance targets for the 2012 award are as follows: Vesting percentage 3-year TSR relative to FTSE350 excluding investment trusts % of maximum Below median 0% Median 30% Upper quartile 100% Between median and upper quartile Straight line basis Vesting percentage 3-year EBITDA growth p. a.
% of maximum Less than 1% 0% Between 1% and 4% Straight line basis Awards made prior to 2012 will vest with joint reference to relative TSR and EBITDA.
The Committee made the decision to measure relative TSR and EBITDA independently from 2012 to simplify the plan.
Performance targets for awards made in 2010 and 2011 are as follows: 3-year EBITDA growth p. a.
Less than 5% 5% 8% Upper quartile No vesting 75% 100% 3-year TSR relative to Median No vesting 30% 75% FTSE350 excluding investment trusts Below median No vesting No vesting No vesting Inmarsat plc 53 AnnuAl report And Accounts 2012 Remuneration Report continued The PSP award made in 2009 did not vest in 2012.

These financial measures have been intended that awards will be made to the Executive Directors selected as they are considered key to driving operational and senior management for 2013 at similar levels to the awards performance.

The Committee will use these limits carefully and does not intend automatically to make share awards at the higher levels.

Share awards to the former Chief Executive Officer Two share plans were in operation for the former Chief Executive Officer, Mr Sukawaty.
The CEO Share award which was an award made in 2007 over 1,000,000 shares, which could have been increased by a further 700,000 shares subject to achieving certain share price conditions.
The performance period ended on 30 September 2012 and an average share price over the last 60 days was 5.73.
The performance condition was to exceed a share price of 5.50.
Out of a potential award of 1,000,000 shares, Mr Sukawaty received 160,631 shares, which included 46,937 additional shares in lieu of dividends.
The second share plan was the CEO Deferred Share Bonus Plan where 125,000 shares were awarded in 2009.
The performance condition was achieved in 2010 and shares were due to vest on 30 September 2012.
The number of shares which vested, including additional shares in lieu of dividends, totalled 142,677.
Vesting for both plans could not occur on 30 September as this was a Sunday and then the Company went into its close period for the Q3 2012 results.

Fees are determined annually by the Board as a whole, taking advice as appropriate.

The Board will next consider the level of fees in July 2013.

Letters of appointment are in place for all Non-Executive Directors.
Appointments are initially for three years and unless agreed by the Board, they may not remain in office for a period longer than six years, or two terms in office, whichever is the shorter.
Four of the Non-Executive directors were appointed at the 2006 AGM and have served longer than six years.

Inmarsat plc 57 AnnuAl report And Accounts 2012 Remuneration Report continued Shareholding guidelines In line with best practice and to bring Directors and shareholders interests further into line, Executive Directors and the Executive Staff group are encouraged to maintain a holding of ordinary shares in the Company with a guideline value of five times salary for Executive Directors and one times salary built up over a four-year period for Executive Staff.
Executive Directors consistently hold approximately five times or over, and based on a share price of 6.50 at the end of February 2013, these levels are equivalent to a range of 6-10x salary.
We believe this reflects a very close alignment with the interests of shareholders.
Directors interests Details of the beneficial shareholdings of the Directors are shown below.
No right to subscribe for ordinary shares in the Company or any corporate body in the same group was granted to, or exercised by any Director or a member of a Directors immediate family during the financial year.
