GOVERNANCE Remuneration Committee Report The Remuneration Committee considers and evaluates remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors, Senior Managers including Executive Committee members and Regional Managing Directors and other key employees and makes recommendations on remuneration arrangements to the Board.
The purpose is to enable therecruitment, motivation and retention of key employees while complying with the requirements of regulatory and governance bodies.
The Committees report is unaudited, except where indicated, and is set out below.
The Committee The Committee held two meetings during 2012, both chaired by Marc Brown.
Peter Williams, Peter Parmenter, Gabby Logan and Marc Brown are members ofthe Committee and all, with the exception of Peter Parmenter and Gabby Logan who was appointed on 12 December 2012, participated in both meetings.
The members of the Committee have no personal interest in the outcome of their decisions and give due regard to the interests of shareholders and to the continuing financial and commercial health of the business.
Remuneration Policy The remuneration policy of Board is to retain and motivate existing key employees and to attract new employees to the Group.
The policy reects that a significant number of key employees, including Executive Directors, hold material, existing shareholdings in the Group and as a result are already materially incentivised to deliver the Groups strategic and financial objectives.
The policy also reects that the Group has a limited number of listed company peers and in terms of revenue and profit scale and growth prole is unique in the FTSE 250.
The components of remuneration for Executive Directors, Executive Committee members and Regional Managing Directors comprise base salary, benets, annual bonus and a longer term share incentive scheme.
Emphasis is placed on the longer term incentive scheme which is linked to the Groups revenue and profit EBITDA growth.
The Committee recognises that the mix of key employees will change over time along with the financial prole of the Group and these changes will be reeced in the compensation packages offered to key employees.
The Group has recently appointed a Chief Personnel Officer who joined the Group on 4 March 2013.
He will work closely with the Committee to ensure the remuneration policy and compensation packages are appropriate and are appropriately benchmarked.
Base salary The Group aims to provide salaries which are fair and reasonable in comparison with companies of a similar size, industry, complexity and international scale.
When making salary determinations, the Committee takes into account not only competitive performance but also each executives individual performance and overall contribution to the business during the year.
The salaries of the Executive Directors and other key staff are in the lower quartile when compared to the FTSE 250.
Annual bonus The annual bonus scheme allows Executive Directors, Executive Committee members and Regional Managing Directors the opportunity to receive, in cash, up to 25% of their annual salary, with awards subject to the discretion of the Committee.
2011 and 2012 bonus schemes were both based on the Groups financial performance compared to budget, with Group revenue and adjusted EBITDA and divisional revenue and EBITDA the key criteria.
If 90% of any of the budget targets are not achieved then that element of the bonus will not be payable.
The Groups budgeted revenue and adjusted EBITDA are not typically materially different to the analysts consensus financial estimates.
In 2012 the Executive Directors received no annual bonus given the Groups performance compared to budget.
Total discretionary bonuses of 0.7 million are being paid to staff across the organisation.
Benets Benets for Executive Directors, Executive Committee members and Regional Managing Directors include private medical insurance, death in service cover, childcare vouchers and matching contributory pension contributions of up to 5%.
These benets are made available on the same basis to all staff, subject to a small number of international variations.
Long term share incentive scheme Peformance Share Plan PSP The Group has in place a PSP which is set out below and in note 26 to the financial statements and below.

Performance Share Plan PSP The PSP is the primary long-term incentive for Executive Directors and other key staff.
PSPs are issued annually and vest three years from the date of grant.
On grant Executive Directors are awarded a maximum number of performance shares based on 150% of their current annual salary divided by the Groups share price the day before the date of grant.
Other senior staff are awarded performance shares based on either 100% or 75% of their annual salaries.
In June 2011 a total of 22 key staff in addition to the three executive directors were awarded PSPs, 30 key staff in March 2012 again in addition to the three executive directors and an additional four key staff in September 2012.
The number of performance shares an employee will receive when the award vests after three year is dependent on certain vesting criteria.
For both 2011 and 2012 the Committee concluded that the most appropriate criteria would be revenue and adjusted earnings per share as dened underneath the Income Statement growth across each three year period.
These criteria are in line with the Groups growth strategy as set out on IPO.
The exact number of shares vesting will be based on a matrix of these criteria.
62 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 OVERVIEW BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE In respect of the 2011 award, if compound revenue growth is less than 35% over the three year period from 2010 and compound adjusted EPS growth is less than 35% over the same period, no shares will be awarded.
In order for the maximum number of shares to be awarded, compound revenue growth must be at least 40% over the three year period and compound adjusted EPS growth must be at least 55% over the same period.
There are a number of performance points set out in the matrix.
For levels of performance between the points, vesting would be determined on a straight line, pro-rata basis.
In respect of the 2012 awards, if compound revenue growth is less than 30% over the three year period from 2011 and compound adjusted EPS growth is less than 30% over the same period, no shares will be awarded.
In order for the maximum number of shares to be awarded, compound revenue growth must be at least 35% over the three year period and compound adjusted EPS growth must be at least 50% over the same period.
The 2012 awards have a slightly lower growth rate attached to them as the Committee recognises that it is not realistic for the Groups revenue and adjusted EPS growth to continue to accelerate at its current rate.
The interests of the Executive Directors in ordinary shares subject to awards under this plan were as follows the number of ordinary shares assumes that 100% of the awards vest refer above for a description of the matrix : Maximum number of Ordinary Shares that may vest As at 31 Date of Granted Granted December Vesting 2 3 1 grant during 2011 during 2012 2012 date Simon Denyer 24 June 2011 174,041 174,041 24 June 2014 23 March 2012 133,339 133,339 23 March 2015 Total 174,041 133,339 307,380 Oliver Slipper 24 June 2011 174,041 174,041 24 June 2014 23 March 2012 133,339 133,339 23 March 2015 Total 174,041 133,339 307,380 David Surtees 24 June 2011 145,034 145,034 24 June 2014 23 March 2012 111,117 111,117 23 March 2015 Total 145,034 111,117 256,151 1 Subject to performance testing 2 The closing price of Perform Group plc shares on the date of the award 24 June 2011 was 2.19.
