Report on Directors remuneration for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2012 Dear Shareholder, On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Remuneration Committees Report on Directors Remuneration for 2012.
As you may be aware, the Government has tabled proposals to reform the way Directors remuneration is voted upon and reported.
In particular, the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills BIS has produced two consultation papers, the results of which, amongst other things, will have an impact on the content and presentation of information in the Report on Directors Remuneration.
The new legislative requirements will not come into effect until October 2013 but, although not mandatory for this report, the Committee has decided to adopt some of these changes early so incorporating extra information, including a remuneration policy table and graphs showing Executive Directors remuneration at various performance levels.
Consistent with the proposals, the report has been split into two sections: a Policy Report which sets out the policy on the remuneration of the executive and non-executive directors taking effect from 28 December 2012 and an Implementation report which discloses how the remuneration policy has been implemented in the period ended 28 December 2012.
We will be seeking your support for both parts of the report by way of a single advisory vote at the forthcoming AGM on 6 June 2013.
For the year under review, the business continued to perform strongly.
Underlying operating profit increased eight per cent on the previous period.
Underlying earnings per share increased 14 per cent to 62.8 pence per Ordinary Share.
Accordingly, the strong performance in EPS growth has generated maximum annual bonus payments for Executive Directors, being 100 per cent of individuals' base salaries.
Long-term incentive awards made in March 2009 under the shareholder-approved Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP were subject to a relative total shareholder return TSR measure.
Over the 3-year performance period, Dignity returned 54 per cent compared to the median of the TSR peer group of 82 per cent and as a consequence none of the award vested.
We believe that this represents a fair link between reward and performance for the year under review.
Remuneration Policy for 2013 We are committed to ensuring that rewards for executives are closely aligned to the interests of shareholders through having all our incentive arrangements linked to challenging performance targets, focused on growing earnings and generating market-beating levels of shareholder return.
Following prior consultation with shareholders, we will be changing the performance measures attached to awards to be made under the LTIP in March 2013.
Whilst Total Shareholder Return TSR remains an important benchmark of the success of the Company and provides a strong alignment with the returns received by shareholders, to improve the line of sight between performance and reward for executives and to target more directly the long-term financial performance of the business, an Earnings per Share measure will also be introduced for future awards.
Each measure TSR and EPS growth applies independently, each to 50 per cent of the overall LTIP award.
In line with best practice, the Committee is also introducing clawback provisions into the Group's annual bonus plan and LTIP and share ownership guidelines for Executive Directors.
Except for executive salary reviews, no other changes to remuneration are being made for 2013.
The Remuneration Committee encourages dialogue with the Companys shareholders and will consult with major shareholders ahead of any significant future changes to the remuneration policy.
We were delighted that the 2011 Remuneration Report received a 98.5 per cent vote in favour at the last AGM.
Thank you for your continued support.
Alan McWalter Chair, Remuneration Committee 6 March 2013 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 34 | Our business Governance Financial statements Other information Introduction This report sets out the remuneration policy operated by the Group in respect of the Executive Directors, together with disclosures on all Directors remuneration.
In addition to considering the new proposals from BIS on disclosure, this Directors remuneration report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports 2008 regulations which set out the current requirements for the disclosure of Directors' remuneration, and also in accordance with the requirement of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
The current legislation requires the auditors to report on the auditable parts of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, the auditable parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the relevant legislation.
The Board has reviewed the Groups compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2010 the Code on remuneration related matters and has followed the Code in the preparation of the report of the Remuneration Committee.
It is the opinion of the Board that the Group complied with all remuneration related aspects of the Code during the period.
Policy report The objective of the remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages to each Executive Director that will: Align rewards with the interests of shareholders: Motivate and encourage superior performance: Allow the Group to retain the talent needed to execute its business strategy: Enable the Group to be competitive when recruiting appropriately skilled and experienced management: and Ensure that the overall package for each Director is linked to strategic objectives.
The Remuneration Committee believes that this policy will retain and develop further the Groups entrepreneurial culture, whilst also focusing executive remuneration on performance which the Committee believes will best serve shareholders interests.
It is therefore the aim of the Remuneration Committee to encourage and reward superior performance by Executive Directors with that performance being based on strong financial performance and returns to shareholders.
This is achieved by weighting the overall remuneration package towards achievement of that performance.

The precise targets are commercially sensitive and will be disclosed when the bonus outcome is determined and reported in the 2013 remuneration report.
The targets are ratified by the Board and are designed to enhance shareholder value.
Profit growth is a key Group financial measure and consistent with this, the Committee has chosen EPS targets to determine the payment of annual bonuses for 2013.
Total Shareholder Return is an important benchmark of the success of the business and provides a strong alignment with the returns received by shareholders.
The FTSE 350 index is an appropriate comparator group given the lack of directly comparable companies in the UK and because Dignity is a constituent of the group.
The EPS measure ensures a focus on long-term profitability which the Committee believes is a driver of shareholder value.
In accordance with the ABI guidelines, the Group can issue a maximum of 10 per cent of its issued share capital in a rolling ten year period to employees under all share plans.
In addition, of this 10 per cent, the Company can only issue five per cent to satisfy awards under discretionary or executive plans.

Alternatively, following notice of termination the Company may terminate an Executive Directors contract with immediate effect by paying an amount equal to base salary plus the fair value of contractual benefits subject to the deduction of tax.
There are no special provisions relating to change of control.
The policy on termination is that the Group does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations and the Committee ensures that there are no unjustified payments for failure.
In accordance with the terms of the UK Corporate Governance Code all Directors submit themselves for reelection at the Annual General Meeting each year.
No Executive Directors hold a NonExecutive position with any other company.
However, the Group allows one such appointment per Executive Director, for which they can retain the fees.

This feedback, plus any additional feedback received during any meetings from time to time, is then considered as part of the Company's annual review of remuneration policy.
For 2013, we were grateful for the constructive feedback received from major shareholders and representative bodies on our proposals to introduce an EPS measure alongside relative TSR under the LTIP for 2013.

None of the annual bonus is deferred.
Vesting occurs on a straightline basis between those points.

Membership of the Remuneration Committee Unaudited The Code requires that a Group of the size of Dignity plc has a Remuneration Committee comprising a minimum of three nonexecutives.
The Committee is chaired by NonExecutive Director, Alan McWalter.
The Committee members until 1 April 2012 were Bill Forrester, Alan McWalter, Ishbel Macpherson and James Newman.
After their retirement from the Board, Bill Forrester and James Newman were replaced by Jane Ashcroft and Martin Pexton.
The Remuneration Committee members have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interests arising from cross directorships and no daytoday involvement in running the business.
The NonExecutive Directors are not eligible for pensions and do not participate in the Groups bonus or share schemes.
The Remuneration Committee determines and agrees with the Board, within formal terms of reference, the framework and policy of Directors and senior managements remuneration and its cost to the Group.
The Committee considers the performance of the Executive Directors as a prelude to recommending their annual remuneration, bonus awards and share awards to the Board for final approval.
The Committee met five times during the year.
At those meetings basic salaries of Executive Directors and senior managers were reviewed, the targets and quantum of annual performance related bonuses for Directors were also agreed, as were awards granted under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The meetings also approved the payment of the 2011 performance related bonus and dealt with the vesting of the shares awarded in 2009 under the LTIP scheme.
During the year, the Committee also introduced share ownership guidelines for the Executive Directors and clawback provisions for the annual bonus and LTIP.
The Committee also receives advice from several sources, namely: The Chairman and the Chief Executive who attend the Remuneration Committee by invitation or when required and the Company Secretary, who is also the Corporate Services Director, attends meetings when required as Secretary to the Remuneration Committee.
No Executive Director takes part in discussions relating to their own remuneration and benefits.
