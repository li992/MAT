Remuneration report Dear shareholder As the new chairman of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to present our remuneration report for 2012, for which we will be seeking your approval at our Annual General Meeting in January 2013.
As outlined earlier in this Annual Report, performance this year has been strong.
We have made excellent progress against our strategic goals, improving the store format and customer experience, expanding product selection, increasing market share in our major categories, improving our multi-channel off ering and expanding the brand internationally.
We have grown gross transaction value, like-for-like sales, profi t before tax and earnings per share during the year and the share price has increased from 52p to 96.5p, adding c. 550 million of value for shareholders.
Remuneration Committee: Main activities during the year The Committee believes that the remuneration for executives for the year appropriately refl ects this performance against the demanding targets we set for them.
Annual bonus Reviewed the executive remuneration payments of 40% of base salary will be made as a result of profi t before tax PBT strategy for 2013 performance of 158.3 million 4.2% growth on last year, 52 weeks to 1 September 2012 Approved the executive directors vs 52 weeks to 27 August 2011 and long-term incentive awards granted in 2009 will vest bonuses for 2012 for the fi first time since the Company listed in 2006, with PSP awards vesting just above threshold and ESOP awards vesting in full refl ecting progress towards long-term goals.
Approved the executive directors bonus plan for 2013 During the year, the Committee reviewed the performance measures for the annual bonus plan and determined that the 2013 annual bonus plan will be based on 80% PBT Approved share awards and vesting performance and 20% on a like-for-like sales and gross margin percentage performance of awards matrix previously 100% based on PBT.
The Committee considers that these measures Reviewed remuneration benchmarking are consistent with the four pillars of our strategy and therefore most appropriate to create a strong alignment with shareholder value creation and eff ectively incentivise executives to Reviewed its terms of reference grow profi t and like-for-like sales on an annual basis whilst motivating focus on gross margin.
After careful consideration and personal consultation with a number of major shareholders and investor representatives, the Committee decided that for 2013 only, the Chief Executive will be made a PSP award of 200% of base salary.
The Committee deemed it appropriate to make a slightly larger award to the Chief Executive this year in light of the strong business performance since his appointment, including signifi cant share price appreciation, his exceptional personal performance and to enhance his longer term alignment with our four pillared strategy.
The Committee believes this award will have a very positive retention and motivational impact on the Chief Executive.
For 2014, it is intended that the award level will revert to the normal policy.
This year we have seen signifi cant focus on improving the transparency of reporting on executive pay.
Although based on the current timeline Debenhams will not be formally required to provide disclosure in line with the legislation until the year ending August 2014, we have provided some additional disclosures in order to help shareholders better understand our remuneration policy and practice.
Our directors remuneration report received a strong level of support in January 2012 with 98% of shareholders voting in favour of the resolution.

Part 1: Unaudited information The Remuneration Committee Committee members The Committee chairman, Dennis Millard chairman from 1 September 2012 is joined by Nigel Northridge, Martina King, Mark Rolfe and Sophie Turner Laing to form the Remuneration Committee.
Details of each of the members background and experience is provided within their biography on pages 56 to 57.
Role of the Committee The full terms of reference for the Committee, which are reviewed annually, are available on the Companys website at www.
In summary, the Committee has responsibility for determining all elements of the remuneration of the executive directors and the Company Secretary together with the provisions of their service agreements, reviewing the bonus structure for senior managers below board level, reviewing the appropriateness and relevance of the Companys remuneration policy taking into account the remuneration arrangements and levels across the Company and administering all aspects of any share incentives in operation for senior management.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is a matter for the Company Chairman and the executive members of the board.
Advisors to the Committee In performing its duties, the Committee has received advice from Deloitte LLP Deloitte who acted as external advisors to the Committee throughout the fi financial year, providing independent advice on directors remuneration and share incentives.
Deloitte is one of the founding members of the Remuneration Consulting Group RCG and complies with the voluntary code of conduct in respect of the provision of remuneration consulting services.
Deloitte also provides industry and comparative employee remuneration data to Debenhams management.
Deloitte also provided unrelated advisory services in respect of corporate and employment taxes during the year.
The Chief Executive, Chief Financial Offi cer and HR Director have attended Committee meetings and provided advice to the Committee during the year.
They are not in attendance when matters relating to their own compensation or contracts are discussed.
Remuneration policy It is the Companys remuneration policy to provide packages that will attract, motivate and retain high calibre executives in a competitive retail market and, where possible, to do this in the most cost eff ective way for the business.
Remuneration structures are designed to support the business strategy with the majority of the remuneration package being linked to the delivery of performance, paid in a combination of cash and shares.
Short-term and long-term performance measures have been selected to be aligned with the delivery of the four pillared business strategy through an annual focus on increasing sales volume while improving margin and profi tability and a long-term focus on growing earnings which ensure that returns to shareholders remain strong.
When determining remuneration policy and arrangements for executive directors, the Remuneration Committee considers pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group to ensure that pay structures from executive director to store manager are appropriately aligned and that levels of remuneration remain appropriate in this context.
The Remuneration Committee also considers the pay and practices of companies of a similar size and complexity and other companies in the retail sector through the review of external survey data and benchmarking provided by Deloitte in order to inform its consideration of the remuneration of Company executives.
In addition to basic salary and pension provision or equivalent cash contribution, the Company seeks to incentivise its executives and senior managers through an annual bonus scheme and through its share incentives.
Remuneration policy for 2013 The Remuneration Committee considered the remuneration policy during the year and determined that the majority of elements would remain the same as for 2012.
However, the Committee did review and make changes to the annual bonus performance targets and the PSP opportunity for the Chief Executive for 2013.
Further details are provided later in this report.

The Committees policy is to set base salaries at an appropriate level to attract and retain the quality of individuals required to run a business of the size and complexity of Debenhams successfully but without paying more than is necessary to do this.
The salary increases awarded to the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Offi cer with eff ect from 1 September 2012 of 615,000 2.5% and 410,000 2.5% respectively are in line with the wider Company pay policy.
Executive directors bonus schemes 2012 bonus As disclosed in last years remuneration report, the annual bonus scheme for executive directors for 2012 was based on PBT with a maximum bonus potential of 100% of base salary.
A target payout of 40% of salary would have been triggered by the achievement of a PBT target of 158.3 million with the maximum only being paid out for performance signifi cantly in excess of this level.
The Committee considered the target to be both stretching and represent value creation for shareholders.
For 2012 the Company achieved the target PBT of 158.3 million which represented growth of 4.2%, 52 weeks to 1 September 2012 vs 52 weeks to 27 August 2011.
The Committee believes that the 40% bonus payment, recognises the excellent performance of the executive directors in terms of delivery against the strategic pillars and fi financial improvement over the period in what was another challenging year for the retail sector.
68 Debenhams plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview 2 Strategy review 10 Finance and risk review 32 Sustainability 46 Governance 52 Accounts 75 2013 bonus The Committee reviewed the operation of the annual bonus plan during the year and decided to introduce a like-for-like sales and gross margin percentage performance matrix alongside the existing PBT measure.
The weighting of the measures will be 80% PBT and 20% gross margin percentage performance matrix.
The Committee considers that these measures are the most appropriate to create a strong alignment with shareholder value creation and eff ectively incentivise executives to grow profi t and like-for-like sales on an annual basis whilst motivating focus on increasing the gross margin.
This is illustrated below: 2012 performance measures 2013 performance measures 20% LFL sales and gross margin matrix 100% 80% PBT performance PBT performance The maximum bonus opportunity will remain at 100% of base salary, payable in cash.
40% of the bonus will be payable for delivering threshold levels of performance with the maximum bonus only being payable on the delivery of performance signifi cantly in excess of plan.
The Companys share incentives The Committee continues to consider that the Debenhams Performance Share Plan PSP is the most appropriate long-term incentive plan for the business as it provides an incentive to deliver superior corporate performance whilst creating alignment with shareholder interest through the delivery of shares.
As communicated last year, it is the Committees intention to grant long-term incentive awards annually to executive directors and other key senior managers under the PSP.
The Debenhams Performance Share Plan PSP The Committee has discretion to grant awards under the PSP up to a maximum of 200% of base salary to executive directors and other senior executives.
Up to 250% of base salary may be awarded in exceptional circumstances.
Awards under the PSP comprise a right to receive free shares or a nil cost option.
Awards under the PSP normally vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant and in the case of nil cost options must be exercised within six months of vesting subject to satisfaction of performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the time awards are granted and generally provided that the participant remains in employment.
In addition, in order for the award to vest the Remuneration Committee must be satisfi ed that the underlying fi financial performance of the Company over the performance period is suffi cient to justify the vesting of the award.
2013 award levels The Remuneration Committee proposes that for 2013 only the Chief Executive will be made a PSP award of 200% of base salary to ensure alignment with the four pillared strategy.
It is intended that the PSP award level for the Chief Executive in future years will return to the normal level of 150% of base salary.
The award for the CFO will be 100% of base salary.
Performance measures The vesting of PSP awards is based on stretching earnings per share EPS and return on capital employed ROCE performance targets.
The Committee considers that EPS and ROCE are the most appropriate performance metrics for our business, as growing our earnings while maintaining an effi cient and sustainable level of return on capital is a key strategic driver of business performance and they are closely aligned with the creation of shareholder value.
For any fi financial year of the Company, ROCE means profi t before interest and tax excluding any pension credit or debit divided by consolidated balance sheet net assets excluding net debt, pension balances, corporation tax and deferred tax.
Should any performance condition not be met at the end of the relevant performance period, that portion of the award will lapse immediately without any opportunity to re-test the relevant performance condition.
Targets for 2013 awards Following shareholder consultation, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the performance targets for the awards to be made in November 2012 and, in the context of the long-term strategic plan, analysts forecasts and market practice, agreed that the 25% of award based on ROCE performance be stretched to trigger threshold vesting at average ROCE equal to the cost of capital plus 1%.
The targets therefore proposed for awards to be made in November 2012 are: Performance measures 75% based on absolute EPS growth 25% based on ROCE performance vs cost of capital Targets Threshold 30% vesting Absolute EPS growth of 6% per annum Average ROCE equal to the cost of capital plus 1% Maximum 100% vesting Absolute EPS growth of 12% per annum Average ROCE equal to the cost of capital plus 5% Both the EPS and ROCE elements of the awards vest on a straight line basis between 30% and 100% based on performance achieved between the threshold and maximum targets disclosed.
Debenhams plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 69 Remuneration report continued 2009 and 2011 PSP awards The table below sets out the performance conditions of the 2009 and 2011 PSP awards.
Date of grant Vesting criteria Performance condition over three year period 24 November 2009 EPS growth Below absolute growth of 6% pa zero vesting Absolute growth of 6% pa 30% vesting Absolute growth of 10% pa 100% Between absolute growth of 6% and 10% pa straight line basis between 30% and 100% 23 May 2011 EPS growth Below absolute growth of 6% pa zero vesting Absolute growth of 6% pa 30% vesting Absolute growth of 10% pa 100% Between absolute growth of 6% and 10% pa straight line basis between 30% and 100% 1 November 2011 Performance measures 75% based on absolute EPS growth 25% based on ROCE performance vs cost of capital Targets Threshold Absolute EPS growth Average ROCE which is equal to the cost of capital 30% vesting of 6% per annum Maximum Absolute EPS growth Average ROCE equal to the cost of capital plus 5% 100% vesting of 12% per annum Reported EPS in the 2008 09 base year for the PSP performance period ended 1 September 2012 was impacted by the fi rm placing and placing and open off er of new share capital that took place in June 2009, prior to the grant in November 2009 of PSP share awards for this performance period.
In accordance with the PSP rules the Remuneration Committee has determined that it would be appropriate for this purpose for base year EPS to be calculated as if the fi rm placing and placing and open off er took place at the start of the year with a corresponding increase to profi t after tax to refl ect the interest benefi t from the additional capital.
On this basis, EPS growth for the period amounted to 6.1% and 32% of the award granted in November 2009 will therefore vest on 24 November 2012.
In reaching this decision, the Remuneration Committee considered that: the minimum EPS growth targets of 6% per annum were appropriately based on this methodology: no other PSP awards vested during the performance period in question though determination thereof utilised this method and therefore no participants benefi tted from awards based on any other methodology: and that the resultant outcome was fair in the context of the earnings performance demonstrated, particularly over the last fi financial year, in what has been a very tough economic climate for the retail sector.
No awards under the PSP vested or were exercised during the year.
The Debenhams Deferred Bonus Matching Plan the DBMP The Committee has discretion to invite participants to invest up to 100% of net annual bonus earned into shares invested shares.
If the participant remains in service for three years and retains the benefi cial ownership of all the invested shares, then subject to the satisfaction of a stretching performance target s he is eligible to receive a matching share award equal to the pre-tax amount of the bonus that has been invested.
If the performance target is not met at the end of the performance period, the matching share awards lapse immediately and the invested shares are returned to the participant.
There is no opportunity to re-test the performance condition.
All bonus eligible employees were off ered the opportunity to invest up to 50% of the 2010 bonus.
Matching awards were therefore made under this plan in November 2010.
These awards have a primary performance metric of EPS.
In addition, the awards are subject to the achievement of an underpin level of ROCE performance.
No executive directors have participated in the DBMP.
This plan has not been operated since November 2010.
The Debenhams 2006 Executive Share Option Plan the ESOP The Committee has discretion to grant options to acquire shares to eligible employees.
It is not currently intended that executive directors will participate in the ESOP other than in exceptional circumstances e. g. recruitment.
Options with a face value of up to a maximum of 100% of base salary can be granted under the plan.
Options may, in exceptional circumstances, be granted with a market value in excess of this amount at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Options can be granted in the form of unapproved options or HM Revenue & Customs approved options up to the prescribed HMRC limit, currently 30,000.
Share options are granted at the closing mid-market price on the day prior to the date of grant and normally become exercisable three years after grant, expiring seven years later.
The exercise of the options is subject to performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the time awards are granted.
In addition, in order for the award to vest, the Remuneration Committee must be satisfi ed that the underlying fi financial performance of the Company over the performance period is suffi cient to justify the vesting of the options.
For options granted under the Scheme in 2009, the performance measure was based on the Companys ROCE exceeding the cost of capital.
The Committee considered that ROCE was an appropriate performance condition as it incentivises sustainable, effi cient profi t performance.
If the performance condition is not met at the end of the performance period, the options will lapse immediately without any opportunity to re-test the relevant performance condition.
The Committee will consider the performance conditions for any future award of options at the time of grant.
The table below sets out the performance conditions of ESOP options existing during the year: Date of grant Vesting criteria Performance condition over three year period 24 November 2009 ROCE growth against ROCE cost of capital zero vesting cost of capital ROCE cost of capital 30% vesting ROCE cost of capital 5% 100% vesting Between these points the options vest on a straight line basis between 30% and 100% Based on ROCE performance exceeding the cost of capital by 7.8% during the three year performance period ended 1 September 2012, the options granted in November 2009 will become exercisable in full on 24 November 2012.

The Debenhams 2008 Share Incentive Plan The Debenhams 2008 Share Incentive Plan is an unapproved plan operated by the Company.
This plan is focused at key senior managers and it is not intended that executive directors would participate in this plan.
The purpose of the plan is to retain and incentivise key employees in the short to medium-term.

The Trust also holds the invested shares of participants of the DBMP totalling 344,765 shares.

Funding of share schemes It is the Companys current intention to satisfy any future requirements of its share schemes in a method best suited to the interests of the Company, either by acquiring shares in the market utilising shares held as treasury shares or, subject to institutional guidelines, issuing new shares.
Where the awards are satisfi ed by newly issued shares, the Company will comply with ABI guidelines on shareholder dilution.
Current levels of shareholder dilution are 0.69% 2011: 0.30% of share capital.
Change of control Generally the rules of the Companys share schemes provide that in the event of a change of control, awards options would vest to the extent that the performance conditions where applicable are satisfi ed at the date of such event.
