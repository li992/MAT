The Remuneration Committee continued 1.6 Terms of appointment of the Chairman and the non-executive directors Letters of appointment set out the key duties and expectations for the non-executive Chairman and the independent non-executive directors.
They include appropriate time commitments, provisions for induction and familiarisation with the businesses and wider senior management team and require approval for other directorships and potential conicts of interest.
The dates and unexpired terms of the letters of appointment for the non-executive directors in ofce at 31 December 2012, which are available for inspection at the annual general meeting and at the Companys registered ofce, are as follows: Unexpired term at 01.01.13 Date of letter or date of letter of Date of appointment of appointment appointment if later as a director P Bentley 01.02.13 2 years 9 months 01.10.12 C P Forster 01.02.13 2 years 9 months 01.10.12 A M Frew 05.03.13 12 months 02.03.06 T M Gateley 01.02.13 4 months 01.11.03 B Nrgaard 01.02.13 2 years 10 months 06.11.12 R Quarta 01.09.11 1 year 10 months 01.06.11 R J Stack 01.02.13 1 year 5 months 13.06.08 The normal period from initial appointment to first renewal is three years.
After six years, renewal is usually considered on an annual basis.
This applied to T M Gateley whose final term expires after the 2013 annual general meeting, to ensure he continues to be available as senior independent director to support the Chairman and A M Frew, whose term was put on an annual basis in March 2013.
Appointments are made under a letter of agreement subject to removal under the Companys articles of association, and all directors will be submitting themselves for annual re-election at the annual general meeting in accordance with the new UK Corporate Governance Code.
There are no provisions for the Company to give notice or pay compensation in relation to the early termination of the appointment of the Chairman or any non-executive director.
There is a provision in the appointment letters to the effect that a non-executive director is normally expected to give at least one months prior notice of termination to the Company and, in the case of the Chairman, three months notice.
Executive Directors remuneration and terms of appointment This section of the Remuneration Report is not required to be audited.
2.1 Statement of policy The Company aims to ensure that remuneration generally, and incentives in particular, provide strong alignment between individual performance, business performance and shareholder interests.
The remuneration policy also recognises that the Company operates in global and highly competitive markets with the vast majority of its activities outside the UK.
The policy is to provide competitive remuneration packages to attract, motivate, reward and retain executives of the calibre required, and to align their interests with those of shareholders by relating a significant element of the remuneration package to performance.
During 2012 the committee reviewed the structure and metrics of the incentive arrangements for the executive directors from a risk perspective and concluded that they were aligned with an appropriate level of risk-taking and with shareholders interests.
The Remuneration Committee considers it to be important to maintain the exibility to respond to individual circumstances.
However, its normal approach has been to pay salaries within appropriate market competitive ranges, combined with realistic potential for above-market total compensation if performance is outstanding.
Board reports 50 BUSINESS OVERVIEW GROUP OPERATING REVIEW RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS BOARD REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In setting the remuneration of each executive director, the Remuneration Committee takes into account their role and responsibilities, skills and individual performance and makes reference to market rates as evidenced by published studies and comparisons with international UK-based groups of a similar size and complexity.
The policy of the committee is to set performance conditions for incentives which are both stretching but also reasonably attainable in the environment in which the Company is then operating.
2.2 Executive Director remuneration The chart below shows the composition of the Chief Executives remuneration package at below threshold, target and maximum scenarios under the IMI remuneration policy.
The total remuneration package links corporate and individual performance with an appropriate balance between short and long-term elements, and xed and variable components.
This supports the committees policy that a significant proportion of remuneration should be performance-related and that the Company rewards executives for investing in and retaining shares within IMI.
The committee considers that the targets set for the different elements of performance-related remuneration are both appropriate and demanding in the context of the business environment and the challenges with which the Group is faced.
The Remuneration Committee considers the quantum of the Chief Executives remuneration to be appropriate and commensurate with the scale and growing performance of the Company, changes to the pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group and strong alignment with the creation of shareholder value.

Board reports 52 BUSINESS OVERVIEW GROUP OPERATING REVIEW RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS BOARD REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2.4 Base salary Salary reviews for the executive directors are conducted annually with increases, if any, normally effective from 1 January.
Salaries are set by the Remuneration Committee taking into account the executives role, responsibilities and individual performance and external benchmark data looking at UK listed companies of similar size, complexity and international presence.
The committee uses such external benchmark data with caution in view of the risk of an upward ratchet of remuneration levels.
The Remuneration Committee has also received information about and had regard to pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group.
The committee has the discretion to take account of environmental, social and corporate governance matters when setting the remuneration of the executive directors.
The salaries for the 2012 financial year were reviewed in December 2011 and increases for January 2013 were agreed in December 2012 taking into account the financial performance of the Group, uncertain economic conditions, comparative market data and the need to balance internal relativities across the IMI Group.
The changes taking effect from 1 January 2013 are shown in Table A on page 52.
2.5 Annual Incentive Plan Executive directors participate in an Annual Incentive Plan see Table B on page 54.
The Annual Incentive Plan supports the business strategy by driving and rewarding performance against annual financial, strategic and operational goals which are consistent with the medium to long-term strategic needs of the business and also take into account individual behaviours and contribution.
The 2012 Annual Incentive Plan metrics were weighted as follows: 80% on financial performance and 20% on a range of non-financial measures including personal objectives.
Achievement of the 2012 Annual Incentive Plan is set out in Table B on page 54.

All the bonus metrics have a sliding scale calibration and on-target performance results in a payment of 50% of the maximum bonus.
The Annual Incentive Bonus maximum is shown in Table B below.
There are no changes proposed for the 2013 Annual Incentive Bonus maxima.
The alignment of Annual Incentive Bonus payments to the executive directors with Group profit before tax is illustrated in the chart below.

The committee retains power to reduce or withhold annual bonus payments in exceptional circumstances and in line with best practice it has reserved the power to seek claw-back of bonuses in certain circumstances.
The 2012 annual bonuses will be paid in March 2013 on the usual payroll date.
2.6 Long-term incentive plans The Company operates two long-term share incentive plans for executive directors.
The Share Matching Plan which is a performance-based investment arrangement: and the Performance Share Plan which is a conventional long-term performance incentive plan.
Board reports 54 BUSINESS OVERVIEW GROUP OPERATING REVIEW RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS BOARD REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2.6.
1 Share Matching Plan The Share Matching Plan SMP runs in conjunction with the Annual Incentive Plan and is linked to the achievement of the share ownership guidelines for executive directors and senior executives.
Under the SMP individuals may invest up to 100% of their maximum annual bonus potential into shares: the limit being set on an annual basis by the Remuneration Committee.
The committee intends to allow such a maximum level of investment in 2013.
By investing in the SMP, matching shares may be earned, which vest after three years, subject to the achievement of stretching performance conditions.
Current policy is that awards made under the share matching arrangements, where settled in shares, will be satisfied through shares purchased in the market but the committee retains the exibility to use new issue and treasury shares.
Matching awards allow for a higher level of match of up to 200% for shares that are purchased through the voluntary investment of bonus or other monies.
Lower levels of match, up to 125% for the Chief Executive and 100% for other executive directors, apply when the annual bonus is required to be invested in shares, in the event that the executive had not met their share ownership guideline.
The matching share awards are subject to improvement in Economic Value Added EVA over a three year period.
The calculation of EVA is based on segmental operating profit after tax with appropriate adjustments, less a capital charge on the invested capital in the business reecting IMIs cost of capital.
Further details of the performance conditions attaching to existing awards are set out in the notes to the table on page 67.
The performance period for the 2010 SMP awards ended on 31 December 2012 and EVA over the three years to this date was 511m.
This is above the top end of the vesting schedule and consequently the 2010 SMP awards will fully vest in March 2013.
In line with best practice, the committee retains power to claw-back awards in exceptional cases see Section 6.1 for further details on discretionary powers.
2 Performance Share Plan The Performance Share Plan PSP aligns the interests of the executives and shareholders through the delivery of awards in shares and provides a retention tool for key executives.
The PSP allows for share-based awards worth up to a maximum of 100% of annual salary.
The vesting of awards is subject to the satisfaction of stretching performance conditions over a three year period.
The current policy is for PSP awards, where settled in shares, to be satisfied through shares purchased in the market but the committee retains the exibility to use new issue and treasury shares.
The 2010 PSP awards are due to vest in March 2013 at 100% of maximum.
The performance conditions for the PSP awards granted since 2009 and to be granted in 2013 are shown below: Grant Vest Performance Conditions % of award 2009 2012 Relative total shareholder return TSR 100% Earnings per share EPS 50% 2012 2013 Return on operating capital employed RoOCE 25% 2011 2014 Relative total shareholder return TSR 25% Earnings per share EPS 50% 2012 2015 Relative total shareholder return TSR 25% 2013 2016 Organic revenue growth CAGR 25% IMI plc Annual Report 2012 55 ENGINEERING ADVANTAGE REMUNERATION REPORT 2.
Executive Directors remuneration and terms of appointment continued 2.6.
2.1 EPS performance condition EPS was chosen as an appropriate measure because it rewards absolute growth in underlying earnings and because the Remuneration Committee believed it worked well in combination with TSR which is a comparative measure.
The performance condition for one half of the 2012 PSP awards and the intended 2013 PSP awards will be based on the Companys compound annual earnings per share growth over a three year period.
The Remuneration Committee sets the EPS targets in respect of each annual award at the level it considers appropriately stretching given the conditions in which the Company is operating.
The vesting schedule for the awards subject to the EPS performance condition proposed to be granted in 2013, which is the same for the 2012 awards, is as follows: Compound EPS growth Vesting 15% per annum 100% Between 6% and 15% per annum Pro-rata between 25% and 100% 6% per annum 25% Less than 6% per annum 0% As for the 2012 awards, the EPS measure for intended 2013 PSP awards will be based on adjusted basic earnings per share which includes adjustment for the elimination of the after-tax cost of restructuring, acquired intangible amortisation, financial instruments, but including economic hedge contract gains and losses, and excluding any other items meeting the denition of an exceptional item as dened in the Group Accounting Policies.
2.2 Total Shareholder Return performance condition Total Shareholder Return TSR is well understood and accepted as a performance measure for long-term incentives and links rewards to shareholder value.
IMIs relative TSR performance at the end of the three year performance period ended 31 December 2012 placed it at the top end of the upper quartile of the comparator group.

The vesting schedule for the element of awards subject to the TSR performance conditions is as follows: Ranking Vesting Upper quartile top 25% 100% or above Between median and upper Pro-rata between 25% and 100% quartile Median 25% Below median 0% To ensure that TSR reects improvement in the underlying performance of the Company the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the financial performance of the Company over the performance period warrants the level of vesting as calculated under the TSR condition.
In the event that the Remuneration Committee is not satisfied in this respect on the vesting of a PSP award it has committed to disclose the factors that it reviewed and give a commentary on the exercise of its overriding discretion.
The TSR comparator group as at 31 December 2012 is as follows: Name Country Name Country Amada Japan Manitowoc United States Atlas Copco 'A' Sweden Meggitt United Kingdom BBA Aviation United Kingdom Metso Finland Bodycote International United Kingdom NSK Japan Borgwarner United States Parker-Hannin United States Cobham United Kingdom Pentair United States Eaton United States Rotork United Kingdom Emerson Electric United States Sandvik Sweden Fanuc Japan SKF 'B' Sweden Flowserve United States SMC Japan GKN United Kingdom Spectris United Kingdom Halma United Kingdom Spirax-Sarco United Kingdom Heidelb.

Note: Cookson Group demerged in December 2012 to form two entities: Vesuvius and Alent.
The ow control business that is relevant to IMI is owned by Vesuvius and accordingly the Remuneration Committee has determined that Cookson Group will be removed from the listing at the point of demerger and Vesuvius will be added to the list for new awards.
The 2013 comparator group will be the same as it was in 2012 subject to any delisting.

2.2 Total Shareholder Return performance condition continued The graph below compares the Companys total shareholder return over the five years ended 31 December 2012 with that of the FTSE All Share Industrial Engineering Index and the FTSE All Share Index.
The FTSE All Share Industrial Engineering Index was chosen as a comparator index because it is the industry share index in which the Company is classied and provides a reasonable benchmark for assessment of its relative performance.
The FTSE All Share Index was chosen as it is a relevant broad equity market index.
Over the past five years the IMI share price has outperformed the FTSE All Share Industrial Engineering Index by 38% and outperformed the FTSE All Share Index by 184%.
Over the same period, total shareholder return has outperformed the FTSE All Share Industrial Engineering Index by 100% and outperformed the FTSE All Share Index by 247%.
2.3 Organic revenue growth performance condition Given the focus on organic revenue growth, and the acceptance that strong margin discipline is rmly embedded across the Company, in 2012 the Remuneration Committee decided that for the 2012 PSP award and this will apply to the 2013 award as well, the RoOCE element was to be replaced with a three year compound growth in organic revenue.
Organic revenue growth % calculated as a compound annual growth rate - CAGR has been adopted for 25% of the 2012 and the 2013 PSP awards to encourage continued focus on organic growth.
Board reports 58 BUSINESS OVERVIEW GROUP OPERATING REVIEW RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS BOARD REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Average CAGR % Vesting 8% 100% Between 2.7% and 8% Pro-rata between 25% and 100% 2.7% 25% Less than 2.7% 0% Details of the awards made under the PSP are contained in the table of directors awards on page 65.
In line with best practice, the committee retains the power to claw-back awards in exceptional circumstances see section 6.1 for further details on discretionary powers.
2.4 Return on Operating Capital Employed performance condition Return on Operating Capital Employed RoOCE was adopted as a performance measure for a portion of PSP awards in 2010 and 2011 to incentivise sustained working capital improvement.
For the 2010 award which vests in March 2013, following the acquisition of Z&J, the RoOCE targets attached to the 2010 PSP awards were adjusted as follows: Average RoOCE Vesting 30% 100% Between 24% and 30% Pro-rata between 25% and 100% 24% 25% Less than 24% 0% For the 2011 award which vests in 2014, RoOCE has been dened to exclude intangible assets and has been calibrated as follows: Average RoOCE Vesting 85% 100% Between 65% and 85% Pro-rata between 25% and 100% 65% 25% Less than 65% 0% IMI plc Annual Report 2012 59 ENGINEERING ADVANTAGE REMUNERATION REPORT 2.

3 Share ownership guidelines The executive directors and senior executives are subject to share ownership guidelines.
To the extent that an individual does not meet their shareholding guideline, up to 50% of the annual bonus award is required to be invested in shares and a matching award will be made under the Share Matching Plan SMP at a lower level of maximum match.
If the individual meets the shareholding guideline, then the investment of their bonus in shares is encouraged through participation in the SMP with matching at the higher level.
The shareholding guidelines were increased in 2009 to 125% of salary for all the executive directors to be achieved by those in ofce at that time by 30 June 2011 or, for new appointments, within a five year period after joining the Board.
When assessing compliance with this guideline the committee review both the level of beneficial share ownership and vested but unexercised share incentive awards on a post tax basis.
All of the executive directors met the guidelines at the year end.
The levels of holdings for continuing executive directors at the end of 2012 relative to basic salaries calculated using the average share price in December 2012 were as follows: Executive Director Level of share ownership M J Lamb 1007% D M Hurt 989% S Toomes 329% R M Twite 526% 3.
All Employee Share Plans This section of the Remuneration Report is not required to be audited.
3.1 UK SAYE plan The Company operates an HM Revenue and Customs approved savings related share option scheme which is open to the majority of the Groups UK employees, including the UK-based executive directors, and allows the grant of options to all participants at a discount of up to 20% below the market price.
Such schemes are not subject to performance conditions and offer tax incentives to encourage employees to use their own money to purchase shares in their employers business or group.
3.2 Share Incentive Plan SIP UK executive directors also participate in an All Employee Share Ownership Plan which is open to the majority of the Groups UK employees.
Shares to a value equal to the lower of 3,000 and 0.6% of each participants basic salary will be acquired in 2013 at market value by the Trustee of the plan in respect of their participation during 2012.
The plan is not operated subject to specic performance conditions.
Eligible employees are able to invest up to 1,500 annually in a tax-efficient manner in purchasing partnership shares under the plan.
Each of the UK executive directors makes the maximum contribution from their salary towards partnership shares under the plan.
Matching shares may be awarded in respect of partnership shares acquired under the plan although the policy to date has been not to award any matching shares.
3.3 Global Employee Share Purchase Plans GESPP New all-employee share plans intended to encourage employee investment in IMI shares were approved by shareholders at the 2011 annual general meeting and save as you earn type plans were launched in the USA and Germany with extension into China underway for 2013 grants.
Board reports 60 BUSINESS OVERVIEW GROUP OPERATING REVIEW RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS BOARD REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3.4 Share Option Plan A share option plan for senior employees was established in 2009 and shareholder approval of this plan was given at the 2011 annual general meeting in order to introduce the exibility to satisfy awards using new issue and treasury shares.
No directors or others who receive PSP awards receive such share options.
Share dilution The Association of British Insurers has set recommended guidelines on the number of new issue and treasury shares that can be used under a companys share plans.
The guidelines are 10% of the issued share capital in any 10 year period for all share plans, with an inner limit of 5% in 10 years for executive schemes.
IMI operates within these limits and its standing as at 31 December 2012 was 2.36% and 1.24% respectively.
Pension entitlement This section of the Remuneration Report is not required to be audited.
The IMI Pension Fund was closed to all employees in respect of future service from 31 December 2010 and alternative pension arrangements were established including an Executive Retirement Plan ERP, which was intended to be a tax-efficient long-term savings vehicle for UK senior managers to save for retirement outside the registered pensions regime.
Discretionary contributions were made to the ERP in 2010 and 2011 but it has since been rendered tax ineffective and no contributions were made during 2012 or are expected to be made in future.
5.1 Pension benets provided for 2012 service Executive directors are entitled to receive a taxable cash allowance instead of pension benets.
With the Remuneration Committees approval the executive directors may, at their discretion, redirect part or all of their allowance into any dened contribution pension arrangement in the country in which they are contracted.
The 2012 pension allowances were 35% of salary and were as follows: M J Lamb 259,000 D M Hurt 141,750 R M Twite 141,750 I W Whiting 80,500 S Toomes 115,500 pro-rated to date of leaving S Toomes participates in a company pension arrangement in Switzerland and the Company contributions to this arrangement are met wholly from the pension allowance described above.
The key elements of this pension arrangement are: a retirement age of 65, with the accumulated retirement funds at that time converted to a pension on rates in force at s that time: contributions on salary up to a specified limit 84,081 for 2012 are invested in a fund that has a minimum growth rate, s which is prescribed by law and is currently 1.5% a year: contributions on salary over this specified limit 84,081 for 2012 are invested in a fund with no investment return s guarantees and benets which are insured are also payable on death or disability before the age of 65. s IMI plc Annual Report 2012 61 ENGINEERING ADVANTAGE REMUNERATION REPORT 5.
Pension entitlement continued 5.2 Pension benets for past service M J Lamb, R M Twite and S Toomes were previously active members of the dened benefit IMI Pension Fund.
M J Lamb opted out with effect from 6 April 2006: R M Twite opted out with effect from 1 February 2007 and S Toomes from 31 August 2010.
As a result they retain past pensionable service benets up to these dates and the value of this is shown in the table on page 68.
The nature of these benets is more complicated than the pension benets provided in respect of 2012, but the key elements are summarised below: The normal retirement age under the Fund is 60 for M J Lamb, and 62 for R M Twite and S Toomes.
M J Lamb may elect to s retire from employment with IMI and receive a pension at any time after age 55 with Company consent and age 57 without any actuarial discount, and R M Twite and S Toomes may retire from employment with IMI any time after age 60 without actuarial discount.
On death after retirement, a dependants pension is provided equal to two-thirds of the members pension for M J Lamb s and 50% of the members pension for R M Twite and S Toomes.
Should M J Lamb die within the first five years of retirement, a lump sum is also paid equal to the balance of five years s pension payments.
For R M Twite and S Toomes, the dependants pension is increased to 100% of the members pension for the remainder of the five year period.
Pensions in payment, in excess of any guaranteed minimum pension, are increased each year in line with price ination s up to a maximum of 5% in respect of pension built up before 1 January 2006, and 2.5% in respect of pension built up after 1 January 2006.
M J Lambs past pension benets generally continue to be linked to final salary ination averaged over the past three s years and equivalent benets to those provided for under the Fund rules immediately prior to closure are preserved in relation to ill-health retirement, death in service and early retirement at the Companys instance.
The difference between these benets and those automatically provided under the Fund, the Enhanced Protection Member EPM benets, is assessed as at 31 December each year until death in service or retirement on ill-health grounds or at the Companys instance and there may be a payment to the Fund to augment Fund benets or a payment in lieu to M J Lamb or his estate or by way of contribution to the ERP or another pension arrangement shortly after each year end until a final augmentation or payment is made following death in service or relevant early retirement event.
No EPM benets were payable as at 31 December 2012 or 31 December 2011.
I W Whiting is eligible for benets under two arrangements in the US.
The first is a dened contribution arrangement, the IMI 401 k Plan.
The second is a dened benefit arrangement, the Control Components Inc Employees Pension Plan.
His pension from this plan is payable from age 65 without further increase.
I W Whiting was also a member of the IMI Americas Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan a dened benefit arrangement but on leaving the Group with fewer than 10 years service no benets are due to him from this Plan.
The policy regarding pension arrangements for new executive director appointments will be exible to take account of the individual position, the cost of pension arrangements to the Company, including in particular the cost of dened benets, and the alternative forms of pension provision.
However, the norm would be not to offer dened benets to new executive directors.

Termination clauses This section of the Remuneration Report is not required to be audited.
Consistent with the policy on service contracts, the executive directors service contracts are subject to termination on one years notice by the Company or the executive directors.
Contractual retirement age for UK-based executive directors is 65 and for Switzerland-based executive directors, 60.
These contracts do not include any specic provision for compensation payable upon early termination save that, as a consequence of the closure of the IMI Pension Fund on 31 December 2010, the Company has made alternative contractual arrangements in lieu of certain contractual entitlements to pension benets, which, but for the closure, would have been provided through the IMI Pension Fund to all members in the same membership category as the Chief Executive.
The alternative contractual arrangements for all these members include augmentation of Fund benets to the level that would have been provided save for the closure or payment in lieu for benets arising on early retirement by reason of redundancy or other termination at the Companys instance.
Had such benets arisen for the Chief Executive as at 31 December 2012, the estimated cash cost to the Company would have been approximately 5.0m.
The payment in lieu computation is designed to be neutral to the Company on a net of tax basis when compared to the cash contributions that would otherwise have been expected to provide the benets through the Fund.
The dates of the contracts and period to normal retirement age for those serving as executive directors during the year are as follows: Date of Date of Period to contractual Date joined appointment to Date of service resignation from retirement age as at Group Board contract Board Notice period 31.12.12 M J Lamb 31.10.86 18.07.96 01.01.11 - 12 months 12 years D M Hurt 01.05.06 01.07.06 01.10.06 - 12 months 8 years 5 months S Toomes 18.02.85 01.06.11 01.09.11 06.03.13 12 months 20 years 5 months R M Twite 26.09.88 01.02.07 01.02.07 - 12 months 19 years 5 months I W Whiting 18.07.05 01.09.10 01.01.10 22.08.12 12 months 16 years 6.1 Discretionary Powers The committee retains power to reduce or withhold Annual Incentive Bonus payments and awards under the long-term incentive share plans in exceptional circumstances as described below.
In line with best practice it has also reserved the power to seek claw-back of bonuses in certain cases as explained below.
Claw-back conditions feature in all incentive share plan schemes and annual incentive bonus rules.
Exceptional circumstances would include the requirements to restate the accounts of the Companys group, for example for a correction of an error as dened by IAS8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors, in circumstances where, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the original overstatement in the accounts has resulted, or would result, either directly or indirectly, in either a participants awards vesting or Annual Incentive Bonus result, at a greater level than would have been the case had the misstatement not been made: or where a participant is found guilty of any serious criminal offence as determined in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee arising out of or in connection with the participants ofce or employment with a participating company.
External appointments Executive directors may accept one external appointment with the consent of the Board, and are normally allowed to retain fees from external non-executive directorships.
M J Lamb was appointed a non-executive director of Severn Trent Water plc & Severn Trent Water Ltd on 29 February 2008 and received fees in the year to 31 December 2012 of 49,087 2011: 46,350.
D M Hurt was appointed a non-executive director of Tate & Lyle PLC on 10 March 2010 and received fees in the year to 31 December 2012 of 58,438 2011: 55,800.

Directors share awards This section of the Remuneration Report is required to be audited.
Directors share awards continued 9.1 Table of SAYE, PSP and SOP awards continued a & b No performance conditions are attached to the UK SAYE or US SAYE options.
c 2009 PSP awards were entirely based on comparative TSR subject to the Remuneration Committee being satisfied that the relative TSR position reects underlying performance with vesting at median 25% vests to upper quartile full vesting.
2009 PSP awards vested in full in 2012. d The 2009 PSP awards carried a right to receive dividend equivalents.
The performance condition was satisfied in full see above and technically the award vested in March 2012.
However, at this time IMI was in a prohibited period and consequently the executive directors were not permitted to exercise their 2009 awards.
The share rights described in the table above against this note include the dividend equivalent of the 2011 final dividend paid in May 2012 as a result of this legal constraint on exercise.
e & f 2010 and 2011 awards were based on 25% TSR measures with the vesting scales as described in c above: 50% on EPS growth of between 6% per annum 25% vests to 15% per annum full vesting over the three-year performance period: and, the other 25%, on RoOCE with vesting on a linear scale from 24% originally 25% before adjustment made in 2011 following the acquisition of Z&J 25% vests to maximum for RoOCE of 30% originally 32% before adjustments made in 2011 following the acquisition of Z&J.
g The 2012 awards were based on 50% EPS, 25% TSR as described in e and c above with the remaining 25% upon organic revenue growth with vesting on a linear scale from 2.7% 25% vests to 8% per annum 100% vests.
h & i SOP awards shown were made to I W Whiting and S Toomes prior to their appointment as executive directors and are not subject to performance conditions.
Executive directors are not eligible to participate in the SOP.
The 2009 SOP Award vested on 3 September 2012.
The award price is the exercise price for awards structured as options and the price used to calculate the number of shares for PSP awards to UK participants in the PSP which are structured as deferred share awards or nil cost options and, in each case, is determined by reference to an average middle market quotation without discount.
The closing price of the Companys ordinary shares at 31 December 2012 was 10.97 per share and the closing price range during the year was 7.76 to 11.07.
The annual priority targets were weighted equally in 2009, between cash conversion and profit drop-through and, in 2010 and 2011, between cash conversion and return on sales.
The 2009 SMP awards vested in 2012 at 95%.
b Dividend awards relating to the vesting of the 2009 SMP award.
If the 2009 SMP award was not exercised or was partially exercised the dividend missed due to the delay in vesting in 2012 is accrued into the vested unexercised award and is paid on exercise.
c The performance measures for the 2010 SMP award was EVA over the years 2010 to 2012.
Vesting is tiered with linear progression in each band as follows: 0% to 25% of maximum for positive EVA up to 235m, 25%-50% for 235m to 335m, 50%-75% for 335m to 369m originally 395m before adjustment made in 2011 following the acquisition of Z&J and 75% to 100% for between 369m originally 395m before adjustment made in 2011 following the acquisition of Z&J and 475m.
d The performance measures for the 2011 SMP was compound annual growth in EVA over the years 2011 to 2013 compared to EVA in the preceding three years.
No awards will vest if compound growth is negative.
10% of awards will vest for positive compound annual growth over the period, with subsequent vesting being tiered with linear progression in each band as follows: 10%-25% vesting for compound annual growth between 0% and 6% and 25% to 100% vesting for compound growth between 6% and 17%.
e The performance measured for the 2012 SMP was the compound annual growth rate of the average EVA of the Group over the performance period 2012 to 2014.

2 For M J Lamb, S Toomes and R M Twite the increase in the accrued pension during the year reects the increase under the IMI Pension Fund, which is generally in line with ination.
No allowance has been made for the value of benets that may be derived by the payment of additional voluntary contributions.
For I W Whiting the reduction shown over 2012 relates to the IMI Americas Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan see note 3 below, in US dollar terms the benefit under the Control Components Inc. Employees Pension Plan does not change from year to year.
3 Figures have been converted using exchange rates of 1:$1.62 as at 31 December 2012 1:$1.55 as at 31 December 2011.
The transfer value as at 31 December 2011 includes 153,000 in respect of the value of benets accrued under the IMI Americas Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan.
On leaving the Group in August 2012 having completed fewer than 10 years service no benets are due under this Plan.
The transfer value as at 31 December 2012 relates solely to the benets under the Control Components Inc. Employees Pension Plan.
The transfer values that would be payable from the IMI Pension Fund at the relevant date are also shown in the table, together with the transfer value at the end of the year of the increase in the accrued pension over the year net of ination.
The transfer value shown is the estimated capital value of the future pension payments in retirement, determined by the Funds Trustee in accordance with the appropriate statutory requirements.
During 2012 the actuarial assumptions were reviewed and amended, resulting in increases in transfer values of around 15% for categories of membership including the above individuals.
In respect of I W Whitings benets under US pension arrangements, the transfer value quoted is based on the method and assumptions used by the Company to account for the costs associated with US dened benefit pension schemes see note 19 to the financial statements on pages 116 to 122.
Under the method and assumptions used by the Company to account for the costs associated with its dened benefit pension schemes, the aggregate value of the accrued benets as at 31 December 2012 for the executive directors was 12.5m 2011: 11.8m.
