The Committee ensures that executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of a high calibre, to recognise the international nature of the Groups business and to reward the directors for enhancing value to shareholders.
The Committee also takes into account pay and employment conditions throughout the Group in determining the overall remuneration for the year.
The performance measurement of the executive directors and the determination of their annual remuneration package is undertaken by the Committee with advice from Kepler.
The package targets median levels of xed pay, supplemented by performance-related annual bonuses and equity-based long-term incentive plans designed to reward and incentivise growth, provide a strong link to Group and individual performance and to take account of corporate governance best practice.

Exit payments for executive directors Should the Company terminate the executive directors service contracts in breach of contract terms, then damages would be due equivalent to annual remuneration plus the value of benets for the unexpired notice period less 5% of the aggregate sum.
The EPP and ESOS rules provide for vesting in certain circumstances in the event of an executive leaving the Company, for example, retirement, redundancy or leaving through ill-health.
The rules also determine that awards will vest if there is a change of control.
Unvested awards would usually be reduced pro-rata to take into account the proportion of the performance period not completed and the extent to which the performance condition for each award has been met.
More details are available in the rules which are available to shareholders on request.

Executive directors are allowed to hold external appointments and to receive payment provided such appointments are agreed by the Board or Committee in advance, there are no conicts of interests and the appointment does not lead to a deterioration in the individuals performance.
