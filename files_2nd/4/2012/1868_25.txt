As a Remuneration Committee consequence of the softer market conditions experienced during 2012 and despite a good underlying operating performance the percentage of salary awarded to Simon Pryce for his 2012 bonus has fallen from 104.4% to 58.7% and for Mark Hoad from 103.4% to 58.7%.
The emoluments and fees for 2012 shown in Table 1 on page 72 for Simon Pryce and Mark Hoad have fallen by 17% and 12% respectively.

Mark Harper In formulating and implementing remuneration policy, the Committee continues to engage in proactive dialogue with its Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 28 February 2013 major investors and their representative bodies and also reflect, where practical, the constantly evolving and differing views of stakeholders and the variety of approaches that are perceived as best practice for UK listed companies in the area of executive remuneration.
Prior to the 2012 AGM, ISS RREV proxy advisory services issued a vote against recommendation in respect of the resolution to approve the 2011 Remuneration Report and just over 20% of shareholders voted against this resolution.
There has therefore been more detailed consultation with shareholders and representative bodies to clarify aspects of, and the rationale behind, our policy and practice and changes to our plans for 2013.
As a result of feedback received during this period, the Remuneration Committee intends to look at ways to further simplify our management incentives in the future for 2014 and beyond.
Directors Report 64 Directors Remuneration Report Remuneration summary The Committee believes that driving improvements in the Groups ROIC and adjusted EPS are the principal mechanisms for creating sustainable shareholder value.
These two measures will be applied to all awards granted in 2013 under the Deferred Bonus Plan DBP and the LTIP.
The elements of the executive directors remuneration planned for 2013 are summarised in the tables opposite and described in more detail in the rest of the Report.
Remuneration mix The following charts show the balance between fixed and variable elements of the remuneration package for each of the executive directors.
The upper bar on each chart shows the position labelled target if half of the maximum potential variable remuneration was received.
The lower bar on each chart shows the position labelled stretch if the maximum potential variable remuneration was received.
As more stretching performance is achieved, so the proportion of variable to fixed remuneration increases.
The actual value of performance-related incentives will depend on actual performance.
The targets for variable remuneration include operating profit, free cash flow, adjusted EPS and ROIC, all of which strongly align to the Companys strategic objective of creating longer-term sustainable value.
Simon Pryce: target Fixed remuneration: includes base salary, bene ts and contribution to pension stretch Variable remuneration: short-term incentive plan delivered in cash and deferred bonus award Variable remuneration: longer-term incentives Mark Hoad: target stretch | 0 25 | 50 | 75 | 100 | Financial performance for 2010 2012 The graphs and table below show the Groups performance over the last three years.
