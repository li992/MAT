Variable remuneration policy Performance-related bonus scheme As detailed above, the Remuneration Committee believes it is important that the Executive Directors are incentivised in a way thatis aligned with the Companys strategy and the interests of the Companys shareholders.
A performance-related bonus scheme currently exists for the Executive Directors which was structured in 2012 in order to achieve the Companys strategic objectives in the manner outlined below.

The Executive Directors are then notified of these targets in January.
However, once set, the Committee continually reviews these targets throughout the year to ensure that they remain appropriate and importantly, regardless of the achievement of financial targets, ultimately has discretion over the paying out or otherwise of any annual performance-related bonus.
Long-term incentive plans Long-term incentive plans are considered to be an important part of the Executive remuneration policy, designed to support management retention and motivation, whilst aligning senior managements interests with those of shareholders.
The details of the historical grants made to the Executive Directors and associated performance conditions are set out in the table of Directors Interests in Share Plans on page 46.

The Board believes that the Executive Director bonus payments for 2012 reflect both its disappointment that the issues in our German business arose andits view that the response of the Group Executive Management to these issues was both appropriate anddecisive.
