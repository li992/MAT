The Committee believes Chairman of the Remuneration Committee that the structure implemented last year remains appropriate and supports long-term growth.
The key features of our remuneration policy at Tesco are: Alignment with strategy Our remuneration arrangements are designed to ensure that Executive Directors are aligned with the delivery of our long-term strategic objectives and the creation of shareholder value.
The majority of our reward is linked to the delivery of stretching performance over the short and long term and is delivered in shares.
Our short-term performance is measured in relation to underlying profit performance and the delivery of key strategic objectives.
Our long-term performance is measured by assessing the growth in our earnings per share and the level of our return on capital, measures which are central to our long-term strategy.
Simple, collegiate approach to remuneration Our remuneration arrangements are designed to be simple to provide clarity to both ourExecutives and to shareholders.
All Executives participate in a common incentive framework to ensure teamwork in delivering our key strategic goals.
Creating alignment with shareholders by building a shareholding in our business We believe that it is important that our employees are shareholders in the business to create alignment with our shareholders.
The CEO is required to hold shares with a value of four times salary with other Executives being required to hold shares with a value of three times salary.
Most Executives already hold shares in excess of this requirement.

Benchmarking group The Committee examines salary levels at the major retailers, the leading FTSE companies and ensures consideration is also given to appropriate international competitors.
Relationship to all The Committee also takes into account pay conditions throughout the Group in deciding executive employee pay annual salary increases.
The average increase for established Executive Directors last year was 2.4%.
The average increase for senior management below Board level last year was 2.4%, and for other employees the average increase was typically around 2.5%.
Pay levels Group-wide are determined with consideration to a number of factors, including the prevailing economic environment, discussions with employee representative groups, and current market practice.
Review date Base salaries are typically reviewed with effect from 1 July each year.
The next salary review will be 1 July 2012 and salaries following this review will be disclosed in next years report.
Pension Philosophy Pension provision is central to our ability to foster loyalty and retain experience, which is why Tesco wants to ensure that the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme is a highly valued benefit.
Pension policy All Executive Directors are members of the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme, which provides a pension of up to two-thirds of base salary on retirement, normally at age 60, dependent on service.
Pension drawn before age 60 will be actuarially reduced to reflect early retirement.
The Final Salary Scheme is now closed to new entrants and has been replaced in the UK for new entrants throughout the organisation by a defined benefit pension scheme based on career average earnings.
Our defined benefit pension is a key incentive and retention tool throughout the organisation and remains an important part of our reward package for all UK employees.
SURBS Since April 2006, following implementation of the regulations contained within the Finance Act 2004, and the subsequent changes to the annual allowance in 2010, Executive Directors have been eligible toreceive the maximum pension that can be provided from the registered pension scheme.
The balance of any pension entitlement for all Executive Directors is delivered through an unapproved retirement benefits scheme SURBS.
Except for Tim Mason US CEO, the SURBS is secured by using a fixed charge over a cash deposit in a designated account.
Employee contribution Over the last few years employee pension contributions by our Executive Directors have been increasing progressively.
In 2011 12 the level of employee contribution was 10% of salary which is in line with contribution levels by senior management below Board level.
Contributions for 2012 13 will remain at this level.
The Company is currently consulting with employees regarding some proposed changes to the pension scheme.
These changes, which would be expected to come into effect from 1 June 2012 and only apply to benefits that build up in the future, will apply to all participants in the scheme including the Executive Directors.
There are two proposed changes.
The first is that, whilst the Normal Pension Age remains unchanged, the age at which a full pension is paid will increase by two years and which will be adjusted up or down to reflect any further unexpected changes in life expectancy.
Secondly, we will increase pensions, up to 5%, by CPI instead of RPI.
Further details of the pension benefits earned by the Directors can be found on page 80.

To ensure full alignment with best practice, the Committee has decided that the policy for new executives joining the Board will be to restrict termination payments in lieu of notice to a sum based on salary and benefits only.
This was reflected in the new service contract for Philip Clarke on his appointment to CEO.

The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to CEO from appointment on 2 March 2011 1,100 make such adjustments under the new plan but will only do so when theimpact is material.
Other Executive Directors 852 Clawback provisions apply to awards, allowing the Committee to Director Corporate and Legal Affairs 639 scale back awards potentially to zero in the event that results are materially misstated.
The average increase for established Executive Directors last year was 2.4%, which was broadly the same as the increase for other senior executives and employees throughout the Group.
Salary increases over Remuneration decisions for Executive the last three years have been aligned with those of other employees.
Directors in 2011 12 Despite achieving record sales and profits and improved ROCE performance, 2011 12 has been a challenging year for Tesco, particularly in the UK and Tesco Bank.
Nevertheless there were encouraging signs for the future in many of our key growth opportunities.
Our International business performed strongly, with promising sales growth in all three regions: Asia, Europe and particularly the United States.
Online sales, akey strategic area, also grew strongly.

Long-term performance Vesting of 2009 10 to 2011 12 awards Awards vesting in the year were made under the previous long-term incentive arrangements, comprising both share options and performance related shares.

The Committee determined, however, that it was appropriate to base vesting of PSP awards on ROCE including the impact of Japan to ensure alignment with shareholders.
13.0% Assessment of the quality of ROCE The Committee also exercised its judgement as to the Tesco extent to which the remaining 25% of the PSP award should vest by reference to the overall quality of ROCE performance, taking into account factors including: 12.5% the level of ROCE achieved: 25% vesting the expected ROCE for additional and existing capital investment: 12.0% whether capital spend was in line with strategic objectives and balanced short-term and long-term investment needs: and the level of sales and underlying profit growth and whether this reflected other developments in the marketplace.
The Committee considered these factors and concluded that there were no reasons to treat the remaining 25% of the award differently and therefore determined that the vesting for the remaining 25% of the award should be in line with vesting for the first 75% of the award.
Overall therefore 69.7% of the maximum award vested.
International ROCE performance 2011 12 8.0% Post Tax International ROCE 2011 12 including the discontinued Japan business was below the level of International ROCE required for threshold levels of vesting and therefore 0% of the International Full vesting award will vest.

The targets are set out below.
The second tranche 2011 12 of the award was subject to testing against US Return on Capital Employed ROCE and Earnings Before Interest and Tax EBIT targets and the targets were not met.
The 2010 11 targets were also not met so no part of this award has vested to date.
The next assessment of performance will be in respect of 2012 13.
It is currently considered unlikely that any portion of these awards will vest.
