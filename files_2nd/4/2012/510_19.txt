reMuneration report SuMMary StateMent A statement to shareholders from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to present the Directors Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2012.
Aggrekos remuneration policy remained unchanged during 2012, and our approach to implementation has also remained consistent with previous years.
The Remuneration Committees focus is on ensuring that the way we manage remuneration for Executives rewards them for delivering what we see as being their central responsibility to increase the value of the business to shareholders consistently and over a long period of time.
The main focus of the Committees work is to manage the various aspects of the remuneration package of Executive Directors at Aggreko which comprises: salary: annual bonus: the Companys Long-term Incentive Plan LTIP : pension and life assurance: and other benefits, including healthcare and expatriate benefits for Directors seconded away from their home country.
The Committee met four times during 2012: details of members attendance are set out in the table on page 59.
The main tasks for the Committee during 2012 were: Reviewed and approved the Executive Directors bonuses for 2011.
Set targets for Executive Directors bonuses for 2012.
Reviewed performance and approved the vesting of 2009 LTIP awards.
Reviewed and approved targets for the 2012 LTIP grant.
Reviewed and recommended to the Board the remuneration for Ken Hanna on his appointment as Chairman.
Decided on levels of pay and benefit increases in the annual salary review.
Approved the financial arrangements for Directors upon their redundancies.
Approved the proposed remuneration packages for the new regional Directors.
Reviewed the possible changes in reporting requirements and ensured that Aggreko was compliant.
Consulted informally with major shareholders on matters of remuneration policy.
The Committee is aware of the ongoing public debate on executive remuneration in the UK and is sensitive to the concerns of shareholders and other stakeholders on this subject.
During the year, the Committee has kept abreast of the developments in regulatory thinking on shareholder voting rights and the reporting of Directors remuneration.
Although the proposed new reporting requirements are not yet finalised, we have opted to incorporate a number of the proposed changes in this years report to enhance transparency.
This report is therefore divided into two distinct sections: a Policy Report and an Implementation Report.
The Policy Report outlines Aggrekos remuneration policy for 2013, setting out the role of each element of pay, how the structure of the package helps reinforce the achievement of Aggrekos strategy, and details of reward opportunities available to the Companys Executive Directors.
The Implementation Report details how the policy was implemented in 2012, and includes a table for the new single figure of total remuneration for all Directors.
We hope these changes help make the Remuneration Report clearer and easier to understand, and would welcome any feedback.
russell king Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 7 March 2013 70 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Directors Report coMpliance StateMent This Report covers the period 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012 and provides details of the Remuneration Committees role and the remuneration policy we apply in decisions on executive remuneration.
The structure of this report has been modified from previous years to take account of the proposed regulations put forward by The Department of Business, Innovation and Skills.
The Company has complied with the principles and provisions relating to Directors remuneration in the UK Corporate Governance Code, and this Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with the Large & Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008.
In accordance with Section 439 of the Companies Act 2006, an advisory resolution to approve this report will be proposed at the AGM on 25 April 2013.
In accordance with the Regulations, the following sections of the Remuneration Report are subject to audit: Pensions & Benefits pages 79 and 80, 2009 LTIP Awards Vesting pages 82 and 83, 2012 LTIP Awards Granted & Sharesave Plans pages 83 and 84, and Directors Emoluments table pages 86 and 87.
The remaining sections of the Remuneration Report are not subject to audit.
reMuneration coMMittee The Committees principal function is to determine Aggrekos policy on executive remuneration and to approve specific remuneration packages for its Executive Directors, Company Secretary and such senior members of the executive management, for example the Executive Committee, as it is asked by the Board to consider, including their service contracts with the Company.
The Committees remit includes, but is not restricted to, basic salary, benefits in kind, performance related awards, share options and share awards, long-term incentive schemes, pension rights, and any compensation or termination payments.
The Committee also has responsibility for making a recommendation to the Board in respect of the remuneration of the Chairman.
The full Terms of Reference of the Committee are available on our website at http: ir.
policy report Key principles of the remuneration policy The Committee has adopted a number of principles which it applies to the way it sets, balances and adjudicates different elements of remuneration for the Executive Directors.
As a general policy, we aim to ensure that our remuneration policy rewards executives for delivering what we see as being their central responsibility to increase the value of the business to shareholders consistently and over a long period of time.
More specifically, our policy is to have a reward package structured such that: the fixed element of pay i. e. salary, pension and benefits is around the median for companies of similar size and complexity: the majority of executive remuneration is linked to Aggrekos performance, with a heavier weighting on long-term performance than on short-term performance: and the remuneration packages reward a balanced portfolio of measures which deliver value for shareholders, which can be independently verified, and which give clear line-of-sight to the Executives.
In determining the Companys remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee takes into account the particular business context of Aggreko plc, the industry in which we operate, the geography of our operations, the relevant talent market s for each of our Executives, as well as the best practice guidelines published by institutional shareholders and their representative bodies.
The Remuneration Committee will keep remuneration policy under review during the forthcoming year, and, in doing so, will continue to give full consideration to the principles set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code in relation to Directors remuneration and to the guidance of investor representative bodies.
In particular, the Remuneration Committee intends to review all aspects of 2013 variable pay to ensure it continues to be aligned with the Remuneration Policy and Company strategy.
The Committee will consult with major shareholders before making any significant changes.

Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 73 reMuneration report CONTINUED Share ownership guidelines The Committee has a policy of encouraging Executive Directors to acquire and retain a material number of shares in the Company, with the objective of further aligning their long-term interests with those of other shareholders.
Under this policy, Executive Directors who are not within five years of their normal retirement age should hold at least 50% of the net proceeds from any shares vesting until their aggregate shareholding is equivalent to at least 100% of their salary.
Current Executive Director shareholdings are set out in the Implementation Report on pages 85 and 86.
Pay-for-performance: scenario analysis The graphs below provide estimates of the potential future reward opportunities for Executive Directors, and the potential split between the different elements of remuneration under three different performance scenarios: Minimum, Target and Maximum.
Potential reward opportunities illustrated above are based on the remuneration policy, applied to the base salary in force at 31 December 2012.
For the annual bonus, the amounts illustrated are those potentially receivable in respect of performance for 2013.
For the CIP, the award opportunities assume full voluntary investment in Aggreko shares.
It should be noted that the LTIP awards granted in a year do not normally vest until the third anniversary of the date of grant.
The projected value of LTIP amounts excludes the impact of share price movement.
"In illustrating potential reward opportunities the following assumptions are made: Annual bonus LTIP Fixed pay Minimum No annual bonus payable Threshold not achieved but minimum Latest base salary, amount vesting under the CIP pension, benefits Target On target annual bonus Performance warrants 25% vesting "" Maximum Maximum annual bonus Performance warrants full vesting "" 74 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Directors Report Remuneration of senior executives below the Board The policy and practice with regard to the remuneration of senior executives below the Board is consistent with that for the Executive Directors."
Senior executives participate in the LTIP with the same performance measures applied.
In 2012, 150 individuals about 2.6% of employees were invited to join one or both of the Plans.
In making remuneration decisions, the Remuneration Committee also considers the pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group, and is informed of changes to broader employee pay.
The Remuneration Committee does not specifically consult with employees over the effectiveness and appropriateness of the remuneration policy and framework, although as members of the Board they receive the results of the Companys periodical employee satisfaction survey which includes questions covering remuneration.
The increase to the base salaries of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer with effect from 1 July 2012 of 8.9% and 8.1%, respectively, is above the average increase across the Group of 4%.
However, the salaries of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer remain well below median, and their larger increases reflect a move towards median, in line with our policy, over time.
Details of Executive Directors service contracts The Executive Directors are employed under contracts of employment with Aggreko plc.
The Remuneration Committee sets notice periods for the Executive Directors at 12 months or less, which reduces the likelihood of having to pay excessive compensation in the event of poor performance.
The principal terms of the Executive Directors service contracts which have no fixed term are as follows: Notice period Executive Director Position Effective date of contract From Company From Director Rupert Soames Chief Executive 1 July 2003 12 months 12 months Angus Cockburn Chief Financial Officer 1 May 2000 12 months 12 months Debajit Das Regional Director, Asia Pacific 1 January 2013 12 months 12 months Asterios Satrazemis Regional Director, Americas 1 January 2013 12 months 12 months David Taylor-Smith Regional Director, Europe, 11 March 2013 6 months 6 months Middle East & Africa increasing increasing to 12 months to 12 months after 12 months after 12 months continuous continuous service service Former Executive Directors who have served during 2012 Kash Pandya Former Regional Director, 20 June 2005 12 months 12 months Aggreko International Bill Caplan Former Regional Director, 17 November 200812 months 12 months Europe and Middle East George Walker Former President, 1 January 2001 12 months 12 months North America Exit payments policy The Companys policy is to limit severance payments on termination to pre-established contractual arrangements.
In the event that the employment of an Executive Director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined in accordance with the terms of the service contract between the Company and the employee, as well as the rules of any incentive plans.
It is also the Companys policy to negotiate extended non-compete agreements where they are considered appropriate to protect the Companys interests.
Under normal circumstances, the Company may terminate the employment of an Executive Director by making a payment in lieu of notice equivalent to basic salary and benefits for the notice period at the rate current at the date of termination.
In case of gross misconduct, a provision is included in the executives contract for immediate dismissal with no compensation payable.
In the event an Executive Director leaves for reasons of death, ill-health, injury, redundancy, retirement with the agreement of the Company, or his employing Companys ceasing to be a member of the Group or other such event as the Remuneration Committee determines, then Performance Share Plan awards held for less than one year will lapse: those held for more than one year will be pro-rated for time and will vest based on performance over the performance period as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Co-investment Plan awards held for less than one year will give the Minimum Match only: those held for more than one year will vest over the Minimum Match and the remainder will be pro-rated for time and vest as soon as practicable after the date of leaving, based on performance up to that date.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 75 reMuneration report CONTINUED Upon the occurrence of a takeover, scheme of arrangement, winding-up or a demerger a Corporate Event, Performance Share Plan awards held for less than one year will lapse: Co-investment Plan awards held for less than one year will vest in part in respect only of the Minimum Match i. e. on a 1:2 basis.
LTIP awards granted at least 12 months prior to the date of the relevant Corporate Event will vest to the extent that, in the opinion of the Committee, the Performance Conditions have been or would have been satisfied on the date of the relevant Corporate Event.
For all other leavers, outstanding LTIP awards will normally lapse.
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to alter these provisions on a case-by-case basis, following a review of circumstances, to ensure fairness for both shareholders and participants.
External appointments It is the Boards policy to allow the Executive Directors to accept directorships of other quoted companies.
Any such directorships must be formally approved by the Chairman of the Board.
Details of external directorships held by Executive Directors, together with fees retained during the year are as follows: Executive Director Company Role s held Fees retained Rupert Soames Electrocomponents plc Senior Independent Director 103,417 formerly Acting Chairman Angus Cockburn Howden Joinery Group plc Non-executive Director 48,000 GKN plc Non-executive Director n a w. e. f. 1 January 2013 Angus Cockburn has informed the Company that he intends to step down from the Board of Howden Joinery Group plc once a successor has been recruited.

It is estimated that the salary fees, benefits and pension that would be payable for the period 1 January 2013 to 15 September 2013 will be 331,600.
Note 2 This is paid in local currency and for the purposes of this table has been converted into Sterling using the average year to date exchange rate of 1 US$1.5854.
Note 3 Bill Caplan resigned as a Director on 13 November 2012 and his salary fees, benefits, pension and bonus are shown pro-rated to that date.
He will continue to be employed by the Company until 30 September 2013 in accordance with the arrangements described in Exit arrangements made during the year on page 84.
It is estimated that the salary fees, benefits, pension and 2012 pro-rated annual bonus that would be payable for the period 14 November 2012 to 30 September 2013 will be 364,200.
The figures have been calculated as follows: 1.
Base salary fees: amount earned for the year.
Benefits: the taxable value of benefits received in the year.
Pension: the amount of any Company pension contributions and cash in lieu.
The increase in transfer value of Angus Cockburns interest in the defined benefit scheme is not included in this table but is referred to on page 80.
Annual bonus: the total bonus earned on performance during the year.
LTIP: the market value of shares to vest under the 2010 LTIP on 15 April 2013 on performance to 31 December 2012 73% vesting on performance based on the average market value over the last quarter of 2012 of 2128.59p.
Details of awards under the 2009 LTIP, which vested on 16 April 2012, are not included in this table but are set out on pages 82 and 83.
Base salary Annual salaries for Executive Directors are generally reviewed each year by the Committee.
Salaries are determined by a combination of the individuals contribution to the business, the market rate for the position and the range of salary increases applying across the Group.
We aim to pay the market median for standard performance and up to market upper quartile for upper quartile performance.
On occasions it may be necessary to pay above the market median to attract people of the right calibre to meet the needs of the business.
In setting Executive Director salaries, as with other elements of their remuneration, the Committee has discretion to consider all relevant factors, including performance on environmental, social and governance issues.
The appropriate market rate is the rate in the market place from which the individual is most likely to be recruited.
The Company operates in a number of market places throughout the world where remuneration practices and levels differ.
This can result in pay and benefit differentials between the Executive Directors.
In arriving at an appropriate market rate, we commission studies from our advisers, who carry out in-depth research on the practices of Aggrekos peer group to establish accurate benchmarks.
The same approach is taken for expatriate and overseas salaries where reference is made to the appropriate data for the geographical location.

Pensions Executive Directors participate in pension schemes or receive cash in lieu with a value appropriate to the median practice in their home countries.
In 2002 the Company closed its Defined Benefits scheme for UK employees to new joiners, and as a consequence Angus Cockburn is the only Director who is a member of this scheme.
The other Executive Directors are members of the Aggreko plc Group Personal Pension Plan, which is a defined contribution scheme.
Rupert Soames is entitled to a pension contribution from the Company of 30% of his basic salary 25% prior to 1 July 2012 and other Executives are entitled to a Company contribution of 20%.
With effect from April 2011 no further contributions are being made to the Plan for Rupert Soames and he receives a cash payment in lieu.
Other Executive Directors have elected to take part of the Company contribution into the Group Personal Pension Plan and part as a cash payment.
These cash payments are shown as Cash payments in lieu of pension in the Emoluments table on page 86.
George Walker is entitled to participate in the Employees Savings Investment Retirement plan and the Supplemental Executive Retirement plan of Aggreko LLC, which is governed by the laws of the United States.
These plans allowed contributions by the employee and the Group to be deferred for tax.
2 The payments in 2012 are up to date of resignation, 13 November 2012.

Angus Cockburn joined the Company before 1 April 2002 and is a member of the Aggreko plc Pension Scheme which is a funded, defined benefit scheme approved by Her Majestys Revenue & Customs.
The key elements of his benefits are: a normal retirement age of 60: for service up to 31 December 2006, a benefit accrual rate of 1 30th on a final salary basis for each years service final salary is subject to the earnings cap for service to 5 April 2006 : for service after 1 January 2007 and up to 30 April 2011, a benefit accrual rate of 1 30th on a career average basis for each years service: Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 79 reMuneration report CONTINUED for service from 1 May 2011, no further defined benefit pension is accrued: an employee contribution rate of 6% of Pensionable Earnings.
Employee contributions ceased on 30 April 2011: a spouses pension on death.
As a result of opting out of making further contributions to the Aggreko plc Pension Scheme with effect from 30 April 2011, Angus Cockburn now receives a cash payment in lieu of the pension he would otherwise have built up.
This cash payment is paid net of the member contributions he would have been required to pay to the scheme and is broadly an estimate of the cost to the Company of providing the benefits being given up.
For 2013 onwards, the amount will be adjusted by CPI growth each year subject to a minimum of 25% of salary.
This is shown as Cash payments in lieu of pension in the Emoluments table on page 86.
The following disclosure relates to Angus Cockburns membership of the Scheme.
Transfer Transfer Increase value of value of Accrued Increase in accrued accrued accrued Directors Increase pension at in accrued pension during pension at pension at contributions in transfer 31 December pension 2012 net of 31 December 31 December during value during 2012 during 2012 inflation 2012 2011 the year 2012 Age pa pa pa Angus Cockburn 49 85,023 4,049 1,547,730 1,466,961 80,769 Angus Cockburns transfer value has increased by 5.5% over 2012.
The main factors were the increase in his pension entitlement for statutory revaluation 5%, which was greater than the previous RPI assumption 3.4%, the fact that he is one year older and that all else being equal the assumptions used to calculate the transfer value as at 31 December 2012 place a slightly lower value on the liability than those used at the end of 2011.
The transfer value has been calculated in accordance with the methods and assumptions underlying the calculation of cash equivalents under the Aggreko plc Pension Scheme, which are in line with the Occupational Pension Schemes Transfer Values Regulations 1996.
The accrued pension is the amount which would be paid at the anticipated retirement date based on a date of leaving the Scheme of 30 April 2011, with allowance for one statutory revaluation increase in the period to 31 December 2012.
No allowance is made for any further statutory increases from 31 December 2012.
Angus Cockburn is also entitled to a pension of 2,162 per annum payable from age 60 from the Aggreko plc Pension Scheme resulting from benefits transferred in from the scheme of a previous employer.
This benefit is not included in the above disclosure.
All Executive Directors who are members of a pension plan are provided with a lump sum death in service benefit of four times salary.
Benefits All the Executive Directors receive health-care benefits and life assurance cover.
Rupert Soames and Angus Cockburn receive the benefit of a Company-funded car and George Walker receives a car allowance.

Annual Bonus Scheme The purpose of the Annual Bonus Scheme is to align Executive Directors with performance during the year, and to motivate them to meet and beat demanding annual performance targets.
In 2012 the on-budget and maximum bonus earnings for the Executive Directors were: % of annual salary Executive Director On-budget Maximum Rupert Soames 62.5% 125.0% Angus Cockburn 50.0% 100.0% Kash Pandya 55.0% 100.0% Bill Caplan 55.0% 100.0% George Walker 67.5% 125.0% 80 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Directors Report The targets for the Annual Bonus Scheme are tied to the Annual Budgets set by the Board and have due regard to external forecasts.
Generally, bonuses will start to be earned at performance levels a few percentage points below Budget, increase sharply to Budget, and then increase until they reach capped levels, which will generally be at 10-15% above Budget.
Executive Directors with regional management responsibilities have half of their bonus related to the performance of their region as measured by trading profit and return on capital employed and half related to Diluted Earnings Per Share D-EPS.
The Chief Executives and Chief Financial Officers bonuses are measured exclusively against D-EPS.
D-EPS is calculated on a constant currency basis, using exchange rates fixed at the beginning of the year, so that the bonus reflects the true performance of the business, and not currency movements.
The Budget for bonus purposes was set at D-EPS of 106.84p: the actual outcome on the adjusted basis set out above was 102.14p, representing growth of 14.8% over the prior year, and 95.6% of Budget.
Readers are referred to our Review of Trading, where the difference between headline growth and underlying growth is set out: in 2012 the actual rate of underlying growth in Trading Profit, as defined in the Review of Trading, was 6%.

Long-term Incentive Plan The LTIP was first introduced in 2004, and each year senior executives are invited to join.
It consists of two distinct elements: the Performance Share Plan PSP and the Co-investment Plan CIP.
The PSP and CIP are both measured against performance over three financial years and they share the same performance criteria.
These are the real compound annual growth rate of Diluted Earnings per Share D-EPS, and Return on Capital Employed ROCE.
This directly aligns both elements of the LTIP with Group strategy and measures performance against what the Board believes are Key Performance Indicators.
The PSP is a nil-cost conditional award of shares which vest depending on performance against the targets: the number of shares conditionally awarded is related to the salary of the individual concerned and his or her level within the Company.
The PSP provides for annual awards of performance shares up to an aggregate limit of 100% of salary in normal circumstances and 200% of salary in exceptional circumstances.
The CIP is a Co-investment plan, whose purpose it is to encourage executives to buy and hold shares in the Company.
Participants can subscribe to purchase Aggreko shares up to a value of 30% of their salary, each year that they are invited to join the CIP: if they hold those shares for three years, or, if earlier, the date that their CIP award vests, they will be entitled to receive a minimum award of one share for every two they subscribed the Minimum Match, plus a performance-related award of a further three shares for every two they subscribed.
The Minimum Match is not subject to performance conditions.
The performance criteria for the LTIP are set annually: in 2012 they were: 75% of the award is based on CPI inflation-adjusted compound annual growth in D-EPS over the three-year performance measurement period in a range of 3% to 10%.
No performance shares will be awarded against this element if performance is less than 3% and awards will increase straight-line to the maximum at 10% growth.
25% of the award is based on average ROCE over the performance period in a range of 26% to 28%.
No performance shares will be awarded against this element if performance is less than 26% and awards will increase straight-line to the maximum at 28% ROCE.

3-year Average ROCE In addition to the above, and to reward truly exceptional performance, the number of shares awarded to participants in the both elements of the 2012 LTIP may be increased by between 1.3 and 2 times if the real compound annual growth in D-EPS over the three-year performance measurement period is in a range of 13% to 20%, as illustrated below: Super LTIP 2.0x 1.3x 1.0x 13% 20% 3-year Real D-EPS growth p. a.
2009 LTIP awards vesting The performance period for the 2009 LTIP awards ended on 31 December 2011.
Over the period: Aggrekos aggregate D-EPS was 228.2p which is the equivalent of a real compound annual growth rate of 24%.
This exceeded the upper limit of the performance range and accordingly all 75% of the award vested under this criterion.
Aggrekos actual average ROCE for the period was 29.5%, which exceeded the upper limit of the performance range and accordingly all 25% of the award vested under this criterion.
Further, as real compound annual growth in D-EPS exceeded 20%, the enhanced LTIP was triggered.
This resulted in the maximum 2 times multiple being applied to the total number of shares vesting based on the above criteria.
This combined performance resulted in 100% of 2009 LTIP awards vesting: Market price Executive Director Vested during the year Date vested Option price on date vested Value performance Share plan Rupert Soames 190,114 16 April 2012 nil 2186p 4,155,892 Angus Cockburn 79,848 16 April 2012 nil 2186p 1,745,477 Kash Pandya 77,186 16 April 2012 nil 2186p 1,687,286 Bill Caplan 71,864 16 April 2012 nil 2186p 1,570,947 George Walker 81,846 16 April 2012 nil 2186p 1,789,154 82 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 % vesting % vesting Directors Report Market price Executive Director Vested during the year Date vested Option price on date vested Value co-investment plan Rupert Soames 134,608 16 April 2012 nil 2186p 2,942,531 Angus Cockburn 80,764 16 April 2012 nil 2186p 1,765,501 Kash Pandya 78,072 16 April 2012 nil 2186p 1,706,654 Bill Caplan 60,000 16 April 2012 nil 2186p 1,311,600 George Walker 82,788 16 April 2012 nil 2186p 1,809,746 Each of the above awards was granted on 16 April 2009.
The market price of the shares on that date was 533.5p.
Therefore 76% of the value of the award to participants was derived from share price accretion during the period.
The aggregate gain made on these exercises was 20,484,787 of which 7,098,423 related to the gain of the highest paid Director.
The market price of the shares at 31 December 2012 was 1740 pence and the range during the year was 1664 pence to 2400 pence.
In 2011 the performance criteria were identical to 2012.
In 2010 they were similar, except that the range for the ROCE performance condition was 25% to 27%.
2012 LTIP awards granted In April 2012 Executive Directors were granted awards of shares under the PSP and CIP ranging from 70% to 100% of salary.
The three year performance period over which D-EPS and ROCE performance will be measured began on 1 January 2012 and will end on 31 December 2014.
None of the awards granted under the 2012 LTIP are eligible to vest until 16 April 2015 except in certain circumstances where a CIP participant ceases to be an employee of the Group, as described on page 75.
The performance conditions attached to awards are discussed on pages 81 and 82.
Sharesave Plans The Board believes that Sharesave schemes are valuable in aligning the interests of employees and shareholders, and the Company seeks to make it possible for as many employees as practicable to join the scheme or its various proxies.
In 2012, there were 2,192 employees in Aggreko subscribing to Sharesave Plans.
The Aggreko Sharesave Plans are normally offered annually to employees and Executive Directors who have at least three months continuous service, and allow a maximum of 250 per month to be saved and converted into Aggreko shares at the end of either two, three, four or five year periods, depending on local legislation.
The options under the Sharesave Option Schemes have been granted at a 20% discount on the share price calculated over the three days prior to the date of invitation to participate, mature after three years and are normally exercisable in the six months following the maturity date.
The options under the US Stock Purchase Plan have been granted at a discount of 15% on the closing share price on the date of grant, mature after two years and are normally exercisable in the three months following the maturity date.
The following table shows the interests of the Directors who served during the year in the Groups LTIP and Sharesave plans.
