The Committee recommends for approval by the Board awards to the CFO and other employees under the DFSS.
For theCFO, all share awards are subject to the above performance criterion.
For staff below Group Board level awards will be split.
50% of the award will be subject to the above performance criterion, and the other 50% will have no performance criteria attached other than the requirement that the recipient remains an employee of the Group atthedate of vesting.
Award sizes vary by organisational level.
All holders of DFSS awards receive the DFSS bonus.
Remuneration Arrangements for Founding Directors Two of the three Executive Directors Henry Engelhardt and David Stevens are founding Directors.
They and theCommittee continue to hold the view that the significant shareholdings held by them provide a sufficient alignment of their interest in the performance of the Group with the interests of other shareholders.
In light of this, their remuneration packages consist only of a below market rate salary and benefits such as private medical cover, permanent health insurance and death in service cover.
The Group does not contribute to any pension arrangements on behalf of these Executive Directors, and they have not participated, nor is it intended that they participate, in any Group share schemes.
Details of Directors Service Contracts The following table summarises the notice periods relating to the service contracts of the Executive Directors serving at March 2013.
Notice Notice Director Company months months Henry Engelhardt 12 12 Kevin Chidwick 12 12 David Stevens 12 12 There is no provision in the Executive Directors contracts for compensation to be payable on early termination of their contract over and above the notice period element.

Summary details of terms and notice periods are included below.

Termination Payments The Companys policy is to limit severance payments on termination to pre-established contractual arrangements.
Inthe event that the employment of an Executive Director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined inaccordance with the terms of the service contract between the Company and the employee, as well as the rules ofany incentive plans.
Under normal circumstances, good leavers are entitled to receive termination payments in lieu of notice based on base salary and compensation for loss of benefits.
The notice period for all Executive Directors is one year.
In the event an Executive leaves for reasons of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement, or any other reason which the Remuneration Committee in its absolute discretion permits, any outstanding long-term incentive awards will be pro-rated for time and performance and will vest after the end of the performance period.
Upon a change ofcontrol of the Company, awards will be pro-rated for time and vest immediately based on the extent to which theCommittee determines that the performance conditions have been met or are likely to be met.
Overview Performance Governance Financial statements Other information Admiral Group plc Annual Report 2012 51 For all other leavers, outstanding awards will lapse.
The Committee retains discretion to alter these provisions as permitted by the relevant Plan Rules on a case-by-case basis following a review of circumstances and to ensure fairness for both shareholders and participants.
Pay-for-Performance: Scenario Analysis The following chart shows the potential split between the different elements of the Executive Directors total remuneration under two different performance scenarios: Zero vesting, and Maximum vesting.
