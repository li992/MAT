4 J eff Carr resigned as a Director on 11 November 2011.
5 Si dney Barrie resigned as a Director on 31 March 2012.
He ceased accruing benefits on 31 March 2011 and therefore no further contributions have been paid since 1 April 2011.
His pension commences at 1 April 2012 and the increase in his pension since cessation is shown above.
The Group does not have one pension scheme but instead operates a number of different schemes.
All of the Executive Directors participate in one defined benefit scheme which is not limited in membership to Executive Directors.
Sidney Barrie, Jeff Carr and Tim OToole participated in a final salary arrangement restricted through a scheme earnings cap based on the previous HMRC definition.
To reflect the need to provide a competitive pensions package, a Group SIPP arrangement operates, in which these individuals are allowed to participate.
A pension allowance is calculated for each Director as 20% of their salary in excess of the earnings cap.
Some of this is paid to the SIPP as a Company contribution with the remainder being payable to the Director in the form of a salary supplement.
This amounted to a Group SIPP Company contribution during the financial year of nil in respect of Sidney Barrie, 5,698 in respect of Jeff Carr, and 9,222 in respect of TimOToole and a salary supplement of 69,700 in respect of Sidney Barrie, 34,254 in respect of Jeff Carr and 134,417 in respect of Tim OToole.
