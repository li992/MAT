Drax Group plc Annual report and 64 accounts 2012 Remuneration Committee report We believe that the best measures of performance are those most aligned with the interests of our shareholders.
These include both operational and strategic measures, in particular the development of a much more sustainable business.
Tim Barker Chairman of the Remuneration Committee A statement to shareholders from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee In last years report I said that the Remuneration Committee was supportive of many of the proposals that had been suggested by the Government following reviews by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills BIS of narrative reporting and executive remuneration.
This year BIS has made proposals for further regulations in relation to remuneration reporting for years ending after October 2013 and in this years report we have adopted many of those proposals.
We want to build trust in the remuneration process through transparency and accountability, and we have implemented further measures to promote greater transparency within the Group.
In particular, we have explained decisions on executive director remuneration packages to employee representatives in connection with discussions on remuneration generally.
The Committees approach is to enhance the link between both short and long-term performance and executive remuneration and also to improve the clarity of reporting.
We believe that the best measures of performance are those which are most aligned with the interests of our shareholders, both those relating to the Groups performance and also individual contribution.
We are now well advanced in a programme to transform our business from predominantly coal-fired generation to predominantly renewable biomass.
Our performance cannot be measured solely in terms of share price or earnings growth, which is why the Committee places considerable importance on performance measures which underpin our longer term strategic development.
The Committee applies this approach to performance measures in both the annual bonus arrangements and the Bonus Matching Plan BMP for executive directors and senior management.
These therefore include both operational and strategic measures to align remuneration more closely with key strategic goals specific to Drax, in particular the development of a much more sustainable business with reduced reliance on coal, a greater focus on biomass, including upstream development, and increased retail sales.
The BMP also retains a Total Shareholder Return TSR measure to ensure more direct alignment of executive reward with the returns to shareholders.
There is a further introductory point to make.
Since the Company listed in 2005, its business has been predominantly a coal-fired power generation business located at the Drax site.
In determining executive directors remuneration, the Committee has been conscious that we have been less broadly based than many other businesses of a comparable market value.
This has been particularly relevant in relation to the positioning of executive directors base salaries.
The acquisition and growth of Haven Power, the Groups retail business, has added to the breadth of the business.
As the biomass programme develops, as explained fully in the reports by the Chairman and the Chief Executive, we will become a more international and more complex business.
In order to attract and retain the senior executives who will be most involved in this strategic development it will be necessary to take these factors into account.
Accordingly, during 2013, the Committee intends to review the positioning of executive directors remuneration in the light of these changes.
Context to the Committees decisions 2012 has been a very important year in the development of the Group.
The Government has provided clarity on the regulatory framework to support power generation from renewable biomass.
We were therefore able to build on the work of previous years to deliver solid foundations for the Groups future as a major renewable power generator.
We made excellent progress with very encouraging results in our biomass research and development and we secured committed financing for our strategic capital investment from our investors and lenders.
We also made excellent progress in the strategic growth of our retail business.
It was also a year of strong operational and financial performance across the business.
The Committee is satisfied that remuneration incentives are compatible with the Groups risk policies and systems, including those relating to environmental, social and governance risks.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2012 65 Key Committee decisions in the year Each year the Committee agrees an annual work schedule.
The regular scheduled matters considered by the Committee in 2012 were: review of the performance of the Group by reference to the 2011 Balanced Corporate Scorecard Scorecard, including the application of the discretionary factor: agree the measures and weightings of the 2012 Scorecard: 2011 annual bonus awards to executive directors and senior managers by reference to the Scorecard and individual performance against personal objectives: agreeing personal objectives for executive directors and senior managers for 2012: review of base salary and overall remuneration packages for executive directors and senior managers: review of the Chairmans remuneration: granting of awards under executive and all employee share plans: consideration of vesting of awards under executive share plans: the 2011 Remuneration Report: and review of advisers and the fees paid to them.
At various stages throughout the year the Committee considered the consultation on executive remuneration by BIS, and has actively participated in the consultation.
The Committee considered the Groups own remuneration policy and practices in that context.
It concluded that the structure and level of executive remuneration in the Group continued to be appropriate.
As noted in the introduction to this report, the Committee intends to review the positioning of executive directors remuneration in the light of the development of the Groups biomass transformation.
The Committee has sought to develop its reporting in line with developing best practice.
The Committee also considered the provision of pension benefits in the Group as a whole.
It agreed that additional steps should be taken to make employees aware of the likely level of retirement benefits and encourage additional contributions.
This may require additional contributions by the Group dependent upon the terms applicable to the relevant schemes.
Policy report Introduction This report covers the reporting period from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012 and provides details of the remuneration policy for the Group.
This report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee based on the regulations proposed by BIS.
The regulations will apply to all UK companies listed on a major stock exchange with financial years ending on or after October 2013.
Remuneration policy During the year, the Committee reviewed its terms of reference to ensure that they remain sufficiently flexible and appropriate to meet the different requirements necessary to attract, reward and retain senior managers in all Group companies.
The objectives of the remuneration policy are: to enable the Group to recruit, retain and motivate the people needed to achieve its business objectives: to strengthen teamwork by enabling all employees to share in the success of the business: to ensure alignment of executive and shareholder interests: and to develop an approach which emphasises total reward.
Financials Governance Corporate and social responsibility Marketplace, performance and risk Overview Drax Group plc Annual report and 66 accounts 2012 Remuneration Committee report The core principles of the remuneration policy are to: pay market rates of total remuneration: adopt different pay and benefit structures for different operating entities in the Group as appropriate for each entitys markets, workforce and location: ensure that there is an appropriate link between performance and reward: award annual bonuses which are linked to the delivery of the annual Business Plan targets including the achievement of strategic objectives and personal performance: and ensure that long-term incentives are linked to TSR and to the delivery of Business Plan targets including the achievement of strategic objectives.
The role of the Committee The principles set out above are put into effect through the Committees principal duties, which are to: determine and recommend for approval by the Board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of the Companys Chairman, Chief Executive and other executive directors and the senior managers: approve the design of, and determine targets for, any performance related pay schemes operated by the Group in respect of executive directors and senior managers and approve the total annual payments made under such schemes: review the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and shareholders.
For any such plans, determine each year whether awards will be made, and if so, the overall amount of such awards, the individual awards to executive directors and senior managers and the performance targets to be used: determine the pension arrangements for executive directors and senior managers: ensure that contractual terms on termination of the employment of any executive directors or senior manager, and any payments made, are fair to the individual, and the Group, that failure is not rewarded and that the duty to mitigate loss is fully recognised: within the terms of the agreed policy determine the individual total remuneration packages of the executive directors and senior managers including bonuses, incentive payments and share options or other share awards: review and note annually the remuneration trends across the Group: and oversee any major changes in employee benefits structures throughout the Group.
Throughout 2012, the Remuneration Committee comprised Tim Barker, Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the Committee, Charles Berry, Chairman of the Company, Tim Cobbold, David Lindsell and Tony Thorne, all of whom are independent non-executive directors.
The Company Secretary acted as Secretary to the Committee.
The Chief Executive is invited to attend meetings of the Committee except when her own remuneration is being discussed.
The Committee met on three occasions during the year and its members attendance record is set out on page 53.

3 The award of conditional shares under the BMP is based on the individuals prior year annual bonus and therefore it is assumed that corresponding threshold, target and maximum bonus is earned for calculating threshold, target and maximum BMP award under each scenario.
Service contracts Executive directors service agreements are of indefinite duration, terminable at any time by either party giving 12 months prior notice except that the contracts of Peter Emery and Paul Taylor are terminable by them providing six months notice to the Company.
Under each of the executive directors service agreements other than the Chief Executives, Drax has the right to make a payment in lieu of notice of termination, the amount of that payment being the salary and benefits that would have accrued to the executive director during the contractual notice period.
The following table shows for each person who was a director of the Company at 18 February 2013 or who served as a director of the Company at any time during the year ended 31 December 2012, the commencement date and term of the service agreement or contract for services, and details of the notice periods.

The policy is that an executive director who accepts an external appointment having had the prior approval of the Board should retain the fees payable in respect of the appointment.
Dorothy Thompson is a non-executive director of Johnson Matthey plc and received 53,750 in fees for that appointment during 2012.
Tony Quinlan is a non-executive member of the Port of London Authority board and received 22,344 in fees for that appointment during 2012.
Peter Emery is a non-executive director of NG Bailey Limited and received 12,000 in fees for that appointment during 2012.
Non-executive directors The Chairman and non-executive directors receive fees in respect of their services.
They do not receive any pension or benefits in kind, nor are they eligible for any annual performance bonus or any of the share-based reward plans.
The Chairmans notice period is six months whilst the other non-executive directors have a notice period of one month.
The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Committee whilst that of the other non-executive directors is determined by the Chairman and the executive directors.
These are determined in the light of: fees the chairmen and non-executive directors of other listed companies selected on the same basis as for executive directors: the responsibilities and time commitment: and the need to attract and retain individuals with the necessary skills and experience.
Chairman The Chairmans fees are 220,000 per annum.
Other non-executive directors The fees for non-executive directors are: Basic fee 52,500 per annum Senior Independent Director to include chair of a committee other than the Audit Committee 10,000 per annum Audit Committee Chairmanship 10,000 per annum Termination payment No service agreement includes any operative provision for the payment of compensation upon early termination.
Any compensation payable in those circumstances would need to be negotiated at the time and in the light of the circumstances.
Share plans All employee share plans The Committee operates a Savings-Related Share Option Plan SAYE and a Share Incentive Plan SIP, both of which are approved by HM Revenue & Customs and must be operated on an all employee basis.
The executive directors may participate in each plan upon the same terms as other employees.
The plans are the main vehicles for aligning staff remuneration with TSR performance.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2012 71 SAYE The SAYE plan provides for the grant of options which, at the Committees discretion, may be offered at a discount of up to 20% to the market price of a share determined in accordance with the rules of the plan linked to a savings contract which pays interest at a statutory rate.
The plan was operated in 2006 and again in 2010, 2011 and 2012, so that subject to the statutory upper aggregate limit of 250 per month on an individuals savings under all SAYE plans a participating employee could choose to save for either or both periods of three or five years.
In each year of operation, options have been granted at the permitted discount of 20% to the prevailing share price determined in accordance with the plan rules resulting in option prices of: 2006 636.00 pence per share 2010 310.50 pence per share 2011 321.00 pence per share 2012 410.00 pence per share Options may be exercised upon successful completion of the three or five year savings contract to which they are linked.
Details of the SAYE options held by the executive directors are shown in the table in the Audited Information section of this report.
On 12 February 2013, the Committee agreed that invitations to the SAYE be made again in 2013, following the preliminary results announcement.
The 20% discount to the market price is applied and participants will be able to take out SAYE contracts over three and five years and contribute in total no more than 250 per month.
SIP In any one tax year, the Committee may operate the SIP for the benefit of participants using any combination of the following elements: award Free Shares up to 3,000 in value : allow the purchase of Partnership Shares up to 1,500 in value subject to an overriding maximum of 10% of salary : allocate free Matching Shares in a maximum ratio of two Matching Shares for each Partnership Share : and allow the investment in shares of dividends received in respect of SIP shares.
The table below details how the SIP has been operated between 2006 and 2009: 2006 2007 2008 2009 1 SIP Free Share Award Participants received Participants received 2,500 worth of shares Participants received 2,000 worth of shares in each year.
Partnership Share Award Participants were allowed to invest up to the maximum permitted of 1,500 subject to an overriding maximum of 10% of salary in each year.
1 Matching Share Award Partnership Shares matched on a one-for-one basis in each year.
Note: 1 The SIP Trustee was funded by the Group to purchase the required Free and Matching Shares.
In accordance with the plan rules, shares taken up by an employee are allocated to a trustee which holds them on behalf of the employee.
Under normal circumstances, the employee will receive the shares from the trustee without incurring a tax liability once the shares have been held in trust for five years.
The employee is entitled to receive dividends paid in respect of the shares held in trust.
Details of the shares allocated to executive directors under the SIP are shown in the table in the Audited Information section of this report.
The SIP has not operated since 2009.
Financials Governance Corporate and social responsibility Marketplace, performance and risk Overview Drax Group plc Annual report and 72 accounts 2012 Remuneration Committee report Provision of shares for share plans dilution All equity-based plans are funded through the issuance of shares, or through the purchase of shares in the marketplace through a trust, subject to an overall dilution limit for all employee share plans of no more than 10% of share capital in any ten year period and a limit of 5% of share capital in any ten year period for the Groups discretionary share plans e. g. Bonus Matching Plan.
The current estimated dilution from subsisting awards, including executive and all employee share awards, is less than 0.5% of the shares in issue at the date of this report.
Share ownership guidelines The Group has share ownership guidelines for senior executives participating in its performance share plans.
They are 100% and 50% of base salary for executive directors and other senior management BMP participants, respectively.
Those who receive shares by virtue of share plan awards or who receive deferred bonus shares must retain 50% of the net that is, after income tax and national insurance contributions shares received until the applicable guideline is reached.
Other matters Wider employee population In determining executive remuneration, the Committee also takes into account the level of general pay increases within the Group.
The pay increase in 2012 for staff covered by collective bargaining arrangements was determined by a 33 months agreement with increases on 1 January 2011 and 2012 at RPI plus 0.3%.
The increase was subject to a cap of 4.9%, which was therefore the level of the general pay increase on 1 January 2012.
The agreement continued until 31 December 2012.
Following joint negotiations, a two-year pay offer has been made to all employees within the collective bargaining unit.
The pay offer, which covers the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2014, is based on another RPI plus formula.
The average pensionable pay of an executive director is eight and a half times the average of pensionable pay for employees within the collective bargaining unit.
Views taken from the employee population In the course of discussions on pay with employee representatives, the Group discussed executive remuneration policy and provided details of the process by which the Committee established executive remuneration packages.
The information provided included details of the benchmarking of executive director remuneration as well as information benchmarking the packages of employees in the collective bargaining unit with those elsewhere in the industry.
Shareholder engagement The Company holds regular meetings with its largest shareholders, and the Committee takes into account any views or representations of shareholders relating to executive remuneration.
During 2012 shareholders did not raise any matters of concern with the Company with regard to executive remuneration.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2012 73 Implementation report Pay for performance at Drax Group The Remuneration Committee believes that the current executive remuneration policy and the supporting reward structure provide clear alignment with the performance of Drax Group.
To maintain this relationship, the Remuneration Committee periodically reviews the business priorities and the environment in which the Group operates.
Value of 100 invested The following graph shows how the value of 100 invested in the Company on 31 December 2007 has changed and compares that performance with the changing value of the same amount invested at the same time in the FTSE100 and FTSE250 indices.
These indices have been chosen as suitable broad comparators against which the Companys shareholders may judge their relative returns given that, in recent years, the Company has been a member of both the FTSE100 and FTSE250 indices.
The graph reflects the TSR determined according to usual market practice for the Company and each of the indices referred to on a cumulative basis over the period from 31 December 2007 to 31 December 2012.

Details of performance against metrics for variable pay awards Annual bonus plan outcome A summary of the Committees assessment in respect of the 2012 Scorecard is set out in the following table: Strategic Area Elements Target Weighting Actual Weighting 1 Financial performance Group underlying earnings per share 20% 37.7% 2 Cash flow and controllable costs 10% 13.6% Safety, production Safety and plant operation performance 15% 20.4% and retail Retail sales volume 5% 7.0% Strategic and other Regulatory securing appropriate support and sustainability 5% 6.3% Business Plan objectives requirements for biomass combustion Development of biomass conversion 20% 30.0% Biomass procurement targets 10% 14.0% Industrial Emissions Directive compliance plan development 5% 5.0% Other strategic development initiatives 10% 8.8% Notes: 1 Calculated using underlying earnings, being profit attributable to equity shareholders adjusted to exclude the after tax impact of unrealised gains and losses on derivative contracts, and exceptional items see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
2 Cash flow for the year excluding the impact of short-term investments, prior to payment of equity dividends.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2012 75 Following this process, and based on the relative weightings and scores as set out in the table, the Committee assessed the corporate score for 2012 at 1.43.
The Committee considered that there were certain elements of the Scorecard where above target performance was attributable to factors outside the control of management.
In particular, the underlying earnings per share score was positively affected by lower tax and financing costs than anticipated.
This was the result of reductions in the corporation tax rate and delayed refinancing reflecting the Governments delay in announcing its decision on the review of support levels for renewable energy.
There were, however, other factors where the Committee felt that the Scorecard result did not adequately represent management performance.
These were mainly in relation to achievement of regulatory and strategic objectives which provide the platform for the development of the biomass transformation.
On balance, the Committee felt that the numerical calculation of the Scorecard reflected a fair assessment of performance, and therefore decided not to exercise its discretion to adjust the overall score.
The Board determines personal performance objectives for each executive director.
The Committee assesses performance against these objectives and applies an individual performance multiplier of between zero and 1.5.
To determine the actual bonus awarded to each executive director, the target bonus is multiplied by the corporate score and by the personal score, subject to a cap of twice the target bonus.
For bonus awards for 2012, the target bonus for the Chief Executive and the other executive directors was 65% and 60% of base salary respectively.
Their maximum bonus was 130% and 120% respectively.
75% of any bonus award is paid in cash and 25% is deferred in shares that vest after three years and are forfeited if the executive leaves the Group other than as a good leaver before the shares vest.

Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2012 77 Bonus Matching Plan outcome Conditional share awards under the Bonus Matching Plan The Group operates the BMP as a long-term performance share plan.
Awards under the BMP have been made in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.
Executive directors and other senior executives receive an annual grant of conditional shares to a value of up to 1.5 times the amount of the executives annual bonus for the prior year.
No payment is made for the shares.
However, vesting is subject to service and performance conditions.
In respect of existing awards, one-third of awards granted to those members of senior management who are not members of the Executive Committee will vest on the third anniversary of grant provided that the participant is still employed by the Group.
Awards granted to members of the Executive Committee and the balance i. e. two-thirds of the awards granted to other members of senior management will vest on the third anniversary of grant provided the participant is still employed by the Group and subject to achievement of performance conditions determined by the Committee and described below.
