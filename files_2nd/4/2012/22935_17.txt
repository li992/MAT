Directors remuneration report t The 2012 bonus overall outcome is that the Group bonus payout is marginally below On-target in aggregate.
We have made good progress on our transformation plan, and the Board is encouraged by the progress towards the targets disclosed in September 2012.
However, the level of bonus set in aggregate by the Committee takes into account a wider set of criteria than just these, including general affordability and market practice.
We believe that the planned payout is appropriate taking into account these wider criteria.
We intend to continue to set stretching but achievable targets for future bonus awards across a range of criteria.

Termination policy summary It is appropriate for the Committee to retain discretion to consider the termination terms of any Executive Director, having regard to all the relevant facts and circumstances available to them at the time.
The table below sets out the general position although it should be noted that the Committee, consistent with most other companies, has reserved a broad discretion to determine whether an Executive Director should be categorised as a good leaver and that discretion forms part of the approved policy.
Similarly, while the policy is generally to reduce awards on a pro-rata basis, the Committee has reserved discretion to disapply such reduction if, in the circumstances, it considers that to be appropriate.
If a leaver is deemed to be a good leaver, for example leaving If a leaver is deemed to be through redundancy, ill health or a bad leaver, for example leaving death or otherwise at the discretion Other events, for example Incentives through resignation or dismissal of the Committee change in control Annual Incentive Plan No awards made Pro-rata bonus Pro-rata bonus Deferred Annual All awards will lapse Will receive all deferred shares at Will usually receive all Incentive Plan the end of the vesting period deferred shares the DAIP Long-Term Incentive Plan All awards will lapse Will receive a pro-rata award Will receive a pro-rata award subject to the application of the subject to the application of the performance conditions at the performance conditions end of the vesting period For as long as RBS Group owns more than 50% of the Ordinary Shares in the Company, Paul Geddess and John Reizensteins service agreements will continue to have the RBS Group policy provision regarding termination without notice or payment in lieu when personal underperformance is not remedied following a warning from the Board and after reasonable opportunity to remedy it has been given.
The Direct Line Group Directors service agreement provides that Paul Geddes and John Reizenstein are not eligible to receive any enhanced redundancy terms which may be offered by Direct Line Group from time to time.
Their rights to a statutory redundancy payment are not affected.
Non-Executive Directors Non-Executive Directors are appointed for a three-year term which may be renewed by mutual agreement.
In common with the Executive Directors, all Non-Executives are subject to annual re-election by shareholders.
The term of either Bruce Van Saun or Mark Catton as Directors will cease when RBS Group divests its controlling interest in Direct Line Group.
Both will step down as Directors when RBS Group owns less than 20% of Direct Line Group: one will step down once the shareholding drops below 50% and the other when the shareholding drops below 20%.
The Directors may appoint additional members to join the Board during the year.
Directors appointed in this way will be subject to election by shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment.
In subsequent years the Directors are expected to submit themselves for re-election at the AGM.

The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors have notice periods of three months from either party.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to any compensation on exit.
External directorships The Group encourages Executive Directors to accept, subject to the approval of the Chairman, an invitation to join the board of another company outside the Group in a non-executive capacity, recognising the value of such wider experience.
In these circumstances, they are permitted to retain any remuneration from the non-executive appointment.
Executive Directors are limited to accepting one external appointment.
Currently the Executive Directors do not hold any external appointments.

Annual Incentive Plan For the 2012 AIP, the Committee determined the level of award for Paul Geddes, taking into account the views of RBS Group on his performance.
The award for John Reizenstein was agreed by the Committee, making an assessment against the targets set by RBS Group at the beginning of 2012.
Overall, the Committee felt the bonus outcome was marginally below On-target.
The Committee acknowledged that the commitments set out at IPO have been met, and that the share price has increased signicantly since listing.
However, taking into account wider factors and internal stretch targets, overall performance was slightly below On-target.
For all other employees, their performance was assessed against the targets set at the beginning of 2012, and senior employees were specically considered by the Committee.
Resulting from the performance described above, the annual incentive awards payable to the Executive Directors in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2012 are: Maximum annual Actual annual incentive Actual annual incentive award 1 incentive award award for 2012 for 2012 Director Position % of base salary % of base salary 000 Paul Geddes Chief Executive officer 175% 100% 760 John Reizenstein Chief Financial officer 150% 75% 345 Note: 1.
Paul Geddess bonus outcome for 2012 will be deferred on terms comparable to those applying to all members of the RBS Group Executive Committee, due to his having been a member of the RBS Group Executive Committee for nine months of the year, with the exception that any deferral is into the Companys shares.
John Reizensteins bonus will be paid 60% in cash and 40% in deferred shares under the DAIP as per the plan for all other senior employees.
Deferred Annual Incentive Plan The table below shows details of the deferred awards granted to Paul Geddes and John Reizenstein for the 2012 financial year.

These comprise a balanced scorecard of measures, which reects both financial and strategically important non-financial measures including a customer-based assessment, with the majority being financial measures.
The final 25% is linked to clear personal objectives.
Personal objectives are set in line with the Groups values and will be measured based on achievement of objectives and demonstration of these values.

The first awards were made on 7 November 2012, following IPO.
These awards were treated by the Committee as an ordinary award, consistent with awards that will usually be made in the second half of the Companys financial year.
The value of these awards was, therefore, equal to 50% of the normal annual policy level, that is, the awards granted to Paul Geddes and John Reizenstein were over Ordinary Shares with a face value of 100% of their salary.
Awards were also granted to SLT members for lower amounts than those applicable to the Executive Directors.
Details of RBS Group long-term incentive awards previously made to the Executive Directors under RBS Group plans prior to the IPO are disclosed on page 89.
Performance conditions for awards made in 2012 The initial awards granted on 7 November are subject to the achievement of the following performance conditions: t 60% is based on RoTE over a two-year performance period 2013 and 2014 : and t 40% is based on relative TSR performance against the constituents of the FTSE 350 excluding investment trusts over a three-year performance period starting on 16 October 2012.
The starting TSR is measured over the period of one month following 16 October 2012 and closing TSR will be measured over the last three months of the three-year period.
For these purposes, the Companys standard denition for RoTE is used, subject to such other adjustments as the Committee considers appropriate.
The performance targets are as follows: Performance measure Threshold vesting Maximum vesting RoTE 20% of portion of award vests for average annual Full vesting for average annual RoTE RoTE performance of 14% performance of 17% Relative TSR 20% of portion of award vests for median performance Full vesting for upper quintile performance Vesting on the RoTE scale is weighted, with 40% vesting for RoTE of 15%.
Otherwise, there is straight line interpolation by ranking between these points.
In addition, the LTIP awards will only vest to the extent that the Committee is satisfied that the outcome of the TSR and RoTE performance conditions reects the underlying financial performance of the Group over the period from the awards date until vesting.
In making these considerations, the Committee will take into account whether there have been any material risk failings.
Free share awards Following the IPO in October, an offer of 143 shares worth approximately 250 at the time of offer was made to all employees in the Group under the all-employee, HMRC-approved, Share Incentive Plan SIP.
The SIP is not subject to performance conditions and the shares vest after three years.
Both Executive Directors accepted this offer.

Dilution Direct Line Group is not permitted to make awards over unissued shares while remaining a major subsidiary undertaking of RBS Group.
In due course, unissued shares may be used and the Direct Line Group will ensure that it complies with both of the dilution levels recommended by the ABI guidelines of 10% in 10 years for all share plans and 5% in 10 years for discretionary plans consistent with the rules of the Direct Line Groups share plans.
To date, legacy RBS Group awards to be satisfied in Direct Line Group shares will be satisfied by RBS Group rather than the Direct Line Group and RBS Group have placed shares in trust to facilitate this.

It was agreed with RBS Group that participants now employed by Direct Line Group holding awards granted in 2011 and 2012 under the RBS Group LTIP would be given the opportunity to have those awards satisfied by the transfer of Direct Line Insurance Group plc shares from RBS Group on vesting.
The conversion rate applied to these awards was the average price of RBS Group shares over the five business day period prior to 11 October 2012 divided by the Direct Line Insurance Group plc share offer price 1.75.
This conversion equated to 1.487 Direct Line Insurance Group plc shares for every RBS Group share under grant.
Both Executive Directors took up this offer.
These are subject to performance conditions to be assessed by the RBS Group Remuneration Committee.
The conditions relate to financial and operational performance against the strategic plan for Direct Line Group and effective risk management with, in the case of Paul Geddes only, 25% of vesting also dependent upon RBS Group performance.
The 2012 awards also applied measures based on employee and customer satisfaction.
