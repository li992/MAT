Directors Report: Corporate Governance Remuneration Report Remuneration Committee Chairmans Introduction This is my first report to shareholders following my appointment as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee at the 2012 AGM.
I would like to thank Mike Dearden, my predecessor, who retired from the Board at that time, for his support to me in my new role.
This report covers the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2012 and sets out the changes that we have implemented in respect of 2013.
Since my appointment I have spent time with management understanding the purpose and detail of each element of our remuneration strategy.
I have also met with a number of our major shareholders and their representative bodies to get their views on remuneration structures in the changing environment.
I would like to thank them for sharing their views at these introductory meetings.
At the beginning of 2012, the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills BIS announced a series of executive remuneration reforms for consultation.
The principal drivers are pay for performance, not failure, improved transparency in particular the link between remuneration and Group strategy and an increased ability for shareholders to hold companies to account in respect of executive pay.
Weir supports, in principle, what the proposed reforms are trying to achieve and has contributed to the consultation process during the course of 2012.
As debate continued around the reforms, the Association of British Insurers ABI and Research, Recommendations and Electronic Voting RREV, together with a small number of major institutions, updated or issued their own principles of remuneration, with a common theme of simplication.
Weir again supports this objective, provided this is not inconsistent with the promotion of value creation and rewarding success fairly.
We look forward to continuing to engage with our shareholders, their representative bodies and BIS during the course of 2013, as we review our existing arrangements and prepare to implement the new rules in 2014.
In delivering a record financial performance in 2012, the Group has dealt well with difficult conditions in its principal markets.
As set out in the Chief Executives Strategic Review, the beginning of the year saw a major and unexpected downturn in the upstream pressure-pumping markets and, in the second half, a slowdown in demand for iron ore and coal, with some associated project deferrals.
These were in addition to the continuing challenging global economic environment, all of which continued into 2013.
The management team identied the slowdown in upstream pressure-pumping markets early and reacted by rapidly introducing efficiency measures and realigning capacity to the strongest growth opportunities.
In mining markets, the strategy to embrace diverse commodity exposure, high product quality and superior aftermarket capability of the Minerals Division, underpinned a good performance.
66 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 I II III IV At the same time as taking early action to deal with market challenges, the management team has continued to focus on driving the Groups long term value.
Investment in technological innovation, supply chain capability and talent development across the Group have been features of 2012, as Weir continues to enhance its sources of competitive advantage.
It was against this background that the Remuneration Committee reviewed the overall structure of our executive remuneration, including the balance between xed and variable pay, the pay policy of the Group as a whole and cost to shareholders.
Specic items considered included the salaries of the Chief Executive and the Finance Director, some minor amendments to the annual bonus scheme in 2013 and the 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP awards.
The Committee believes that our overall remuneration policies and practices support our business strategy, including promoting the long term success of the business and our talent strategy.
Further details of, and commentary on, the salary increases for the Chief Executive and the Finance Director, amendments to the bonus scheme and the LTIP, and fees for Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman are set out later in this Report.
The key elements are briey summarised below: base salary increase for the Chief Executive from 700,000 to 725,000, an increase of 3.6 per cent and in line with the commitment made in 2010: base salary increase for the Finance Director from 420,000 to 440,000, an increase of 4.8 per cent: review of the bonus scheme with the introduction for Executive Directors of 20 per cent of total bonus potential to be contingent on meeting personal objectives, 80 per cent previously 100 per cent to remain contingent on the achievement of normalised profit Before Tax and Amortisation PBTA : changes to the earnings per share EPS range for the LTIP to reect the current environment that represent challenging and motivational targets for executives: base fees increase for the Non-Executive Directors from 50,000 to 55,000: and fees increase for the Chairman from 250,000 to 275,000.
The Committee believes that the salary increases, which for the Chief Executive is in line with previous guidance, are justied by superior personal performance and that the amendments to the bonus scheme will further increase the alignment of remuneration with strategy.
The Committee is confident that the targets for both the 2013 bonus scheme and LTIP are appropriately challenging.
During the course of this year, the Remuneration Committee will continue to review the Groups overall remuneration structure and engage with shareholders and their representative bodies as we formulate our remuneration policies for consideration at the AGM in 2014.
Melanie Gee Chairman of the Remuneration Committee The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 67 Directors Report: Corporate Governance Remuneration Report Continued Membership and activities of the Remuneration Committee Melanie Gee became Chairman of the Committee on 9 May 2012 taking over from Michael Dearden.
The other members of the Committee are Lord Robertson and Richard Menell.
During 2012, Keith Ruddock took on the role of Secretary for the Committee from Alan Mitchelson following his retirement during the year.

Advisors to the Remuneration Committee The Committee undertook a selection process to appoint new advisors during 2011 and appointed PwC with effect from December 2011.
PwC demonstrated a good track record in working with FTSE 100 companies, in shareholder engagement and advising on the wider regulatory environment.
In the course of 2012, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the quality of the advice and was comfortable that PwC should continue to provide independent external advice to the Committee in relation to the Groups executive remuneration policy and its implementation.
The Committee recognises the need to obtain independent advice and given that PwC provides additional services to the Group, the Remuneration Chairman has discussed this with PwC and management.
The Committee is confident that any potential conicts are managed appropriately by the Company and PwC.
For information, the additional services provided by PwC include advice on pension schemes, taxation, company secretariat services and global mobility services.
PwC also provided internal audit services, due diligence and corporate finance advice in relation to acquisitions and advice in relation to the Groups carbon emissions and sustainability strategy.

68 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 I II Remuneration policy for Group executives III The Groups overarching remuneration policy is designed to ensure that remuneration supports the Groups strategy and business objectives.
The policy has been developed to support the creation of value for shareholders, drive appropriate behaviours and incentivise outperformance while being clearly linked to individual and corporate performance.
The Remuneration Committee is mindful of a broad range of stakeholders in setting this policy and considers best practice guidelines from shareholders and their representative bodies.
The Committee has adopted IV a set of principles which are used as the basis upon which the remuneration arrangements are reviewed each year.
The Groups remuneration principles are that reward should enable the Group to: attract, motivate and retain senior executives with the necessary abilities to manage and develop the Groups activities successfully for the benefit of shareholders: clearly align remuneration outcomes with the long term interests of the Group and its shareholders: drive appropriate behaviours that are in line with the culture of the Group and focus executives on the critical business objectives by rewarding them against challenging performance criteria: and provide a significant part of potential reward through performance based incentive plans for all senior executives.
During the course of 2013, the Remuneration Committee will review proposals for the Groups overall remuneration structure and its application in 2014 and beyond.
The Committee will engage with shareholders and their representative bodies as the Company develops an enduring remuneration policy that will operate effectively through the business cycle.
To ensure the interests of management remain aligned with those of shareholders, Executive Directors are expected to build up a shareholding in the Company of 100% of base salary over a five year period.
This may be achieved by purchasing shares or retaining a proportion of share awards that vest.
An element of the annual bonus must be deferred into shares.
Further details of each element of the reward framework for Executive and Non-Executive Directors are set out on the following pages.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 69 Directors Report: Corporate Governance Remuneration Report Continued Elements of remuneration for Executive Directors in 2012 The following table sets out how each element of the Executive Directors reward package operated in 2012 and changes for 2013.

Remuneration scenarios A key element of the Groups remuneration policy is to provide a significant part of potential reward through performance based incentive plans.
Set out below is the reward mix for both Executive Directors at target performance and maximum performance.
The package is broadly structured so that for maximum performance at least 75% of the overall package is delivered through variable pay.
As such the aggregate level of remuneration received by each of the Executive Directors demonstrates a clear relationship between delivery of performance and total remuneration.

Target performance is based on an assessment of the proportion of maximum award that would be paid should budgeted performance levels be met.
Material factors taken into account when setting the remuneration policy The Committee is mindful of a broad range of stakeholders in the business and is keen to engage where appropriate on key areas of policy setting and implementation.
The Committee has considered the following in developing the changes for 2013: Annual General Meeting feedback The Committee has considered the feedback provided by shareholders, the ABI and RREV from the 2012 AGM.
Any review of the Groups remuneration strategy would take into regard such comments.
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills The Committee has taken into consideration the proposed changes outlined in the BIS revised remuneration reporting regulations.
The wider employee context In determining the adjustments to the Executive Directors and Group Executive salaries, the Committee has considered the increases to pay levels across the broader employee population, which in the UK are up to 4.5%, although they can be above this gure for exceptional candidates.
Shareholder engagement The Committee has written to our major shareholders and their representative bodies informing them of the changes to the Executive Directors base salaries as well as other changes to be implemented in 2013.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 71 Directors Report: Corporate Governance Remuneration Report Continued Service contracts Chairman and Non-Executive Directors The Chairman and each of the Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment.
The letters of appointment do not contain any contractual entitlement to a termination payment and the Non-Executive Directors can be removed in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association.
Directors are required to retire at each Annual General Meeting and seek re-election by shareholders.
The details of the service contracts, including notice periods, contained in the letters of appointment in relation to the Non-Executive Directors who served during the 2012 financial year are set out in the table below.

Executive Directors service contracts All the Executive Directors who served during the year have service contracts with the Company.
The respective notice periods contained within these are detailed below.
In the event that the Company terminates an Executive Directors service contract other than in accordance with its terms, the Committee, when determining what compensation, if any, should properly be paid by the Group to the departing Executive Director, will give full consideration to the obligation of that Executive Director to mitigate any loss which they may suffer as a result of the termination of their contract.
The details of the service contracts in relation to the Executive Directors who served during the year are set out in the table below.
Executive Director Contract commencement date Unexpired term Notice period by the individual Notice period by the Company Keith Cochrane 2 November 2009 12 months 12 months 12 months Alan Mitchelson 12 December 2001 Jon Stanton 19 April 2010 12 months 6 months 12 months Alan Mitchelson resigned from the Board at the AGM in May 2012.
To recruit the best executives, the Committee may in the future agree contractual notice periods which initially exceed 12 months, particularly if it is necessary to attract executives who will be required to relocate their families.
Executive Directors external appointments The Executive Directors are permitted, with Board agreement, to take up one non-executive appointment provided there is no conict of interest and that the time spent would not impinge on their work for the Group.
It is the Groups policy that remuneration earned from such appointments may be kept by the individual Executive Director.
No Executive Director received remuneration for external appointments during 2012.
Executive Directors salaries for 2013 In the 2010 Remuneration Report, the Committee outlined its intention to increase the Chief Executives salary to a target level of 725,000 over a three year period, which received shareholder support.
This was subject to individual and company performance, including the Groups financial success and the maintenance of its ranking in the FTSE 100.
The Committee is satisfied that the required conditions have been achieved in 2012 and has approved the final increase to take his salary to 725,000 from April 2013.
The Committee has also decided that an adjustment be made to the Finance Directors salary from 420,000 to 440,000, an increase of 4.8%.
The Committee took account of the Finance Directors individual performance as well as that of the Group, and guidelines for pay increases for UK employees which are up to 4.5% for 2013, although can be above this gure for exceptional candidates.

Fees for the Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Board, excluding the Non-Executive Directors.
The Non-Executive Directors fees and Chairmans fees are reviewed annually and changes were last made in 2011.
In determining fee levels for 2013, the following was taken into account: time commitment, the scale of role, general market practice and comparison with companies of an equivalent size based on information provided by PwC.
As a result of this IV review in 2012, it has been determined that the following will apply from April 2013: Chairmans fee is 275,000 per annum 2012: 250,000.
Non-Executive Directors base fee is 55,000 per annum 2012: 50,000.
Additional fees of 10,000 per annum 2012: 10,000 are paid to the Audit Committee Chairman and the Remuneration Committee Chairman.

The same is true for the Chairman except for an entitlement to participate in the Group healthcare scheme.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors are not involved in any discussions or decisions about their own remuneration.
Remuneration outcomes for Executive Directors The Weir Group has outperformed both the FTSE 100 and its comparator group used for the LTIP on a total shareholder return basis over a five year period.

74 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 I II Variable pay awarded in the year III Annual bonus outcome The Group operates an annual bonus plan for Executive Directors as set out in the section of this Report on remuneration policy for Group executives.
Annual bonus awards for 2012 were based entirely on normalised PBTA targets.
In 2012, the Group delivered above threshold performance resulting in bonus payouts of 54% of the maximum bonus available for the Executive Directors.
IV The chart below illustrates the percentage of salary that is attainable for each of the Executive Directors at maximum performance.
In addition, the 2012 outcome of the annual bonus plan is also illustrated for each Executive Director demonstrating the proportion of compulsory deferred bonus.
Annual bonus outcome 2012 Percentage of base salary 150 Maximum annual bonus opportunity 2012 actual bonus achieved 125 Compulsory deferral 100 75 50 25 Chief Finance Executive Director In line with the Groups remuneration policy, Executive Directors were required to defer 30% of their bonus under the LTIP, in exchange for which they are awarded investment shares.
In addition to the compulsory deferral, the Chief Executive and Finance Director may voluntarily defer an additional 25% and 20% respectively of the remaining net bonus received to be converted into shares.
The deferral will result in a matching award of shares of up to 200% the pre-tax value of the original deferral, subject to the performance conditions described on page 77.
Compulsory investment and matching shares are entitled to dividend equivalents between award and vesting, paid in additional shares at the end of the performance period.
Annual bonus changes for 2013 The Committee has reviewed the overall structure and operation of the annual bonus plan during the year with consideration of market practice and alignment with the Groups business and remuneration strategies.
It believes that the primary focus should remain on profitability.
However, the Committee has approved the introduction of a personal element of bonus which will provide focus on critical business goals.
Major shareholders, the ABI and RREV were informed about the proposed changes which will come into effect from 2013.
Introduction of a set of individual performance measures designed to create stronger line of sight between individual efforts and annual bonus outcomes.
This will represent 20% of the maximum annual bonus potential.
For 2013, half of this 20% will be based on working capital targets.
A corresponding reduction in the weighting of the normalised PBTA element to 80% of the maximum annual bonus potential.
The Committee has reviewed the targets and payout structure under both elements of the bonus and is satisfied that the bonus for 2013 is sufciently challenging, with stretching performance required for maximum payout.
The deferral elements and matching elements of the bonus under the LTIP are unchanged.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 75 Directors Report: Corporate Governance Remuneration Report Continued LTIP outcome In 2012, performance conditions for the 2009 LTIP awards were tested to determine the level of vesting achieved.
The 2009 awards vested in full, along with the deferred elements of the 2008 annual bonus.
This was based on the Group ranking first in the TSR comparator group and EPS outperforming the UK Retail Prices Index over the performance period.
Relative TSR outcome for 2009 Long Term Share Incentive Plan TSR % 490 390 290 190 90 -10 TSR comparator group ranking For the 2010 LTIP award, which is due to vest in 2013, based on the performance period of three years ending 31 December 2012, Weir ranked second in the TSR comparator group which will result in maximum payout under this element of the LTIP.
For the EPS measure, growth was 32.79%, which is greater than the target of 11% per annum for full vesting, and therefore 100% of this part of the award will also vest.
Relative TSR outcome for 2010 Long Term Share Incentive Plan TSR % 450 350 250 150 50 -50 TSR comparator group ranking TSR is based on performance over three consecutive financial years, beginning with the year in which the award is made.
Between upper quintile and median performance, awards vest on a straight-line basis.
The TSR calculation is performed by PwC for the Committee.
The EPS growth measure is adjusted to exclude intangibles, amortisation and exceptional items.
During the course of the performance period, the Committee may, in its absolute discretion, vary, add, remove or alter the companies making up the comparator group where events happen which cause the Committee to consider that such change is appropriate to ensure a fair measure of performance.
Detail of LTIP awards made in the year It is the Groups remuneration policy to ensure that a significant part of potential reward is delivered through performance based incentive plans.
Proper alignment between the interests of management and the interests of shareholders also forms an important part of this policy.
Therefore, in line with the LTIP normal grant policy, awards of 100% of salary were granted to the Executive Directors in 2012.
In addition, they received investment shares in exchange for the compulsory deferred element of their bonus, which, along with any voluntary investment shares, are subject to matching shares on the third anniversary of the award if the performance conditions are met.

III Performance conditions associated with the 2012 LTIP award are outlined below along with the conditions that will be used for awards made in 2013.
The Committee believes that a balance between EPS and relative TSR is appropriate and aligned to the Groups long term strategic goals of driving sustained earnings performance and shareholder value creation.
IV The Committee believes that targets for incentives should be stretching but also motivational to executives.
It is mindful of the challenging environment the Group is currently operating in and as such has reviewed the EPS targets for the 2013 LTIP award.
The targets have been lowered to reect internal and external growth forecasts to give a range of 5% to 11% per annum.
The Committee is confident that this range is sufciently challenging and is consistent with our remuneration strategy.
The Committee has also reviewed the TSR comparator group to ensure that the companies included remain relevant and has added Fenner plc to the comparator group for the 2013 award, to bring the total number of peers to 25.

Total pension entitlements Keith Cochrane and Jon Stanton are responsible for their own pension arrangements.
Alan Mitchelson was an active member of the Companys 1972 pension and life assurance plan until 31 December 2011 when he ceased to accrue further benets and became a deferred member.
The plan is a contributory dened benefit plan with the active members contributing 8% of salary.
The balance of the cost of the plan is met by the Group having taken account of the trustees opinion arrived at by considering the funding recommendations of the plans independent actuary.
The plan targets a pension of two thirds of final salary payable at normal retirement date, providing a member then has at least 24 years pensionable service.
Where a member has less than 24 years pensionable service to normal retirement date their pension currently accrues at 1 36th of final salary per annum.
For members, salary both for contributions and for plan benets is subject to a plan specic earnings cap.
The plan provides for a surviving spouses pension of one half of the members pension before any exchange for cash and, in certain circumstances, for a dependent childs pension until the child attains the age of 23 years.
Pension built up prior to April 2006 increases in payment by the annual increase in the retail prices index up to a maximum of 5%.
For pension built up after April 2006, the annual increase is limited to a maximum of 2.5%.
Deferred pensions are revalued between the date of exit and normal retirement date in line with statute.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 79 Directors Report: Corporate Governance Remuneration Report Continued The following table and its corresponding notes detailing pension entitlement and the corresponding transfer values during the period is subject to audit.
Change in transfer value of accrued Transfer value Transfer value pension during of accrued Transfer Accrued of accrued the year net pension as at value of Accrued Increase pension as at pension as at of directors Directors 31 December increase net pension as at in accrued 28 December 31 December ordinary ordinary 2011 of ination 31 December pension during 2012 2011 contributions contributions note 2 note 2 Name of Director Notes 2011 the period note 1 note 2 note 3 Alan Mitchelson 4,5, 6,7, 8 40,422 3,355 43,777 983,807 20,880 1,004,687 76,997 Notes 1.
The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement, prior to any cash commutation, at the end of the year.
With effect from 1 October 2008, Government legislation requires the Trustees having taken actuarial advice to take responsibility for setting the assumptions underlying the calculation of voluntary transfer values to be paid from the plan.
Prior to this date the scheme actuary had this responsibility.
Consequently, the transfer values of the accrued pension entitlement have been calculated in accordance with this revised requirement.
The change in the amount of the transfer value over the year is made up of the following elements: a. transfer value of the increase in accrued pension: b. decrease in the transfer value of accrued pension at year start due to ageing since Alan Mitchelson has passed his normal retirement date: c. impact of any change in the economic or mortality assumptions underlying the transfer value basis as referred to in 2, above: d. less the directors ordinary contributions.
The change in the amount of the transfer value over the year includes the effect of uctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Group and directors, such as stock market movements, which will be reected within 3c, above.
The Consumer Prices Ination measure for leavers from the dened benefit scheme during 2012 with at least one year remaining until their normal retirement was 2.5%.
Since Alan Mitchelson left the dened benefit scheme in 2011 after his normal retirement date and as at the year end had not vested any of his retirement benets, the rate of ination assumed in the above gures is 0%.
Directors have the option to pay voluntary contributions.
Neither the contributions nor the resulting benets are included in the above table.
The gures for Alan Mitchelson allow for the impact of the plan specic earnings cap, his restricted salary for pension accrued from April 2010 and the late retirement factor from 1 January 2012.
Alan Mitchelson does not have an entitlement to an excepted formerly known as unapproved pension from the Group and, as at the year end, had not vested any of his retirement benets under the dened benefit scheme provided by the Group.
Payment of actual transfer values from the dened benefit scheme of which Alan Mitchelson is a member are not currently reduced below 100% of their full value.
Alan Mitchelson ceased to be an Executive Director with effect from 9 May 2012.
