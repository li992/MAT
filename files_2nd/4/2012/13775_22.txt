Remuneration Report Letter from the Chairman Dear fellow shareholder It is my pleasure to present this years Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 September 2012.
Remuneration overview As stated in last years report, during the year the Remuneration Committee commissioned a review of the short and long-term incentive arrangements, to ensure that these continue to meet the needs of the business and provide an appropriate and effective incentive to deliver on the Groups strategic objectives.
In addition, during the year management reviewed and realigned the strategy of the business to accelerate organic revenue growth, drive margins and improve EPS performance.
This strategy was articulated at the Investor Day held in July 2012.
I was delighted to be able to engage with many of our major investors and representative bodies on the incentive changes proposed by the Remuneration Committee in response to these strategic aims.
Following the extensive consultation, we have made a number of changes to our remuneration framework to further align with the Groups strategic objectives.
Key changes to the operation of the bonus plan for 2012 13 onwards are: Introduction of strategic performance measures.
Simplification and extended scope of our deferral policy.
Key changes to the operation of the Performance Share Plan for 2012 13 onwards are: Introduction of an organic revenue growth performance measure and simplification of the measurement approach in respect of the EPS and TSR performance measures.
Reduction of the level of award that will be available for stretch performance i. e. the level of vesting for meeting targets consistent with the level of stretch under our 2011 framework from 210% to 200%.
Introduction of an additional 50% of base salary to reward exceptional performance i. e. for exceptional performance, the maximum award would be 250% of base salary: this would remain within the overall Plan limit of 300% of base salary.
We have also extended our shareholding guideline policy to all members of our Executive Committee.
Further details of the proposed changes are set out on page 66.
Remuneration for 2011 12 For the year ending 30 September 2012, underlying pre-tax profit increased by 4%, organic revenue growth was 2% and the profit underpin for annual bonus purposes was achieved: this resulted in annual bonus payments of between 26% and 30% of base salary for the executive directors.
Performance share awards granted in 2010 are primarily based on EPS targets: these targets were not met during the year and therefore no part of the awards will vest in March 2013.
Remuneration disclosure We are committed to maintaining an open dialogue with shareholders.
We have made a number of improvements to the Remuneration Report this year and have sought to make our disclosure more transparent.
Notably we have added a single figure of remuneration for each executive director.
I hope that you find the report clear and informative.
