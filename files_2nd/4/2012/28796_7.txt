The objective of our remuneration policy is to retain and incentivise talented individuals to deliver sustained superior returns for our shareholders.
The Committee implemented a number of changes to the Compensation schemes in the year to 31 March 2012.
A new Annual Incentive Scheme AIS was introduced with performance requirements measured over a three-year period.
On a trailing three-year basis, RITs growth in total net assets has not exceeded the benchmarks.
Therefore, despite RITs good performance over the recent financial crisis, no bonus payments have been made to Executive Directors under this scheme.
The Committee also introduced a policy of bonus deferral into shares for amounts in excess of 150,000, as well as new claw-back arrangements.
The Committee continues to operate a Share Appreciation Rights SAR Plan.
Following shareholder consultations, a new cap has been applied from 2012 on the size of individual SAR awards.
The Committee has also introduced an overall limit of 1% of NAV on the aggregate of annual incentive payments and SAR awards.
As no AIS payments were made for the financial year, the total variable pay was well below the prescribed limit.
We believe that this Remuneration Report provides a clear explanation of the Committees policies and their alignment with shareholders interests.
Those items which are audited are highlighted within the title.
Remuneration Committee The Committee members throughout the year were: Lord Douro Chairman John Cornish James Leigh-Pemberton Michael Marks Executives provide information to the Committee, although individuals are not present when their own remuneration is considered.
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee has appointed New Bridge Street NBS as its adviser on senior executive and employee remuneration.
The Company has no other relationship with NBS, which is therefore independent.
Remuneration Overview The Remuneration Committee is responsible for setting the remuneration of Executive Directors including pension rights.
It also monitors and recommends the level and structure of remuneration for senior management.
The Board of Directors is responsible for determining the remuneration of the non-executive Directors within the limits set out in the Companys Articles of Association.
Remuneration levels for Executive Directors are intended to be sufficient to attract, retain and motivate Directors of the quality to run the Company successfully whilst avoiding paying more than is necessary for this purpose.
The major part of Executive Directors remuneration is linked to corporate and individual performance.
As foreseen in the 31 March 2011 Remuneration Report and following consultations with shareholders, the Company implemented a new Annual Incentive Scheme in the financial year ended 31 March 2012.
The characteristics of the scheme are included in the table overleaf.
RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts March 2012 21 224233 RIT R&A pp18-pp27 31 05 2012 22:10 Page 22 Directors Remuneration Report Performance Graph A performance graph which measures the Companys total shareholder return calculated by reference to the Companys share price, including dividend reinvestment against that of a broad equity market index is shown below.
For this purpose the Committee considers that the MSCI World Total Return Index in Sterling and the FTSE All-Share Total Return Index are the most suitable indices for comparative purposes.
The graph below therefore compares the Companys total shareholder return to that of these two indices over the last 5 years.

Following the Remuneration Committees review after the year-end on 31 March 2012, the Executive Directors base salaries have been set at the following annualised amounts: Lord Rothschild: 438,768 March 2012: 430,165 Micky Breuer-Weil: 331,500 March 2012: 325,000 This represents an increase of 2%, which is consistent with the average percentage increases awarded to other employees, which are considered and taken into account by the Committee.
Pensions The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme under which Micky Breuer-Weil is entitled to pension contributions at the rate of 20% of base salary.
The Groups defined benefit pension scheme closed to new members in 1997.
Neither of the Executive Directors has any accrued defined benefit entitlement under the scheme.
Lord Rothschild receives a cash allowance of 20% of base salary, in lieu of pension contributions.
Duncan Budge, who retired during the year, was a member of the defined benefit scheme.
Details of the movements in his entitlements are shown on page 27.
Other Benefits In addition to base salary, the Executive Directors received a bonus of 1,000 that was paid to all staff in December 2011 December 2010: 1,000.
The Executive Directors are entitled to the use of a company car, private medical and other insurances.
VARIABLE PAY Annual Incentive Scheme As described in the Companys March 2011 Directors Remuneration Report, the Remuneration Committee has implemented a new Annual Incentive Scheme AIS for the year to 31 March 2012 for Executive Directors and senior management.
This provides better alignment with the Companys objectives, is more consistent with market practice in the investment management sector and is partly payable in deferred shares.
Under the AIS, a bonus pool is created for participants based on the Companys trailing three-year total net asset value growth, relative to the growth in the MSCI World index in.
The Remuneration Committee has set the participation rate at 5% of such outperformance.
Individual awards made from the pool are based on personal performance, taking account of contribution to investment performance, overall management, development of the Company, adherence to prudent risk management and regulatory compliance controls.
In common with the practice amongst many asset managers, there is no explicit cap on the size of individual awards.
However, the Remuneration Committee applies a cap of 1% of NAV on all incentive payments.
The first 150,000 of any individual award is paid in cash.
Any bonus award in excess of 150,000 is in the form of conditional, deferred shares of the Company.
This helps generate additional incentive for, and alignment with, sustained performance delivered for shareholders.
Any awards paid in deferred shares will vest in two tranches: 50% after a year and 50% after two years, subject to remaining in service.
RITs total NAV increased by 42.2% over the three years to 31 March 2012.
However, the benchmark index the MSCI World Index, in grew by 45.7% over the same period.
Therefore no bonus payments have been awarded to Executive Directors under the AIS for performance to 31 March 2012.
Bonuses for the previous year ended 31 March 2011 were awarded to the Executive Directors before the implementation of the AIS as follows: Lord Rothschild: 150,000 Micky Breuer-Weil: 275,000 RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts March 2012 23 224233 RIT R&A pp18-pp27 31 05 2012 22:10 Page 24 Directors Remuneration Report Long-term Incentive Plan Audited The J Rothschild Capital Management Share Appreciation Rights Plan SAR Plan was last approved by shareholders of the Company on 17 July 2008.
The SAR Plan provides for the grant of Share Appreciation Rights SARs over a number of shares in the Company.
Following the expiry of a three-year vesting period, participants in the SAR Plan are entitled to exercise their SARs and receive a payment equal to the growth in value of the notional shares over the vesting period.
However, the exercise of a SAR is ordinarily subject to the participants continued service over the vesting period and whether the performance condition applying to the SAR is satisfied.
The performance condition applied to SAR awards requires that the increase in the Companys total shareholder return TSR exceeds the growth in the Retail Price Index plus 3 percentage points per annum over the three-year performance period.
The performance condition was chosen as a good measure of above-inflation returns to shareholder and is subject to ongoing review by the Committee.
At the 2011 Annual General Meeting and further to a review of the SAR Plan by the Committee which included consultation with major investors, shareholder approval was granted for the SAR Plan to use ordinary shares of the Company to settle the share appreciation amount for existing and future awards granted under the SAR Plan.
The Group seeks to hedge its exposure under the SAR Plan by using an Employee Benefit Trust to acquire shares to meet the estimated future liability.
With effect from 2012, the Remuneration Committee has applied a cap on individual annual grants under the SARs Plan of 4x base salary measured as the value at grant of the shares notionally under option.
The following SARs held by the Companys Executive Directors lapsed unexercised during the year: Notional no.

These include the awards in the table above.
The lowest closing price of the Companys shares during the year was 1,173p and the highest was 1,360p.
Clawback For awards granted after 1 April 2011, all annual incentive and long-term incentive payments are subject to claw-back provisions which provide scope for the Company to recover value from awards in the event of a material mis-statement of the Companys results or in the event of dismissal for gross misconduct.
Executive Shareholding Requirements Executive Directors are expected to build and retain a substantial personal shareholding in the Companys shares.
As at 31 March 2012, these beneficial holdings represented a very significant multiple of base salary for Lord Rothschild and 94% of base salary for Mikael Breuer-Weil.
Directors Service Contracts Lord Rothschild and Mikael Breuer-Weil each have service agreements with J Rothschild Capital Management Limited JRCM, dated 29 April 1996 and 9 December 2008 respectively.
The service agreements of Lord Rothschild and Mr Breuer-Weil can each be terminated on not less than twelve months written notice.
They provide for benefits-in-kind in line with normal company practice, including pension provision, private health insurance and a company car.
Neither agreement specifies compensation payable in the event of early termination.
When considering the size of any proposed termination payment, the Committee would take into account a number of factors including the health, length of service, age and the performance of the relevant executive, including the duty to mitigate his own loss, with a broad aim to avoid rewarding poor performance while dealing fairly with cases where the departure is due to other reasons, such as illness.
No payments were made to any Director for termination of employment nor were any payments made to third parties for Directors services during the year.
Duncan Budge retired as an Executive Director on 28 November 2011 and as an employee on 31 December 2011.
He retains SARs granted to him in 2007 for a period of 12 months after leaving service and SARs granted in 2009 for a period of 12 months following the applicable vesting date.
Unvested SARs awards granted in 2010 and 2011 were reduced in number in proportion to the amount of the applicable vesting periods served.
The balances of unvested SARs held remain subject to the performance condition prior to vesting.
