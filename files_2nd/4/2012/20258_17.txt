Total shareholder return policies and practices detailed in our report.
Against this background, the aggregate value of bonus awards has increased by 10%, but there have been no increases in awards to executive directors.
Aberdeen's remuneration policies are designed to support our Simon Troughton business strategy, as a leading international asset manager.
The Chairman of the remuneration committee objective is to attract, retain and reward talented individuals for the delivery of sustained, superior returns for our clients and shareholders.
Aberdeen operates in a highly competitive international employment market, and aims to maintain its strong track record of success in developing and retaining talent.
During the course of the past year, the remuneration committee has reviewed a number of aspects of the remuneration policies, seeking to enhance further the close alignment with shareholders interests.
This has resulted in some important developments, including: For executive directors and members of the GMB, the vesting period for the deferred portion of annual bonus awards has been extended.
Awards will now vest over a period of four years instead of three years.
The deferred element remains unchanged at 75% of the total bonus award, substantially higher than the market norm: The principle of clawback has been formalised in the annual bonus plan, to enable the committee to reclaim annual bonus where justified by exceptional adverse events or circumstances: The minimum shareholding requirement for executive directors has been increased to 200% of annual salary from 100% previously : each of our executives has a major investment in Aberdeen shares and complies comfortably with this requirement: and The committee has for many years maintained control of the aggregate level of annual bonuses by reference to the Groups overall profitability.
However, as explained later in this report, this has not previously been formally reported to shareholders and we have agreed that we should now do so more explicitly.

vesting of LTIP awards were met and determining the appropriate vesting proportion: and Review of incentive plans during 2011-12 The committee reviewed the incentive plans for executives, including addressing the items in the table below: Items addressed Outcomes Annual bonus caps The committee considered whether to apply an absolute cap on the level of individual bonus awards.
Having reviewed market practice, it concluded that this would place Aberdeen in an uncompetitive position relative to its peer group.
However, the committee believes that its practice, which it has adopted consistently for several years, of relating the maximum level of aggregate bonus pool to the Groups profits provides a robust control over the risk of excessive awards.
The committee believes that the aggregate bonus pool in any year should normally be no more than 25% of pre-bonus operating profit.
The committee also takes account of the ratio of total compensation costs to revenue, which at 34.8% for 2012 2011: 34.9% is competitive within Aberdeen's peer group.
The high proportion of bonus deferral 75%, the extended vesting period 4 years for executive directors and members of the GMB, supplemented by clawback arrangements and the risk controls incorporated in Aberdeens team-based investment process, ensure that the uncapped bonus opportunity encourages both excellent performance and the prudent management of risk.
52 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Items addressed Outcomes Clawback The committee has formalised the clawback principle applied in the annual bonus plan.
This enables annual bonus in the exceptional event of: a misstatement or misleading representation of performance: a significant failure of risk management and control: or serious misconduct by an individual.
Long-term remuneration The committee has not granted long-term incentive LTI awards since 2009.
As part of the recent review, the committee considered whether it was appropriate to re-commence LTI awards.
The committee concluded that its policy of deferring 75% of annual bonus already provides a substantial proportion of long-term remuneration.
Rather than augmenting the existing package with new LTI awards, the committee has decided to: extend the period over which deferred bonuses vest to four years: formalise the clawback provision in the bonus plan: and increase the shareholding requirement for executive directors.
The committee also concluded that the absence of a separate LTI programme helps to reduce the complexity of the package.
Shareholding requirements The committee increased the shareholding requirement for executive directors to 200% of base salary, twice the previous requirement.
Deferred share awards arising from annual bonus awards are recognised as part of an individuals shareholding.
