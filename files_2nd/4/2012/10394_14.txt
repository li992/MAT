MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 'LUHFWRUV UHPXQHUDWLRQ UHSRUW, QWURGXFWLRQ This report has been prepared on behalf of the Board in accordance with s420 of the Companies Act 2006 and in line with the Schedule 8 of the Large and Mediumsized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 and covers all Directors who served on the Board during the reporting period.
The Remuneration Committee believes in and promotes good governance through the adoption of the Code, compliance with the Listing Rules and due reference to other guidelines which together should provide shareholders with a practical framework and reference point.
Certain elements of this report need to be audited by the Companys auditors and for them to state that the audited information has been duly prepared in accordance with the regulations.
The report therefore has been arranged into two sections: Section A: not subject to audit and Section B: subject to audit.
The report will be presented for shareholder approval at the forthcoming AGM on 11 July 2012.
Section A: The following information is not subject to audit 5HPXQHUDWLRQ SROLFLHV DQG SULQFLSOHV Membership The Remuneration Committee met five times in the year and is comprised of solely Non-Executive Directors of the Company.
The members of the Remuneration Committee are Terry Morgan CBE Committee Chairman, David Jenkins, Graeme Potts, Larry Hirst CBE and Roger Matthews.
Ruby McGregor-Smith CBE, Chief Executive and the Group HR director attended Committee meetings by invitation only, to provide further information on the Companys performance and the performance and remuneration of the Executive Directors.
Advisers to the Committee During the year the Committee requested the attendance of and sought advice from Kepler Associates appointed by the Committee in 2007.
Kepler Associates provide no other services to the Company.
Terms of reference The terms of reference for the Committee are available on the Companys website and include: shaping and agreeing with the Board the framework of policy for the remuneration of Executive Directors and certain aspects of the remuneration of senior management: determining the total individual remuneration package of each Executive Director with due regard to the performance of the individual in line with the agreed remuneration policy: agreeing Executive Directors contractual terms: acting on behalf of the Board, in connection with the establishment and administration of the groups current and or future share plans, including the selection of participants, the setting of option prices and the setting of performance targets: and, drafting and approving the Directors remuneration report and any remuneration related resolutions to be put to the shareholders at the groups AGM.
General remuneration principles The Committee is responsible for formulating remuneration policies and principles that promote the success of the Company in creating value for shareholders over the longer term, are aligned to the corporate objectives and business strategy and take into full account the associated risks.
The Committee understands that it is accountable to shareholders for the decisions made on Executive remuneration and seeks to maintain an open and constructive dialogue where changes to remuneration policy are being proposed.
The remuneration policy for the Companys Executive Directors and other group senior executives is shaped by the requirement to align the interests and individual performance of the Senior Executive team with those of MITIEs shareholders.
The policy has particular regard to the Companys and the groups long-standing culture of encouraging equity ownership in order to achieve this alignment.
The Committee, and the Board, continues to believe that the principle of equity incentivisation has been a key driving force in the past success of the group.
Consequently, in order to maintain and further develop MITIEs performance culture, the Committee believes that the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors should continue to contain significant performance-related equity-based elements.
The Committee continues to believe that exceptional performance should be matched with appropriate remuneration to attract, retain and motivate Directors and management and ensures that packages are linked to and support the long-term performance of the Company.
64 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Remuneration policy The remuneration policy of the Company promotes and embeds the Companys remuneration principles.
The Companys policy is: Performance linked Company performance determines a significant element of the Executive remuneration packages.
Only top-end performance can achieve the stretching targets that are reflected in the performance-linked pay elements of the packages.
Shareholder aligned The discretionary share schemes are based on EPS growth to align the interests of the senior executive team with those of shareholders.
Bonuses are structured to reward the attainment of the strategic target of long-term sustainable, profitable growth.
Comprehensive and simple The overall remuneration policy is comprehensive without becoming overcomplicated and encourages Executives to concentrate on growth of the group.
The Committee believes, and is satisfied that, the remuneration policy is appropriate and takes account of the groups performance and strategic objectives and will continue to use this approach and policy as a framework for the setting of future packages, whilst having due regard for the remuneration packages offered across the group and the external market.
Share ownership policy The Company operates a share ownership policy to encourage the build-up of equity in the Company by both its Executive Directors and senior executives.
Under this policy, all Executive Directors are required, over time, to build and maintain a target shareholding in the Company worth 100% of base salary 150% of salary for any Executive Director who is granted an LTIP award of more than 100% of base salary.
The Committee recognises that the principal mechanism for building up this holding will be on the exercise of LTIP awards and accordingly, until such time as the shareholding requirement is met, Executive Directors will be expected to retain no fewer than 50% of shares net of taxes that vest under the LTIP.
On the 1 May each year, the Committee reviews the expected target holding for the Executive Directors, calculated as a percentage of salary.

7KH NH HOHPHQWV RI [HFXWLYH 'LUHFWRU UHPXQHUDWLRQ The overall package for Executive Directors consists of a fixed element salary and certain benefits and a variable performance-related element annual performance-related bonus and long-term equity-based incentives and has been structured to align the Executive Directors packages with the interests of shareholders.
The Committee tests the remuneration structure regularly to ensure that it remains aligned with business needs and is appropriately positioned relative to the market.
The balance between the fixed and variable elements of the Executive Directors packages is set out below.
Base salary and other benefits The Committees advisers provide an annual review of total remuneration relative to sector and size comparators and including base salary, annual bonus, long-term incentives and pension.
The Committee considers this review and also takes account of a range of other factors when determining appropriate salary levels including market conditions and the responsibilities and skills of the individual Directors and in the context of salary increases across the organisation as a whole.
The Executive Directors received salary increases during the year averaging less than 4% and took account of the range of factors described above, the continued growth and performance of the group and the performance of the individual Executive Directors, with due consideration of the outcomes of the benchmarking exercise.
For the current year, the Remuneration Committee approved salary increases averaging 3%.
The other benefits offered to the Executive Directors consist of contributions to a pension scheme, private healthcare and the provision of a car allowance.
65 Accounts Governance Business review Overview MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 'LUHFWRUV UHPXQHUDWLRQ UHSRUW 7KH NH HOHPHQWV RI [HFXWLYH 'LUHFWRU UHPXQHUDWLRQ Annual bonus Performance-related remuneration is designed to drive MITIEs performance and be aligned to the group strategic objective of achieving long-term sustainable, profitable growth.
The annual bonus rewards mainly short-term Company performance but also has a link to longer-term performance through a link to strategic targets and partial delivery in MITIE Group PLC shares.
For the 2011 2012 performance year, Executive Directors had the opportunity to earn bonuses of up to 125% of salary, with any bonus earned above 100% of salary deferred into MITIE Group PLC shares for two years and forfeited should the Director leave the business during this period.
Up to 100% of salary is earned for the achievement of group budgeted profit growth and the remaining 25% of salary is assessed on a series of non-financial strategic targets.
In setting the non-financial strategic targets, the Committee had due consideration of the longer-term success of the Company and the aligning of interests with shareholders and continues to believe that the performance targets for the annual bonus are sufficiently stretching for the maximum bonus payment.
During the year under review, MITIE achieved the profit growth target in full and 100% of base salary will be paid in cash.
The Remuneration Committee decided that significant overall progress had been achieved on the non-financial strategic targets and therefore awarded a further 25% of base salary, deferred into MITIE Group PLC shares for two years.
For the 2012 13 performance year, the Remuneration Committee has approved two changes to the annual bonus scheme structure.
A sliding scale has been introduced into the element of the bonus based on financial targets which will pay out 90% of salary for threshold performance to 110% of salary at stretch.
The upper end of the scale is intended to reward the achievement of exceptional financial performance and the sliding scale in general to ensure that bonus pay-outs are not unduly sensitive to small changes in performance.
Given the extension of the financial performance targets, the Committee feels that a modest uplift in the bonus opportunity for financial performance from 100% to 110% of salary is appropriate.
In addition, the bonus opportunity for the Chief Executive on the strategic objectives element has been increased by 25% to 50% of salary.
This increase recognises her significant influence on the achievement of these objectives.
Overall the maximum bonus opportunity for the Chief Executive will therefore increase to 160% of base salary while the maximum opportunity for the other Executive Directors will increase to 135% of base salary.
Any bonus amount over 100% of base salary will be deferred in shares for a two year period.
Share-based incentives The remuneration package reinforces long-term decision making and sustainable profitable growth through the use of share-based incentives.
For Executive Directors and certain senior executives, the principal tools designed to support this ethos are the Companys LTIP as described on page 68 and the Share Ownership Policy as described on page 65.
Vesting of share awards under the LTIP is based on performance measured over three years which is considered appropriate to align rewards to Executive Directors with the strategic objectives of the Company.
Certain Executive Directors still retain options granted under the ESOS details of the holdings are set out in Table 5 of Section B below.
It is the intention of the Committee not to issue further ESOS options to Executive Directors, although ESOS continues to be used to reward and incentivise certain other members of the senior group executive and management teams.
Details of Executive Directors participation in the Groups share schemes are set out below.
[HFXWLYH 'LUHFWRUV VHUYLFH FRQWUDFWV All Directors are appointed for an indeterminate period of office but are subject to annual re-election at the AGM in accordance with the Code.
The Executive Directors service contracts are available for inspection at MITIEs registered office, the head office and at the AGM.
All the Executive Directors have rolling service contracts which provide for a maximum of 12 months notice from either party.
There are no provisions for compensation on termination of employment set out within the contracts of the Executive Directors.
The dates of the service contracts of the Executive Directors are set out below: Table 2: Executive Directors service contracts Date of Contract term agreement Notice period R McGregor-Smith CBE Rolling contract 01-Apr-03 12 months S C Baxter Rolling contract 10-Apr-06 12 months W Robson Rolling contract 01-Apr-03 12 months 66 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 3ROLF RQ H[WHUQDO DSSRLQWPHQWV The Board recognises that the appointment of Executive Directors to Non-Executive positions at other companies can be beneficial both for the individual Director and the group through the broadening of their experience and knowledge.
Ruby McGregor-Smith CBE receives fees of 51,000 per annum in respect of her role as a Non-Executive Director of Michael Page International plc and is entitled to retain any fees earned.
1RQ [HFXWLYH 'LUHFWRUV Non-Executive Directors fees The fee level is designed to recognise the contribution and responsibilities of the role and to attract individuals with the experience and skills required to contribute to the future development of the Board and the group.
The Non-Executive Directors are paid a basic fee with an additional fee for chairing a Committee, together with expenses incurred in carrying out their duties on behalf of the Company.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Companys share schemes or the annual bonus scheme, nor do they receive pension or ancillary benefits.
Following an external benchmarking exercise, the fees for Non-Executive Directors were increased from 40,000 to 46,000 effective from the 1 April 2011.
An increase from 5,000 to 7,000 per annum was also approved and paid to Non-Executive Directors who also chair one of the Committees of the Board.
This was the first increase to Non-Executive Director fees since 2006.
No increases were made in respect of the Chairman.
Further details of fees paid to Non-Executive Directors are provided in Table 1 of Section B below.
Non-Executive Directors engagement terms The terms of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at MITIEs registered office, the head office and at the AGM.
The Non-Executive Directors are engaged for an initial term of three years which is terminable on either three or six months notice and thereafter on a rolling term.

The Board believes that the groups culture of employee equity involvement is a significant driver in the groups growth performance and that this assists in attracting and retaining skilled and committed employees.
Equity-based incentive schemes The group currently operates six equity-based incentive schemes as set out below and the interests of the Executive Directors in each of these schemes are set out in Tables 4 to 8 of Section B below.
2001 SAYE Scheme 2001 SAYE and 2011 SAYE Scheme 2011 Scheme The 2001 and the 2011 SAYE Schemes are the Companys non-discretionary option schemes open to all eligible employees and approved for HMRC purposes.
Salary deductions are made and savings are used to purchase the options at the end of the three-year period.
No options have been issued to any Directors under the 2001 SAYE Scheme.
The 2001 SAYE Scheme expired in September 2011 and future awards may only be granted under the 2011 SAYE Scheme rules following the adoption of new plan rules at the Companys 2011 AGM.
2011 Share Incentive Plan 2011 SIP At the 2011 AGM shareholders approved the adoption of the 2011 SIP which allows employees to use their salary to purchase shares in the Company.
Eligible employees are offered the opportunity to buy Company shares from pre-tax earnings as part of a regular share purchase plan.
Shares are currently purchased monthly using employees deductions and are placed in trust.
All the Executive Directors participate in this scheme with each Director contributing the maximum permitted under the plan rules for which details are set out in Table 4 of Section B.
67 Accounts Governance Business review Overview MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 'LUHFWRUV UHPXQHUDWLRQ UHSRUW PSOR HH VKDUH VFKHPHV 2001 Executive Share Option Scheme 2001 ESOS and 2011 Executive Share Option Scheme 2011 ESOS New 2011 ESOS Plan rules were adopted by shareholders at the 2011 AGM.
The 2001 and 2011 ESOS are discretionary schemes and therefore not open to all employees of the group.
The award of options under the 2011 ESOS is focused on employees who are below main Board level and who do not participate in the LTIP.
Currently, 2011 ESOS is used to retain, reward and motivate employees with continuous service of six months who are part of the leadership team of the group includes senior managers, managers and team leaders.
The scheme has been approved by HMRC and options over shares to an individual limit of 30,000 can be awarded in the approved element of the scheme.
Above 30,000, options are awarded under the unapproved for HMRC purposes section of the scheme.
Overall, awards in any single year are limited to 100% of an individuals base salary.
Awards made prior to 2011 were granted with a single performance threshold for vesting of average growth in earnings per share over the three-year vesting period in excess of inflation measured as RPI plus 4% per annum.
In order to ensure a consistent and aligned approach to performance criteria across other MITIE schemes, for awards granted in 2011, the Committee approved a performance threshold based on a nominal EPS measure and accordingly, 2011 awards were granted with a performance measure of 6% per annum compound growth over a three-year performance period.
The scheme permits the grant of share appreciation rights and the settlement of outstanding unapproved options with share appreciation rights.
No price is payable upon award in respect of 2011 ESOS.
The Board continues to believe that ESOS offers incentive and motivation to those employees nominated for awards and proposes to continue with awards on the basis explained above.
The share options detailed in Table 5 of Section B were granted to Executive Directors prior to 2007 under the 2001 ESOS and the performance conditions that applied at the date of grant required a percentage growth in the Companys earnings per share equal to or in excess of 10% per annum compound over the period from the date of grant of the option to the date on which the option first became exercisable.
The performance conditions relating to the awards to Directors detailed below are the same as for any other member of the schemes who received awards at the same time.
Since these grants to Ruby McGregor-Smith CBE and Suzanne Baxter there have been no grants to Directors under the 2001 or 2011 ESOS both under the unapproved part and the HMRC-approved part, and it is the Committees current policy that equity-based incentives for Directors will be based solely upon LTIP awards.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP is a discretionary scheme rather than being open to all employees of the group, and is focused on incentivising Executive Directors and senior management.
Awards under the LTIP may be made, either through a joint-ownership structure or through direct grants in the form of nil-cost options, conditional shares or forfeitable shares.
The Committee may also decide to grant cash-based awards of an equivalent value to share-based awards or to satisfy share-based awards in cash, although it does not currently intend to do so.
An award may not be granted under the current LTIP after 26 July 2017, when the current scheme expires.
No payment other than in respect of any individual recipient electing to pay income tax and national insurance, where appropriate is required for the grant of an award.
Awards are not transferable, except on death, and are not pensionable.
The scheme rules, in line with standard industry practice, contain provision for pro-rata vesting in the event of retirement, redundancy, disability and or death.
In the event of a change of control of the group, awards will be pro-rated both for time and performance, subject to the discretion of the Committee.
The upper limit on the market value as at grant of awards that an individual Executive Director may receive in any financial year is 200% of annual base salary.
In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment, the rules allow for awards of up to 250% of an employees annual base salary.
The performance criteria for the LTIP is based on growth in the EPS of MITIE.
The Committee continues to believe that EPS is a key long-term performance measure for MITIE as it is aligned with the groups strategy and KPIs but recognises that measures need to be reviewed regularly to ensure that they continue to align with the groups strategy and are effective as an incentive.
The Committee is currently reviewing the performance criteria for 2012 LTIP awards.
Any significant changes will be discussed with major shareholders in advance and disclosed in next years report.
Awards will normally vest after three years provided that certain performance criteria have been met.
All awards are subject to performance conditions that require adjusted EPS to exceed certain performance thresholds over a three-year period.
Where EPS growth is less than a lower performance threshold no awards will vest.
Awards vest in full when EPS growth is equal to, or more than, an upper performance threshold.
Vesting is on a straight-line basis for performance between these levels.
At the time when the LTIP scheme was introduced, RPI growth was considered a broad proxy for underlying economic growth in the UK.
For this reason, the EPS performance measure was linked to RPI.
However, the Committee believes this is no longer a valid assumption and the correlation between the Companys earnings growth and UK RPI growth is increasingly limited, since RPI-linked year-on-year uplifts to contract values are not a big feature of the 68 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 MITIE business model.
During the year the Committee consulted with its shareholders on this issue, and following this has replaced the real EPS growth targets with nominal EPS growth targets for 2011 and future LTIP awards.
Accordingly, for LTIPs granted in 2011, the lower performance threshold at which 25% of an award vests is 7% per annum and the upper performance threshold is 13% per annum.
Awards to all Executive Directors during the year were 200% of salary.
During the year the Committee assessed the outcome of the 2008 LTIP awards.
The vesting of these awards was conditional on achieving performance within the following performance scale the lower performance threshold at which 25% of an award vests was RPI 5% per annum and the upper performance threshold was RPI 14% per annum.
The upper performance threshold applicable to the 2008 LTIP award was assessed to have been achieved and consequently the awards granted in 2008 vested in full on 30 June 2011.
Table 6 in Section B provides details of the LTIP awards granted to, and exercised by, the Executive Directors, as well as the performance targets governing the vesting of LTIP awards granted in prior years.
Share dilution The Company manages dilution rates within the ABI guidelines of 10% of issued Ordinary share capital in respect of all employee schemes ESOS and SAYE and 5% in respect of discretionary schemes ESOS.
In calculating compliance with these guidelines the Company allocates available headroom on a ten-year flat-line basis, making adjustments for projected lapse rates and projected increases in issued share capital.
LTIP awards are satisfied through the market purchase of shares held by the MITIE Group PLC Employee Benefit Trust 2007 and the MITIE Group PLC Employee Benefit Trust 2008.
The potential dilution of the Companys issued share capital is set out below in respect of all outstanding awards granted under the Companys equity-based incentive schemes which are to be satisfied through the allotment of new shares.

The Committee is of the opinion that these comparators provide a clear picture of the performance of MITIE relative to a range of companies of comparable size as well as a specific group of companies within the same sector.
Total shareholder return is calculated according to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 and assumes that all dividends are reinvested.
The market price of the Companys shares as at 31 March 2012 was 279.5p.

The Company made contributions to the groups defined benefit scheme on behalf of the two Directors who are members of the scheme at a rate of 10% 2011: 10% of the value of the benefit cap of 123,600.
In addition, the two Directors received a salary supplement of 20% of salary 2011: 20%.
Suzanne Baxter is not a member of the MITIE Group PLC Defined Benefit Pension Scheme.
The value of the pension benefits provided to Suzanne Baxter mirror the value of the pension benefits provided to the other Executive Directors under the capped defined benefit arrangements, albeit that her benefits are currently provided through a separate defined contribution arrangement.
Following an assessment of the value of her defined contribution pension scheme assets as at 31 March 2011, no pension contributions were required for Suzanne Baxter for the year ended 31 March 2012 2011: Nil.
Suzanne Baxter received a salary supplement of 20% of base salary 2011: 20%.
Given the complexity and on-going annual cost around determining comparable values of pension benefits, the Remuneration Committee approved the decision to allow Suzanne Baxter entrance into the MITIE Group PLC Defined Benefit Pension Scheme, ceasing all further contributions into the defined contribution scheme.
Suzanne Baxter entered the scheme in April 2012.
There is no change to the value of Suzanne Baxter's total remuneration as the result of this change.
