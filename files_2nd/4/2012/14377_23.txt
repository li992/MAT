We therefore expect our Executive Directors to build up a holding of Smith & Nephew shares of two times their base salary.
In order to reinforce this expectation, we require them to retain 50% of all shares vesting under Company share plans after tax until this holding has been met recognising that differing international tax regimes affect the pace at which an Executive Director may fulfil the shareholding holding requirement.
When calculating whether or not this requirement has been met, we will include Ordinary Shares or ADSs held by the individual and by their immediate family and the intrinsic value of any vested but unexercised options.
We also require our Non-Executive Directors to hold a personal stake in the Company equivalent to their basic annual fee.
The table on page 86 shows the shares ADRs held by the Directors.
Dilution headroom The Committee ensures at all times that the number of new shares which may be issued under any share-based plans, including all employee plans, does not exceed 10% of the Companys issued share capital over any rolling ten-year period of which up to 5% may be issued to satisfy awards under the Companys discretionary share plans.
The Committee monitors headroom closely when granting awards over shares, taking into account the number of options or shares that might be expected to lapse or be forfeited before vesting or exercise.
In the event that insufficient new shares are available, there are processes in place to purchase shares in the market to satisfy vesting awards and to net-settle option exercises.
Over the previous ten years 2003 to 2012, the number of new shares issued under out share plans has been as follows: All-employee share plans 8,349,735 0.92% of issued share capital as at 19 February 2013 Discretionary share plans 34,234,721 3.78% of issued share capital as at 19 February 2013 Non-Executive Director fees Non-Executive Director and Chairman fees in 2012 were as follows: Fee in UK Sterling Fee in US Dollars Fee in Euros Basic annual fee 63,000 $120,000 84,250 Committee Chairman and Senior Independent Director fee 15,000 $27,000 20,000 Intercontinental travel fee per meeting 3,500 $7,000 5,000 Chairmans fee 400,000 Distribution statement For the year to For the year to 31 December 2012 31 December 2011 % change Attributable profit for the year $729m $582m 25% Dividends declared and paid during the year $186m $146m 27% Total Group spend on remuneration $886m $930m 5% 015914 Smith&Nephew AR12 p74-88 Working Copy.
