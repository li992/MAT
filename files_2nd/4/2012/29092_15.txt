Aligned with Any deferred variable compensation in excess of clients 50,000 is generally delivered equally in share awards and fund awards, subject to a minimum into fund awards of 10,000.

Aligned with The Groups total spend on compensation is set financial results as a percentage of operating revenue.
Over the long term, we aim for a compensation cost:operating revenue ratio of 45 per cent.
Variable compensation, being a component of profit, is set as a percentage of pre-bonus profit before tax, determined by the Committee and recommended to the Board.
This approach aligns compensation with financial results.
