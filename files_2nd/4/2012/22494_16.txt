These include an assessment of risk management behaviour which ensures that negative behaviours are penalised, resulting in lower or no variable compensation, regardless of financial performance.
Our review process to determine annual awards includes input from the group control functions risk, compliance and internal audit to ensure awards have been adjusted to take into account positive or negative issues from a risk and compliance perspective.
The mix of fixed and variable remuneration is structured to ensure that employees are not incentivised to take disproportionate risks for short-term gain, with 88% of employees across the group receiving bonuses less than or equal to 25,000 for the 2012 financial year.
