It has also continued to monitor developments in remuneration in the financial services sector and companies generally and is interested in the debates about the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches to remuneration.
For 2013, the Committee concluded that no material changes to SJPs overall policy are required.
We have awarded an increase of 3% in base salary for the Executive Directors.
This follows a freeze in salaries for the Executive Directors in 2012, and is in line with Sarah Bates increases awarded to the workforce as a whole.
In addition, we have amended the weightings of the financial and non-financial elements of the annual bonus for 2013 in order to reduce the emphasis on new business growth and increase the emphasis on Dear Shareholder some of the non-financial objectives set out in the 2013 business On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors plan.

Annual Report and Accounts 2012 65 Directors Remuneration Report continued Remuneration Policy Report This part of the Directors Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policy for the Company from 1 January 2013.
In setting the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors, the Committee takes into consideration a number of different factors: The Committee applies the principles set out in Schedule A of the UK Corporate Governance Code and also takes into account best practice guidance issued by the major UK institutional investor bodies, the FSA and other relevant organisations: The Committee has overall responsibility to be aware of the remuneration policies and structures of the Group as a whole and it reviews remuneration policy on a firm-wide basis.
When the Committee determines and reviews the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors it considers and compares it against the pay, policy and employment conditions of the Group to ensure that it is comfortable that there is alignment and equity between the two: and The Committee considers the external market in which the Group operates and uses comparator remuneration data from time to time, but as a guide only recognising that data can be volatile and must be used carefully to avoid the risk of an upward ratchet in remuneration.
The Committee recognises that there is often a need to phase-in changes over a period of time.
Engagement with Shareholders The Remuneration Committee engages with the Companys major shareholders and will discuss with them its proposals for 2014 in advance of seeking shareholder approval at the AGM in that year.
It also engages with the major investor bodies when a material change is proposed to the remuneration policy and gives full and proper consideration to their views.
Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors The remuneration policy is designed to support and encourage the delivery of the Groups short-term and long-term businessobjectives.
The following table summarises each element of the remuneration policy for the Executive Directors, explaining how each element operates and how each part links to corporate strategy.

Non-executive Directorsfees To attract high quality, experienced Non-executive Directors.
The Chairman is paid an all encompassing annual fee, which is reviewed periodically by the Committee.
All Non-executive Directors receive a basic annual fee for carrying out their duties, together with additional fees being paid in respect of Board Committees and other responsibilities, with fee levels reviewed periodically by the Board.

Policy to pay up to the median based on similar time commitments of Chairman and Non-executives in similar sized companies.
For 2013, there will be no increase to the fees paid to the Chairman and other Non-executive Directors.

Annual Report and Accounts 2012 69 Directors Remuneration Report continued Notes: 1 The EEV operating profit metric includes the impact of persistency on funds under management and other operational variances and the profit from new business metric includes both growth in new business and the control of expenses.
The operating profit and profit from new business targets set by the Committee for 2013 are based on a sliding scale, to progressively reward incremental performance with the bottom end of the scales representing an increase.
2 The team element of the 2013 annual bonus will be assessed by reference to three key elements, being client satisfaction, shareholder experience and stakeholder satisfaction, including regulatory compliance.
Specific objectives include the delivery of strong investment performance, the delivery of appropriate advice to clients, the client experience as measured by surveys and awards, client feedback and complaints, enhancing the range of investment funds and standards of service for St. Jamess Place clients, the successful recruitment and retention of high quality new Partners, successfully controlling and mitigating the material risks that could impact the Group and maintaining the Groups good relations with its shareholders and regulators.
3 The first EPS performance condition is calculated by reference to adjusted consolidated profit after tax on the EEV basis of accounting for both the life and unit trust businesses on a fully diluted per share basis.
The effect of the adjustment to the consolidated after tax figures will be to strip out the post-tax EEV investment variance and any economic assumption change in the final year of the performance period as these factors are not within the control of management and can produce wide variations in reported earnings due to stock market fluctuations.
However, this measure of EPS is still impacted by stock market movements in the prior year due to the impact of any such movements on the unwind of the discount rate in the current year.
The second EPS performance condition is calculated in a similar way to the first EPS condition, save that a further adjustment is made to strip out the impact of the unwind of the discount rate.
This adjustment eliminates any direct impact of stock market volatility and changes in the economic assumptions throughout the whole three-year period of the performance condition.
When assessing the EPS performance conditions for the 2013 PSP awards, the Committee noted that the base point of the 2012 financial year end from where the growth in EPS would be measured represents a material increase over the previous year.
The Committee has also looked at analysts forecasts for the Company and the EPS growth ranges adopted in long-term incentive plans operated by similar businesses.
Overall it considers that the growth range is generally above those set in most other comparable businesses and represents an equivalent level of challenge to those ranges set for previous PSP awards.
4 No Executive Director has a contractual right to receive an annual bonus award.
The satisfaction of the targets set by the Committee is assessed by reference to the Companys internal management information systems and verified by the Committee, which the Committee believes is the most appropriate method, given the internal nature of most of the performance targets.
Financial performance metrics are also verified by the Companys auditors.

This ensures that there is no particular incentive to maximise performance over a particular period.

Remuneration Policy across the Group All employee long-term incentives The Company operates a Save As You Earn Share Option Plan and a Share Incentive Plan under which all UK employees of the Group, including the Executive Directors, are eligible to participate.
Group wide remuneration policy The remuneration policy for the Executive Directors is designed with regard to the policy for employees across the group as a whole and the Committee aims, where appropriate, for there to be a consistent approach applied.
For instance, the suite of benefits in kind is consistent and the vast majority of employees participate in annual bonus plans.
All employees are offered the opportunity to participate in the Groups SAYE Share Option Plan and Share Incentive Plan.
Key differences relate to the fact that there is a higher potential level of reward under performance related elements, in order to ensure that the higher potential remuneration levels at senior executive levels are driven more and will vary more, by the performance of the business.
More of senior level remuneration is deferred than is the case for the workforce as a whole.
Remuneration Scenarios for Executive Directors The charts below show how the proportion of each Executive Directors remuneration package varies at different levels of performance, assuming incentives pay out at one half of the maximum, and at a full payout level.
On this basis the charts show that, at the maximum level of performance under the annual bonus and PSP, the performance linked elements of the package comprise around 70% of total remuneration: David Bellamy, Chief Executive Mid-point payout 30% 10% 24% 36% Maximum 23% 7% 27% 43% 20 40 60 80 100 0 Proportion of Total Pay Basic Salary Benefits & Pension Annual Bonus Performance Shares Annual Report and Accounts 2012 71 Directors Remuneration Report continued Andrew Croft, Chief Financial Officer Ian Gascoigne, Managing Director David Lamb, Managing Director Mid-point payout 31% 10% 25% 34% Maximum 23% 8% 28% 41% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Proportion of Total Pay Basic Salary Benefits & Pension Annual Bonus Performance Shares Service Contracts In summary the contractual provisions of the Executive Director service contracts are as follows: Provision Detailed terms Notice period 12 months by either party Termination payment An express obligation on the executive to mitigate his loss.
Payments can be made on a monthly basis and reduced if an executive is able to secure alternative employment.
Remuneration entitlements No enhanced rights other than those previously approved by shareholders in relation to the Groups share incentive schemes or benefits in addition to in service entitlement.
Change of control As on termination.
When considering the size of any proposed termination payment, the Committee would take into account a number of factors including the health, length of service and performance of the relevant executive, including the duty to mitigate his own loss, with a broad aim to avoid rewarding poor performance while dealing fairly with cases where the departure is due to other reasons, for example illness.

To the extent that pension contributions were capped by legislation, a non-pensionable salary supplement was paid to the Executive Directors for the balance.

ii At the start of the year under report the Committee agreed that the performance of the Executive Directors as a team would be measured against a number of non-financial objectives set out in the business plan.
These objectives included retention of funds under management, client satisfaction, measured through client research carried out by an independent third party during the year, fund management performance compared to peer groups and benchmark indices, complaint levels, the effectiveness of the example portfolios, growth in Partnership numbers, completion of the professional qualifications and other changes to business processes required by the FSAs Retail Distribution Review RDR, Partner productivity, the successful retention of Academy recruits, the adoption of electronic business submission by the Partnership, the maintenance of good investor relations and good relations with the Groups regulators.
The Committee considered how the Executive Directors had performed as a team in relation to all of the above factors during 2012, taking into account the views of the Chairman and the other Non-executive Directors, proposals made by the Chief Executive, and documentary evidence of the performance of the Group against various scales set by the Committee at the start of the year.
Taking into account the Groups performance in 2012, particularly the long-term performance record, client experience, the growth in the size of the Partnership, the satisfactory completion of the professional qualifications, requirements and readiness for RDR, the Committee awarded 35% of salary for the team performance element of the bonus.
iii The Committee retains the discretion to amend each element of the bonus, up or down, within the overall cap of 120% of salary, to take into account other relevant factors such as the Groups performance compared to competitor organisations or, for instance, an exceptional positive or negative event which impacts the Group.
