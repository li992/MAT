EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS BASE SALARIES As set out on page 70 of our 2011 Remuneration report, the new positions of Chief Operating Officer and Managing Director, BGAdvance were created on 15 November 2011.
The base salaries of the individual Executive Directors were not reviewed at that stage, but instead their increased responsibilities were considered as part of the annual salary review process in March 2012.
As indicated in the remuneration Policy section, when awarding base salary increases, the Committee also has regard to base salary increases operated elsewhere in the Group.
The average annual salaryincreases that applied across the Group in April 2012 were 4.6%.

Average Group capital employed is calculated byaveraging the positions atthe start and end of the year.
Group capital employed is the aggregate of total equity excluding commodity financial instruments and associated deferred tax and net borrowings funds in both casesadjusted to exclude the impact of changes in upstream prices and material exchange rates.
c Group HSSE a balanced scorecard measures performance across a range ofleading and laggingindicators.
d Project performance assesses in-year performance onall Board-sanctioned projects, both operated and non-operated, against a range ofindicators, including in-year cost and schedule performance relative to plan.
AIS amounts in excess of 100% of base salary areautomatically deferred into Deferred Bonus Awards over BG Group shares under the DBP.
Shares subject to these awards are not normally released to the individual for three years and are subject to forfeiture in the event of leaving employment other than for reasons such as ill health, agreed retirement or redundancy and in such circumstances early release would normally apply.
Under the DBP, the number of shares actually delivered may be reduced in circumstances where the Company becomes aware of misconduct or performance issues relevant to the bonus award year.
AIS amounts may also be voluntarily deferred into awards over BG Group shares under the VBDP, which operates in a number of BG Groups key locations.
All employees participating in the AIS arrangements including members of the GEC inthese countries are eligible to participate in theVBDP.
Eligible employees may choose to defer any percentage between 1% and 100% oftheir AIS award upto 100% of base salary into aDeferred Share Award over BG Group shares.
Thisaward may be exercised within five years of the date of grant.
The balance of the AIS award up to 100% of base salary ispaid in cash.
For the 2012 incentive year, the Committee followed the two-stage review process outlined in the Policy section.
This involves for each metric areview of performance against targets and, secondly, consideration of the outcomes of the first stage in the context of the underlying performance ofthebusiness, including operational performance, strategy and business development activities, and performance against industry peers.
Forthe2012 incentive year, the AIS business performance outcomes were as follows allmeasures are Group-wide : Weighting Metric % Performance outcome Threshold Target Stretch Commentary | | | Group EPS 38 Between target Normalised EPS above target outcome consistent and stretch with overall Group EPS outcome.

HSSE 15 Below target Performance was assessed at below target inanumber of areas.
Overall assessment Between target and stretch As shown above, for the 2012 financial year the underlying performance of the business relative to the performance metrics set was solid.
Accordingly, an AIS award would normally have been considered at a level between target and stretch.
However, in recognition of the Groups revision of its anticipated production growth for 2013 and the share price fall in the final quarter of the year, theExecutive Directors all concluded thatitwould be inappropriate for them to receive an AIS award this year and asked the Committee that they not be considered for a bonus.
TheCommittee agreed to accept these requests, and accordingly the Executive Directors were not considered for abonus.
