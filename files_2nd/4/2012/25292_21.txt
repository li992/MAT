Intermediate Capital Group plc 74 Report of the Remuneration Committee continued 2 Remuneration for FY12 explained continued Medium Term Incentive Scheme As detailed last year, the MTIS does not form part of ICGs new reward policy, and no further points have been awarded in respect of investments made after 31 March 2010.
Payments continued to accrue up until March 2012 when the scheme closed for employees in respect of points awarded in previous years.
Payments under this scheme are based upon a proportion of cash realisations from our portfolio, subject to the satisfaction of the performance condition.
The payment from the MTIS in respect of FY12 is the maximum of 20%, since the full performance target has been achieved.
This will be been paid to participants in June 2012 and there will be a final termination payment which will be paid to all participants other than managing directors and other senior management in June 2012.
Prior period MTIS accruals of 45.0 million will be released to the Income Statement.
This release will more than offset the cost of running the old and new schemes in parallel over the transition period estimated to be 20.0 million.
Share options in FY12 There are a number of share option schemes currently in existence at the Company.
No new awards have been made under these schemes in the last 2 years but the awards made in previous years are still in existence until they either lapse or are exercised.
The schemes are: The ICG 2001 Approved Executive Share Option Scheme: and The ICG 2001 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme Market value options may only normally be exercised between three and 10 years after the date of grant if performance targets are met.
The Key Executive Retention Share Plan KERSP.
Nil cost options could be granted to key executives under the KERSP up to an amount equal to 15% of the value of the MTIS pool.
The options were subject to achievement of a performance condition measured from the date of grant to the vesting date.
The performance conditions for the Approved ESOS and the KERSP were growth in core income per share and growth in earnings per share respectively.
The Committee considers that performance conditions attaching to the options granted were appropriate.
No value is delivered to participants if performance is below threshold performance.

Carried interest on third party funds The Company has established for its executives, including the managing directors, carried interest arrangements under which between 56% and 77% of the carried interest negotiated by the Company in respect of managed funds raised since 21 January 1998 is available for allocation to its executives.
Although these arrangements are not a long term incentive scheme as the costs of these arrangements are borne by the investors in such funds the Company sought, and obtained, approval from its shareholders for such arrangements at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 21 January 1998.
Reconfirmation of the approval of the carried interest arrangements was obtained from shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 27 May 2003.
It is not possible to put a monetary value on these interests, as they are dependent upon the performance of the relevant funds in the future.
No amounts will be payable until the third party investors in the funds have had all their capital returned, plus a minimum return.
