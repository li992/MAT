Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group 98 99 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 diREcTORs REMunERATiOn REPORT Statement by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee As chairman of the Groups Remuneration committee, i am pleased to introduce the directors Remuneration Report for 2012 and to provide context around the key reward decisions taken in respect of the past year and our future plans.
The ongoing economic challenges currently encountered in our industry and across all aspects of life naturally lead to continuing attention being placed on executive remuneration.
As a committee we have a strong belief in aligning the pay delivered to our executives with the successful performance of the business and, through this, the return of value to our shareholders as set out in our 2011 strategic Review.
To this end, we have continued to develop our performance management process, with the close participation of our Risk team, to embed meaningful challenging but responsible performance measures across our reward structure, which reflect Group and divisional achievement in addition to personal contribution.
in order to further align reward to the longer-term, sustainable success of the business we plan to introduce changes to our annual incentive scheme from 2014 to better connect the interests of colleagues with shareholders and to ensure a fair distribution between all stakeholders of the benefits which result from the Group meeting its performance targets.
in setting our reward policy we endeavour to keep the structure as simple as possible and to clearly communicate the aims of the policy to our colleagues and our shareholders.
We believe that transparency around our policy and the basis for our performance measures is critical to rebuilding trust with our employees and our numerous stakeholders.
This has been evident in the annual disclosures we make to explain our policy approach to remuneration and the actions we undertake to implement this.
We support the new proposals made by the department for Business, innovation and skills Bis to codify and standardise additional reporting expectations in this area.
We are also heartened to note that many elements of the draft regulations published to date are already incorporated in our annual reporting.
central to the Bis proposals is the active engagement of shareholders to approve the remuneration policy applied by the company.
We maintain an open and transparent exchange of information and feedback with our shareholders and acknowledge the weight of their judgment in setting our policies.
in line with the Bis proposals, we have therefore included dedicated commentary on these interactions and the outcome of the shareholder vote on our reward policy in the body of the Report.
The introduction of a binding shareholder vote on policy will promote consistency by requiring strict adherence to policy for a three-year period from approval, permitting exception only by agreement through a further shareholder vote.
Whilst, in certain individual circumstances this may require us to revert directly to shareholders within the three year period, the commitment to an approved policy will promote upfront transparency with shareholders and will ensure rigour is embedded into policy design and adherence, firmly underpinning the responsibility and accountability that we as a committee have to fulfil.
With respect to the proposed reporting of supplementary data including comparative tables to show the movement of Group chief Executive pay against TsR, or the relative growth in the total cost of pay against Group profit and dividend performance we have taken the decision not to incorporate the proposals of these draft regulations in advance of enactment.
Whilst the inclusion of illustrative examples of these tables may add value by enabling a year-on-year comparison to be drawn in next years report, as consultations on the nature and scope of these new disclosures and graphs are still ongoing, there remains a possibility that these may change significantly over the course of the year.
The package delivered to our Executive directors and our Group Executive committee remains broadly consistent with that provided in previous years.
The composition of the package is approximately as follows: Long-term incentive Based on a combination of performance targets comprising Paid in shares after 24% economic profit, absolute total shareholder return and strategic three years financial objectives shown on an expected value basis Short-term incentive Based on financial measures and on a balanced scorecard o f Deferred into shares 33% non-financial measures based on actual award value until at least March 2015, subject to malus Salary Based on role, market competitiveness, and performance Paid in cash 33% based on actual value Pension and benefits Based on role and market competitiveness based on actual Paid into pension 10% value or taken as cash comparable numbers for the Group chief Executive are: long-term incentive 23 per cent, short-term incentive 30 per cent, salary 30 per cent and pension and benefits 17 per cent.
Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group Board of Directors 78 98 99 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Group Executive Committee 80 Directors report 82 Corporate governance report 86 Directors remuneration report 98 Other remuneration disclosures 114 1 18 115 203 355 The committee firmly believes that fixed pay should be positioned competitively but conservatively against the market and that the variable pay offered to our executives should be directly aligned to the delivery of value to our shareholders.
Although shareholder return and operational effectiveness have been very positive over the course of the year, we feel it is appropriate that the fixed pay elements for our directors should remain unchanged for a further 12 months in recognition of the continuing economic climate and the need to deliver further, sustained economic growth to our shareholders.
in addition, bonus awards in respect of the 2012 year have been determined conservatively against the robust performance measures set.
The bonus awards will be deferred into shares for varying periods according to the seniority or role of the individual see page 103 for further information with attached malus provisions to enable the adjustment of awards where such awards are subsequently considered by the committee not to reflect appropriately the performance in the period to which they relate.
We have demonstrated through the adjustment of bonus payments made in respect of previous years that we are comfortable executing the malus provisions for these awards in situations where it is appropriate to do so.
Across the business as a whole, the Remuneration committee feels it is important to recognise the contribution of our colleagues in achieving success against our strategic goals and to enable them to share in that success through the payment of bonuses.
The assessment of the value of bonus pool to be made available has been undertaken in consideration of our relative, risk-adjusted performance for the year and with a focus on ensuring that the reward is weighted towards our more junior staff.
The total bonus pool of 365 million in 2012, which reflects the final statutory results for the Group, is down 3 per cent on 2011 and represents 7 per cent of the pre-bonus management profit before tax compared to 12.5 per cent in the prior year.
The average value of bonus per employee is similar to the prior year at 3,900. in my previous statements i have highlighted the importance of our long-Term incentive Plan in aligning our reward strategy to the performance of the business.
Through the application of carefully considered, stretching target measures, we are able to ensure that awards are forfeited or restricted where performance does not meet the desired level.
We also require executives to retain the net shares ie.
after the deduction of tax awarded under the lTiP for a minimum period following receipt.
This directly connects the financial reward for the executive and senior management team with the growth and prosperity of the company and motivates them to demonstrate appropriate behaviours across all areas of the business.
shareholders will also note that revised shareholding guidelines have been introduced from 2012 as detailed on page 103 which we are considering extending to a broader population in the future.
Our commitment to managing executive reward through the strict application of challenging lTiP performance measures is demonstrated through the confirmation that, as key targets for the 2010 lTiP have not been met, awards made under this plan will not vest.
Moreover, for the anticipated 2013 lTiP awards we have once again set challenging targets for delivery of core financial measures Economic Profit and Absolute Total shareholder Return alongside operational measures aligned to the strategic business plan, all underpinned by a clear consideration of the risk impact of our activities.
in general, the committee retains discretion over all remuneration plans and consideration is given to the exercise of such discretion both at the point of award and subsequently when assessing performance under the lTiP.
As a committee we are keen to continually review our policy approach and to explore ways in which we may strengthen and simplify the alignment of the Groups remuneration package with the companys business performance and relative value to shareholders.
Over recent years we have introduced to our bonus scheme a mandatory deferral into shares for awards made to our Executive directors and for any awards in excess of a specific threshold made to other staff.
As noted above, our aim is that from 2014 we will implement a restructure of our package which will more effectively recognise the connection between the impact of short-term and long-term goals in driving forward our business and will also further facilitate the adjustment of awards for malus.
The committee has striven to ensure that the remuneration policies and practices detailed in this Report are appropriate to supporting the delivery of the companys current and future strategy.
This Report will be tabled for shareholder approval at the AGM, which i hope you will support.
Anthony Watson CBe chairman, Remuneration committee This is a report made by the Board of lloyds Banking Group plc, on the recommendation of the Remuneration committee.
it covers the current and proposed components of the remuneration policy and details the remuneration for directors during 2012.
The Group has complied throughout the period with the requirements of the uK corporate Governance code previously known as the combined code in relation to directors remuneration.
in addition, the report has been prepared in accordance with the large and Medium sized companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008.
The committee recognises the attention which Bank remuneration receives and is very aware both of the importance of getting the right balance between the linkage of rewards to performance and the competitive process: recruiting, retaining and motivating staff as well as a more widely perceived concept of fairness for all involved.
Overview Business review Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group 100 101 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 diREcTORs REMunERATiOn REPORT Policy Report Directors remuneration policy The Groups remuneration policy continues to support our business values and strategy, based on building long-term relationships with our customers and employees and managing the financial consequences of our business decisions across the entire economic cycle.
Our policy is intended to ensure that our remuneration proposition is both cost effective and enables us to attract and retain Executive directors and senior management of the highest calibre, motivating them to perform to the highest standards.
Our objective is to align individual reward with the Groups performance, the interests of its shareholders, and a prudent approach to risk management.
in this way we balance the requirements of our various stakeholders: our customers, shareholders, employees, and regulators.
This approach is in line with the Association of British insurers best practice code on remuneration and the FsA Remuneration code of Practice, as the policy seeks to reward long-term value creation whilst not encouraging excessive risk taking.
Our overall policy objective is met by a focus on the particular aspects detailed below.
Policy objective How achieved Building long-term We build relationships with our customers and people.
Working for lloyds Banking Group is about more than pay.
relationships Our relationship with our people means that we want to pay them fairly and competitively, but our pay is positioned conservatively against the market and we do not seek to align with the highest payers in the sector.
in setting pay for Executive directors and senior managers, we take account of relative pay positioning and target levels of variable remuneration opportunity for all levels of employees in the Group.
Our incentive measures are not just financial.
Our Balanced scorecards, which are incorporated into the performance objectives of all of our senior executives for the year, include objectives that cover effective risk management, lending to corporates including sMEs and retail customers, performance against targets that measure how satisfied our customers are with our service and the extent to which our employees feel engaged with and committed to working for lloyds Banking Group.
Managing the financial Economic profit is a key measure by which we manage our business.
This measure takes into account the level of consequences of our capital required to generate profits as well as the risks taken.
The same level of profit generated at lower risk results business through the in higher economic profit.
Economic profit also measures risk based on an assessment of how the business will economic cycle perform through the economic cycle and is a key measure for short term incentives.
For example, in good times, when default rates on loans are low, we adjust the economic profit measure downwards based on a higher average expected default experience over the economic cycle.
This encourages us to avoid business and funding strategies that are only profitable during boom times but turn bad in a recession.
Economic profit plays a prominent role in our incentive plans for executives, with its inclusion in both the annual and lTiP performance measures.
Aligning individual Our executives annual incentives are based on stretching performance objectives and targets in the Group rewards with Group Balanced scorecard.
This Balanced scorecard is derived from the Medium Term Plan which defines the financial and performance and non-financial targets within our agreed risk appetite over a three year period.
shareholders Any annual bonus for Executive directors is deferred into shares and released over time, helping to increase alignment with shareholders.
These deferrals are subject to malus in the event of unsustainable performance.
Executives are also aligned with shareholders through the lTiP, which pays out in shares based on performance against Group financial targets over a three year period.
in addition to purely financial metrics of Economic Profit and Total shareholder Return, the performance conditions for the 2013 lTiP will comprise measures linked to the strategic Review that reflect the wider Group objectives.
These measures are sME lending, customer satisfaction, total costs at the end of 2015 and non-core assets excluding uK Retail at the end of 2015.
We operate tough contract provisions relative to market practice, whereby no executive has an entitlement to more than 12 months notice not taking into account recruitment provisions, pay in lieu of notice is limited to basic salary, is paid monthly over 12 months and is mitigated if the executive gets another job.
This approach avoids the risk of payment for failure.
A prudent approach We also have non-financial measures of performance against risk objectives in both the annual and long-term to risk management incentive plans for executives.
For the 2012 annual incentive plan we continue to align the award to long-term prudent risk management by deferring 100 per cent of the award for Executive directors, which is subject to malus.
Executive directors are also required to retain any shares vesting from lTiP awards from 2010 onwards for a further 2 years, after allowing for tax and national insurance requirements.
For other employees, the immediate cash bonus award is limited to 2,000 with a percentage of larger bonuses being subject to deferral and malus.
if the performance is unsustainable during the deferral period some or all of the award may be forfeited.
We have a robust governance framework with an independent Remuneration committee reviewing all compensation decisions for senior executives.
This approach to governance and review is cascaded through the organisation.
We also ensure that all control function employees are assessed and their remuneration determined jointly by the relevant business director and the control function director.
The remuneration of senior risk and compliance officers is also reviewed by the Remuneration committee.
Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group Board of Directors 78 100 101 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Group Executive Committee 80 Directors report 82 Corporate governance report 86 Directors remuneration report 98 Other remuneration disclosures 114 1 18 115 203 355 Policy objective How achieved cost effective packages We aim to ensure that the totality of remuneration for Executive directors is competitive against our benchmark to attract and retain groups.
These groups are other major uK banks and the top 20 companies in the FTsE 100, reflecting practices in executives large uK companies across all sectors.
We aim to be competitively but conservatively positioned against the market.
We select incentive plan targets that are directly linked to the business strategy and priorities, ensuring alignment with company performance, targets that are meaningful to executives and incentive packages that are both valued by executives and cost effective.
The remuneration package offered to our Executive directors and other senior managers within the business is fundamentally based on the same components as are provided to other employees, including the eligibility to participate in all-employee share plans.
However, the ratio of fixed to variable income is adjusted such that more than half of total reward for this group is put at risk by linking earnings through delivery of the annual incentive plan and lTiP to challenging company, individual and share price performance.
This weighting towards variable pay is intended to promote behaviours focused on the success of the business.
Moreover, the assessment of performance against target measures is moderated by the Group Risk function to ensure that the performance is sustainable in the long term and does not merely produce a positive short-term result.
The committee places great weight on this assessment and holds the Executive directors to a more stringent standard in this regard.
When setting the policy for directors remuneration, the committee seeks confirmation from the companys shareholders that its approach is acceptable and over the course of 2012 we have entered into frequent consultation with shareholders and representative bodies who control a significant majority of the Group's share base and all views are taken into consideration in relation to remuneration policy and implementation.
We do not directly consult with employees as part of the process of reviewing executive pay, however we are kept informed on general remuneration feedback across the Group in addition to receiving updates on employee engagement surveys and take these into account.
in all executive remuneration discussions the committee considers the approach towards establishing pay levels elsewhere in the Group.
When setting remuneration levels for Executive directors, the committee refers to benchmark data from comparable organisations across the FTsE and industry sector to ensure that remuneration is positioned competitively but conservatively against the market.
Summary Following extensive consultation with shareholders, the Remuneration committee is proposing a package for Executive directors for 2013 that is closely based on the structure and principles applied in previous years as follows: element Level design for 2013 Key purpose Base salary Base pay should be set relative to FTsE 20 and banking sector competitors To provide the basis for a competitive package There were again no increases to base salaries for Executive directors Pension To enable executives to build long-term defined contribution pension provision for new entrants retirement savings Retention Annual incentive 200 per cent of salary maximum 225 per cent for the Group chief Executive Alignment with Group performance Based on Group financial targets relating to Profit Before Tax Motivation of executives and Economic Profit as well as Balanced scorecard measures Pay for performance covering divisional financial targets, customers e. g. sME Alignment with sound risk management lending, people, risk and building the business subject to deferral and malus in line with FsA requirements long-term Annual awards of up to 300 per cent of salary for the Group incentive plan chief Executive and Executive directors.
Vesting based on Motivation and retention of executives financial measures comprising Absolute Total shareholder Alignment with sound risk management Return, Economic Profit and strategic financial objectives.
Alignment with long-term shareholder interests details of the performance conditions are provided below.
Overview Business review Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group 102 103 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 diREcTORs REMunERATiOn REPORT Base salary Base salaries are reviewed annually, taking into account individual performance and market information which is provided by Towers Watson and supplemented with information from deloitte llP and normally adjusted from 1 January of the relevant year.
The remuneration committee confirmed during the 2012 review that the FTsE remains the most appropriate comparator group to use to benchmark overall competitiveness of the remuneration package whilst taking particular account of the remuneration practice of our direct competitors, namely the major uK banks.
Annual incentive plan The annual incentive scheme for Executive directors is designed to reflect specific goals linked to the successful performance of the business.
incentive awards for Executive directors are based upon individual contribution and overall corporate results.
incentive opportunity is driven equally by i corporate performance based on profit before tax and economic profit, and ii divisional achievement and individual performance.
individual targets relevant to improving overall business performance are contained in a Balanced scorecard and are grouped under the following headings: Financial Building the Business customer service Risk People development These targets apply differently for the Executive directors, reflecting differing strategic priorities.
The non-financial measures include key performance indicators relating to risk management, sME lending, process efficiency, service quality and employee engagement.
The remuneration committee believes that the structure of the incentive in particular the use of risk-adjusted and non-financial measures has been highly successful in promoting a long-term focus within the senior management team.
The maximum annual incentive opportunity is 200 per cent 225 per cent for the Group chief Executive of base salary for the achievement of exceptional performance targets.
Deferral consistent with the aim of ensuring that short-term financial results are only rewarded if they promote sustainable growth, the 2012 annual incentive is subject to deferral in shares until at least 2015.
This deferred amount is subject to malus if the performance that generated the incentive is found to be unsustainable.
in 2012 the FsA has reviewed the Groups Risk-adjusted Performance assessment process and advised that it is considered a sound framework.
The committee reserves the right to exercise its discretion in reducing any payment that otherwise would have been earned, if they deem this appropriate.
in this respect, the committee has recommended to the Board that it should exercise its discretion to adjust the value of certain 2010 bonus awards, on a basis equivalent to that applied in the previous year.
The key achievements of the Group are set out in the Group chief Executives review on pages 14 to 17 of this annual report.
The calculation of the annual incentive plan outcomes for Executive directors, based on the achievement of performance against targets in respect of 2012, has been vigorously discussed by the Remuneration committee.
The bonuses awarded are shown in the table below: name A Horta-Osrio M G Culmer Maximum Opportunity 225% 200% % awarded for 2012 140% 97% Bonus awarded for 2012 1,485,000 700,000 The award for Mr A Horta-Osrio will be delivered in the form of a conditional share award.
This will be subject to the normal performance adjustment policy and will only vest if a share price of 73.6p has been reached for a given period of time or the Government has sold at least 33 per cent of its shareholding at prices above 61p.
This award will not be released before the fifth anniversary of award and will be forfeited if neither of the conditions has been met by that date.
The Board believes that these conditions are in the interests of all shareholders and support our common aim of repaying the taxpayer.
The award for Mr M G culmer reflects his contribution for 2012 as a whole and is not based on strict time apportionment.
Long-term incentive award The current lTiP rules allow for awards to be made of up to 400 per cent of base salary.
under normal circumstances, awards can be made of up to 300 per cent of salary with the additional 100 per cent available for circumstances that the Remuneration committee deems to be exceptional.
Awards in 2013 have been set at 300 per cent for the Group chief Executive and 275 per cent for Executive directors and the Group Executive committee.

The committee believes that the performance measures for the 2013 lTiP award for the Executive committee should be Economic Profit, Absolute Total shareholder Return and strategic non-financial measures.
These measures capture risk management, profit growth and shareholder experience and align shareholder experience and management reward.
Measure Basis Metric Weighting Economic Profit Payout range set relative to 2015 targets Threshold: 1,254 million 35% Maximum: 1,881 million Absolute TsR Growth in share price including dividends Threshold: 8% per annum 30% Maximum: 16% per annum customer satisfaction FsA reportable Payout range set relative to 2015 targets Threshold: 1.05 10% complaints per 1,000 customers over 3 years Maximum: 0.95 Total costs Payout range set relative to 2015 targets Threshold: 9,323 million 10% Maximum: 8,973 million non-core assets at end of 2015 Payout range set relative to 2015 targets Threshold: 37 billion 10% excluding uK Retail Maximum: 28 billion sME lending Payout range set relative to performance Threshold: at market 5% against market lending to sMEs over 3 year Maximum: 4% period to 2015 Pension Executive directors may participate in the Groups defined contribution scheme under which their pension entitlement will be based upon both employer and employee contributions.
company contributions are 25 per cent of salary, with the exception of Antnio Horta-Osrio who is eligible for 50 per cent of reference salary, including his flexible benefit allowance.
These can be taken as cash or pension contributions, or a mixture of each.
Other share plans The Executive directors are also eligible to participate in the Groups sharesave and share incentive plans.
These are all-employee share plans.
Shareholding guidelines Executive directors are required to build up a holding in lloyds Banking Group shares of value equal to 1.5 times gross salary 2 times gross salary for the Group chief Executive and are expected to achieve these targets within 3 years from the later of 1 January 2012 and their date of joining the Board.
They are required to retain any shares vesting from lTiP awards from 2010 onwards for a further two years post vesting.
The Group chief Executive is making significant progress in reaching this target.
The Group shareholding requirements policy in respect of Executive directors was restated in May 2012 and was extended to cover all members of the Group Executive committee at 1 times gross salary.
Chairmans remuneration The chairmans remuneration comprises salary and benefits.
He does not participate in the annual bonus and long-term incentive arrangements, nor is he entitled to pension benefits.
The chairmans fee was last reviewed in 2012 and is currently 700,000 per annum.
independent non-executive Directors fees The fees of the independent non-Executive directors are agreed by the Board within a total amount determined by the shareholders.
non-Executive directors may also receive fees, agreed by the Board, for membership of Board committees.
The fees are designed to recognise the various responsibilities of a non-Executive directors role and to attract individuals with relevant skills, knowledge and experience.
The fees are neither performance related nor pensionable and are comparable with those paid by other companies.
The annual fees were reviewed in 2012 and remain unchanged as listed below.
non-Executive director base fee 65,000 deputy chairman 100,000 senior independent director 60,000 Audit committee chairmanship 50,000 Audit committee Membership 20,000 Remuneration committee chairmanship 30,000 Remuneration committee Membership 15,000 Risk committee chairmanship 40,000 Risk committee Membership 15,000 nomination & Governance committee Membership 5,000 Overview Business review Governance Risk management Financial statements Other information Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group 104 105 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 diREcTORs REMunERATiOn REPORT in the case of the nomination & Governance committee, membership currently comprises the deputy chairman, senior independent director and chairs of the Board committees the fees for which include membership of the nomination & Governance committee and one other independent non-Executive director.
Only this director receives an attendance fee, which is 5,000 per annum.
independent non-Executive directors who serve on the Boards of subsidiary companies may also receive fees from the subsidiaries.
Service agreements The Groups policy is for Executive directors to have service agreements with notice periods of no more than one year.
All current Executive directors are entitled to receive 12 months notice from the Group, but would be required to give at least six months notice.
Any entitlements under the pension scheme or equity plans will be in accordance with the scheme rules on leaving.

Termination it is the Groups policy that where compensation on early termination is due, it should be paid on a phased basis, mitigated in the event that alternative employment is secured.
Where it is appropriate to make a bonus payment to the individual, this should relate to the period of actual service, rather than the full notice period, will be determined on the basis of performance as for all continuing employees and will remain subject to malus.
in the event of redundancy, the individual may receive a payment in line with statutory entitlements at that time.
Helen Weir left the company in March 2012 under a redundancy agreement entered into on 7 April 2011. in addition to the contractual salary payments made during the 12-month notice period, she received a payment of 4,200 in respect of her statutory redundancy entitlement.
no further non-contractual payments were made in respect of the cessation of employment, in keeping with our policy for handling terminations.
external appointments The Group recognises that Executive directors may be invited to become non-Executive directors of other companies and that these appointments may broaden their knowledge and experience, to the benefit of the Group.
Fees are normally retained by the individual directors as the post entails personal responsibility.
Executive directors are generally allowed to accept one non-Executive directorship.

This ensures that our policy is robustly applied and risk is managed appropriately.
The overarching purpose of the Remuneration committee is to consider, agree and recommend to the board an overall remuneration policy and philosophy for the Group that is defined by, supports and is closely aligned to its long-term business strategy, business objectives, risk appetite and values and recognises the interests of relevant stakeholders.
The Group has a conservative business model characterised by a risk culture founded on prudence and accountability.
The remuneration policy and philosophy covers the whole Group, but the committee pays particular attention to the top management population, including the highest paid employees in each division, those colleagues who perform significant influence functions for the Group and those who could have a material impact on the Groups risk profile.
The committees role is to ensure that these colleagues are provided with appropriate incentives and reward to encourage them to enhance the performance of the Group and that they are recognised for their individual contribution to the success of the organisation, whilst ensuring that there is no reward for excessive risk taking.
The committee works closely with the Risk committee in ensuring the bonus pool is moderated.
The two committees meet together every year to determine whether the proposed bonus pool and performance assessments adequately reflected the risk appetite and framework of the Group: whether it took account of current and future risks: and whether any further adjustment is required or merited.
We are also determined to ensure that the aggregate of the variable remuneration for all our colleagues is appropriate and balanced with the interests of shareholders and all other stakeholders.
The committee determines the pensions policy for the Group and advises on other major changes to employee benefits schemes.
it also agrees the policy for authorising claims for expenses from the Group chief Executive and the chairman.
it has delegated power for settling remuneration for the chairman, the Group Executive directors, the company secretary and any group employee whose salary and annual bonus exceeds a specified amount, currently 750,000.
To ensure compliance with the FsA code of Practice, the committee approves remuneration for code staff and that of senior risk and compliance officers.
The committee monitors the application of the authority delegated to the Group chief Executive who in turn delegates to the Group Executive committee, the Executive compensation committee and the divisional Remuneration committees, to ensure that policies and principles are being fairly and consistently applied.
The committee liaises closely with the Risk committee and the Groups risk function in relation to risk-adjusted performance measures, including consideration of both current and future risk.
Together the management of remuneration and risk form an integral part of the Boards determination of Group corporate strategy.
All the independent non-Executive directors are invited to attend meetings and have the opportunity to comment on proposals and have their views taken into account before the committees decisions are implemented.
The committees terms of reference are available from the company secretary and are displayed on the Groups website, www.
These terms were last updated in April 2012 to ensure continued compliance with the FsA code.
The members of the committee during 2012 were as follows: Anthony Watson chairman sir Winfried Bischoff carolyn Fairbairn from 1 June 2012 sir Julian Horn-smith until 17 May 2012 lord leitch until 29 February 2012 david Roberts also chairman of the Risk committee Tim Ryan sara Weller from 1 February 2012 during 2012, the committee met 10 times and considered the following principal matters: Review of remuneration arrangements for senior executives determination of the appropriate remuneration packages for a number of senior new hires determination of bonus pools based on Group performance and adjustment for risk Performance conditions for the long-Term incentive Plan Bonus and salary awards for Executive directors and key senior managers Approval of remuneration and terms of service that fall within the committees terms of reference, including new appointments Feedback from the Remuneration committee chairman on his meetings with the FsA and shareholders We thank all committee members for their commitment during the last year and attendance at meetings.
The committee appoints independent consultants to provide advice on specific matters according to their particular expertise.
during the year, deloitte llP advised the committee.
deloitte has voluntarily signed up to the Remuneration consultants code of conduct and are judged by the committee to be independent.
deloittes fees for 2012 for advising the committee amounted to 336,000. during 2012, deloitte provided information on behalf of the committee for the testing of TsR performance conditions for the Groups long-term incentive plans calculated by reference to both dividends and growth in share price.

Directors pensions audited The Executive directors are members of the lloyds Banking Group defined contribution pension scheme.
in previous years the Group also operated a defined benefit pension scheme, however there are now no directors accruing further pensionable service on a defined benefit basis.
Benefits from a registered pension scheme are subject to the lifetime Allowance, currently 1.5 million, which is equivalent to an annual pension of 75,000.
Any benefit in excess of this amount will incur a tax charge for the individual.
The Group has agreed that if an Executive director has benefits in excess of the lifetime Allowance he may cease to accrue benefits in the scheme and receive a salary supplement as an alternative.
This will not cost the Group more than the current arrangements.
The Group will not compensate any individual in respect of any tax liability arising from the provision of pension.
