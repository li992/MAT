This year, there is an overview at the start of the report itself.
However, I would like to highlight the following points in particular.
The targets for 2013 are stretching and will require a strong corporate Executive Director remuneration at IHG has evolved during 2012: performance to achieve similar levels of total remuneration.
the measures under the Annual Bonus Plan ABP have been changed for Executive Directors in 2013.
To distinguish it from Luke Mayhew the previous measures, we refer to it as the Annual Performance Plan APP.
Although not a radical change, the APP does align Chairman of the Remuneration Committee annual incentives more closely to the key elements of our 18 February 2013 strategic priorities of Brands, People and Delivery: and the 2010 12 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, which will vest Directors Remuneration Report glossary of terms in 2013, is the last LTIP using the previous measures.

Audited information on Directors emoluments Nomination Committee Report and Directors Remuneration Report 59 Governance: Directors Remuneration Report continued Overview Report structure In June 2012, the UK Government Department for Business, Innovation & Skills BIS published draft regulations setting out the proposed content of a new two-part Directors Remuneration Report to consist of: a forward-looking remuneration policy report that sets out the parameters for directors pay, on which shareholders will have a binding vote: and an implementation report that explains how the agreed policy has been implemented and the resulting payments, on which shareholders will have an advisory vote.
Although the new regulations do not apply to IHGs Directors Remuneration Report until 2013, we have reflected as much as is practical of the direction and spirit of the draft BIS regulations, including the proposed structure, addressing firstly remuneration policy for 2013, and then the 2012 outcomes.
IHG, and a number of other FTSE 100 companies, worked with the Financial Reporting Councils Financial Reporting Lab in making recommendations on the composition of the single figure disclosure that will be required under the new regulations.
This report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and has been approved by the Board.
It complies with the Companies Act 2006 and related regulations.
It will be put to shareholders for approval at the 2013 Annual General Meeting AGM.

Policy: remuneration policy for 2013 A Key remuneration principles IHGs executive remuneration principles are designed to drive the delivery of strategic objectives by: attracting and retaining high-quality executives in an environment where compensation is based on global market practice: aligning rewards for executives with the achievement of business performance targets, strategic objectives and returns to shareholders: supporting equitable treatment between members of the same executive team: and facilitating global assignments and relocations.
IHGs remuneration structure for senior executives places a strong emphasis on performance-related reward.
The Committee believes that it is important to reward management, including the Executive Directors, for targets achieved, provided those targets are stretching.
B Link with strategy Our strategy summarised below is the driver of our reward structure, and is further explained on pages 11 to 17 of this Annual Report.
The current performance measures used in IHGs incentive plans are aligned with our strategic priorities, which will enable us to achieve our Vision of becoming one of the great companies in the world by creating Great Hotels Guests Love.

As a result of this review, the APP is being launched with effect from 2013.
It will apply to the Executive Directors, the Executive Committee and other senior executives from 2013, and roll-out to the rest of our eligible corporate employees is planned for 2014.
The APP is being introduced in the context of the broader growth agenda and more closely aligns the annual incentive with our strategic priorities of Brands, People and Delivery.
The APP will require the achievement of challenging goals in 2013 before the target award is payable.
The measures for 2013 are focussed on the following key strategic priorities: Performance Payment measures structure Brands: Guest satisfaction as measured by the Heartbeat score year-on-year improvement: 50% shares 20% Brands deferred for People: Employee engagement score year-on-year three years improvement: and APP 10% People Delivery: EBIT achievement against target.

APP targets for 2013 Achievement of target performance results in an award of 115% of salary and the maximum annual award an Executive Director can receive in any one year is 200% of salary.
A combination of global and regional targets will be used.
Executive Directors with global roles will have global measures.
Kirk Kinsell will have partly regional measures, reflecting his regional role as President, The Americas.

Payment is determined on a straight-line basis between Threshold and Target, and Target and Maximum.
Threshold award is subject to a global EBIT affordability gate such that: if global EBIT is below 85% of target, no award is made: and if global EBIT is between 85% and 90% of target, half of any award relating to the Brands and or People measures is made.
The Committee has the ability to exercise certain specified discretion over the level of awards made under the 2013 APP.
Directors Remuneration Report 67 Governance: Directors Remuneration Report continued G Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP allows Executive Directors and other eligible executives to receive share awards, subject to the achievement of performance targets set by the Committee, measured over a three-year period.
Awards are made annually and, other than in exceptional circumstances, will not exceed three times annual salary for Executive Directors.
The performance measures for the 2013 15 cycle are: cumulative annual growth in net rooms: Performance Payment cumulative annual like-for-like RevPAR growth: and measures structure IHGs TSR relative to the DJGH index.

measure, it provides focus on ensuring a balance between the quality of IHG hotels and the speed at which IHG grows.
In order to generate higher returns for our shareholders, we need to increase revenue share, improve operating efficiency and grow margins through increasing the number of rooms we have available to sell, as well as generating more RevPAR for those rooms.
By focussing on both net rooms growth and RevPAR growth, we are rewarding the balanced approach to growth that will support the long-term increase in shareholder value.

Vesting for points between Threshold and Maximum will be calculated on a straight-line basis.
In setting the TSR performance target, the Committee has taken into account a range of factors, including IHGs strategic plans, historical performance of the industry and FTSE 100 market practice.
After testing the performance targets set at grant, the Committee will review the vesting outcomes of the net rooms and RevPAR measures against an assessment of earnings and quality of Company financial performance over the period.
The Committee may reduce the number of shares which vest if they determine such an adjustment is appropriate.
IHGs performance and vesting outcomes will be fully disclosed and explained in the relevant Directors Remuneration Report.
There is no re-testing of performance targets under the LTIP, and awards lapse if they are not met.
68 IHG Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 GROUP FINANCIAL PARENT COMPANY OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION H Pensions IHG operates the following pension arrangements in which the Executive Directors participate: for UK executives, the executive section of the IC Plan, which has a DB section and a DC section the UK DB Plan and the UK DC Plan respectively : for UK executives, ICETUS: this is an unfunded arrangement, but with appropriate security: for US executives, the DC US 401 k Plan and the DC US Deferred Compensation Plan: and for executives outside the UK and US, the InterContinental Hotels Group International Savings and Retirement Plan, or other local plans.
As an alternative to the pension arrangements, a cash allowance may be taken in lieu by UK executives.
Following an extensive UK pension review and subsequent consultations with affected employees, it was announced on 29 September 2011 that the UK DB Plan would close to future accrual for existing members with effect from 1 July 2013.
The UK DB Plan is already closed to new entrants.
A cap on pensionable salary increases of RPI plus 2.5% per annum became effective on 1 October 2011.
As part of the consultation with employees and the plan trustees about these changes, it was agreed that the Enhanced Early Retirement Facility EERF would be retained.
This provides an option for plan members, with the Companys agreement, to retire within five years of normal retirement age on accrued benefits without reduction.
The level of plan funding provides for this facility.
The Committee considered that the reduction in risk and expense achieved by the closing of the UK DB Plan justified the cost of retaining this facility for existing active members.
The Executive Directors participate as follows: Richard Solomons participates in the UK DB Plan and the ICETUS on the same basis as other senior UK-based executives: Tracy Robbins participated in the executive UK DC Plan on the same basis as other senior UK-based executives until March 2012: from April 2012 she received a cash allowance in lieu of pension benefits: Tom Singer does not participate in any pension plan and receives a cash allowance in lieu of pension benefits: and Kirk Kinsell participates in the DC US 401 k Plan and the DC US Deferred Compensation Plan.
Further details on the Executive Directors pension arrangements are shown on pages 75 and 76.
I Executive share options From 2006, executive share options have not formed part of the Companys remuneration structure.
Details of prior share option grants are given on page 78.
J Clawback in incentive plans For awards made from January 2012, the ABP, APP and LTIP allow the Committee discretion to claw back unvested share awards in the following circumstances: misconduct that causes significant damage or potential damage to IHGs prospects, finances or brand reputation: and or actions that lead to material misstatement or restatement of accounts.
This feature helps ensure alignment between executive rewards and shareholder returns.

Other matters A Share capital Return of share capital Background In October 2012, the Company paid a special dividend to its shareholders.
This was accompanied by a share consolidation in order to maintain comparability as far as possible of the share price before and after the payment of the special dividend.
In addition, the Company commenced a share buyback programme in November 2012.
Implications for outstanding LTIP awards LTIP award holders were not entitled to receive the special dividend.
The effect of the share consolidation was broadly to preserve the value of their awards subject to normal market fluctuations, so no adjustment was necessary to the number of shares to which awards related.
With regard to the LTIP performance targets, consideration was given by the Committee as to whether awards needed to be adjusted in relation to the EPS measure for the 2010 12 LTIP cycle, so that it remained economically equivalent to the target before the share consolidation took place.
It was concluded that the maximum award target would have been exceeded by a significant margin even taking such adjustment into account and therefore no adjustment to the performance targets was required.
No adjustment was required to the TSR targets under the 2010 12, 2011 13 and 2012 14 LTIP cycles because the special dividend and share consolidation did not result in IHGs TSR being impacted excluding any market fluctuations.
No adjustment was required to the net rooms or RevPAR targets as these did not relate to the share capital of the Company.
Implications for outstanding ABP deferred share awards ABP award holders, other than Executive Directors and Executive Committee members, hold conditional awards and are not eligible to receive dividends on their awards prior to vesting.
They were similarly not entitled to receive the special dividend.
The effect of the share consolidation was broadly to preserve the value of their awards subject to normal market fluctuations, so no adjustment was necessary to the number of shares to which the awards related.
Executive Committee members hold forfeitable shares, rather than conditional awards subject to one exception.
Accordingly, they received the special dividend and their share awards were subject to the share consolidation.
Kirk Kinsell holds one forfeitable share award and one conditional share award upon which dividend equivalents are paid in order to ensure economic parity with the rest of the Executive Committee.
In order to achieve equality of treatment for Kirk Kinsell, his conditional award was adjusted to place him in the same position as if he had held a forfeitable award, and therefore he received the special dividend and his share award was subject to the share consolidation, in the same way as other Executive Committee members.
Implications for outstanding executive share options IHG Executive Share Option Plan share option holders were not entitled to receive the special dividend.
The effect of the share consolidation was broadly to preserve the value of their awards subject to normal market fluctuations, so no adjustment was made to the number of shares to which the options related.
Share buyback programme In relation to the share buyback programme, the effect on LTIP awards, ABP deferred shares and share options will be to broadly preserve the value of those awards.
No adjustments are required to LTIP performance targets for the same reasons as stated above.
Use of share capital in incentive plans No awards or grants over shares were made during 2012 that would be dilutive of the Companys ordinary share capital.
Current policy is to settle the majority of awards or grants under the Companys share plans with shares purchased in the market.
A number of options granted up to 2005 are yet to be exercised and will be settled with the issue of new shares.
B Performance graph Throughout 2012, the Company was a member of the FTSE 100 index and, for remuneration purposes, used a TSR comparator group of the DJGH index.
Accordingly, the Committee has determined that these are the most appropriate market indices against which to test the Companys performance.
The graph below shows the TSR performance of IHG from 31 December 2007 to 31 December 2012, assuming dividends are reinvested, compared with the TSR performance achieved by the FTSE 100 index and the DJGH index.
All indices are shown in sterling.
Over the five-year period, IHGs TSR performance has increased by 139%.
Over the last three years, it has significantly outperformed the FTSE 100 index and the DJGH index.

These fees also reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of the roles.
Accordingly, higher fees are payable to the Senior Independent Director who chairs the Audit Committee and to the Chairmen of the Remuneration and Corporate Responsibility Committees, reflecting the additional responsibilities of these roles.
The Chairmans fees are agreed by the Committee.
Non-Executive Directors fee levels are reviewed annually.
In the final quarter of 2012 an increase of approximately 3% for the Non-Executive Directors was agreed from 1 January 2013.
This increase is broadly in line with anticipated salary increases for executive and senior management employees across the wider organisation.

D Service contracts Notice periods The Committees policy is for all Executive Directors to have rolling contracts with a notice period of 12 months.
All Executive Directors have service contracts with a notice period of 12 months.
All new appointments will have 12-month notice periods, unless, on an exceptional basis to complete an external recruitment successfully, a longer initial notice period reducing to 12 months is used, in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Termination No provisions for compensation for termination following change of control, nor for liquidated damages of any kind upon termination in any circumstances, are included in the current Directors contracts.
There are no provisions in Executive Directors contracts for making a payment in lieu of notice.
Instead the parties will rely on common law to assess what, if any, damages may be payable for any loss resulting from termination in breach of contract subject to the duty to mitigate any loss.
In the event of any early termination of an Executive Directors contract, the policy is to seek to minimise any liability.
Non-executive directorships of other companies The Company recognises that its Executive Directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies and that such duties can broaden experience and knowledge, and benefit the Company.
Therefore, Executive Directors are permitted to accept one non-executive appointment in addition to any positions where the Director is appointed as the Groups representative, subject to Board approval, as long as this is not, in the reasonable opinion of the Board, likely to lead to a conflict of interest.
Executive Directors would generally be authorised to retain the fees received.
Current Executive Directors do not hold any non-executive directorships of any other company.
Non-Executive Director appointments Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment.
Patrick Cescaus appointment as Non-Executive Chairman, effective from 1 January 2013, is subject to 12 months notice.
