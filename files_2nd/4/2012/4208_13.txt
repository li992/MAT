Keith Layden has a separate agreement which provides death in service benets outside of the CPS.
Notes 1 The gures shown represent: the amount of annual pension benets which would have been preserved had the Director left service on 31 December 2012, based on service to, and pensionable earnings at, that date.
Accrued pension revalued from 5 April 2011 to 31 December 2012 for Keith Layden.
2 The gure represents the difference between the total accrued pension at 31 December 2012 and the corresponding pension at the beginning of the year.
3 The gure represents the difference between the total accrued pension at 31 December 2012 and the corresponding pension at the beginning of the year after an adjustment to exclude ination was provided as required under paragraph 9.8.
4 Transfer values are quoted on the basis recommended by the Scheme Actuary for valuation of accrued benets if the member had transferred benets to another approved scheme on the relevant date.
The increase decrease in transfer value between 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2012 takes account of changes in market conditions over the period.
5 The gure represents the difference between transfer values of the accrued benets at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, less contributions paid by the Director or on his behalf under the Companys salary sacrifice scheme.
6 The gure represents the transfer value of the increase in accrued benets over the period, adjusted for ination, less contributions paid by the Director or on his behalf under the Companys salary sacrifice scheme.
7 Following the triennial valuation, the Trustee of the CPS amended the transfer value basis with effect from October 2012.
The impact of updating the basis was a reduction in the Directors transfer values of around 5%.
8 Keith Layden became a Direcor on 6 February 2012.
The accrued pension disclosed above has been calculated taking into account his entire pensionable service including the period before his promotion to Director.
Members of the CPS have the option to pay voluntary contributions.
Neither the contributions nor the resulting benets are included in this table.
During 2012, Steve Foots was paid 62,500 2011: nil, Sean Christie was paid 32,541 2011: 22,876 and Keith Layden was paid 54,750 in addition to their basic salary to enable them to make independent provision for their retirement.
This contribution reects the introduction of a cap to the maximum salary on which benets at retirement are based under the CPS.
Accordingly, benets above this cap are now provided by a salary supplement in lieu of pension benets above the cap of 187,500.
This change in benefit structure is expected to be cost neutral for the Company.
The salary supplements in lieu of pension benets provided above the cap are included in the emoluments table on page 51.
