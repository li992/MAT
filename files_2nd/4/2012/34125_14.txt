Audit Committee Report Summary of the role of the Audit Committee The Audit Committee is appointed by the Board from the Non-Executive Directors of the Group.
The Audit Committees terms of reference include all matters indicated by Disclosure and Transparency Rule 7.1 and the UK Corporate Governance Code.
The terms of reference are considered annually by the Audit Committee and are then referred to the Board for approval.
The Audit Committee is responsible for: monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of the Group and any formal announcements relating to the Groups financial performance and reviewing significant financial reporting judgements contained therein: reviewing the Groups internal financial controls and the Groups internal control and risk management systems, including consideration of the need for an internal audit function: making recommendations to the Board for a resolution to be put to the shareholders for their approval in general meetings, on the appointment of the external auditor and the approval of the remuneration and terms of engagement of the external auditor: reviewing and monitoring the external auditors independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process, taking into consideration relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements: and developing and implementing a policy on the engagement of the external auditor to supply non-audit services, taking into account relevant guidance regarding the provision of non-audit services by the external audit firm.
The Audit Committee is required to report its findings to the Board, identifying any matters on which it considers that action or improvement is needed, and make recommendations on the steps to be taken.
Composition of the Audit Committee The members of the Audit Committee are: Mark Richardson Chairman Tim Clark Steve Johnson Jonathan Short Richard Cotton will join the Committee upon his appointment to the Board, replacing Jonathan Short.
Membership of the Committee is reviewed by the Chairman of the Committee and the Executive Chairman, who is not a member of the Audit Committee, at regular intervals and they recommend new appointments to the Nominations Committee for onward recommendation to the Board.
Appointments to the Audit Committee are for an initial period of three years, and are extendable by additional three year periods.
The Audit Committee structure requires the inclusion of one financially qualified member as recognised by the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies.
Currently Mark Richardson, as a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales, fulfils this requirement.
All Audit Committee members are expected to be financially literate.
The Committee is comprised of four Non-Executive Directors, a majority of whom have to be deemed independent, with a minimum of three members at any time.
The Group provides an induction programme for new Audit Committee members and on-going training to enable all of the Committee members to carry out their duties.
The induction programme covers the role of the Audit Committee, its terms of reference and expected time commitment by members and an overview of the Groups business, including the main business and financial dynamics and risks.
New Committee members also meet some of the Groups staff.
On-going training includes attendance at formal conferences, internal company seminars and briefings by external advisers.
The Board expects the Audit Committee members to have an understanding of: the principles of, contents of, and developments in financial reporting including the applicable accounting standards and statements of recommended practice: key aspects of the Groups operations including corporate policies, Group financing, products and systems of internal control: matters that influence or distort the presentation of accounts and key figures: the principles of, and developments in, company law, sector-specific laws and other relevant corporate legislation: the role of external auditing and risk management: the regulatory framework for the Groups businesses: and environmental and social responsibility best reporting practices.
The Committee have reviewed the arrangements for whistleblowing by employees to ensure that there is a consistent policy in the Group to enable employees to voice concerns particularly in respect of possible financial reporting improprieties.
A whistleblowing policy is included in the employee handbook.
31 Audit Committee Report continued Meetings The Audit Committee is required to meet three times per year and has an agenda linked to events in the Groups financial calendar.
The agenda is predominantly cyclical and is therefore approved by the Audit Committee Chairman on behalf of his fellow members.
Each Audit Committee member has the right to require reports on matters of interest in addition to the cyclical items.
The Audit Committee invites the Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer, Financial Controller, and senior representatives of the external auditors to attend all of its meetings in full, although it reserves the right to request any of these individuals to withdraw.
Other senior management are invited to present such reports as are required for the Committee to discharge its duties.
Overview of the actions taken by the Audit Committee to discharge its duties Since the beginning of the financial year the Audit Committee has: reviewed the March 2011 report and financial statements, the September 2011 half-yearly report and the trading updates issued in July and January.
As part of this review the Committee received a report from the external auditors on their audit of the annual report and financial statements and review of the half-yearly report: considered the output from the Group-wide process used to identify, evaluate and mitigate risks: reviewed the effectiveness of the Groups internal controls and disclosures made in the annual report and financial statements on this matter: reviewed and agreed the scope of the audit work to be undertaken by the auditor: agreed the fees to be paid to the external auditors for their audit of the March 2012 financial statements and September half-yearly report: undertaken an assessment of the qualification, expertise and resources, and independence of the external auditors and the effectiveness of the audit process.
This included consideration of a report on the audit firms own quality control procedures and the audit firms annual transparency report, and the report produced by the Audit Inspection Unit on the audit firm: assessed the risks associated with the possible withdrawal of the external auditor from the market: met the Groups external valuers: undertaken an evaluation of the performance of the external auditors: and reviewed its own effectiveness.
External auditor The Audit Committee is responsible for the development, implementation and monitoring of the Groups policy on external audit.
The policy assigns oversight responsibility for monitoring the independence, objectivity and compliance with ethical and regulatory requirements to the Audit Committee, and day to day responsibility to the Chief Financial Officer.
The policy states that the external auditor is jointly responsible to the Board and the Audit Committee and that the Audit Committee is the primary contact.
The Groups policy on external audit sets out the categories of non-audit services which the external auditors will and will not be allowed to provide to the Group, including those that are pre-approved by the Audit Committee and those which require specific approval before they are contracted for, subject to fide minimis levels.
They may not provide a service which places them in a position where they may be required to audit their own work.
Specifically, they are precluded from providing services relating to bookkeeping, financial information system design and implementation, appraisal or evaluation services, actuarial services, any management functions, investment banking services, legal services unrelated to the audit or advocacy services.
To fulfil its responsibility regarding the independence of the external auditor, the Audit Committee reviewed: The external auditors plan for the current year, noting the role of the senior statutory audit partner, who signs the audit report and who, in accordance with professional rules, has not held office for more than five years, and any changes in the key audit staff: the arrangements for day-to-day management of the audit relationship: a report identifying the number of former external audit staff now employed by the Group and their positions within the Group: a report from the external auditors describing their arrangements to identify, report and manage any conflicts of interest: the overall extent of non-audit services provided by the external auditors, in addition to its case-by-case approval of the position of non-audit services by the external auditors: and the past service of the auditor who was first appointed in 2000.
To assess the effectiveness of the external auditor, the Audit Committee reviewed: the arrangements for ensuring the external auditors independence and objectivity: the external auditors fulfilment of the agreed audit plan and variations from the plan: the robustness and perceptiveness of the auditor in his handling of the key accounting and audit judgements: and the content of the external auditors comments on control improvement recommendations.
32 Regard is paid to the nature of, and remuneration received, for other services provided by Deloitte LLP to the Group and, inter alia, confirmation is sought from them that the fee payable for the annual audit is adequate to enable them to perform their obligations in accordance with the scope of the audit.
Where non-audit services are provided, the fees are based on the work undertaken and are not success related.
In respect of the year ended 31 March 2012, the auditors remuneration comprised 167,000 for audit work and 152,000 for other work, principally relating to corporation tax work.
As part of this years decision to recommend the re-appointment of the auditors, the Audit Committee has taken into account the tenure of the auditors and the audit partner and the need to consider at least every five years whether there should be a full tender process.
The auditors, Deloitte LLP, have been in tenure since 2000 and the current audit partner has been in place since the audit of the 2009 financial statements.
There are no contractual obligations that act to restrict the Audit Committees choice of external auditors.
As a consequence of its satisfaction with the results of the activities outlined above, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board that the external auditors are re-appointed.
Overview As a result of its work during the year, the Audit Committee has concluded that it has acted in accordance with its terms of reference and has ensured the independence and objectivity of the external auditors.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee will be available at the Annual General Meeting to answer any questions about the work of the Committee.
Approved by the Audit Committee and signed on its behalf by: Mark Richardson Audit Committee Chairman 21 May 2012 33 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 1.
INTRODUCTION Our Corporate Social Responsibility CSR policy documents how we can best manage the impact of our business on society and the environment and control risks and opportunities in our business in a sustainable way.
To continue to deliver our CSR policy for our main Stakeholders, the Board has continued to commit significant resources to environmental and social aspects of its operations and new developments.
These are consistently measured by key performance indicators KPIs, the most significant of which are highlighted in this report and identified below.
A limited level of assurance of selected CSR data is undertaken by Deloitte in accordance with ISAE 3000.
This standard provides evaluation of both quantitative and qualitative aspects of CSR management and reporting 2.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Highlights Our CSR programme for the year ended 31 March 2012 committed us to focus on our most significant environmental challenge of energy efficiency and carbon reduction.
In order to achieve these twin objectives we: 1.
Continued our lighting efficiency programmes to gain an absolute carbon CO emission reduction of 5.5%: 2 2.
Reduced carbon intensity emissions by 10.1% per store gross internal area and by 18.6% per customer occupied space, with three new stores opening and an increase of 16.1% in occupied space: 3.
Increased our annual solar electricity generation by 15.3% to 123,489 kWh and saved carbon emissions equivalent to 64.4 tCO in the year ended 2 31 March 2012: 4.
Generated cumulative solar PV electricity of 374 MWh since the first installation in March 2008, an increase of 49.4% on last years solar cumulative total: and 5.
Generated total Feed in Tariff income, displaced electricity costs and carbon tax reductions of 90,000 since 1 April 2010.
Our carbon footprint is the carbon dioxide emissions resulting from store electricity use 97.5% : flexi-office gas use 1.4% and Construction Fit-out diesel and electricity use 1.1%.
This can be summarised as follows: Total carbon footprint emissions Year 2011 2012 Change Store electricity emissions tCO 7,542 7,127 5.5% 2 Construction fit-out gas oil & electricity emissions tCO 74 82 10.8% 2 Flexi-office gas emissions tCO 121 102 15.7% 2 Absolute carbon dioxide emissions tCO 7,737 7,311 5.5% 2 Store electricity use and CO emissions 2 Year 2011 2012 Change Electricity use kWh 13,925,217 13,674,944 1.8% Absolute carbon emissions tCO 7,542 7,127 5.5% 2 2 Carbon intensity kgCO m gross internal area 13.8 12.4 10.1% 2 2 Carbon intensity kg CO m occupied space 38.1 31.0 18.6% 2 Solar electricity generation and carbon savings Year 2011 2012 Change Cumulative solar PV generation kWh since 2008 249,991 373,479 49.4% Annual solar PV generation kWh 107,071 123,489 15.3% Carbon dioxide saved by solar electricity tCO 58.0 64.4 11.0% 2 Solar electricity % of stores with solar PV 4.8 5.4 12.5% Solar electricity % of whole portfolio electricity use 0.8 0.9 12.5% Store non-hazardous bulk waste tonnage Year 2011 2012 Change Tonnage of store waste t 266 263 1.1% Percentage further sorting and landfill % 28% 28% Percentage for direct recycling % 72% 72% Number of stores 62 65 4.8% Tonnage of waste per store 4.3 4.1 4.7% 34 3.
STAKEHOLDERS Big Yellow engages with its main stakeholders to provide information and gain useful feedback from a variety of groups, as described below.
3.1 The media, staff and customers Industry awards: The Sunday Times Best Green Companies Survey We achieved a 65% response rate from our staff for this survey.
The aim was to gather staff opinions on our green policies and to help us recognise where we need to improve.
Big Yellow was listed in the Top 60 Best Green Companies, on our first attempt at the benchmark.
In the staff survey we scored highest in the areas of our staff awareness of our CSR policy, our carbon reduction achievements and our waste recycling policies.
Built Environment Best Practice Award Big Yellow was selected for this Award by a South East Counties Business Network Enterprise.
Companies are judged in a unique way for this award, as no company can put themselves forward or be nominated.
The sponsors track some 5,000 companies in the south of England and liaise with twelve representative organisations and academics to identify pro-active, environmental leaders.
They researched Big Yellows background and talked to people who know us, to get personal as well as business validation.
The environmental attributes of Big Yellow were featured in a report in Decision Magazine.
Government awards & standards: The Queens Award for Enterprise in Sustainable Development This award was presented to Big Yellow for recognising our outstanding achievement in Innovation and Sustainable Development.
The Award is only presented to a limited number of companies each year, and in 2012 we were very proud to have been one of them.
To achieve this recognition, we described our approach to how we managed customer relationships over a five year period.
We explained how we contributed to the environmental dimension of sustainable development through operational energy efficiency, increased waste recycling and enhanced biodiversity.
The Governments Carbon Reduction Commitment CRC Big Yellow achieved a position in the top 3.7% of over 2,000 UK companies that participated in the Governments CRC and Energy Efficiency Scheme League table.
The league table details the relative performance of all participants against their absolute carbon emissions, their early action on the Carbon Trust Standard see below and their use of smart meters.
The Carbon Trust Standard CTS During the year Big Yellow was able to extend its participating in the CTS to 31 March 2013 and to strengthen our position in the CRC League table.
The aim is to reduce CO2 emissions over the longer term.
Big Yellow is now able to consistently demonstrate carbon reductions over a five year period 2007 to 2011.
For the financial years 2007 to 2009, we achieved an absolute carbon emission reduction of 4.8% and a turnover reduction of 7.8%.
From 2009 to 2011, we can report a relative benchmark, improvement of 7.5% per square metre of occupied space in carbon efficiency as follows: Carbon reduction efficiency increases customer occupied space Year 2009 2010 2011 2 tCO Customer Occupied Space m 0.043 0.040 0.039 2 The Investment Community Recognition: Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark GRESB During the past year Big Yellow entered the second GRESB survey, managed by Maastricht University, on behalf of pension fund investors.
Over 340 real estate funds and companies participated, representing a total property value of $928 billion and 21,000 assets globally.
The results are published on the GRESB website and they announced that we demonstrated leadership in sustainability performance and were ranked within the top 10% globally, and within the top 5% in Europe.
During the next year we will continue to participate in Government programmes and industry awards to measure our CSR performance against our peer group and to provide our Stakeholders with an independent measurement of our activities.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS Big Yellows most significant environmental impact is its carbon emissions from electric lighting use in operational stores.
Approximately 97% of the store area does not require either heating or cooling due to adequate insulation, air tightness and top floor ventilation.
Only the public reception area requires heating and cooling for staff and customer comfort levels.
We have calculated carbon dioxide CO emissions using the latest Department of 2 Energy and Climate Change DECC conversion factors: 2011 DEFRA DECCs GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting Version 1.2, 19 08 2011.
We have also included total electricity cost including VAT and the Climate Change Levy CCL, where appropriate, to assess the reduction of kWh consumption in terms of total savings from energy use.
35 Corporate Social Responsibility Report continued 4.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS continued 4.1 Store energy use carbon dioxide emissions Independent energy statements estimate that about 60% of our store electricity is consumed by lighting.
Approximately 30% of our total electricity use is by lifts.
Approximately 3% of our store electricity is used in external signage, security and parking.
The remainder is used for reception area heating and cooling.
Carbon emissions from these power station sources are known as Scope 2, indirect offsite emissions.
The table below summarises the Groups store electricity usage, costs and emissions over the last three years: Store electricity use & CO emissions 2 Year 2010 2011 2012 Change 2013 target Electricity use kWh 12,730,855 13,925,217 13,674,944 1.8% 1.5% Total electricity cost 1,567,270 1,476,755 1,277,131 13.5% Pence per kWh 13.57 10.28 10.16 1.2% Carbon emissions kgCO 6,913,236 7,541,898 7,126,560 5.5% 2 2 Store occupied space m 177,904 198,063 229,869 16.1% 2 KgCO m occupied space 38.9 38.1 31.0 18.6% 10.0% 2 2 GIA m 528,604 545,884 573,857 5.1% 2 Kg CO m GIA 13.1 13.8 12.42 10.1% 2 We are reporting an absolute electricity reduction 1.8%, carbon emission reduction 5.5% and a carbon intensity reduction for self storage customer occupied space 18.6%.
Electricity consumption reduced by 250,273 kWh, due to the continued effects of our investment in more energy efficient management, lighting systems and increased generation of carbon free solar electricity.
Electricity cost savings at an average cost of 10.16p per kWh amounted to 25,000, against rising customer occupied space and three new store openings in the year.
CRC tax savings of 1,000 12 tCO2 will be achieved from this electricity reduction.
The reporting of electricity use estimates has now been reduced to a minimum by the use of automatic meter reading AMR devices.
DEFRA Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2011 states that the increased import of overseas electricity included more renewable and nuclear energy.
This has contributed to our lower carbon emissions, through the use of the lower electricity to carbon conversion factor compared to last financial year.
Carbon intensity emissions for self storage occupied space reduced significantly 18.6%, against increasing customer numbers.
The carbon intensity measure for gross internal area GIA takes into account our new store portfolio growth we opened three new stores at Eltham, Stockport and New Cross.
In the new financial year our targets will be to continue absolute carbon reduction and carbon intensity reduction through our continued energy efficient re-lamping programmes and our increasing investments in solar electricity generation.
4.2 Store lighting energy efficiency programmes Our three new stores at Eltham, Stockport and New Cross have energy saving motion sensor lighting, T5 energy efficient lamps and external LED lighting, installed by Big Yellow Construction.
Facilities Management installed zoning of the existing motion-sensor lighting MSL at eight stores: Cheltenham, Croydon: Leeds: New Malden: Portsmouth: Slough: Staples Corner: and Twickenham, to increase the efficient use of electricity and reduce carbon emissions.
We now have nine stores upgraded to MSL, including Bow.
A further four stores were re-lamped by Facilities Management with Power Saver lamps at Beckenham, Byfleet, Milton Keynes and Staples Corner.
This brings the total number of stores with energy efficient T5 or Power Saver Lamps, in the whole portfolio to 30 stores.
Our strategy for the store portfolio has been progressed by Facilities Management who are currently trialling LED lighting for internal storage and reception use at our Slough store.
Initial performance monitoring shows energy savings of around 60% efficiency compared to conventional T8 switched-start fittings.
With the possible installation of LEDs during 2012, the Power Saver relamping programme will potentially be replaced with the more efficient LED investment.
4.3 Stores gas use carbon dioxide emissions Flexi-office services are provided alongside self storage in twelve of our sixty five stores.
Gas heating, which involves direct on-site combustion and on-site carbon emissions, are known as Scope 1 type emissions.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS continued 4.3 Stores gas use carbon dioxide emissions continued Flexi-offices using electricity four and ground source heat pumps two at Kennington and Bromley have been excluded from the data above.
The table includes flexi-offices using gas heating only.
Gas use decreased by 15.6% due to a milder winter and more frequent meter readings from stores, which in turn has reduced over-estimations resulting in more accurate data, and cost savings against a 4.2% increase in flexi-office customer occupancy.
Gas costs including VAT and the Climate Change levy CCL reduced by 10.5%.
Automatic meter reading AMR installations are planned for July 2012 to reduce further over estimations in gas use and payments.
4.4 Construction fit-out carbon dioxide emissions Store fit-out is the final stage of the development of a store that Big Yellow Construction manages.
This stage uses gas oil for on-site electricity generation before grid electricity is supplied.
Stockport, New Cross and Chiswick account for these energy uses and carbon emissions in the year ended 31 March 2012.
Gas oil use reduced due to a reduced new store development programme and an early availability of on-site electricity supply at Chiswick.
Construction fit-out energy use & CO emissions 2 Year 2010 2011 2012 Change Total gas oil use litres 50,571 13,481 8,033 40.4% Gas oil generator tCO 133.5 35.6 22.2 37.6% 2 Total electricity supplied kWh 127,643 69,933 114,395 63.6% Electricity emissions tCO 69.3 37.9 59.6 57.3% 2 Number of stores fit-outs 63 3 Total metric tons tCO 203 74 82 10.8% 2 As Chiswick is a larger than average store, electricity use was higher than average, and so total carbon emissions increased by 10.8%.
However, construction gas oil and grid electricity use amounted to a residual 1.1% of our total carbon emissions.
4.5 Big Yellows carbon footprint In summary, Big Yellows carbon footprint is set out in the table below: Big Yellow absolute carbon footprint Year 2010 2011 2012 Change 2013 target Store electricity tCO emissions 6,913 7,542 7,127 5.5% 2.0% 2 Fit-out diesel & electricity tCO emissions 203 74 82 10.8% 5.5% 2 Flexi-office tCO emissions 89 121 102 15.7% 2.0% 2 Total tCO emissions metric tonnes 7,205 7,737 7,311 5.5% 6.0% 2 The total carbon dioxide footprint for operational stores, flexi-offices and new store construction fit-out emissions has been reduced in absolute terms by 5.5%, exceeding our 5% target and was delivered against increased customer occupancy.
This achievement continues the longer term trend, only reversed in 2011, from 2008, for year on year absolute carbon reductions.
Operational store energy use accounts for 97.5% of our carbon emission footprint with flexi-office gas accounting for 1.4% and fit-out construction 1.1%.
In the year ending 31 March 2013, Big Yellow will continue its energy efficiency and carbon reduction commitment programmes for store lighting and increased capacity for solar PV installations on new stores.
We also aim to reduce absolute carbon emissions and carbon intensity emissions per square metre of occupied space.
4.6 Renewable energy generation In the year ended 31 March 2012, Big Yellow added one large 50 kWp solar photo-voltaic installation at our new store in New Cross.
Our renewable energy assets now consist of twelve solar installations, five ground source heat pumps and two wind turbines.
Renewable energy generation data has been restated this year to focus on the higher performance of solar generation based on more accurate quarterly meter readings, for claiming solar Feed in Tariff FIT payments and off Grid savings.
Micro-wind turbine generation in the urban environment has not proved to be viable and ground source heat pumps have under-performed and proved difficult to monitor.
Solar PV electricity generation Year 2010 2011 2012 Change 2013 target Annual cumulative solar electricity kWh 142,917 249,991 373,479 49.4% 40.0% Annual solar electricity generation kWh 95,517 107,071 123,489 15.3% 15.0% Big Yellow average electricity cost p kWh 13.57 10.28 10.16 1.2% National Grid displaced kWh savings 12,962 11,007 12,547 14.0% Carbon emission reduction tCO 51.9 58.0 64.4 11.0% 10.0% 2 CRC carbon tax savings 12 tonne 622.8 696.0 772.8 11.0% Solar kWh FIT & ROC payments 1,683 33,751 15,837 Total solar electricity income and savings 15,268 45,454 29,157 Solar electricity % of solar store use 5% 4.8% 5.4% 12.5% 6.0% Solar electricity % of whole portfolio use 0.7% 0.8% 0.9% 12.5% 1.0% 37 Corporate Social Responsibility Report continued 4.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS continued 4.6 Renewable energy generation continued The cumulative solar PV electricity generated since our first installation at Balham in March 2008 is now 374 MWh, increasing by 49.4% from the prior year.
Annual solar electricity generation increased by 15.3% to 123,489 kWh and a carbon reduction of 11.0% will help reduce carbon tax emissions in the year ended 31 March 2013.
The first Feed in Tariff revenues for solar electricity generation were backdated to the start of the scheme on 1 April 2010 and up to 30 June 2011 15 months and amounted to 34,000.
Payments in the year ended 31 March 2012 were 16,000 for 9 months, as the first three months were included in the first payment for FY 2011.
Total solar store income and savings over the last three years amount to 90,000 for displaced grid electricity, carbon tax savings and Feed in Tariff revenues.
Currently our 12 solar stores are generating 5.4% of their electricity use and nearly 1% of the total store portfolio electricity use.
4.7 Store waste management In May 2011 we changed our waste contractor to one that recycles and manufactures cardboard in addition to providing standard waste collection services.
In the year ended 31 March 2010, the waste volume was estimated from the number of bin lifts and volume of bins.
The volume in 2010 3 was 4,380 m. Store non-hazardous bulk waste tonnage Year 2010 2011 2012 Change Tonnage of store waste t 266 263 1.1% Percentage further sorting and landfill % 28% 28% Percentage for direct recycling % 72% 72% Number of stores 60 62 65 4.8% Tonnage of waste per store 4.3 4.1 4.7% From May 2010, store waste sorting on site was introduced with mixed dry recyclables, mixed papers and general waste.
During the last 12 months the total tonnage of waste has reduced by 1.1% and by 4.7% per store, against an increase of 3 store openings.
72% of the total tonnage was sent directly for recycling including mixed papers.
A further 28% was sent for further sorting and or landfill.
The change in store waste policy and procedure has resulted in a raised awareness of waste recycling and performance improvement.
4.8 Store water use In preparation for future commercial building Water Performance Certificates we aim to improve our metering and monitoring of water use.
New stores have low flow aerated taps and duel flush WCs.
Six stores have rainwater harvesting systems Sutton, Barking, Merton, Liverpool, Sheffield and Chiswick and these supply rainwater for WC flushing and irrigation for enhanced landscape or green walls.
STORE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION Our Eltham store opened at the start of the financial year and has a Green Travel Plan for our store staff, to encourage more active modes of transport other than the car.
It also has an enhanced landscape, including trees, shrubs and a Green wall to encourage wildlife habitat and local biodiversity.
Our Stockport store also has an enhanced landscape with hundreds of new plant species.
Our New Cross store has our largest solar PV roof panel capable of generating about 17% of the stores annual energy use.
All new stores since December 2009 have about 60% more energy efficient external signage LED lighting.
The tables below summarise the eco-efficient specifications, installations and environmental improvement features of our most recent store developments: Improvements in sustainable development & eco-efficient store designs 2007 2012 Motion Energy LED Solar Green Rain Green sensor efficient external GHSP travel water roofs Improved Store lighting lighting signage energy plans harvest walls ecology 1 1.
