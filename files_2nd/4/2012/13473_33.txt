Employee share plans Management Share Plan MSP The primary focus of the MSP is to support the Groups ability to attract and retain key staff below executive level in an increasingly tight and competitive labour market.
Executives are not eligible to participate in the MSP.
Retention of key individuals is also important given the long-term nature of the delivery of the business strategy.
MSP awards are conditional awards not subject to a performance condition as they vest subject to continued employment, at the end of three years, and thus act as an effective retention tool.
Shares to satisfy the awards are purchased in the market and no new shares are issued.
All employee share plans Executives may participate in broad-based share and share option plans which are available to Group employees generally and for which performance conditions do not apply.
These plans form part of standard remuneration practice whereby employees are offered participation in plans to encourage alignment with the long-term performance of the Group.
