The requirement that the Committee must be satisfied that the underlying performance of the Company during the performance period justifies the exercise of an award gives the Committee a discretion as to whether or not to allow a particular exercise, notwithstanding the achievement of at least a median TSR ranking and annual compound growth in EPS at 4% or more above growth in RPI.
The Committees view is that such circumstances are likely to be exceptional and therefore they are difficult to determine before they have arisen.
In addition, the Committee does not wish to limit its discretion in any way by attempting to pre-determine the circumstances in which it might be exercised.
If the Committee exercised this discretion it would be in respect of all awards made on a particular date and not in respect of a particular individual or individuals.

4 Dennis Millard and Paul Withers joined the Company on 1 September 2007 Directors interests audited The interests of the Directors in the ordinary share capital of the Company at the beginning and end of the financial year are set out below, together with a note of those interests as at 7 April 2008, being within one month of the date of the Companys Notice of Annual General Meeting.

All employees including Executive Directors are potential beneficiaries of the trust.
It is not anticipated that any employee or Executive Director will be entitled to receive from the trust a greater number of shares than that to which they are entitled on exercise of awards made to them under the PSP.
The other options listed above are executive options which are subject to the performance conditions described below.
The rules of the ESOS allow annual awards to be made, with a maximum grant equal to 100 per cent of the individuals annual salary.
Exercise of options granted under the scheme is subject to a performance condition.
This condition is that the growth in the Companys adjusted EPS over the three consecutive financial years starting with the year of grant exceeds the growth in RPI over the same period by at least 9 per cent.
At this level of performance half of the options granted are exercisable.
Exercise of all options granted requires that the Companys EPS growth exceeds RPI over the period by at least 15 per cent, with a sliding scale for performance between 9 per cent and 15 per cent.
The rules of the scheme approved by shareholders in 2003 provided that, if the performance condition was not met over this three-year period, options could also be exercised if the Companys EPS growth exceeded RPI by a minimum of 12 per cent over the four financial years starting with the year of grant.
The Committee decided to remove this re-testing provision with effect from 13 March 2006 and it does not apply to any options granted after that date.
Options granted under earlier schemes operated by the Company remain outstanding.
Executive options granted under such schemes after 13 March 2001 may not be exercised unless the growth in the Companys EPS over a period of three consecutive financial years exceeds the growth in RPI over the same period by at least 9 per cent.
For options granted after 20 June 1996, but before 14 March 2001, exercise is subject to the growth in EPS over three consecutive years exceeding the growth in RPI over the same period by at least 6 per cent.
The Company has met the performance condition for options awarded up to and during January 2003 and these options are now exercisable.
The Company has also met the performance condition for options awarded from March 2004 up to and during October 2005 and these options are exercisable from the third anniversary of their grant.
No price was paid for any option.
There were no variations to the terms and conditions of any Directors options during the year.
The market price of the Companys shares at 3 February 2008 was 150.5p 28 January 2007: 195.0p and the range during the year was 128.75p 225.5p.

For awards made prior to June 2007, the main performance condition compares the growth of the Companys TSR share price growth and reinvested dividends over a three-year period to that of the companies in the FTSE mid-250 Index excluding investment trusts.
The Companys ranking among the comparator companies determines the percentage of shares which a participant can acquire.
No shares may be acquired where the Companys ranking is below median and, to acquire the full number of shares awarded, the Company must rank in the top quartile of the comparator group.
Between these two points, vesting is on a straight-line basis, with 20 per cent of any award vesting where the Companys performance is at the median.
There were no variations made to the terms and conditions of any award during the year.
70 Remuneration Report continued Restricted share plan audited As part of the remuneration package offered by the Company to secure Harriet Greens services, the Company established a restricted share plan, of which Harriet is the sole participant.

Performance graph The graph below shows the total shareholder return for a holding of the Companys ordinary shares for the five financial years of the Company of which the year to 3 February 2008 is the last.
This is compared to the total shareholder return for a hypothetical holding in the FTSE mid-250 Index excluding investment trusts.
This was chosen as it is the index of which the Company is a constituent.
Total shareholder return is the growth in value of a share plus the value of dividends paid, assuming that the dividends are reinvested in the Companys shares on the day on which they are paid.
