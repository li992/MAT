QinetiQs policy is that Executive Directors should have contracts with a rolling term providing for a maximum of one years notice.
Consequently, no Executive Director has a contractual notice period in excess of 12 months.
In the event of early termination, this ensures that compensation is restricted to a maximum of 12 months basic salary and benefits.
The Committee will generally require mitigation to reduce the compensation payable to a departing Executive Director.
Non-executive Directors contracts are renewed on a rolling 12-month basis subject to reappointment at the Annual General Meeting.
There are no provisions in their contracts for compensation on early termination.
