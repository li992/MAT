Directors remuneration report Introduction This remuneration report summarises the Companys remuneration policy and particularly, its application in relation to the directors.
The report describes how the Company applies the principles of good corporate governance in relation to directors remuneration in accordance with the Combined Code 2006, the directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, relevant company law, and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
The Companys auditors are required to report on certain sections of this report the audited information and to state if the report has been properly prepared in accordance with these regulations.
Shareholders will be provided with an opportunity to vote on this remuneration report at the forthcoming AGM.
Further details are contained in the notice of AGM booklet that accompanies this report.
Shareholder approval will also be sought at the AGM for two changes in the Companys existing equity-based employee incentive schemes.
The first is a change to the maximum grant level of awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The second, a reduction in the contract period under the all-employee MITIE Group PLC 2001 Savings Related Share Option Scheme, known as the Save As You Earn SAYE Scheme, from five years to three years.
Details of these schemes are set out below and speci c details of the proposed changes are set out in the notice of AGM booklet that accompanies this report.
Part 1: information not subject to audit Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the committee has responsibility for determining the remuneration packages of the executive directors.
It is also responsible for overseeing the operation of all equity-based employee incentive schemes operated by the Company.
The terms of reference of the committee are available on the Groups website www.
During the year, the members of the committee were: Ishbel Macpherson Chairman : David Jenkins: Graeme Potts: and Cullum McAlpine.
Certain decisions affecting Group remuneration policy were taken during the period immediately prior to the reporting period when Sir John Jennings was a member of the committee.
Sir John Jennings retired on 30 March 2007 and Graeme Potts was appointed a member on 30 March 2007 in his place.
All members of the committee are independent non-executive directors.
By invitation of the committee, meetings may also be attended by David Ord, Roger Matthews and Ruby McGregor-Smith.
During the year, the committee was advised by New Bridge Street Consultants LLP in relation to the introduction of the 2007 LTIP.
In November 2007 the committee engaged the services of Kepler Associates to assist with a review of executive remuneration policy including the remuneration of executive directors and to review the LTIP and SAYE schemes.
The proposed changes to these schemes are the result of this review.
Other than remuneration advice, neither New Bridge Street Consultants LLP nor Kepler Associates provided any other services to the Company.
Remuneration policy The remuneration policy for the Companys executive directors and other Group senior executives is shaped by the need to recruit, retain and motivate individuals of the right calibre.
The policy also has regard to the Companys and the Groups culture which encourages equity ownership in order to maximise the alignment between the Companys executives and its shareholders and is a long-standing feature of the Groups executive remuneration structures.
The committee, and the Board, continues to believe that the principle of equity incentivisation has been a key driving force in the past success of the Group.
Consequently, in order to maintain and develop further MITIEs performance culture, the remuneration packages of executive directors and other Group executives should continue to contain signi cant performancerelated elements.
Chairmans remuneration The remuneration for the Chairman, David Ord, is recommended by the committee for approval by the Board.
The level of remuneration for the Chairman re ects the responsibilities and commitment of this role and was reviewed during the year following receipt of advice from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP in relation to market comparators.
Non-executive director remuneration The fees for the non-executive directors are set by the Chairman and the executive directors and they are reviewed annually.
The fee level is designed both to recognise the contribution and responsibilities of the role and to attract individuals with the levels of experience and skills required to contribute to the future development of the Board and the Group.
The non-executive directors are paid a basic fee with an additional fee for chairmanship of committees, together with expenses incurred in carrying out their duties on behalf of the Company.
non-executive directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Companys schemes or the annual bonus scheme, nor do they receive pensions or ancillary bene ts.
Further details of fees paid to non-executive directors are provided in the audited section of this report.
Executive directors remuneration Overall policy The committee has, during the year, further reviewed its policy in respect of remuneration for executive directors.
Kepler Associates were engaged to assist in this process.
The changes proposed to the LTIP scheme as set out in greater detail below and in the notice of AGM booklet accompanying this report will enable the Company to provide an executive director remuneration package that is more strongly weighted towards share-based incentives reinforcing the link between the interests of executive directors and those of the shareholders.
The overall package for executive directors consists of salary, an annual performance-related bonus, long-term equity-based incentives, pension contributions and other bene ts.
The committee has continued its policy of providing a remuneration structure with a strong variable performance-related element.
There are two key components of variable remuneration: the annual performance-related cash bonus and the performance-related LTIP.
The committee believes that where the executive directors receive remuneration packages at or above the median of an appropriate Group of comparator companies, this appropriately re ects the relative outperformance of MITIE when compared with such sector and size comparator companies.
Salary and bene ts Salaries for executive directors are reviewed annually and any change to salary is generally made with effect from 1 April.
Kepler Associates advised the committee during the year on a formal benchmarking process in respect of executive director pay which took account of pay levels in sector and size comparator companies.
The committee also took account of a range of other factors when determining appropriate salary levels including market conditions and the responsibilities and skills of the individual directors.
Details of the salaries of the executive directors during the year, together with the details of and value of other emoluments and bene ts are given below.
52 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Annual bonus scheme The annual bonus schemes for executive directors in respect of the reporting period were designed to enable the executive directors to share in the success of MITIE and, where relevant, the divisions for which the executive director is responsible.
All the executive directors have a maximum annual bonus potential of 100% of salary.
The bonuses payable to Ruby McGregor-Smith and Suzanne Baxter for the year were based on the achievement of Group budgeted performance levels.
The bonuses payable to the other executive directors were calculated on the basis of 50% of their bonus being dependent on the achievement of Group budgeted performance levels and 50% being calculated on the performance against budget of the respective areas of the Groups business within each individual directors direct control.
The pro tability performance targets for the year were delivered and as a result maximum awards under the scheme were paid to the executive directors.
Service contracts and terms Chairman and non-executive directors The non-executive directors and the Chairman are engaged for terms of three years which are terminable on six months notice: Date of agreement Notice period Date of leaving David Ord 26 April 2004 6 months David Ord has announced his intention to retire on 31 July 2008 1 Ian Stewart 30 March 2007 6 months 2 David Jenkins 31 January 2006 6 months 3 Cullum McAlpine 3 August 2005 6 months Cullum McAlpine has announced his intention to retire on 31 July 2008 4 Ishbel Macpherson 27 July 2005 6 months Roger Matthews 4 December 2006 6 months Graeme Potts 1 August 2006 6 months 1 Ian Stewart was appointed non-executive Deputy Chairman on 30 March 2007 having previously held the position of Chief Executive.
2 Chairman of the Nomination Committee.

Equity-based incentive schemes The Group operates three equity-based incentive schemes from which awards can be made.
The Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP targeted at executive directors and other senior executives and the MITIE Group PLC 2001 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS are both discretionary schemes and therefore not open to all employees of the Group.
The SAYE, an Inland Revenue approved scheme, is open to all our UK employees.
LTIP The LTIP was established in 2007 and is the principal equity-based incentive scheme for executive directors.
Awards may be granted in the form of nil cost options, conditional shares or forfeitable shares.
The committee is examining the possibility of granting awards using a combination of these award types.
The committee may also decide to grant cash-based awards of an equivalent value to share-based awards or to satisfy share-based awards in cash, although it does not currently intend to do so.
An award may not be granted after 26 July 2017.
No payment other than in respect of individual recipients electing to pay income tax, where appropriate is required for the grant of an award.
Awards are not transferable, except on death, and are not pensionable.
Awards will normally vest after three years provided that certain performance criteria have been met.
The LTIP awards made in 2007 are subject to performance conditions that require adjusted earnings per share EPS, less in ation measured by the retail prices index RPI, to exceed certain performance thresholds over a three-year period.
Where EPS growth is less than in ation plus 5% per annum none of the awards will vest.
Awards vest in full for EPS growth equal to in ation plus 14% per annum.
Vesting will be on a straight-line basis for performance between these levels.
Following advice from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP and a consultation exercise with the Companys principal shareholders in 2007, the committee determined and continues to believe that EPS is the most appropriate long-term performance measure for MITIE.
It brings the advantages of simplicity and visibility of the value of the award which the committee believes enhances the LTIPs effectiveness as an incentive tool.
In the event of a change-of-control, awards will be pro-rated both for time and performance, subject to the discretion of the committee.
MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 53 Directors remuneration report continued Currently an individual may not ordinarily receive awards in any financial year over shares having a market value in excess of 100% of annual base salary in that financial year.
In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment or retention, the rules currently allow for this limit to be increased to 200% of any employees annual base salary.
It is proposed that the threshold in respect of annual grants is amended to 200% to allow certain executive directors, who have not otherwise had the opportunity, a greater possibility to build shareholdings in the Company, subject to the satisfaction of stretching performance targets.
As part of its review of the LTIP, the committee considered the introduction of a second performance target for awards of over 100% of an executive directors base salary.
The committee decided against this believing it would dilute the clarity and simplicity of the scheme, and that a single target is more in keeping with the other successful equity-based incentive schemes that operate within the Group.
It is also proposed to increase the maximum award in exceptional circumstances to 250% of base salary.
The 2008 notice of AGM booklet accompanying this report contains further details of these proposed amendments.
Further details of the LTIP were provided in the 2007 notice of AGM booklet available in the investor section of the MITIE website at www.
ESOS The current ESOS was established in 2001.
The scheme has been approved by Her Majestys Revenue and Customs HMRC and options over shares to an individual limit of 30,000 can be awarded under the approved element of the scheme.
Options have in the past been awarded under this scheme to executive directors but, following the introduction of the LTIP it is intended that the ESOS will be focused on employees below main Board level.
The committee does not currently intend to make any further awards under the ESOS to executive directors or to other participants in the LTIP.
There is a limit on the grant level set at 100% of an individuals base salary and the scheme has, following changes to the scheme approved by shareholders at the 2007 AGM, a single performance threshold for vesting of the options average growth in earnings per share over the three-year vesting period must exceed in ation measured as RPI plus 4%.
The scheme permits the grant of share appreciation rights and the settlement of outstanding unapproved options with share appreciation rights.
SAYE The current MITIE Group PLC Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE was established in 2001.
The SAYE is open to all qualifying employees within the MITIE Group including executive directors.
HMRC rules restrict the maximum amount saved to 250 per month.
When the savings contract is started, options are granted to acquire the number of shares that the total savings will be when the contract matures, at a discounted price set at the start of the scheme.
In 2007 this discount was set at 13.5%.
The scheme currently provides that the savings scheme will run for, and options cannot normally be exercised before, five years.
The committee is concerned that take-up of the SAYE should be improved and the lapse rate reduced, and accordingly it is proposing that shareholders agree an amendment to the scheme rules to provide for a lesser savings contract period and option exercise period of three years.
The notice of AGM booklet accompanying this report contains further details of the proposed amendments to the SAYE.
Dilution limits For historic reasons the Schemes rules have incorporated limitations on the grant of equity-based incentives which exceed the ABI guidelines.
These limitations have historically been that the Company will not issue in any ten-year period: more than 12% of the issued Ordinary share capital of the Company in respect of equity-based incentive schemes both all-employee schemes and discretionary schemes : and more than 6% of the issued Ordinary share capital of the Company in respect of discretionary equity-based incentive schemes.
However, the Company will endeavour to keep within the best practice ABI guidelines of 10% of issued Ordinary share capital in respect of both all-employee schemes and discretionary schemes the ESOS, LTIP and SAYE and 5% in respect of discretionary schemes the ESOS and the LTIP.
In calculating compliance with these guidelines the Company allocates available headroom on a ten-year atline basis, making adjustments for projected lapse rates and projected increases in issued share capital.
As at 31 March 2008, the potential dilution of the Companys issued share capital was equal to 6.2% of the issued share capital in respect of all outstanding options granted under the Companys equity-based incentive schemes which will be satis ed through the allotment of new shares, and 3.0% of the issued share capital in respect of all outstanding options granted under the Companys discretionary equity-based incentive schemes which will be satis ed through the allotment of new shares.
Shareholding policy A shareholding policy for executive directors was introduced in 2007 at the same time as the LTIP.
Under the current policy, all executive directors are required to build and maintain a shareholding in the Company worth 100% of base salary.
The committee recognises that the principal mechanism for building up this holding will be on the exercise of LTIP awards and accordingly, until such time as the shareholding requirement is met, executive directors will be expected to retain no fewer than 50% of shares net of taxes that vest under the LTIP.
In view of the proposal to increase the maximum level of LTIP award as set out above, the committee has deemed it appropriate to increase the level of shares required to be held by any executive director who is granted an LTIP award of more than 100% of their base salary to a level equivalent to 150% of base salary.
The level of executive director share ownership as at 31 March 2008 expressed as a percentage of base salary is set out in the share ownership table below.
Policy on external appointments The Board recognises that the appointment of executive directors to non-executive positions at other companies can be bene cial both for the individual director and the wider Group through the broadening of their experience and knowledge.
Individual directors retain their fees in respect of any such appointments.
Roger Goodman receives 25,000 per annum in fees in respect of his role as Chairman of Networkers International plc.
Ruby McGregor-Smith receives 43,000 per annum in fees in respect of her role as a non-executive director of Michael Page International plc.
54 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Total shareholder return performance graph The graph below shows the value of 100 invested in MITIE shares on 1 April 2003 and ending on 31 March 2008 compared with 100 invested in the FTSE 250 Index and the FTSE 350 Support Services Index on the same date assuming that all dividends are reinvested.
The other points are the values at intervening financial year ends.
