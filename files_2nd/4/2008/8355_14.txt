54 Interserve Plc Annual report 2008 Executive directors service contracts The Companys policy on the duration of directors service contracts is that all newly appointed executive directors should have contracts terminable at any time on one years notice save where it is necessary to offer longer notice periods to any new directors recruited from outside the Group, in which case such periods would be reduced to one year after an initial period.
Details of service contracts of the executive directors who held office during the financial year ended 31 December 2008 are summarised as follows: Unexpired Date of term at Notice Name contract 11 March 2009 period S L Dance 10 January 2008 Indefinite one year T C Jones 1 August 2003 Indefinite one year B A Melizan 10 January 2008 Indefinite one year A M Ringrose 13 December 2001 Indefinite one year J H Vyse 13 December 2001 Indefinite one year In the event of the termination of any service contract the policy of the Company would be not to make payments beyond its contractual obligations.
The service contracts provide that if the contract is terminated summarily for reasons other than gross misconduct, liquidated damages equal only to the executives annual basic salary are payable.
The Committee feels that this level of the liquidated damages provision is not excessive as there is no entitlement to other elements of the package and considers that the certainty for the executive that this provision provides ensures clarity all round.
There are no provisions entitling the executive to terminate his employment or receive damages in the event of a change in control of the Company, or for compensation payable by the Company to increase beyond one times annual basic salary.
Copies of the service contracts are available for inspection by shareholders at the AGM.
The Committee will continue to keep under review the terms of executive directors service contracts.
None of the executive directors, save for Mr Ringrose, who is a non-executive director of the Business Services Association, hold non-executive directorships at other companies.
Interserve Plc Annual report 2008 55 Directors remuneration report continued Group Chairman and non-executive directors Non-executive directors are appointed initially until the first AGM of the Company following appointment when they are required to stand for re-election and, subject to their re-election, thereafter for a maximum period of three years, renewable on the agreement of both the Company and the director.
These appointments are terminable upon one months notice by either party, without compensation, save for the Group Chairman whose appointment is terminable upon six months notice by either party, without compensation.
The fees of the non-executive directors are determined by the Board as a whole, taking into account amounts paid by other similar-sized companies within the FTSE 250 index.
