Summaries of the principal plans are set out below.
Barclays has a number of employee benefit trusts which operate with these plans.
In some cases, the trustees grant awards and purchase shares in the market to satisfy awards as required, in others, new issue or treasury shares may be used to satisfy awards where the appropriate shareholder approval has been obtained.
The number of shares held by the trustees is set out in Note 32 on page 243.
The limits on the issue of new shares comply with the guidelines issued by the Association of British Insurers.
Table 24: Plans under which awards made in 2008 Executive Directors Plan name Eligible?
Description Performance Yes PSP is a performance related share plan under which awards of Barclays shares may be made to selected Share Plan employees including executive Directors, subject to trustee discretion.
PSP The PSP trustee may select any employee of the Group to participate in the plan.
Awards are granted by the PSP trustee, in consultation with the Remuneration Committee and are communicated as provisional allocations to participants.
No right to the shares arises until the PSP trustee releases the shares.
Participants do not pay for a grant or release of an award.
2 Awards are normally releasable on or after the third anniversary of grant, to the extent that applicable performance conditions are satisfied, subject to trustee discretion.
Any awards released may also include an additional number of shares equivalent to any dividends that would have been paid on the shares between the date of grant and release.
Normally, the maximum expected value of an award made to an employee at the date of grant is the higher of 150% of base salary, or 75% of base salary and target bonus.
Maximum awards reflect the relevant market for each executive Director.
Awards are communicated on grant as an expected value, this is a single value for the award at grant, which takes into account the sum of the various possible performance and vesting outcomes.
On cessation of employment, eligible leavers as defined normally receive an award pro rated for time and performance subject to trustee discretion.
For other leavers, awards will normally lapse.
On a change of control awards may vest at the PSP trustees discretion and may be pro rated for time and performance to the date of change of control.

Normally, for executive Directors, a minimum of 25% of bonus is delivered as a recommended mandatory award under ESAS with 75% delivered as cash.
The mandatory provisional allocation will normally include bonus shares equal to 30% of the value of the deferred bonus amount awarded in shares.
Bonus shares are awarded to recognise the interest that a participant forgoes on the deferred part of the discretionary bonus.
Under mandatory ESAS awards, nil cost options are typically granted three years from award, subject to the discretion of the ESAS trustee.
Participants may then call for the shares plus two thirds of the bonus shares and any associated dividend shares.
If the nil cost option is not exercised by the end of the two year period, the ESAS trustee may release all shares, bonus shares and any dividend shares to the participant.
In addition to mandatory ESAS, participants may also request to waive any bonus or part of a bonus to which they may become entitled and request that a voluntary ESAS award be made to them in the form of a nil cost option.
Voluntary ESAS awards are typically fully exercisable after five years, and include bonus shares equal to 30% of the waived bonus amount.
Dividend shares may be awarded, as per mandatory ESAS awards.
On cessation of employment, a participant may forfeit an award depending on the reason for leaving.
Special provisions apply on a change of control.
ESAS is also used to make certain awards to facilitate the retention and recruitment of new joiners to the Group who have forfeited share awards on leaving previous employment.
Typically bonus shares are not awarded, though dividend shares may be awarded, as per mandatory ESAS awards.
ESAS is not an HMRC approved plan.

BGI EOP No BGI is Barclays asset management business headquartered in San Francisco.
The BGI Equity Ownership Plan BGI Equity BGI EOP was approved by shareholders at Barclays 2000 AGM to provide the employee share incentive Ownership Plan arrangements required to recruit and retain the quality of senior management and investment talent appropriate for building a global investment management business.
The BGI EOP was designed to provide participants with a long-term equity interest in BGI to meet the expectations of, in particular, BGIs key investment talent in the United States, who could expect to participate in the equity of their employer.
Under the terms of the BGI EOP, options were granted at fair value to key BGI employees over shares in Barclays Global Investors UK Holdings Limited BGI Holdings within an overall cap of 20% of the issued ordinary share capital of BGI Holdings.
No options were granted under the BGI EOP in 2008 and no further options will be granted.
The plan will not be renewed in 2010 when it comes to the end of its life.
All grants of options were approved by the Committee.
The Committee is also advised of option exercises and share sales by employees.
Employees who were executive Directors of Barclays PLC at the date of grant were not eligible to receive options under the BGI EOP.
In summary the BGI EOP operated as follows: certain key BGI employees were granted options over shares in BGI Holdings: the option exercise price was based on the fair value of a BGI Holdings share at the date of grant determined by an independent appraiser: the options generally vest evenly over a three-year period and can be exercised during the exercise windows which generally occur twice annually: option holders are required to fund the exercise without any financial support from any member of the Barclays Group.
Once employees become shareholders, they are subject to the Articles of BGI Holdings under which: shareholders are required to hold the shares for a minimum of 355 days.
As shareholders, employees derive the full risks and rewards of ownership, including voting rights and entitlement to any ordinary dividends paid by BGI Holdings: on expiry of the minimum holding period, shareholders may, but are not obliged to, offer their shares for sale to Barclays Bank PLC during the sales windows which generally occur twice annually: Barclays Bank PLC, at its discretion, has a right to purchase shares so offered, but is not obliged to do so.
The table below contains information on the number of shares in BGI Holdings over which options were granted, outstanding and exercised in 2007 and 2008: Number Number granted outstanding Number during year at year end exercised Year 000s 000s 000s 2007 2,599 7,502 1,632 2008 6,584 550 In 2008 BGI employees exercised options over 0.5m 2007: 1.6m shares for consideration of 19m 2007: 57m : Barclays Bank PLC purchased 1.8m 2007: 4.9m shares offered for sale by shareholders for consideration of 157m 2007: 488m.
As at 31st December 2008, employees owned 4.5% of BGI Holdings 2007: 5.9%.

Description BGI EOP Accounting and disclosure The BGI EOP is accounted for as an equity settled share-based payment in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
The fair value of the services received from the employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the share options granted on the date of the grant.
The cost of the employee services received in respect of the share options granted is recognised in the income statement over the period that the services are received.
The cost for 2008 of 30.9m 2007: 54.8m, 2006: 37.4m is included in staff costs in Note 8 to the accounts.
In accordance with IFRS 2, details of share options granted and exercised, together with weighted average fair values at grant date and weighted average exercise prices are set out in Note 45 to the accounts.
In accordance with IAS 33 Earnings per Share, unexercised options are taken into account in the calculation of diluted earnings per share as set out in Note 11 to the accounts.
For Group reporting, the exercise of options by employees is treated as a deemed disposal of interests in a subsidiary, as its holding in the subsidiary has been reduced for the consideration represented by the exercise price.
Any subsequent purchase of shares offered for sale by employees is treated as a purchase of an additional investment in a subsidiary entity.
The cash flows relating to these capital transactions are included in the consolidated cash flow statement and disclosed, along with other disposals and acquisitions, in Note 38 to the accounts and related movements in goodwill and minority interests are included in Notes 21 and 33 to the accounts respectively.
