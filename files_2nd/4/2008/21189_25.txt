objectives for 2009 A review of the Executive Remuneration A review of the proposed approach to the 2008 regulatory environment Directors Remuneration report An update on progress with the Committees 2008 and proposed 2009 work plans Governance 82 119 Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 103 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information The Companys EDs elected to take a basic pay freeze in 2009 and the Committee endorsed that proposal.
A further 45 members of senior management have similarly accepted a 2009 basic pay freeze.
The EDs will receive 2008 bonuses below as a percentage of basic salary those awarded in 2007 against the background of the overall performance of the Group, as set out in pages 22 to 27.
This is due to some of the demanding targets originally set in December 2007 not being met in full.
The Committee is conscious of the shareholders loss of value over the last year.
This loss was also felt by the EDs directly through the significantly lower value of the deferred ABP shares and LTIP shares granted in 2006, both of which will vest in March 2009.
This is a direct consequence of our reward strategy that seeks alignment between the shareholder and Executives interests.
Financial targets for the 2008 bonus Despite the unprecedented changes in the economic position over the year no changes were made to the targets for Executive Directors for 2008 which were set in December 2007.
The introduction of a One Aviva, Twice the Value OATTV Bonus Plan Details of how the OATTV plan operates are provided later in this report.
This plan is designed to align senior management firmly behind the Chief Executives aim of doubling Earnings per Share EPS from its end 2007 baseline by the end of 2012.
After significant debate the Committee satisfied itself that this additional element of remuneration would assist the delivery of a key part of the Groups strategy.
It was also satisfied that all or part of the bonus will vest only if stretching performance conditions are met.
Furthermore, grants under the plan are only expected to be made in 2009 and 2010 in addition to the grants made in 2008.
The plan was subject to extensive formal consultation with institutional shareholders and other stakeholders in advance of being put to Avivas Annual General Meeting AGM in 2008 where it was approved.
Planned Future Changes The Company does not anticipate any significant changes to the structure of EDs compensation packages in 2009, compared with that outlined below.
There are, however, two points to note:- Aviva is changing its financial reporting from a European Embedded Value EEV to a Market Consistent Embedded Value MCEV approach.
This required the Committee to consider how financial targets should be stated on the new MCEV basis.
In particular, the Committee has discussed how to treat the Return on Capital Employed ROCE element of new and subsisting LTIP grants on an MCEV basis.
It is comfortable that a move to MCEV ROCE will not make targets materially easier or more difficult to achieve.
The external economic climate against which financial targets for 2009 have been set is unprecedentedly volatile.
The level of stretch in the targets is very sensitive to the depth and duration of the economic downturn, which is currently highly uncertain.
The Committee have therefore decided to review mid year the financial targets used for bonus purposes for EDs and other senior managers.
Only in exceptional circumstances would the Committee consider amending financial targets, either up or down, and any significant change would be the subject of appropriate consultation.
Any changes would be fully disclosed and explained in the 2009 Annual Report issued in 2010.
The Company is required every five years to seek shareholder approval for the operation of its share based incentive plans.
The Committee has, in the past, carried out a comprehensive review of senior executive remuneration to coincide with this.
This has allowed the Company to put to shareholders proposals that reflect a thorough review of the Companys remuneration package taking into account changing market and regulatory practice and the requirement to ensure that the package remains competitive.
It had been the Committees intention to carry out such a review in 2009 with a view to putting proposals to the AGM in 2010.
Following due consideration, the Committee has determined that this review should be deferred until 2010.
Given the current turbulence in the economy, significant developments in relation to shareholder attitudes on executive pay, and emerging regulatory involvement from the Financial Services Authority FSA, the Committee considers that a more durable outcome will be obtained from a review carried out in 2010, when a number of these factors will be more settled.
Aviva plc 104 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Directors remuneration report continued The permission from shareholders given in 2005 will allow grants to be made under current arrangements up until the AGM in 2010.
New proposals will therefore be put to shareholders in 2011.
Notwithstanding this deferral of the full review, the Committee has undertaken a high level review of Avivas remuneration practices against the preliminary good practice criteria issued by the FSA.
The initial assessment identified generally strong alignment of the Companys current practices with the FSA criteria.
However, this is an area that will be kept under closer review during the year as the FSA develops its guidance both generally and specifically in relation to the insurance sector.
Remuneration policy Alignment with Group Strategy The Committee considers alignment between Group strategy and the remuneration of its senior executives, including EDs, to be critical.
It believes that senior executives should be highly rewarded on a market competitive basis for the delivery of stretching goals but should receive reduced rewards when the business performs poorly.
To achieve this alignment Avivas remuneration package is leveraged, with a high percentage of pay at risk against the achievement of stretching goals.
Furthermore two-thirds of any bonus and any LTIP grant are delivered in the form of Aviva shares.
The element of deferred bonus that is matched under the OATTV bonus plan only vests if very demanding EPS targets are met.
The requirements to defer bonus, participation in the LTIP and the OATTV bonus plan closely tie the long term value of executive remuneration to the Companys share price performance.
Senior executives thus have high exposure to the same benefits and drawbacks of share price movement as all shareholders.
The belief that senior executives should be shareholders is reinforced through formal guidelines requiring EDs to build up and maintain a significant holding of shares in the Company.
The Groups strategic priorities and targets are set out elsewhere in this report.
Those priorities are reflected closely in the remuneration package: Basic Salary: Internal and external equity in basic salary positioning is an important contributor to a motivational remuneration package.
A range of market data is used to inform decision making taking into account the Companys policy with regard to the FTSE 30 and FTSE 50.
Annual Bonus Plan ABP : Bonus structures are effective only if they drive, through the targets, the maintenance of the Company on a sound financial footing and sustained profitable growth.
In addition, the targets must not provide an incentive to promote behaviours which could be detrimental to the Companys long term interests.
Management must justify the targets it recommends.
The Committee assures itself that the targets, first, provide appropriate incentives and, second, are challenging.
The Committee also considers how, given changing economic circumstances, the Groups priorities and consequently the targets underpinning its bonus structures need to change.
Given the challenging current environment the Committee has agreed that financial targets for 2009 should focus more on capital conservation and strengthening the Groups liquidity than in previous years.
Financial targets sit alongside targets on customer advocacy and employee engagement introduced in 2005 that the Committee believes are critical to long-term organisational health.
The personal objectives of executive committee members are reviewed by the Committee to ensure they adequately reflect the strategic aims of the Group, good governance and best practice.
The One Aviva Twice the Value Bonus Plan OATTV : This plan was introduced to emphasise the Chief Executives clear strategic imperative for the Group to deliver growth in Earnings Per Share EPS, with a target of doubling EPS in five years from an end 2007 baseline.
No other element of executive remuneration was focused on EPS growth, and this bonus scheme directly aligns a portion of executive remuneration to this key strategic goal.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP : The LTIP encourages a longer-term management focus on ROCE and relative Total Shareholder Return TSR.
These metrics measure how the Company is performing in both absolute and relative terms.
The Committee considers all these elements, plus pension and other benefits, as a whole.
It looks to ensure that an appropriate balance is maintained between them so that the need for both short-term success and long-term sustainable growth is recognised.
The Committee also ensures that the non-financial business measures and individual objectives reflect adequately the Companys environmental, social and governance responsibilities.

Three of the financial targets operating profit, volume and new business contribution were stretched as set out in Table 6 due to their importance in achieving these aspirations.
Employee and customer targets each accounting for up to 10% of annual bonus are set taking into account performance to date and aspirations for the future.
The employee targets on leadership and engagement are derived from the Groups employee climate survey in which all business units participate and which over 42,000 staff completed in 2008.
This survey is delivered through an independent third party able to provide extensive external benchmark data.
Our aspiration is to reach the upper quartile positions compared to the relevant global and national norms on leadership and engagement over time.
Customer metrics do not yet have the same degree of consistency and external comparability in all business units as our employee climate survey.
During 2008 we moved towards a more consistent metric to measure customer advocacy.
Although there is still not complete alignment, all business units do have customer satisfaction and or advocacy targets from which we can derive suitable performance targets.
We expect our new measure to be used in most business units during 2009 and in all business units in 2010.
Internal assurance that the outcomes on employee and customer targets were accurately calculated and reported was provided to the Committee by Group Audit.
Personal objectives based on delivery of key strategic priorities, personal leadership and operating performance of the relevant portion of the business account for up to 30% of annual bonus.
The Groups performance against its financial, employee and customer KPIs in 2008, as they affected the bonus of the Chief Executive, is shown in Table 6 below.

The Committee is sensitive to the current environment in relation to executive pay, and particularly relating to the payment of bonuses in circumstances where financial targets have not been met and share prices have fallen.
However, the combination of financial and non-financial measures is central to the structure of the ABP.
The Committee wants to ensure a balanced focus on both short-term financial performance and on the objective non-financial measures that are leading indicators of future financial success.
This balance is, in the Committees view, reflective of good practice in incentive design and is consistent with the FSAs guidance on creating incentive schemes that have a focus on long-term sustainable performance.
As described above, the Committee took the view that it was important to maintain the integrity of the financial targets for the EDs, and so these were not adjusted during the year.
In the same way, the Committee believes that it is appropriate to pay bonus based on pre-agreed rigorous targets when these have been met.
As outlined earlier in this report, given the overall 2008 performance against the demanding targets set, the bonuses of the EDs fell in 2008 compared with 2007 as a percentage of basic salary.
To align with the business priorities for 2009, the financial measures at Group level for 2009 are operating profit, volume, new business margin, the Combined Operating Ratio COR of our general insurance businesses, net capital returns and cost savings.
Aviva plc 110 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Directors remuneration report continued One Aviva Twice the Value OATTV Bonus Plan The OATTV bonus plan aligns senior executives with the Chief Executives clear strategic imperative of doubling EPS by the end of 2012.
The plan matches 100% of the deferred ABP shares for the Chief Executive 75% for other EDs.
For the grant made in 2008 the vesting of these matched shares is dependent on the average annual growth in EPS during the three year performance period, thus: Less than 10% growth pa Nil 10% growth pa 0.1 for 1 26% growth pa 2 for 1 Matching is on a straight-line basis for performance between 10% and 26%.
The maximum match of 2 shares for each deferred share is paid for delivering a doubling of EPS by the end of 2010.
The threshold matching of 0.1 of a share for each share deferred is equivalent to doubling EPS by 2014.
The Committee reviews the performance conditions of this plan annually.
Long-Term Incentive Plan target setting The LTIP vests subject to the degree of achievement of two equally weighted performance measures chosen to reflect shareholders long-term interest in absolute ROCE and relative TSR performance.
Return on Capital Employed ROCE targets ROCE targets are set annually within the context of the Companys three year business plan and have to date been set on an EEV basis.
Vesting depends upon performance over the three year period against a target return.
The Companys external auditor provides a formal opinion on the ROCE vesting calculation.
The 2008 LTIP award ROCE targets are set out in Table 7 below: Table 7: 2008 LTIP ROCE targets ROCE over the three year performance period Percentage of shares in award that vests based on achievement of ROCE targets Less than 31.5% 0% 31.5% 15% Between 31.5% and 37.5% Pro rata between 15% and 50% on a straight-line basis 37.5% and above 50% The same performance targets will apply for the 2009 LTIP, except that the measure will be calculated using an MCEV reporting basis and not EEV.
Total Shareholder Return TSR targets Relative TSR determines the vesting of the other 50% of any LTIP award.
The comparator group for the assessment of relative TSR performance at the time of the 2008 grant comprised Aegon, Allianz, Axa, Fortis, Friends Provident, Generali, HBOS, ING, Legal and General, Lloyds TSB, Prudential, Royal Bank of Scotland, Royal and Sun Alliance, Standard Life and Zurich.
HBOS has since been delisted.
The 2006 and 2007 LTIP grants are based on the same comparator group, with the exception of Standard Life which was not included in 2006.
TSR vesting operates as set out in Table 8 below: Table 8: TSR vesting schedule for the 2008 award TSR position over the three year performance period Percentage of shares in award that vests based on achievement of TSR targets Below median 0% Median 15% Between median and upper quintile Pro rata between 15% and 50% on a straight-line basis Upper quintile and above 50% The same targets will apply for the 2009 LTIP awards.
The comparator group will remain unchanged other than the removal of HBOS.
The Committee has agreed a shortlist of companies that would be considered for inclusion in the comparator group, subject to final review, should any further member of the group be delisted.
Details of subsisting LTIP awards are provided on page 112 and Table 9 below shows the vesting projections non-audited of those awards as at 31 December 2008.
For subsisting grants where HBOS was a member of the comparator group the Committee has determined that HBOS TSR performance to the end of 2008 should be used and thereafter replaced by a synthetic TSR based on the average TSR performance of the remaining constituents of the comparator group for the remainder of the performance period.

The vesting assumption made in respect of the 2009 award for accounting purposes is 50%.
Since the LTIP has performance conditions attached to it, then one potential outcome is that neither performance condition is met and the whole of the LTIP lapses.
Table 10 below has been drawn up to assist in understanding the potential value of the LTIP awards made to executive directors in 2008 should the performance conditions be met in part or in whole.
Table 10: Potential value of 2008 LTIP awards rounded to nearest 100 LTIP Andrew Moss Philip Scott Mark Hodges Face value of grant 1,540,000 855,000 592,500 Threshold vesting 462,000 256,500 177,800 Expected value 891,400 494,900 342,900 Maximum vesting 2,049,700 1,138,000 788,600 Assumptions are as follows: Threshold vesting assumes TSR and ROCE elements vest at the minimum level, producing a 30% vesting of the total award.
No share price growth is assumed: Expected value, based on the vesting assumption made for accounting purposes, assumes TSR and ROCE elements vest at a combined rate of 50% of the total award.
Share price growth of 5% per annum is assumed over the three year performance period: Maximum vesting assumes both TSR and ROCE elements vest in full, producing a 100% vesting.
Share price growth of 10% per annum is assumed over the three year performance period.
At the end of the performance period for the 2005 LTIP grant, which vested in 2008, the Company was ranked 12th out of the 15 companies in the TSR comparator group 0% vesting and ROCE was 39.4% 50% vesting.
The total vesting was therefore 50%.
The 50% of the award which did not vest lapsed.
The LTIP vesting history is set out in Table 11 below.
Prior to the 2005 award vesting history is based on an earlier LTIP plan, the last award under which was made in 2004.

The actual price used to calculate the ABP and LTIP awards is based on a three-day average price.
The three-day average price used to grant the 2008 One Aviva twice the value award was 617p.
The performance period for all awards begins at the commencement of the financial year in which the award is granted.
The performance conditions for awards granted and vested during 2008 are explained elsewhere in this report.
The money value of awards will be calculated by multiplying the relevant number of shares by the market price at the date of vesting.
The award date for the awards which vested in 2008 was 24th March 2005.
These awards were granted to Mark Hodges before he was appointed to the board, and were held at the date of his appointment.
These awards were released to Mark Hodges before he was appointed to the board, and were not held at the date of his appointment.

This index has been chosen because it is a recognised equity market index, of which Aviva is a member.
The companies which comprise the current LTIP comparator group for TSR purposes were chosen on the basis of product and geographic match to Aviva and are listed above.
The TSR graph for the comparator group has been plotted using the 20 companies including Aviva in the comparator group for pre-2005 grants, the 15 companies including Aviva in the comparator group for 2005-07 grants and the 16 companies including Aviva in the comparator group for the 2008 grant.

Shares held in compulsory bonus deferrals and performance shares held in unvested LTIPs are not taken into account in applying this test.
As at 31 December 2008, based on that days closing share price of 390p, Mr Moss shareholding of 176,067 shares represented 74% of his basic salary of 925,000 his holding of 73,208 shares at 1 January 2008 represented 30.8% of his basic salary of 925,000 using the 31 December 2008 share price.
Mr Scotts shareholding of 400,973 shares represented 261% of his basic salary of 600,000 his holding of 291,106 shares at 1 January 2008 represented 189% and Mr Hodges shareholding of 100,086 shares represented 75% of his basic salary of 520,000 his holding of 79,873 shares at 26 June 2008 represented 59.9%.
External Board appointments Aviva recognises its senior executives can benefit from serving in a personal capacity as a non-executive director NED of non-Aviva Group companies.
It is, at the same time, conscious of the corporate governance recommendations that EDs should take account of the time commitment required by a NED position and ensure any such role does not impact their ability to carry out fully their executive duties.
The Company therefore has a policy of normally allowing senior executives to serve as a NED of one external company, subject to approval by the Board, and to retain any board fees.
The only ED who held an external NED appointment during 2008 was Philip Scott who was appointed to the Board of Diageo plc on 17 October 2007.
As an NED of Diageo plc Mr Scott received fees totalling 90,000 in 2008.
All-employee share plans EDs are eligible to participate in a number of HM Revenue & Customs HMRC approved all-employee share plans on the same basis as other eligible employees.
These plans include a share element of the Aviva All-Employee Share Ownership Plan AESOP.
Under this plan, eligible employees can receive up to a maximum of 3,000 per annum in shares based upon the profits of the Companys UK businesses.
The shares are free of tax subject to a retention period.
In addition, the partnership element of the AESOP, which the Company also operates, allows participants to invest up to 125 per month out of their gross salary in the Companys shares.
There is no matching to this investment by the Company.
The Aviva Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE allows eligible employees to acquire options over the Companys shares at a discount of up to 20% of their market value at the date of grant.
In order to exercise these options, participants must have saved through a three, five or seven-year HMRC approved savings contract, subject to a maximum savings limit of 250 per month.
Details of holdings under these plans can be found on page 119.
Dilution Awards granted under the Aviva employee shares plans are met by the funding of an employee trust administered by an external trustee that acquires shares in the market.
New issue shares will only be used where it is not possible to use trust shares and the funding policy is kept under review by the Committee and the Board.
Details of the shares currently held in the employee trusts are set out in note 30 to the accounts.
During November 2008 a loan of 32 million was made to RBC Trustees CI Limited to ensure sufficient shares were available to meet its ongoing liabilities.

NEDs receive a basic annual fee in respect of their Board duties.
A further fee is paid to NEDs other than the Chairman in respect of membership and, where appropriate, chairmanship of Board Committees.
Fees are reviewed annually and are set by the Board to attract individuals with the required range of skills and experience.
In determining the level of fees paid to the NEDs the Board receives recommendations from the EDs, who consider the NEDs duties and responsibilities, together with the time commitment required in preparing for and attending meetings, and the amounts paid by competitors and similar-sized companies.
The Chairman and NEDs do not participate in any incentive or performance plans or pension arrangements.
The Companys Articles of Association provide that the total aggregate remuneration paid to the Chairman and NEDs will be determined by the Board within the limits set by shareholders.
The current aggregate limit of 1.5 million was approved by shareholders at the Companys 2005 Annual General Meeting.
The amount paid in 2008 was 1.23 million.
EDs are remunerated under their service contracts and receive no additional fee for serving as directors.

All the EDs received life assurance benefits during the year that relate to the cost incurred by the Company of insuring the directors life and relevant spouses benefits which, had the director died during the year, could not have been wholly paid by the pension scheme and would therefore have been met by the Company had the insurance not been in place.
The disclosure also includes the cost of private medical insurance and, where appropriate, accompanied travel, accommodation and car benefits.
All the numbers disclosed include the tax charged on the benefits.
No directors received an expense allowance during the year.

Mr Moss ceased accrual in the ASPS with effect from 31 March 2006, and as a result, his post March 2006 Pension Benefit was 19,556 pa.
This will increase in line with deferred pensions the lower of the increase in RPI or 5% subject to the life time allowance.
At 31 December 2008 it had increased to 21,042 pa. 2.
Mr Scott has been accruing benefits in the ASPS since before June 1989, so was not therefore subject to the HMRCs Earnings Cap.
Following pensions simplification Mr Scott registered with HMRC for enhanced protection.
He remains a member of the scheme and continues to accrue benefits as a result of salary increases.
However, he is not accruing benefits as a result of additional service.
Mr Scotts pension will be based upon his final pensionable salary and years of service at retirement, subject to an overriding limit of two-thirds of final pensionable salary.
Mr Scott has a pre-existing commitment that were he to retire up to two years before his normal retirement age of 60, then he would receive a non-discounted pension.
This commitment was entered into prior to the publication of ABI Guidelines issued in December 2006, which made reference to early retirement terms for directors.
Mr Hodges ceased accrual in the ASPS with effect from 31 March 2006, and as a result, his post March 2006 Pension Benefit was 75,000 pa.
This will increase in line with deferred pensions the lower of the increase in RPI or 5%.
Mr Hodges was appointed as an ED from 26 June 2008.
His benefits shown above are therefore as at that date not 1 January 2008 and as at 31 December 2008.
At 31 December 2008 his accrued pension was 80,700 pa. 4.
The accrued pension is the amount of annual pension to which the Directors would have been entitled to at age 60, had they left service at 31 December 2008.
Members of the Defined Benefit section of the ASPS made a contribution of 5% of their pensionable salary.
The change in transfer values over the year include the effect of changes made by the Trustee of the ASPS to the assumptions used in respect of changes to market values and expected future investment returns.
The Trustees changed the long term financial and mortality assumptions for transfer values with an effective date of 1 July 2008.
Transfer values represent the estimated liability on the Scheme to pay the stated level of benefits.
They are not sums paid or due to a Director, and do not represent the true cost of providing the pension benefit.
No former Directors received any increase in retirement benefits in excess of the amount to which they were entitled, on the later of the date when the Benefits first became payable, or 31 March 1997.
Share incentive plans Details of the directors who held executive office for any part of the financial year, and hold or held options to subscribe for ordinary shares of the Company or hold or held awards over shares in the Company, pursuant to the Companys share-based incentive plans, are set out in Table 20 below.

Long Term Incentive Awards are awards granted under the LTIP which vest only if the performance conditions are achieved.
OATTV awards are granted as a match to the bonus plan awards under the ABP and vest only if the performance conditions are achieved.
Options are options over shares granted under the SAYE 6.
