Front-End-Final-AW 17 4 09 14:33 Page 65 65 Directors Remuneration Report Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations.
The report also meets the relevant requirement of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Corporate Governance set out in The Combined Code appended to the Listing Rules relating to directors remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, the Company will propose a resolution to approve the Report at the Annual General Meeting.
The Report contains separate sections for unaudited and audited information as the Regulations require the auditors to report to the Companys members on the auditable part of the Directors Remuneration Report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the Report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Regulations.
Unaudited information REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The Company has established a Remuneration Committee, constituted in accordance with the recommendations of The Combined Code.
The members of the Committee are Christopher Forbes Chairman and Richard Scholes, who are independent Non-executive Directors.
Robert Deutsch also served as a Remuneration Committee member until his resignation on 31 December 2008.
The Committee met on 4 occasions during the year and attendance by members was as follows: Committee member Number of meetings attended total 4 C D Forbes Chairman 4 R V Deutsch resigned 31 12 08 3 R T Scholes 4 None of the members of the Committee has any personal financial interest in the Company other than as shareholders, conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships, or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board.
No Executive Director plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
In determining the Directors remuneration for the year, the Committee consulted Ewen Gilmour Chief Executive Officer about its proposals.
REMUNERATION POLICY The Group designs executive remuneration packages to attract, motivate and retain directors and employees of the high calibre needed to maintain the Groups position as a market leader and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders.
The Committee undertakes the performance measurement of the Executive Directors and the determination of their annual remuneration package.
The Executive Directors of the Board determine the remuneration of the Chairman and Non-executive Directors within limits set out in the Articles of Association.
The Company operates in a market where earnings can be cyclical and extremely volatile depending on the mixture of premium rates, claims made and investment returns.
Consequently, remuneration policy is designed so that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the Executive Directors is performance related and therefore very variable.
The remuneration package for executive directors and senior management can be divided between fixed and variable elements: 1.
Fixed elements Basic annual salary and benefits Pension arrangements Basic annual salary and benefits The Committee determines an executive directors basic salary prior to the beginning of each year or when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a whole and relies on research that gives up-to-date information on a comparator group of companies, comprising 10 companies within the sector.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the Company with the Chairmans permission and providing that directors account for all fees from all such appointments to the Company.
In addition to basic salary, the Executive Directors receive certain benefits-in-kind, principally a car allowance and private medical insurance.
For 2009, cash benefits for example car allowance have been added to basic salary, as they have for all employees, in order to simplify remuneration structure.
Executive Directors are also eligible to participate in both the SAYE and the SIP Schemes, which are open to all employees.
Chaucer Holdings PLC Annual Report 2008 Front-End-Final-AW 17 4 09 14:33 Page 66 66 Directors Remuneration Report Pension arrangements All the Executive Directors are members of the defined benefits section of the Chaucer Pension Scheme.
Their dependants are eligible for pensions of 50 per cent of the members prospective entitlement and, in the event of death in service, the payment of a lump sum of 4 x basic salary.
The pension arrangements provide for a pension on retirement of 2 3 capped salary after 30 years eligible service, except that R A Stuchberys entitlement was uncapped until A-Day, 6 April 2006.
Executive Directors pension entitlements are disclosed on page 74.
No other payments to directors are pensionable.
All members of the defined benefit section contribute 4% of basic salary up to the salary cap for the time being.
There are no unfunded pension promises or similar arrangements for directors.
Variable elements Annual Bonus Scheme Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP and other Long Term Incentive Plans The Annual Bonus Scheme and DSBP act closely together to: act as a significant retention mechanism, through the deferral for 3 years of any bonus in excess of 150% of salary and at least 25% of bonus below that amount: provide material alignment between director and senior executive and shareholder interests as the whole value of deferred bonus is converted into Chaucer shares.
Alignment is further enhanced though the award of dividend shares and matching shares dependent on performance criteria: and reduce the amplitude of individual earnings variability.
The Annual Bonus Scheme provides for 15% of the bonus pool created in any year to be deferred thereby reducing annual bonuses in very good years and providing a pool of cash to augment annual bonuses in poor years.
This process also supports retention.
The significant fall in Chaucers share price over the last year has been mirrored by the fall in value of deferred shares in which directors and senior executives are interested.
Clear and strong alignment with shareholder interests has thereby been demonstrated.
Both schemes are described in detail below.
Annual Bonus Scheme This Scheme operates by creating a bonus pool, based on Company operating profit relative to return on net asset value NAV, which is then divided into two sections, one to be distributed amongst some 55 senior executives and one amongst all other employees.
Since 2006, the Annual Bonus Scheme has operated in conjunction with the Deferred Share Bonus Plan see page opposite.
Annual bonuses are calculated in accordance with the following paragraphs.
No value accrues to the bonus pool until operating profit exceeds a 9% return on NAV: thereafter the Scheme allocates profit into the pool in accordance with agreed return bands.
15% of the bonus pool is deferred to facilitate bonus payments in years of poorer performance.
The proportion of profit allocation and the amount of the pool allocated to senior executives increases with increased returns, except for the highest return band where the proportion of profit allocation falls.
The pattern of profit allocation operates to create an expectation of lower bonus payments to individuals in years of poor or average performance and higher ones in years of exceptional performance.
There is no bonus ceiling compared to base salary.
The intention is to drive performance and therefore shareholder value.
The mathematical operation of the Scheme determines half of the amount of an individuals bonus based on profit and personal performance determines the other half.
Bonuses for all the Executive Directors are determined by the Remuneration Committee and for other senior executives by the Executive Directors.
Payment of the cash element of executive bonuses is split between April and the following January to provide a retention mechanism.
The operation of the DSBP further enhances the retention.
The 2008 results produced a loss, and therefore no contribution into the bonus pool.
The Remuneration Committee at its meeting on 4 March 2009 approved a release of 2.3 million from the deferred bonus pool for distribution amongst senior executives but excluding the Executive Directors.
That distribution was in accordance with the stated objective of reducing the amplitude of individuals earnings variability.
Chaucer Holdings PLC Annual Report 2008 Front-End-Final-AW 17 4 09 14:33 Page 67 67 Directors Remuneration Report Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP Shareholders approved the DSBP at the AGM held on 25 May 2006.
Broadly, it aims to provide both an incentive over the long term and a retention mechanism.
Watson Wyatt provided assistance in the design of the Scheme, which operates in conjunction with the Annual Bonus Scheme.
Under the DSBP, there is deferral of a proportion of the Annual Bonus for a period of 3 years.
Certain elements of the deferred proportion are eligible for an award of Matching Shares, subject to the attainment of defined performance criteria.
The DSBP facilitates the build up by senior executives of holdings in Chaucer shares, which are significant relative to base salary, thereby creating very strong alignment with shareholder interests and a significant retention incentive, as demonstrated by the tables of directors interests.
The DSBP operates as follows.
First, the Scheme compulsorily defers any bonus in excess of 150% of salary into Chaucer shares.
These deferred shares, which are not eligible for Matching Shares, vest after three years unless the recipient leaves Chaucer during this period, in which case, subject to good leaver provisions and Remuneration Committee discretion, the recipient forfeits the shares.
Of the bonus of up to 150% of salary, the recipient must compulsorily defer 25% and may elect to defer up to another 25%, into Chaucer shares.
All of these shares are eligible for Matching Shares, which are awarded at the end of the 3-year retention period depending on performance against two performance criteria.
All deferred shares but not Matching Shares are eligible for dividend shares, which also vest at the end of the retention period.
Matching Shares may be awarded up to a maximum ratio to eligible deferred shares of 2 for 1.
The number of Matching Shares for any award divides equally between two performance criteria measured over three years.
Total Shareholder Return TSR performance criteria Degree of Chaucers TSR outperformance against index comprising Number of Matching Shares awarded for each basket of ILVs weighted for market capitalisation at the start of the period deferred share subject to this TSR test Below 15% above the index No match From 15% above but less than 45% above the index 0.5-2:1 match is on a straight line basis between these figures Equal to or above 45% above of the index 2:1 The Scheme measures TSR from the date of award to the third anniversary of the date of award.
The Company chose this performance measure since it provides a comparison of Chaucers performance relative to an index of a peer group of listed specialist insurers.
This comprised the following companies for the 2008 awards: Advent Capital Holdings PLC, Amlin plc, Beazley Group plc, Brit Insurance Holdings plc, Catlin Group Limited, Hardy Underwriting Group plc, Heritage Underwriting Agency plc, Highway Insurance Holdings Plc, Hiscox Limited, Omega Insurance Holdings Limited and Novae Group plc.
An external advisor with experience in such calculations will be engaged to assess actual TSR against the index.
Net Asset Value NAV performance criteria The increase in Chaucers NAV per share compared Number of Matching Shares awarded for with the Retail Price Index over 3 years each deferred share subject to this NAV Less than RPI 15% No match From RPI 15% to RPI 45% 0.5-2:1 match is on a straight line basis between these figures In excess of RPI 45% 2:1 The scheme measures NAV per share from the end of the accounting period prior to the award of the grant to the end of the accounting period before the award is due to vest.
The Company chose this performance measure as it indicates the success of management in growing the assets of the company.
It is expected that this performance criteria will be reviewed by the external auditors.
The Scheme does not allow retesting.
Leavers lose all rights to deferred shares, except if they fall under the good leaver provisions or the Remuneration Committee exercises its discretion.
On a takeover or winding-up of the Company, all Deferred Bonus Shares and Dividend Awards will vest in full.
All Matching Shares will vest to an extent if any and at such time as the Remuneration Committee determines, provided that the Remuneration Committee will take into account the extent that the performance conditions imposed have been satisfied at that date and the foreshortened performance period, and the number of Matching Shares which shall vest shall be reduced on a time-apportioned basis.
Chaucer Holdings PLC Annual Report 2008 Front-End-Final-AW 17 4 09 14:33 Page 68 68 Directors Remuneration Report Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS Following the adoption of the DSBP, the Committee has made no further awards under the ESOS, although unexercised options remain.
CHAUCER HOLDINGS PLC UNAPPROVED SHARE OPTION SCHEME Options currently outstanding and granted between the start of the Scheme in July 1998 and May 2003 are subject to a performance target as described under the Chaucer Holdings PLC Approved Share Option Scheme below.
Options granted under this Scheme after May 2003 are subject to revised performance targets.
For example, the first 20,000 of options are only exercisable if the total shareholder return that is to say, share price growth plus reinvested dividends on Chaucer shares exceeds that of the FTSE All Share Index by more than 2% per annum over the three years from grant.
If the total shareholder return misses this target, options are only exercisable if total shareholder return from grant of the option exceeds the RPI by more than 3% over the same or a longer period.
These test levels increase by 1% for the next 20,000 of options granted to an individual and by a further 1% for any additional options.
Introduction of these revised targets reflected the volatility of the insurance market, so that the benefits available under the Scheme should not be too easily achieved in buoyant market conditions and not impossible to attain during quieter periods of the market cycle.
CHAUCER HOLDINGS PLC APPROVED SHARE OPTION SCHEME This share option scheme, approved by shareholders in 2001, operates in conjunction with the Unapproved Share Option Scheme described above.
It allows the Company the ability to grant options over shares up to a value of 30,000 to any individual employee in a more tax efficient manner than under the Unapproved Performance-Related Share Option Scheme.
On 17 May 2001, the Company made an initial grant of options under the Scheme.
The options are exercisable at any time between three and ten years of the date of grant, subject to total shareholder return of the Company over any consecutive three-year period after grant of the options exceeding the average total shareholder return of the companies in the FTSE All Share Index over the same period.
Share usage Overall usage of new issue shares for all share schemes remains well within ABI limits to prevent excessive dilution.
The rules of each share scheme replicate those limits.
Typically, SAYE maturities have historically been satisfied through a mixture of new issue shares and market purchase shares, either directly or from the Employee Benefit Trust.
Partnership, Matching, Free and Dividend Shares under the SIP have all very largely been met through market purchase shares either directly or through the Employee Benefit Trust.
Occasionally, as for example in 2006, new issue shares have been used to satisfy part of the Free Share awards where it was not possible to satisfy the whole award through market purchases.
Historically, the Group has met the exercise of ESOS awards through market purchase shares, although more recently, many have been cash settled based on closing market price on day of exercise to avoid dealing and spread costs to both Company and participant.
The Group has established an Employee Benefit Trust to hedge the cost of DSBP awards against share price increases and to facilitate vesting administration.
At 31 December 2008, the Trust held some 29.5 million shares to satisfy awards under any share scheme.
Those shares have been entirely purchased in the market.

Transfer values have been calculated in line with the relevant UK regulations.
The value of net increase d represents the incremental value to the director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption that service terminated at the year-end.
It is based on the accrued pension increase b after deducting the director's contribution.
The change in the transfer value e includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and directors, such as stock market movements.
It is calculated after deducting the director's contribution.
Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
