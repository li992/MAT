The outstanding awards are as follows: Executive Share Options The last grants under the Executive Share Option Scheme were made on 17 April 2003.
Other than those granted to Gerry Murphy which have lapsed, the options vest from three to 10 years of the grant date subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition which generally requires the growth in the Companys Earnings Per Share EPS over a three-year period to have exceeded that of the Retail Price Index RPI plus 6%.
The criteria were set and approved by shareholders when the scheme was established in 1993 and were judged at the time to be appropriate criteria.
On exercise, only the cash equivalent to any gain will be paid and disclosed as remuneration at that time.
2 The performance conditions for all options have been met with the exception of the final grant made on 17 April 2003.
