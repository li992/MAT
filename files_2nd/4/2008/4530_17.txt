Section 3 Management and Governance REMUNERATION REPORT This Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 August 2008 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee on behalf of the board for approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 13 January 2009.
The report complies with the requirements of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority, the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and the provisions of the 2006 Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
PART 1: UNAUDITED INFORMATION THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The Remuneration Committee comprises the following non-executive directors: Richard Gillingwater Committee Chairman, Adam Crozier, Peter Long, Dennis Millard and Paul Pindar appointed on 18 October 2007.
The Company Secretary is secretary to the Committee.
There were four meetings of the Committee during the year under review with a further two meetings being held on 28 January 2008 and 30 April 2008 which were held by way of written resolution.
The individual attendance of the directors is detailed in the table within the Corporate Governance Report on page 49.
The Committee has responsibility for setting the remuneration of the executive directors and the Company Secretary, reviewing the appropriateness and relevance of the remuneration policy and administering all aspects of any share schemes in operation for senior management.
The Committees terms of reference can be downloaded from the Companys website at www.
During the year the Committee appointed Mercer Limited Mercer to provide it with independent advice on directors remuneration and share plans.
Mercer also provides industry and comparative employee remuneration data to Debenhams management.
The Committee has also consulted with the Companys Chairman, Chief Executive, Finance Director and Human Resources Director but not on matters relating to their own compensation or contracts.
The Remuneration Committee reviews external data produced through surveys and benchmarking from Mercer about total remuneration in other comparable companies, and the elements of that total remuneration, in order to inform its consideration of the remuneration of Company executives.
REMUNERATION POLICY It is the Companys policy to provide remuneration packages that will attract, motivate and retain high calibre employees in a competitive retail market and, where possible, to do this in the most cost eective way for the business.
In addition to basic salary and pension provision the Company seeks to incentivise its employees through an annual bonus scheme and through its share schemes.
The committees policy is to weight executive directors remuneration towards performance-linked pay and thus to strike a balance between short and long term incentives.
However with the exception of grants made to Angela Spindler on her appointment to the Board, the main Board Directors declined to receive grants under the Companys long term incentive plans in 2007 08.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the current arrangements and is consulting with shareholders to makes changes to short and and long-term incentives for the year 2008 09 to ensure that overall the compensation arrangements remain competitive and drive performance in the current challenging economic environment.
It is proposed that grants will be made to executive directors under the Performance Share Plan in which the directors already participate and the Executive Share Option Plan.
COMPONENTS OF REMUNERATION BASE SALARY The Committee considers base salary and salary increases for executives based on the median level paid within a group of comparable companies in the FTSE 350 Retail sector, and in the context of salary increases across the Groups wider employee population.
To ensure the attraction and retention of the quality of individuals required to successfully run the business, the Committees policy is for base pay to be at or close to the market median of companies of a comparative enterprise value.
In line with the rate of payroll ination across the employee population as a whole the salaries of the executive directors increased in 2007 08 by 2.5 per cent.
For the year 2008 09 the directors have elected to take a pay freeze in light of the uncertain market conditions faced by the industry.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS BONUS SCHEMES The annual bonus scheme for executive directors focuses on the achievement of specic numerical business targets.
The maximum bonus potential for 2007 08 was 100 per cent salary and the targets composed of three independent elements: profit, net debt and like-for-like sales.
The net debt target was the only target to be achieved.
Given the degree of focus on the Companys debt structure, the Remuneration Committee determined that this was a creditable result in a dicult year and that the bonus award of 20 per cent base salary should be paid.
In the case of Angela Spindler this bonus was pro-rated.
Although the scheme provides for the bonus to be paid in cash, after discussions with the committee, several of the executive directors have elected to receive this bonus in the form of shares, net of tax.
Following the review of the current arrangements, the Remuneration Committee is consulting with shareholders with regard to proposed changes to the bonus potential for the executive directors bonus scheme.
It is proposed that the performance targets consist of the key financial metrics of PBT and net debt hurdles.
THE DEBENHAMS PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN THE PSP The Committee has discretion to grant awards under the PSP up to a maximum of 200 per cent of base salary to executive directors and other senior executives.
Up to 250 per cent of base salary may be awarded in exceptional circumstances e. g. for recruitment and this year, the Committee exercised its discretion in this regard on the appointment of Angela Spindler as Managing Director.
On vesting, executives may receive shares, the number of which is determined by the extent to which a performance condition is achieved, provided that they remain employed in the Group.
Awards under the PSP comprise an option to receive free shares or a nil cost option.
52 Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Section 3 Management and Governance Awards under the PSP will normally only vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant and must be exercised within six months of vesting subject to satisfaction of performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the time awards are granted and if the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the underlying financial performance of the Company over the performance period is sucient to justify the vesting of the award.
Awards made up to 2007 08 under the PSP are subject to two performance targets.
Fifty per cent of the award is based on the Adjusted Earnings Per Share EPS growth of the Company above the percentage increase in the Retail Price Index RPI over a three-year performance period and the other 50 per cent is based on the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR against the weighted TSR of the FTSE 350 General Retailers Index over a three-year performance period.
Under the discretion aorded to it in the Scheme rules, the Committee reviewed the EPS targets for 2007 08.
In determining the EPS targets for 2007 08, the Committee took into consideration the current business plan, prevailing economic conditions and shareholder expectations.
It took advice from Mercer, including their analysis of brokers consensus forecasts.
The Committee considered TSR to be an appropriate measure of shareholder value and it chose the FTSE 350 General Retailers Index for comparison.
The Committee determined that a weighted index was a fairer and more reasonable method of determining relative performance as opposed to a conventional TSR ranking as it factors in the size of each comparator company and therefore the absolute levels of value that each company generates relative to its size.
When determining the TSR requirement for maximum vesting, the Committee took into consideration the historical TSR performance of the comparator companies over the last ten years.
A three-month average TSR at the start and end of the performance period will be used to mitigate the eect of any short-term share price volatility.
If one or both of the performance conditions are not met at the end of the performance period, 50 per cent or 100 per cent as appropriate of the awards will lapse immediately without any opportunity to re-test the relevant performance condition.

The Remuneration Committee has not determined what performance conditions will apply to awards under the DBMP although it is intended that they be appropriately demanding and linked to the Companys performance.
If the performance target is not met at the end of the performance period, the awards will lapse immediately and there will be no opportunity to re-test the performance condition.
No awards have yet been made under the DBMP.
THE DEBENHAMS RETAIL EMPLOYEE TRUST 2004 THE TRUST The Debenhams Retail Employee Trust 2004 was originally set up to satisfy share options under the Debenhams Employee Option Plan.

Dividends receivable on the shares held in the Trust are waived on the recommendation of the Company.
The Debenhams Employee Option Plan is now obsolete as it was a plan used by the Company when it was a private company.
In 2008 the Company intends to use shares in the trust to operate a new plan called the Debenhams 2008 Share Incentive Plan.
Under this plan, options vesting in 12 monthstime will be granted to a small group of key executives below board level who the Company wishes to retain and incentivise in the short to medium term.
54 Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Section 3 Management and Governance FUNDING OF SHARE SCHEMES It is the Companys current intention to satisfy any future requirements of its share schemes in a method best suited to the interests of the Company, either by acquiring shares in the market or, subject to institutional guidelines, issuing new shares.
CHANGE OF CONTROL The rules of the Companys share schemes provide that in the event of a change of control, awards options would vest to the extent that the performance conditions are satisfied at the date of such event.
Any such early vesting would be on a time pro-rata basis.

Angela Spindler entered into her service agreement on 3 December 2007 and commenced employment on 4 February 2008.
Each agreement is terminable by either party giving not less than 12 monthswritten notice, save that Michael Sharp is required to give the Company six monthsnotice.
It is the Companys policy that the notice periods of executive directors should not exceed one year.
The Remuneration Committee has considered the financial consequences of early termination of directors service contracts: in order to limit and provide certainty in the event of termination of a contract without cause, the directors contracts contain liquidated damages clauses.
If the Company terminates the employment without due notice, other than in circumstances such as gross misconduct or other immediate justifiable cause, the Company is required to make a payment equal to the aggregate of the executive directors basic salary and the value of their contractual benets for the notice period.
Messrs Templeman, Woodhouse and Sharp are also entitled to a payment equal to the average of the annual bonus paid to the executive director in the two bonus years prior to the termination of employment.
This provision is not included in the service contract entered into with Ms Spindler.
Executive directors are entitled, in addition to salary, to other benets or equivalent cash allowances, the value of which is set out in the table of directors emoluments, including company car and fuel, life, medical, dental and personal accident insurance together with product discount.
Rob Templeman and Chris Woodhouses contracts permit each of them to hold up to two non-executive directorships in non-competing companies and to retain payments received in respect of those other directorships.
Chris Woodhouse, who is Group Non-executive Chairman of Gondola Group Limited, retained fees of 150,000 2007: 104,032.
Angela Spindler, who holds a non-executive directorship for Manchester Airport plc, which was approved by the board on appointment, retained fees of 14,584 in respect of that non-executive directorship during the period from her appointment to the board to 30 August 2008.
