Elements of remuneration audited information The Tomkins 2006 Performance Share Plan continued The PSP is a long-term incentive plan as detailed in the 2006 AGM circular.
The purpose of the PSP is two-fold.
Current incentive schemes continued First, to provide a share-based long-term incentive arrangement for senior executives that more closely Annual Bonus Incentive Plan continued aligns the interests of executives with shareholders.
The bonus awards are payable to senior participants, Secondly, the PSP is in substitution of the Companys including Executive Directors, as to four-sevenths in legal obligation to the CEO to provide annual grants cash, one-seventh in bonus shares and two-sevenths of options, which had previously been satisfied by the in deferred shares.

The bonus is paid at the end of June, and the assistance of PA Consulting Group, devised September and December based on 75% of the bonus a plan that achieves those aims.
The PSP will provide earned to the end of the previous quarter, with the rewards in future years only if shareholders have seen balance of the full entitlement to the bonus for the value created over the preceding three years.

Increases in annual base salary of all participants, including Executive Directors, are restricted to the equivalent rate of increase in the Retail Prices Index in the UK or equivalent index in the country in which a participant works.
The restrictions on the increases in salary, together with the growth in bonus, assuming increases in bonusable profit, will result in the incentive pay element of remuneration increasing over time.
