Directors Remuneration Report Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 the Act.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the Report will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on certain parts of this report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Act.
This report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited Information Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is responsible to the Board for formulating and recommending to the Board remuneration policy and strategy for the Executive Directors.
The Committee also reviews individual remuneration packages of the Executive Directors, including terms and conditions of employment and any changes, and reviews the general remuneration framework for the senior management of the Group.
The Committee also approves the operation of any Group share-based incentive schemes, including any Long Term Incentive Plans LTIPs.
The Committees terms of reference are available on the Group website.
The membership of the Remuneration Committee during 2008 was as follows: Period of membership 2008 P Kirby Chairman of Committee 1 Jan 31 Dec D Mapp 1 Jan 17 Mar S Watson 1 Jan 31 Dec B ONeill 17 Mar 31 Dec None of the members who served on the Committee during the year had any personal financial interest other than as a shareholder of the Company, conflicts of interests arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board.
The principal activities carried out by the Committee during 2008 were: determination of the Executive Directors bonuses for 2007: LTIP awards: determination of performance conditions, vesting of 2005 grant to senior management and new awards for both Executive Directors and senior management: Vesting of the Share Matching Plan for Executive Directors: Consideration and approval of the Remuneration Report for 2007 Annual Report: Monitoring of senior management remuneration: Determination of Non-Executive Chairmans and Executive Directors remuneration: and Initial consideration of a review of existing share-based remuneration for the Executive Directors.
In determining the Executive Directors remuneration the Committee consulted the Chairman about its proposals: no Executive Director played a part in any decision about his or her own remuneration.
The Committee also engaged independent remuneration consultants Hewitt New Bridge Street Hewitt to provide advice on the structure and operation of Directors remuneration packages and the Companys share incentive arrangements.
Hewitt were appointed by the Committee and do not provide any other services to the Group.
The Company Secretary, John Burton, also provided assistance to the Committee during the year.
Remuneration Policy The remuneration of the Executive Directors is designed to provide for a competitive compensation package which reflects the Groups performance against financial objectives and personal performance criteria.
It rewards above-average performance and is designed to attract, motivate and retain high-calibre executives.
The performance measurement of the Executive Directors and the determination of their annual remuneration packages are undertaken by the Committee.
There are five elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors as follows: basic annual salary: benefits: annual bonus: share incentives: and retirement and life assurance benefits.
32 Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 Directors Remuneration Report continued The Companys policy is that a clear majority of the maximum potential remuneration of the Executive Directors should be performance-related.
As described further below, Executive Directors may earn annual bonus payments of up to 100% of their basic salaries and benefit from participation in a performance-based LTIP under which for 2008 the maximum conditional award was also equal to 100% of basic salary.
Bonus payments for 2008 were entirely based on EPS performance while vesting of LTIP awards granted thus far has been also conditional upon EPS growth subject to a total shareholder return TSR underpin.
The Remuneration Committee is able to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues when setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
In its judgment its remuneration policies, for both Executive Directors and senior management, do not raise environmental, social or governance operational risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside of the Company provided that the Chairman determines that it is appropriate.
During 2008 Peter Rigby served as Non-Executive Chairman of Electric Word plc, for which he received and retained fees of 12,000.
David Gilbertson, who ceased to be Chief Executive on 17 March 2008, served as Non-Executive Chairman of John Brown Media Group Limited, for which he received and retained the relevant proportion of annual fees of 30,000.
Basic Salary The basic salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee prior to the beginning of each year and upon a change of position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers pay practices in the Group as a whole and makes reference to objective research which gives current information on appropriate comparator groups of companies.
Following the departure of David Gilbertson, Peter Rigby was requested to take on a substantial proportion of Mr Gilbertsons responsibilities.
As a result, the Board followed the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, which had taken advice from Hewitt, to increase Peter Rigbys base salary to 700,000 with effect from 1 April 2008.
It was also determined that his potential bonus for the year would be based on his salary.
A review at the end of 2008 was undertaken with the assistance of Hewitt.
It included a comparison of benchmark data from two comparator groups of companies, one drawn from the FTSE All Share Media Index, of which the Company is a constituent member, and the other drawn from the FTSE All Share Index which comprised companies of a broadly similar size to Informa in terms of market capitalisation, turnover and overseas operations.
Following its review, the Committee concluded that it was appropriate to maintain the annual basic salaries of the Executive Directors for the 2009 financial year at their rates prevailing at the end of the 2008 financial year, which reflect the scale of the Groups business, their attendant responsibilities and their continued strong performance: P Rigby 700,000 A Walker 425,000 Benefits Each of the Executive Directors receives a benefit allowance of 25,000 per annum together with private medical insurance cover and permanent health insurance cover.
Annual Bonus Each of the Executive Directors has the opportunity to earn a bonus of up to 100% of basic salary, subject to the achievement of challenging performance criteria set by the Committee.
In respect of the year ended 31 December 2008, a bonus of up to 100% of basic salary could be earned based on achievement of a sliding scale of challenging diluted adjusted earnings per share EPS targets set at the end of the preceding financial year.
For the 2008 financial year the Committee declined to base any element of bonus on achievement of personal objectives.
As part of his recruitment arrangements, Adam Walkers bonus for 2008 was based on his annual salary for the full year.
Applying the sliding scale formula, a bonus of 96.2% of basic salary was awarded to each of Mr Rigby and Mr Walker for the 2008 financial year, which reflects another year of very strong financial performance and related significant outperformance against the challenging targets set.
The Remuneration Committee continues to consider adjusted diluted EPS to be the most suitable financial measurement to determine performance and align the interests of the Executive Directors with those of the Companys shareholders for the purpose of determination of bonuses as this measurement of performance can be directly influenced by the performance of the Executive Directors and is a key driver in generating returns to shareholders.
The Committee retains a discretion to look at other appropriate benchmarks.
Accordingly, it has determined for 2009 to revert to an award of up to 20% of basic salary for the achievement of objective personal goals which would be set with the primary aim of enhancing shareholder value.
For 2009 a bonus of up to 80% of basic salary will be dependent upon achievement of a sliding scale of challenging diluted adjusted EPS targets which are set at levels to encourage and reward the delivery of exceptional levels of performance.
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right, however, to adjust the calculation if it believes that it is justified by changes in circumstances.
Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 33 Directors Remuneration Report continued Share Matching Plan In 2004 and 2005 the Company operated a Share Matching Plan in which the Executive Directors could participate.
Following approval at the 2004 AGM, the Share Matching Plan was amended to introduce a requirement for the Executive Directors to invest at least 50% of their annual bonuses net of tax and any other deductions, where such bonus exceeded half of annual basic salary, in the Companys shares.
Corresponding awards of free matching shares were then made under the Share Matching Plan.
In addition, the requirement was introduced for performance criteria to be achieved in order for the free matching shares to vest.
Awards under the amended Share Matching Plan were made in April 2005, as set out on page 38.
Both the 2004 and 2005 grants of the Share Matching Plan vested on 21 April 2008.
Each of the then Executive Directors Peter Rigby, David Gilbertson and Anthony Foye as at 31 December 2007, the end of the financial performance measurement period, received 100% of the shares under each award subject to their individual tax liability.
Details of the vesting of these awards can be found on page 38.
The market price of the Companys shares on 21 April 2008 was 357.00p.
Long Term Incentive Plan From 2006 the Executive Directors have been invited to participate in the Companys LTIP, which had been introduced and approved by shareholders in 2005.
The first grant of awards to Executive Directors under the LTIP was made in March 2006 and they were given the alternative of: a maximum award of 100% of basic salary in the Companys shares, provided they are prepared to sacrifice 5% of that years basic salary: or a maximum award of 50% of basic salary in the Companys shares, with no salary sacrifice required.
All Executive Directors opted for the maximum award with a 5% sacrifice in basic salary.
Two further grants of awards were made in April 2007 and April 2008 on the same basis and the Executive Directors again opted for the maximum award with a 5% sacrifice in basic salary.
The awards made to the Executive Directors thus far under the LTIP vest subject to continued employment over a three year performance period, including the year of award, and the satisfaction of performance conditions which require both that: the Companys TSR is at least at the median compared to the companies constituting, at grant, the FTSE All Share Media Index: and the Companys average adjusted diluted EPS grows by at least RPI plus 5% per annum for 20% of the award to vest increasing to RPI plus 12% per annum for 100% of the award to vest, thereby encouraging Executive Directors to deliver above market returns to shareholders while also delivering strong financial performance.
Proposed Amendments to the LTIP The current LTIP was introduced following a process of shareholder consultation in early 2005.
At that time it was agreed that its terms would be reviewed after three years of its operation.
Accordingly the Committee, having taken advice from Hewitt and consulted with the Companys principal institutional shareholders, is recommending to shareholders that the LTIP be amended to allow for a maximum award equal to two times the salary of the Chief Executive although the awards made in 2009 will be lower than the proposed new maximum level.
A resolution to this effect is to be put to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.
In addition, it is proposed that the salary sacrifice aspect described above be discontinued and that the current performance conditions will no longer be used and instead new performance conditions wholly based on the Companys TSR be adopted further details of which are set out in the notice of AGM.
All-employee share plans From January 2006 the Executive Directors, along with all other UK employees, were eligible to participate in the Companys Share Incentive Plan SIP, introduced and approved by shareholders in 2005.
The SIP is an Inland Revenue Approved All-Employee Share Incentive Plan which offers UK employees the opportunity to purchase up to 1,500 of shares in the Company per year out of pre-tax salary.
In 2008 the Company introduced a US Stock Purchase Plan SPP which is based on the UK SIP and was approved by shareholders at the AGM in May 2008.
All US employees were invited to join the SPP on 1 February 2008.
The SPP provides a means by which the Groups US employees may purchase the Companys shares at a 15% discount to the market price.
No tax benefit is available under the SPP.
Eligible US employees can purchase up to $2,940 of shares per year out of post-tax salary.
Share Options Prior to their merger in May 2004, both Informa and Taylor & Francis operated discretionary share option schemes for the benefit of the Executive Directors.
In the light of changes to the accounting treatment for share options and changing market practice, the Remuneration Committee decided in 2005 no longer to grant options to Executive Directors.
Details of subsisting options granted to the Executive Directors in 2004 and earlier are shown on page 38.
34 Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 Directors Remuneration Report continued Share Ownership Guidelines During early 2006 the Remuneration Committee introduced formal share ownership guidelines requiring the Executive Directors to build up, over a three year period and with pre-existing shareholdings taken into account, a holding in the Companys shares equal to at least one and a half times annual basic salary.
Retirement and Life Assurance Benefits The Executive Directors are entitled to receive a contribution of 25% of basic salary toward their retirement arrangements.
The Company also provides life assurance cover providing for the payment of a lump sum in the event of the insureds death in service.
David Gilbertson, who ceased to be a Director in 2008, is a deferred member of the Informa Final Salary Scheme, a defined benefit scheme which provides for a pension on retirement of up to two thirds of final basic salary at the age of 60.
Dependants are eligible for dependants pension and the payment of a lump sum in the event of the members death in service.
Further details of the benefits accrued under the scheme are shown on pages 39 to 40.
Anthony Foye, who ceased to be a Director in 2007, ceased to be an active member of the Taylor & Francis Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme in April 2006.
This is a defined benefit scheme which provides for a pension on retirement of up to two thirds of final basic salary at the age of 63.
Further details of the benefits accrued under the scheme are shown on page 39.
Since Peter Rigby is neither an active member of any Group pension scheme nor is eligible to make further tax efficient pension contributions, instead the Company pays to him a monthly payment in lieu of pension contributions equal to 25% of basic salary after deducting the incremental National Insurance costs to the Company.
Performance Graph The graph below shows the Companys performance, measured by TSR, compared with the performance of the FTSE All Share Media Index, also measured by TSR, in the five-year period ended 31 December 2008.
The FTSE All Share Media Index has been selected for this comparison because the Company is a constituent company of that index.
Informa plc Total Shareholder Return vs FTSE All Share Media Index 2004-2008 250 200 150 100 50 0 Dec 03 Dec 04 Dec 05 Dec 06 Dec 07 Dec 08 Informa plc FTSE Media All Share Media Index Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 35 Directors Remuneration Report continued Directors Contracts At 31 December 2008 and in accordance with the Companys policy, each of the Executive Directors had service contracts with an indefinite term under which 12 months notice must be given by the Company or by the Director.
In the event of early termination, their contracts provide for compensation equal to basic salary, benefits allowance and retirement benefit and in the case of Peter Rigby only, bonus for the notice period.
Pursuant to the terms on which he joined the Group, Adam Walker was awarded a restricted award of 93,269 shares on 4 April 2008.
This award will vest on 4 April 2010.
If Adam Walker ceases to be an employee of the Company during the first two years prior to vesting of the award, he will receive a pro-rated number of shares dependent upon the number of months he has completed in employment from the grant date of the award.
The award will, however, vest in full if within this period of two years the Company terminates Mr Walkers employment without cause or if a takeover occurs.
Other than in respect of Mr Walkers share award described above, there are no specific terms in relation to the service contracts concerning termination following a change of control or any special rules concerning equity awards following termination: the Executive Directors are subject to the same rules and awards under share schemes following a termination of employment as for all other participants of the relevant schemes.
Each of the Non-Executive Directors has specific terms of appointment, terminable by three months notice.
The dates of the Directors original contracts are shown in the table below, although the contracts have been amended from time to time by letter agreement as required to reflect changes to, for example, salary or fee levels.
The contracts, which include details of remuneration, are available for inspection at the registered office and will be available for inspection at the AGM.

The latter trust did not hold any shares at 31 December 2008.
Employees of the Group including Peter Rigby and Adam Walker are potential beneficiaries under these trusts.
As there was a nil share balance in the Informa Group Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust and no further grants were to be made in respect of that trust, the trust was wound up on 15 December 2008.
Other than the purchase of 220 Share Incentive Plan shares by Peter Rigby and Adam Walker, there have been no changes in Directors share interests from 31 December 2008 to the date of this Report.
