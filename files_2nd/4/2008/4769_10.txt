The auditors are required to report on the auditable part of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The Board has reviewed the Groups compliance with the 2006 Combined Code the Code on remuneration related matters and has followed the Code in the preparation of the report of the Remuneration Committee.
It is the opinion of the Board that the Group complied with all remuneration related aspects of the Code during the period, except that the annual bonus awarded to the former Chief Executive was pensionable.
He was not however a member of the Group pension scheme and maintained his own personal pension scheme.
As a consequence there was no impact on the Groups pension scheme.
Unaudited information The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing policy on remuneration for Executive Directors and senior management and for determining specific remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors.
Bill Forrester chairs the Remuneration Committee and its other members are James Newman and the newly appointed independent NonExecutive Directors, Ishbel Macpherson and Alan McWalter.
Richard Connell, who retired as Chairman of the Company and retired from the Board at the end of 2008, served as a member of the Committee during the year.
The Code requires that a Group of the size of Dignity plc has a Remuneration Committee with a minimum of two members.
The Remuneration Committee members have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interests arising from cross directorships and no daytoday involvement in running the business.
The Chief Executive attends Remuneration Committee meetings when required and the Company Secretary attended meetings when required as Secretary to the Remuneration Committee.
No Executive Director takes part in discussions relating to their own remuneration and benefits.
The Remuneration Committee is formally constituted with written terms of reference.
A copy of the terms of reference is available for inspection on the Groups investor website www.
The Committee met four times during 2008.
At those meetings basic salaries of Executive Directors and senior managers were reviewed, the targets and quantum of annual performance related bonuses for Directors were also agreed, as were options granted under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The meetings also approved the payment of the 2007 performance related bonus and the vesting of the shares awarded under the LTIP scheme in 2005.
A further meeting was also held in March 2009 to approve the payment of the performance related bonus for 2008, LTIP awards and bonus targets for 2009.
In the 2007 Report on Directors Remuneration it was noted that in future, following the Groups out performance since flotation and subsequent admission to the FTSE 250, the Committee intended to set elements of the Executive Directors Remuneration package by reference to the constituent companies of the bottom half of the FTSE 250.
In 2008, the Committee retained the external benefit consultants, Hewitt New Bridge Street, to complete a review of the Executive Directors remuneration.
In discussions with the Committee, and in consultation with Hewitt New Bridge Street, it was decided that a Comparator Group would be defined consisting of all companies in the Consumer Goods and Consumer Services Sector of the FTSE 250 filtered to exclude companies deriving more than 50% of their turnover from overseas or having a market capitalisation in excess of 1.4 billion.
This gave a group of 32 companies with an average market capitalisation of 628 million at November 2008 as the Comparator Group.
At that date Dignity had a market capitalisation of 473 million and an enterprise value including net debt of 710 million.
The bottom half of the FTSE 250 was also used as a reference point for the benchmarking process.
Remuneration policy The objective of the remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages to each Executive Director that will: Align rewards with the interests of shareholders: Motivate and encourage superior performance: Allow the Group to retain the talent needed to execute its business strategy: and Enable the Group to be competitive when recruiting appropriately skilled and experienced management.
The Remuneration Committee believes that this policy will retain and develop further the Groups entrepreneurial culture, whilst also focusing executive remuneration on performance which the Committee believes will best serve shareholders interests.
It is therefore the aim of the Remuneration Committee to encourage and reward superior performance by Executive Directors with that performance being based on strong financial performance and returns to shareholders.
This is achieved by weighting the overall remuneration package towards achievement of that performance.
Only 31 per cent of each Executive Directors total remuneration package ignoring benefits and pension contributions is accounted for by basic salary, assuming a full annual bonus is achieved and a maximum conditional award under the LTIP is made.
MAC RF63831 01 tp 8 4 09 14:32 Page 24 24 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 REPORT ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION CONTINUED for the 52 week period ended 26 December 2008 The Remuneration Committee will continue to review all aspects of the policy on an annual basis to ensure that rewards continue to be in line with the Groups objectives and shareholders interests.
Basic salary When determining the basic salary of the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration: The levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills, in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity: The performance of the individual Executive Director: The individual Executive Directors experience and responsibilities: and Pay and conditions throughout the Group.
No significant changes were made to the Executive Directors basic salaries during the period.
Changes have been proposed for 2009, based on the review completed by Hewitt New Bridge Street see above.
It was clear from Hewitt New Bridge Streets analysis that the Companys basic salary levels no longer reflected the Comparator Group and there was a need to ensure that the Company continues to offer competitive salaries in order to attract and reward superior performance.
The Committee therefore recommended and the Board approved, an increase in basic salaries to be in line with the lower quartile of the Comparator Group and FTSE 250.
Details of the changes, which were effective from 1 January 2009, are: 2008 2009 Name 000 000 Mike McCollum 275 440 Andrew Davies 200 250 Richard Portman 150 200 Steve Whittern 88 150 Total 713 1,040 Peter Hindley 350 150 The salary reviews also reflect the change in responsibility of Mike McCollum from Finance Director to Chief Executive, the appointment of Steve Whittern to the Board as Finance Director and Peter Hindley moving from Chief Executive to NonExecutive Chairman.
Annual performance related bonus The targets for the year, which are based on the achievement of set earnings per share targets, are reviewed and set annually by the Committee to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and remain challenging.
They are ratified by the full Board.
The targets are designed to enhance shareholder value.
The maximum bonus attainable for 2008 by Executive Directors is 100 per cent of basic salary.
A bonus of 70 per cent is attainable for meeting the first earnings per share target set by the Committee and a further bonus of 30 per cent may be earned by achieving a second and more demanding earnings per share target.
The increase in underlying earnings per share during the period was 14 per cent and the bonus percentage earned by the Executive Directors in the period was 100 per cent.
No other bonuses of any description were paid in the period to Executive Directors.
No changes have been proposed to the Annual Performance Related Bonus by Hewitt New Bridge Street.
This will continue to be based on demanding earnings per share targets with a maximum bonus equal to 100 per cent of base salary.
The scheme is in line with the market median for the bottom half of the FTSE 250 and the lower quartile of the Comparator Group.
Share incentives Shareholders approved the current discretionary share incentive plan, the LTIP, on 31 March 2004 prior to the Companys admission to the London Stock Exchange on 8 April 2004.
If existing LTIPs were to be amended or if there was a new LTIP Scheme, approval would be sought from the shareholders.
All Executive Directors and other employees are entitled to be considered for the grant of conditional share awards under the LTIP.
Under the rules, the maximum annual award that can be made to an individual is 125 per cent of salary.
All four Executive Directors serving at the start of the year, were granted conditional share awards during 2008 equivalent to the maximum award.
The Committee deemed this award appropriate, as in previous years, mindful of the need to encourage superior performance from the Executive Directors and ensure that a significant proportion of their total remuneration is linked to the performance of the Group.
This award is in addition to those granted in all years from 2004 to 2007.
Richard Portman, prior to his appointment to the Board, received a conditional share award in 2006 equal to 100 per cent of his salary.
Steve Whittern received an award equal to 100 per cent of his salary in 2006 and awards of 4,000 shares in each of the years 2007 and 2008, prior to his appointment to the Board on 29 December 2008.
Total awards made to the Executive Directors under the scheme are shown on pages 28 and 29.
MAC RF63831 01 tp 8 4 09 14:32 Page 25 25 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Eligible Executives are awarded rights, in the form of nil cost conditional share awards, to acquire a maximum number of shares at the beginning of a three year period, a proportion of which they will be entitled to receive at the end of that period depending on the extent to which the performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the time the allocation is made, are satisfied.
The Remuneration Committee selected comparative Total Shareholder Return TSR as the performance condition for LTIP awards as it ensures that the Group outperforms the FTSE 350 Index over the measurement period in delivering shareholder value, before the Eligible Executives are entitled to receive any of their awards.
The constituent companies of the FTSE 350 Index, at the time the awards are made, were selected as a benchmark as there are no directly comparable quoted companies in the United Kingdom and the enterprise value of the Group debt plus equity also are a comparable value to FTSE 350 companies.
The Remuneration Committee will calculate the TSR in accordance with the rules of the scheme and ratify the calculation prior to the release of any award.
Performance conditions under the LTIP are not subject to retesting.
The percentage of the conditional share award exercisable or vesting is calculated as follows: Ranked in the top quintile: 100 per cent of the total award: Ranked at median: 40 per cent of the total award: Ranked below median: zero: and Ranked between median and top quintile: straightline apportionment.
In addition and irrespective of the TSR performance target, no award will vest unless, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, the underlying financial performance of the Group has been satisfactory over the measurement period.
The graph shows the Groups TSR compared to the FTSE 350.
This gives a broad indication of the likelihood of any conditional award vesting.
5 Year Total Shareholder Return 300% 250% 200% 150% 100% 50% 0% Dignity plc FTSE 350 Index On 14 April 2008 the conditional share awards made in 2005 under the LTIP became capable of vesting.
The TSR of the Group over the measurement period was compared to that of the constituent companies of the FTSE 350 at the time the awards were made.
The performance of the Group was found to be in the top quintile.
On that basis the Remuneration Committee, mindful also of the continued strong performance of the Group, recommended that the entire 2005 share award vest.
Shares were issued to Mike McCollum and Andrew Davies on 14 April 2008 and sold in their entirety the following day by the Groups brokers.
Peter Hindleys shares vested to the Trustees of the LTIP, Lloyds TSB Offshore Trust Company Limited on 14 April 2008.
They were issued to Peter Hindley on 29 August 2008 and sold by the Companys brokers in two tranches on 4 September 2008 and 11 September 2008.
The total conditional awards held by each Director are shown on pages 28 and 29 in the section of the Remuneration Committees Report that is subject to audit.
In accordance with the ABI guidelines, the Group can issue a maximum of 10 per cent of its issued share capital in a rolling ten year period to employees under all share plans.
In addition, of this 10 per cent, the Company can only issue 5 per cent to satisfy awards under discretionary or executive plans.
At the period end, conditional awards under the LTIP Scheme to Executive Directors and senior managers amount to 1.19 per cent of the current issued share capital.
If the awards in 2004 and 2005, that have vested, are included, that percentage is 2.15 per cent.
The total, including SAYE options granted in both the 2004 and 2007 Schemes, is 3.63 per cent.

Pensions The Group provided Peter Hindley with a contribution to his personal pension plan of 10 per cent of his salary and bonus payable during 2008.
As this is a personal pension plan, any pension contributions paid on a bonus do not affect the Groups pension scheme.
Such payments ceased when he became NonExecutive Chairman at the start of 2009.
Mike McCollum and Richard Portman are members of the Groups pension scheme into which the Group contributed 10.5 per cent of salary details are set out within the audited section of this report on pages 27 and 28.
The Group makes no pension contributions for Andrew Davies or Steve Whittern.
No NonExecutive Directors receive any pension contributions.
Hewitt New Bridge Street have not proposed any changes to the pension arrangements of Executive Directors.
Benefits in kind Benefits included the following elements: provision of a company car or allowance: fuel: landline telephone at each Executive Directors home residence: and a mobile telephone: together with a prearranged funeral plan in accordance with any scheme established by the Group in respect of the funeral of the Executive Director or his wife.
All Executive Directors received all of their benefits in kind.
As part of their review, Hewitt New Bridge Street, have not proposed any changes to the benefits provided to Executive Directors.
NonExecutive Directors fees The Board determines the fees of the NonExecutive Directors.
It is based upon recommendations from the Chairman and Chief Executive or, in the case of the Chairman, based on recommendations from the Remuneration Committee and the Chief Executive.
The level of fees of the NonExecutive Directors reflects the time commitment and responsibility of their respective roles.
Their fees are set by reference to the constituent companies of the bottom half of the FTSE 250.
Service contracts Details of the service contracts with all Executive Directors and letters of appointment with NonExecutive Directors are as follows: Unexpired term of contract Name Contract date Notice period or letter of approval Mike McCollum 1 April 2004 12 months Rolling Contract Andrew Davies 1 April 2004 12 months Rolling Contract Richard Portman 1 November 2006 12 months Rolling Contract Steve Whittern 1 January 2009 12 months Rolling Contract Peter Hindley 1 January 2009 3 months 24 months James Newman 31 March 2008 3 months 15 months Bill Forrester 31 March 2008 3 months 15 months Ishbel Macpherson 12 January 2009 3 months 23 months Alan McWalter 12 January 2009 3 months 23 months There are no special provisions in service contracts of employees or Directors relating to cessation of employment or change of control.
The policy on termination is that the Group does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations, which do not include any payment from the takeover or liquidation of the Group.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee ensures that there have been no unjustified payments for failure.
Under the Companys Articles of Association, one third of the Directors are required to submit themselves for reelection every year.
No Executive Directors hold a NonExecutive position with any other company.
However, the Group encourages one such appointment per Executive Director, for which they can retain the fees.
