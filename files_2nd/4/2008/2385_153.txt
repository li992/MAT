The committee undertook a detailed review of BPs BP Annual Review 2008 underlying performance against competitors in Summary directors determining the 2006-2008 share element vesting under the executive directors incentive plan EDIP.
remuneration report This review included financial measures such as earnings per share, returns on average capital employed, free cash ow, operating measures for both Exploration and Production and Re ning and Marketing, and nonfinancial measures for safety and reputation.
All measures were compared across competitors and showed BP rmly in the pack of the other European oil majors.

We concluded that it was appropriate to approve the vesting of 15% of the shares in the plan for the current directors.
This too is set out in the table opposite.
