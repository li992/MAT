easyJet plc Annual report and accounts 2008 Report on Directors remuneration This report sets out the Companys policy on Directors remuneration and details of remuneration paid to Directors in the financial year to 30 September 2008.
The report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.
Those sections of the report that have been subject to audit are identified below.
Membership and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee Membership and responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee are disclosed in the Corporate Governance report above.
The Committee continues to use Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS whom the Committee originally appointed as remuneration advisers.
Apart from advice regarding the design, establishment and operation of remuneration arrangements, HNBS provides no other services to the Company.
Policy easyJets remuneration policy is to reward the Companys executives competitively against the comparative market place, in order to ensure that they are properly motivated to perform in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
The Committee also oversees any significant changes to easyJets employee remuneration structure and sets Directors remuneration in this context.
The Company aims to provide competitive total pay for on target performance, with superior rewards for exceptional performance.
The remuneration packages of the Executive Directors comprise a combination of basic salary, annual bonus, participation in share-based long-term incentive plans, and lean benefits provision.
easyJet has a no frills approach and does not include, for example, company cars or final salary pensions as part of the package.
Therefore, performance related elements form a significant proportion of the packages of the Executive Directors.
Reflecting best practice, the Committee regularly reviews the structure of its incentive arrangements and, in particular, the balance between short and long-term incentives in light of the circumstances prevailing each year.
Taking account of the Companys focus on variable remuneration, an extensive shareholder consultation was undertaken prior to the 2008 AGM to increase the maximum long-term incentive opportunity.
Following shareholder approval at the AGM, the maximum award limit applying to awards made under the easyJet Long Term Incentive Plan the LTIP was increased from 100% of salary to 200% of salary.
In light of the current economic environment including tougher credit conditions, movements in exchange rates and the volatility of oil prices, the Company is currently revisiting its incentive policy.
Should the conclusion of this review result in any proposed material changes being recommended, it is anticipated that consultation with major shareholders would take place prior to the changes being implemented.
The remuneration policy that will apply in the financial year ending 30 September 2009 is summarised below: Element Purpose Delivery Detailed policy Basic salaryReflect the value of the individual Reviewed annually, effective Cash and their role 1 OctoberPaid monthly Reflects skills and experienceAgreed when previous resultsPensionable are finalised Benchmarked against similar sized companies and industry comparators Targeted at or around median Considers individual contribution Annual bonusIncentivise year-on-year delivery of Major measure is profit before tax Paid as cash short-term performance goals aligned to long-term targetsNot pensionable Other measures based on: Customers Cash Cost Operational excellence Long Term Aligned to Business PlanSubject to stretching return on Annual grant of performance Incentive PlanIncentivise long-term growth in equity targets shares easyJets return on equitySubject to 175% of salary Opportunity to defer bonus shareholding requirement and get future matching share awards PensionProvide minimum retirement benefitsDefined contributionMonthly contribution of 7% Opportunity for Executive to HMRC approved salary sacrifice of basic salary contribute to their retirement arrangementSalary sacrifice The Board as a whole determines the remuneration of the Companys Non Executive Directors, with Non Executive Directors exempting themselves from discussions and voting as appropriate.

to continued employment and the Company achieving target returns on equity.
These are defined as post tax profit divided by average shareholders funds.
This measure was chosen as it is a fundamental measure of financial performance and is linked to the generation of shareholder returns.
36 easyJet plc Report on Directors Annual report and accounts 2008 remuneration continued LTIP awards granted in 2008 Awards granted in the year under review were subject to the following performance targets relating to the Groups return on equity ROE in the year ending 30 September 2010: Awards up to 100% of salary Threshold Target Maximum 25% vests 50% vests 100% vests Return on equity 12.5% 14.0% 16.5% The amendment made to the LTIP at last years AGM was to increase the annual award limit of Performance Shares from 100% of 200% of salary, although the maximum award was restricted to 175% of salary in the year under review.
Awards between 100% and 200% of salary Threshold Target Maximum 25% vests 50% vests 100% vests Return on equity 13.5% 15.5% 17.5% The performance targets applying to the part of an award over 100% of salary were set to be tougher in lieu of the higher potential quantum available.
ROE has been historically chosen as the performance measure for a number of reasons, such as: It is a fundamental measure of easyJets underlying performance and is directly linked to the generation of returns to shareho lders: It is directly connected to the self-sustaining growth rate of the business and incentivises management to achieve the appropr iate balance between growth and returns, to maximise shareholder value.
It is intended that similarly challenging ROE targets, set in light of current economic circumstances and the level of award made, will apply to awards made in the current financial year.
As a minimum, any revised targets will be fully disclosed in next years Report on Directors remuneration.
All employee share plan participation easyJet encourages share ownership throughout the Company by the use of a Share Incentive Plan and a Sharesave Plan.
Executive Directors may also participate in these plans which are covered in the Corporate and Social Responsibility section of the Directors report.
Previous share awards FTSE 100 Award In addition to the regular annual LTIP grants, a one-off FTSE 100 award was granted shortly following the establishment of the LTIP to provide senior executives with a simple, transparent incentive to increase materially easyJets market capitalisation and become a member of the FTSE 100 index before the end of the financial year ending 30 September 2008.
Since the performance criterion has not been met these awards will now lapse.
Executive Share Option Scheme The LTIP replaced the existing Approved and Unapproved Executive Share Option Schemes the ESOS as the primary long-term incentive arrangement for the Executive Directors and other senior employees although the ESOS was retained for flexibility, e. g. options were granted to the Chief Executive under the ESOS on his appointment in 2005.
However, there were no grants during the year and there is no current intention to make regular grants of options under the ESOS.
Chief Executive Officer Recruitment Award To facilitate Andrew Harrisons recruitment as Chief Executive Officer and to ensure that his interests were directly and immediately aligned with those of easyJet shareholders, a matching award was introduced.
This was covered in detail in previous reports.
However in summary, Andrew acquired and will retain 1,000,000 worth of easyJet shares using his own funds.
In recognition of this, he was granted a further share-based incentive award.
The shares he acquires will be matched by the conditional award of an equal number of shares.
This matching share award will vest in the coming financial year subject to the satisfaction of challenging EPS and ROE performance conditions described more fully in the notes to Directors share awards below.
Pension contributions Pension contributions for Executive Directors are set at 7% of their basic salary.
While this is a non contributory arrangement, easyJet operates a pension salary sacrifice arrangement where individuals can exchange their salary for Company paid pension contributions.
Where individuals exchange salary this reduces easyJets National Insurance contributions.
easyJet credits half of this saving to the individuals pension currently 6.4% of the amount exchanged.
