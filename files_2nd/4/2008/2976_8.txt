Details of individual Directors remuneration, LTIP awards and sharesave options are set out on pages 28 to 31 of this report.
The main components of the remuneration package for Executive Directors are: Basic salary The Companys policy is that basic salaries for Executive Directors should take into account the role and responsibilities, performance and experience of the individual.
Basic salary is targeted at the retail market median for comparable roles.
Annual performance related bonus Executive Directors are eligible to receive an annual performance bonus.
The amount of bonus is based on the achievement of profit targets specified and agreed at the beginning of the year.
For 2008 9 the bonus will be earned on a sliding scale depending on performance, beginning at the achievement of 81% of budget, rising to 60% for achieving budget and, rising again to 120% of salary for achieving a target 12% above budget.
As in 2007 8, the maximum is set higher than in previous years to reflect changes effected in respect of the LTIP scheme, as noted below.
Bonus payments do not form part of the Directors pensionable earnings.
Long-Term Incentive Plan In order to align the interests of Executive Directors and selected senior managers with those of the shareholders the LTIP was introduced in 2004.
Further details, including membership of the peer group, are given on pages 30 and 31.
Conditional awards of shares were made to Executive Directors and senior managers in September 2004 and September 2005.
In September 2006 awards were made to the Executive Directors only.
Following a review of the LTIP by the Remuneration Committee the Board decided to base more of the Executive Directors remuneration on annual performance: accordingly no award was made in 2007 and it is proposed to make no award in 2008.
Pensions Mr Harris, Mr Kitching and Mr Sollesse are members of the Carpetright plc Pension Plan which is a contributory defined benefit scheme.
Details of the Pension Plan as it applies to the Executive Directors are set out below.

Mr Page intends to join the defined contribution Group Personal Pension Plan and the Company will contribute to this.
