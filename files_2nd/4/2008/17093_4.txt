Index Directors Report and Accounts 2007 8 15 Directors pension entitlements audited information None of the executive directors are accruing benefits, other than interest, under any other company pension arrangements.
No elements of the executive directors pay packages are pensionable other than base salaries.
Neither the Chairman nor any of the non-executive directors are entitled to participate in any of these pension arrangements.
Defined benefit The defined benefit pension entitlements of the executive directors are as follows: Transfer value of Increase, before increase, before Accumulated Increase in accrued inflation, in accrued inflation, less accrued benefits, benefits during benefits during any directors 28 February 2008 the year the year contributions Alan Parker 125,480 5,975 1,315 24,799 Angie Risley 127,121 4,596 182 3,039 This appears as a negative number because the increase in accrual was lower than the rate of inflation.
The transfer value of each directors accrued benefits at the end of the financial year is as follows: Movement, less directors 28 February 2008 1 March 2007 contributions 1 Alan Parker 2,368,830 2,322,780 46,050 Angie Risley 2,119,261 1,544,108 575,153 Transfer values represent a liability of the pension fund, not a sum paid to the individual.
1 The movement in the transfer values during the year reflects both the changes in market conditions which define the assumptions to be used in calculating transfer values and the value of the change in the directors accrued benefit during the year.

He also has an entitlement to a cash sum at retirement in lieu of his benefits from the Whitbread Group Unapproved Pension Scheme.

He received a cash supplement of 92,217 during the year.

If the director ceases to be an employee of Whitbread prior to the release date by reason of redundancy, retirement, death, injury, ill health, disability or some other reason considered to be appropriate by the Remuneration Committee the awards will be released in full.
If the director ceases to be an employee of Whitbread for any other reason, the proportion of award which vests depends upon the year in which the award was made and the date the director ceases to be an employee.
For awards granted in 2007, 75% would lapse if the director leaves before 28 February 2009 and 50% would lapse if the director leaves between 1 March 2009 and February 2010.
For awards granted in 2008, 50% would lapse if the director leaves before 28 February 2011.
