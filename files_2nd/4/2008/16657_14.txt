The following were deemed to be the major investment risks which could affect the value by reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds.
As described in note 38.2 c below, the UK Plan operates a of the UK Plans assets compared to the value of its economic liabilities: hedging strategy, using a combination of swaps and money market instruments, to mitigate the impact of interest rate and Interest rate risk the risk of government bond interest rates falling, leading to an increase in the value of plan liabilities.

Equity market risk the risk of significant equity market falls, leading to a fall in the value of plan assets.
When the relationship between the relevant swap yields and corporate bond yields is stable, the UK Plans hedging strategy should deliver a broadly stable funding ratio the ratio of plan assets to plan liabilities not just in relation to the UK Plans In order to mitigate these key risks, the Trustee has entered into the following financial derivative arrangements: economic liabilities, but also under an IAS 19 basis of valuation.
However, should corporate bond yields be significantly above Interest rate swaps the UK Plan receives a fixed rate of interest and pays out a variable rate of interest, based on the swap yields, as has been the case since the second half of 2007, then the IAS 19 value of the UK Plans liabilities will be London Inter Bank Offered Rate.
This is beneficial when long-term interest rates fall, significantly reduced to a greater extent than will the value of the actual underlying economic liabilities.
