38 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 Directors Remuneration Report This report sets out the information required by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations.
The Report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985, meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to directors remuneration in the Combined Code.
As required by the Regulations, the Directors Remuneration Report will be submitted to shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting on 25 March 2009.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION Remuneration Committee During the year under review the Remuneration Committee comprised: Mr I F R Much Committee Chairman Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss The Rt Hon Lord Freeman Mr K C Scobie The Committees principal responsibilities are: determining, agreeing with the Board and reviewing from time to time the overall policy for the remuneration of the Chairman, the executive directors, the Company Secretary and certain other senior executives in the Group, and their individual remuneration packages and any changes thereto: approving the terms and conditions of employment, and any changes thereto, of the executive directors: approving any compensation payments for executive directors: approving the design of, and determining targets for, any performance-related pay schemes operated by the Group: reviewing the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and the Companys shareholders: and overseeing any major changes in employee bene ts structures across the Group.
None of the Committee members has any personal financial interest in the matters reserved for the Committee other than the Chairman in respect of his own remuneration: accordingly, he is not present during any discussions relating to this matter, nor do they have any con icts of interest arising from cross-directorships, and they are not involved in the day to day running of the Groups business.
Therefore, they are regarded by the Board as independent.
The Committee met six times during the year.
The Chief Executive attends meetings by invitation but is not present during any discussions relating to his own remuneration.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on the Companys website or on request from the Company Secretary.
Advisers During the year the Committee received advice on remuneration matters from Hewitt New Bridge Street.
The Committee also consults internally with the Chief Executive and the Company Secretary.
Remuneration policy for executive directors The Committees policy is to provide executive remuneration packages which are competitive, but not excessive, by reference to market rates across comparator companies, re ect the performance of the business against financial objectives, and which take into account the individual contribution and performance of each executive director.
Remuneration packages comprise the following elements: i basic salary and bene ts, including pensions: ii annual bonuses linked to the Groups financial performance: and iii awards of share-based incentives linked to the long term growth of the Group.
The Committee aims to align the interests of executive directors with those of shareholders, by ensuring that a signi cant proportion of remuneration is performance-related.
This is achieved through the performance-related elements of annual bonuses and share-based incentives.
In January 2008, the Committee decided that it needed to undertake a full review of the total remuneration packages which applied to the executive directors and senior managers, against the background of the substantial growth achieved by the Group in terms of revenue, pro ts and market capitalisation over the last few years and the enhanced complexity of the Group arising from this growth.
CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT 39 This review was carried out using a number of published reports prepared by third parties and an independent report which was commissioned from Hewitt New Bridge Street.
The main findings of the report were that: directors xed pay levels were at or below lower quartile when compared with both sector companies and general companies of similar turnover and market capitalisation: the maximum annual bonus potential for directors of 60% of salary was signi cantly below the market norm: and the total value of the remuneration package of both of the executive directors was at or below the market lower quartile.
Following this review, the Committee decided to increase basic salaries from 1 April 2008 for Dr Price and Mr Rayner to 400,000 per annum and 250,000 per annum respectively to re ect their outstanding performance and to bring them closer to market norms.
It also agreed to increase the maximum bonus potential for the executive directors to 100% of salary with effect from 1 November 2008.
The Committee believes that these changes achieve the correct balance between an appropriate level of basic pay and the opportunity to see increased levels of variable pay if the Group continues to be as successful as in the last three years.
The Committee is comfortable that the resulting packages are appropriate, given the strong recent growth of the Company, and necessary to ensure the retention of key executives whose recent performance has proved their signi cant value to the business and shareholders.
Basic salaries and bene ts The executive directors basic salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee, and adjustments made, if appropriate, taking into account individual performance and comparable salary levels in manufacturing companies of a similar size and in other companies within the aerospace and defence sector.
The Committee refers to published salary surveys and data provided by its remuneration advisers, Hewitt New Bridge Street, and also reviews the remuneration information presented in the annual reports of companies in the reference group.
The main taxable bene ts for executive directors are company cars, fuel for private motoring and private medical insurance.
Annual bonuses During the year under review, the Company operated an annual performance-related bonus plan for the executive directors, with key characteristics as follows: a maximum bonus potential for the executive directors of 60% of basic salary, with an on-target bonus of 30% of basic salary: three quarters of the bonus potential linked to two separate financial performance conditions, namely earnings per share and cash ow with equal weighting.
The conditions, which are set by the Committee, take into account a number of factors including budget, market expectations, long term growth prospects and the previous years out-turn.
No bonus is payable for achievement of less than 90% of target, with bonuses being earned thereafter on a straight-line basis up to the maximum for 110% or better achievement of target: one quarter of the bonus potential may be achieved in connection with the satisfaction of personal objective criteria set at the beginning of the financial year.
These comprise a mixture of short term and longer term objectives linked to the delivery of the Companys strategic plan.
No part of this element of bonus is payable unless threshold performance of both the financial conditions described above is achieved: one quarter of any bonus payable is deferred as a conditional award of the Companys shares, with vesting subject to continued employment save in good leaver scenarios three years from the award of bonus: and the payment of any bonus remains ultimately at the discretion of the Committee.
The table below summarises the bonuses earned by the executive directors, as a percentage of basic salary, in respect of the current and last years: Earnings per Achievement of share target % Cash ow target% personal objectives % Total % 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 D J Price 19.1 19.0 22.5 15.1 10.5 12.0 52.1 46.1 P A Rayner 19.1 19.0 22.5 15.1 12.7 10.5 54.3 44.6 40 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 Directors Remuneration Report CONTINUED As noted above, the review undertaken by the Committee in January 2008 identi ed that a maximum annual bonus potential of 60% of salary for executive directors is below market norms.
The median maximum bonus in both comparator groups and the FTSE 250 as a whole is 100% of salary.
It has therefore been agreed that, with effect from 1 November 2008, the maximum bonus potential for the executive directors will increase to 100% of annual salary, with appropriate targets to ensure that the upper quartile of payments is only achieved in exceptional years.
All other aspects of the bonus scheme will remain unchanged namely 25% deferred in shares and bonus determined by a mixture of EPS, cash ow and personal targets.
In relation to this increase in bonus potential, shareholders can take comfort from the Committees track record of setting highly challenging bonus targets in recent years, as evidenced by the fact that the executive directors have not received maximum bonuses in any of the last four years despite outstanding levels of EPS growth and returns to shareholders see chart below.

The key features of the plan are as follows: conditional awards can be made of the Companys shares worth no more than 100% of basic salary each year: awards will vest three years after grant subject to the extent to which a demanding performance condition has been achieved over a single three year performance period with no ability to re-test the performance condition.
The performance condition is based on the growth of the Companys earnings per share in excess of RPI over three consecutive financial years.
The Committee considers an earnings per share condition to most closely align the interests of participants with those of the Companys shareholders: the following vesting schedule applies in respect of awards made prior to 23 January 2007: Total earnings per share growth Percentage of the total per annum not compounded number of shares under an over three financial years award that vest Nil Less than RPI 5% 33% RPI 5% 100% RPI 15% or more Between 33%-100% on a Between RPI 5% and RPI 15% straight-line basis the following vesting schedule applies in respect of awards made on 24 January 2007: Total earnings per share growth Percentage of the total per annum not compounded number of shares under an over three financial years award that vest Less than RPI 7.5% Nil RPI 7.5% 33% RPI 20% or more 100% Between 33%-100% on a Between RPI 7.5% and RPI 20% straight-line basis CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT 41 the following vesting schedule applies in respect of awards made on or after 23 January 2008.
The Committee has determined that this highly challenging performance condition remains appropriate for any awards which may be made during the current financial year: Total earnings per share growth Percentage of the total per annum not compounded number of shares under an over three financial years award that vest Less than RPI 10% Nil RPI 10% 25% RPI 30% or more 100% Between 25%-100% on a Between RPI 10% and RPI 30% straight-line basis earnings per share is calculated on a fully diluted and normalised basis, as speci ed by the Committee prior to grant: and market purchase shares or new issue shares including treasury shares may be used to satisfy awards.
To the extent that new issue shares or treasury shares are used, these will count towards the usual share usage dilution limits 10% in ten years for all schemes and 5% in ten years for discretionary executive schemes.
Participation in the plan is extended at the discretion of the Committee to the executive directors and senior management of the Group, both in the UK and overseas.
The following awards were made under the plan during the year: Number of Total number of participants Date of award shares awarded receiving awards 98,771 24 23 Jan 2008 Details of the awards made to executive directors during the year are set out on page 45.
The Committee has veri ed that the current annual awards to the executive directors of performance shares worth 100% of salary are around market compared to the Companys two comparator groups and the FTSE 250 as a whole.
The current arrangements for the level of awards to the executive directors under the plan will therefore remain unchanged for the foreseeable future.
The executive directors are expected to build-up, over a five year period following appointment, and maintain a shareholding in the Company equivalent to one years basic salary.
Other participants in the plan are expected to retain a shareholding equivalent to 25% of their basic salary following vesting of the awards.
During the year, the Company purchased 160,000 2007: 150,000 treasury shares at a cost of 2.9 million for use in the plan.
Other schemes The Company introduced all-employee savings-related share schemes in the UK The Chemring Group 2008 Sharesave Plan and the US The Chemring Group 2008 US Stock Purchase Plan during the year.
There are no performance criteria for these arrangements and options are issued to all participants in accordance with UK HM Revenue and Customs and US Internal Revenue Service regulations.
Between 1998 and 2005 the Company operated the Chemring 1998 Executive Share Option Scheme.
Following the introduction of the Chemring Group Performance Share Plan, no further grants have been made under the option scheme, save in exceptional circumstances such as on recruitment, and the conditions applying to any such grants have accorded with current corporate governance best practice.
The scheme ceased to operate for any new grants on 4 March 2008.
The Company previously operated a long term incentive scheme known as the Chemring Group PLC Share Based Incentive Scheme.
This scheme is not being utilised at present.
The Company complies with the dilution guidelines contained within Executive Remuneration - ABI Guidelines on Policies and Practices.
At 31 October 2008, awards outstanding and issued under all share schemes during the previous ten years amounted to 2.87% of the ordinary share capital of the Company.
At 31 October 2008, awards outstanding and issued under executive share schemes during the previous ten years amounted to 2.71% of the ordinary share capital of the Company.

Pensions Dr Price is a member of the Chemring Group Staff Pension Scheme the Staff Scheme.
This is an approved final salary scheme, which is contracted out of the State Second Pension, and which provides, at retirement, a pension of up to two-thirds of salary, subject to Inland Revenue limits.
The Staff Scheme also provides life assurance cover, dependants pensions and lump sum payments on death-in-service.
Members of the Staff Scheme are required to make monthly contributions to the scheme at the rate of 8% of pensionable salary.
Dr Prices pension under the Staff Scheme accrues at 1 80th of final pensionable salary for each year of membership, and he also accrues a cash lump sum at 3 80ths of final pensionable salary for each year of membership.
On death-in-service, Dr Prices dependants would receive a lump sum payment of two times basic salary and, in addition, a 50% spouses pension would be payable.
Dr Price is subject to an earnings cap equivalent to the cap applied by HM Revenue and Customs prior to April 2006 in respect of his membership of the Staff Scheme.
Mr Rayner is a member of the Chemring Group Executive Pension Scheme the Executive Scheme.
The Executive Scheme is also an approved final salary scheme but is not contracted out of the State Second Pension.
Members of the Executive Scheme are required to make monthly contributions to the scheme at the rate of 8% of pensionable salary.
Mr Rayners bene ts under the Executive Scheme accrue in an identical manner to that in which Dr Price accrues bene ts under the Staff Scheme, as set out above, save that a two-thirds spouses pension is payable in respect of service accrued to 31 January 2004, reducing to 50% for service accrued thereafter.
Mr Rayner is also subject to an earnings cap.
Although the current pension arrangements for the executive directors 1 80ths accrual rate only as far as the notional earnings cap are well below market norms, the Committee determined, following its January 2008 review, that it would not change either the accrual rate or the notional earnings cap.
Both Dr Price and Mr Rayner have a normal retirement age of 65.
Value CHEMRING GROUP PLC REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2008 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT 43 Service contracts Dr Price has a rolling service contract dated 4 April 2005.
This provides for termination by either party on twelve months notice.
The Company may however terminate without notice, and make a payment in lieu of notice equal to the sum of the salary due for the unexpired notice period plus the fair value of any contractual bene ts.
Any such sum may be paid in instalments, and in these circumstances there is a requirement to mitigate loss.
Mr Rayner has a rolling service contract dated 27 August 1999.
The Company may however terminate without notice and make a payment in lieu of notice equal to the sum of twelve months salary plus the value of any contractual bene ts.
There are no other provisions relating to compensation on early termination.
It is the Committees general policy that all new executive directors appointed in the future will have service contracts with the Company which are terminable on a maximum of twelve months notice.
The service contracts will contain provisions permitting the Company to make any termination payments by instalments, and will require directors to mitigate their loss in such circumstances.
Policy on outside appointments With the speci c approval of the Board in each case, executive directors may accept external appointments as non-executive directors of other companies, provided that they do not detract from their responsibilities to the Group, and may retain any related fees paid to them.
Neither of the executive directors currently hold any such external appointments.
Non-executive directors Mr Scobie has a service contract with the Company which will expire at the conclusion of the Companys Annual General Meeting in March 2010, unless terminated earlier on twelve months notice by either party.
His appointment may be extended by one further year by mutual agreement of both parties.
His remuneration under the contract, part of which is paid to his company for consultancy services, is 125,000 per annum.
He is required to devote such time to his role as is reasonably necessary for the proper performance of his duties.
Mr Evans, The Rt Hon Lord Freeman, Mr Much and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss have letters of appointment covering, amongst other items, their terms of appointment and expected time commitment.
These letters of appointment provide for three year appointments, unless terminated earlier by and at the discretion of either party upon three months written notice.
Mr Much and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss are currently serving their second three year terms as non-executive directors, which will expire on 30 April 2010 and 30 November 2010 respectively.
It is anticipated that, subject to satisfactory performance, The Rt Hon Lord Freeman will also be invited to serve a second three year term on expiry of his current appointment on 25 May 2009.
Mr Evans current appointment as a non-executive director expires on 30 March 2009: in view of his continuing contribution to the Board, it has been agreed that, subject to re-election by the shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, his appointment will be extended for an additional three year term.
The basic fee payable to each of the four non-executive directors is 40,000 per annum.
The Rt Hon Lord Freeman and Mr Much each receive an additional fee of 6,000 per annum, in respect of their Chairmanship of the Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee respectively.
Fees for the non-executive directors are determined annually by the Board, having regard to the practice of other companies and the particular demands of the Group.
The Company provides private medical insurance for Mr Scobie, Mr Evans and Air Marshal Sir Peter Norriss, and their respective spouses.
The non-executive directors do not participate in the Companys pension, bonus or share-based incentive schemes.
However, Mr Evans does receive a pension from the Chemring Group Executive Pension Scheme, which he accrued during his former employment with the Company.
In addition, a long term incentive scheme, known as The Chemring Group Phantom Share Option Scheme, was established in 1997 to secure the appointment of Mr Scobie as Chairman at a dif cult time when the Group was undergoing a fundamental reorganisation.
Mr Scobie, who was the only participant in the scheme, acquired a contractual entitlement on his appointment in 1997 to the grant of phantom options over 141,025 ordinary shares in the Company at a notional exercise price of 78p per share.
Mr Scobie exercised his rights under this scheme on 31 October 2007 and received a cash payment from the Company in November 2007 of 3,008,063 gross, being equivalent to the difference between the market value of the ordinary shares on the exercise date 2,211p less the total exercise price.
This scheme has now terminated.
