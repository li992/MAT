The value of these awards when made was 75% of a participants basic salary.
The market value of shares at the date of the provisional award is the average mid-market price over the 20 dealing days prior to the start of the plan 2 The provisional LTIP award to Paul Stockton for the 2008 10 plan cycle was made in August 2008 and was reduced pro-rata to reect the fact that he joined Rathbones part way through the plan cycle Share options Historically, share options were granted to senior employees whom it was considered would have a significant impact on the earnings and profitability of the Group during the following five years.
The Board is of the view that, following the introduction of International Financial Reporting Standards, share options are increasingly expensive to administer and that there is a mis-match between their cost to the business and their perceived value to employees.
In future, option grants will only be made in exceptional circumstances.
Options are no longer granted to directors after their appointment to the Board.
Options granted prior to 21 June 2004 can be exercised if the earnings per share of the Group during the period from grant to the date of notication of exercise has increased in percentage terms by more than the increase in the Retail Price Index RPI plus 2% per annum or pro rata for any part thereof.
Options granted after 21 June 2004 can be exercised if the earnings per share of the Group between the accounting period immediately prior to the option grant and the accounting period immediately prior to the third anniversary of grant has increased in percentage terms by more than the increase in the RPI plus 3% per annum or pro rata for any part thereof.
Option grants to a participant in a ten year rolling period are capped at four times remuneration.
There is no automatic waiving of performance conditions in the event of a change of control or the early termination of a participants employment.
Options may not normally be exercised before the third anniversary of the date of grant and expire on the tenth anniversary of grant.
Details of outstanding options at the start and end of the year together with details of options exercised during the year are set out in Table 5.
The terms and conditions of all options have remained unchanged during the year.
