Salary levels are set according to market salary levels and the speci c role of each Executive Director.
Directors who received a bonus They do not vary in line with the Companys pro ts in the year.
this year did so because they met Annual bonuses are calculated according to speci c criteria for each individual.
These criteria relate to aspects of performance Directors can in uence directly, such as performance against an independent or exceeded their targets, and so industry benchmark.
Directors who received a bonus this year did so because they met or exceeded their helped the Company achieve targets, and so helped the Company achieve relative outperformance.
This is a sound basis for setting bonus levels as it incentivises Directors to prioritise long-term value relative outperformance.
It also means that in a strong growth market the Company must still outperform the market if Directors are to earn a bonus they do not bene t simply because the market has grown.
The Company must also outperform in poor market conditions if Directors are to receive a bonus.
The independent industry sector benchmarks we use are provided by the Investment Property Databank IPD.
How is share price performance factored into the Directors remuneration?
It is factored in through the long-term incentive plan and also through awarding part of the annual bonuses in the form of deferred shares which vest after three years.
However, it is not considered best practice to make share price performance a major incentive.
This could encourage Directors to make decisions that bolster the share price in the short-term rather than decisions that bene t the Company and its shareholders in the long term.
However, all Executive Directors must, within five years of joining the Board, own shares with a value of at least 1.5 x basic salary and for the Group Chief Executive 2.0 x basic salary to ensure their interests are aligned with those of shareholders.
How have the discretionary bonus pool and the additional bonus opportunity been re ected in Directors remuneration this year?
Ian Ellis was awarded a bonus from the discretionary bonus pool amounting to 45% of basic salary in recognition of the successful launch of the 1.1bn Trillium Investment Partners Fund in challenging market conditions.
As a consequence of the signi cant relative outperformance in comparison with IPD benchmarks, which represented some 800 million of value preservation for shareholders, Richard Akers and Mike Hussey were awarded bonuses under the additional bonus opportunity of 200% of basic salary, with Francis Salway and Martin Greenslade being awarded bonuses of 130% of basic salary.
How much do you pay Non-executive Directors?
We pay a base fee and in 2007 this was set at 55,000 and set for two years.
Non-executive Directors are paid further amounts for speci c duties and responsibilities, such as chairing a committee, but are not paid more for attending Board Committee meetings.
Please see Table 56a for more information on what we paid our Non-executive Directors this year.
