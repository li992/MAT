Directors remuneration report Composition of the remuneration committee The remuneration committee is appointed by the board and has comprised Howard Phillips, chairman, Norman Murray and Jane Scriven, all of whom are regarded by the board as independent non-executive directors.
Terms of reference and reporting The committee determines, and annually reviews, all elements of executive directors remuneration.
It approves all contracts of executive directors, and any compensation arrangements arising from their termination.
It also approves all grants of share options and LTIP allocations to directors and executives and reviews best practice in executive remuneration.
The committee is made aware of the salary levels of certain senior employees.
Advisers to the remuneration committee The committee has taken external advice on general remuneration levels and comparator information from New Bridge Street Consultants, who do not provide any other services to the company.
Advice is also obtained, where appropriate, from the companys legal advisers, Linklaters.
The committee also received internal advice from Rooney Anand, chief executive, in determining appropriate remuneration and incentive packages for the other executive directors.
Remuneration policy The company operates in a highly competitive market and must attract, motivate and retain high-quality directors.
The committee considers current market practice and makes comparisons with turnover, market capitalisation and operational details against a selection of other companies.
The committee has regard to pay and conditions elsewhere within the group.
No director makes a decision relating to his own remuneration.
Individual directors leave the meeting when their own remuneration is being discussed.
A significant proportion of each executive directors potential remuneration is performance-related, thus aligning the directors interests with those of shareholders and encouraging performance at the highest levels.
Components of directors remuneration The remuneration package of each executive director consists of the following elements: Annual pay Annual pay reects the responsibilities, market value and sustained performance level of executive directors.
Pay is reviewed annually or when a change in responsibility occurs.
Benets in kind The range of taxable benets available to executive directors is listed on page 73.
Bonus Bonus payments are determined by the remuneration committee and awarded where justied by performance.
For the financial year 2007 8 and for future financial years, the executive directors have been and will be eligible to receive an annual incentive bonus, the maximum amount being 100% of annual pay, for the achievement of stretch targets.
The targets are a combination of personal and financial performance targets agreed in advance by the committee, with the financial targets relating to operating profit and profit before tax and exceptional items and specic business unit related targets.
The performance targets are commercially sensitive and are therefore excluded from this report.
Pensions Tim Bridge is a deferred member of the groups dened benefit and supplementary pension schemes.
He is entitled to receive a pension equivalent to 1 45 of his final pensionable earnings for each year of service, with a pro-rata payment for part years, subject to HMRC limits.
Final pensionable earnings will be determined by reference to his earnings immediately prior to him ceasing to be chief executive.
The scheme also provides a cash lump sum accrual.
The pension arrangements for Rooney Anand, Justin Adams, Ian Bull, David Elliott and Jonathan Lawson are on a dened contribution basis.
They all have self-invested personal pension schemes to which the company makes a contribution.
The contribution rates are 25% for Rooney Anand, as chief executive, and David Elliott, on an age-related basis, and 20% for the remainder of the executive directors.
No element of remuneration other than annual pay is treated as pensionable and the retirement age for the schemes is 60.
Justin Adams, David Elliott and Jonathan Lawson participate in a group death-in-service insurance scheme.
Death benets in excess of the HMRC maximum, where applicable, were provided through additional insurance.
Since A-Day, life assurance provision for Rooney Anand and Ian Bull has been through an HMRC approved excepted life policy.
The cost of this insurance is disclosed as a non-cash benefit in the emoluments table below.
Executive share option scheme Executive directors and other senior employees are rewarded for delivering long-term performance by the phased granting of share options.
The groups executive share option scheme offers the executive directors an annual grant with a value up to the level of their annual pay.
In certain exceptional situations, the remuneration committee can issue shares with an exercise cost up to 2 times annual pay.
The committee approves all grants of share options to directors and does not grant options at a discount to the prevailing closing price.
Options can only be exercised between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant and then only if the stretching performance conditions have been met.
These conditions relate to the growth in audited adjusted earnings per share.
Awards granted prior to September 2005 require growth to exceed RPI ination by 3% per annum compound, measured over any of the periods of three, four or five consecutive financial years of the company, starting with the year in which the award is granted.
Awards granted from September 2005 onwards require growth to exceed RPI ination by 4% per annum compound, measured over the period of three consecutive financial years of the company, starting with the year in which the award is granted.
GREENE KING PLC 71 ANNUAL REPORT 2007 08 Management and governance Directors remuneration report Earnings per share growth has been chosen as the most appropriate performance measure as it directly aligns the individual incentive arrangement with the long-term interests of shareholders.
The specic performance measures were selected to ensure that options can only be exercised if shareholders had first benefited from material earnings growth in real terms over a number of years.
Long-term incentive plan The company also operates a long-term incentive plan LTIP for the benefit of the executive directors and a limited number of senior executives, to reward them for delivering superior long-term performance.
No executive director will in any year receive an award which is greater than their annual pay.
Awards granted to date under the LTIP will only vest if the companys growth in earnings per share is equal to or greater than the increase in RPI plus 4% per annum compound over the three consecutive financial years starting immediately before the award.
At this level, 25% of the award rounded down to the nearest 1,000 shares will vest.
100% of the award will vest if the companys growth in earnings per share is greater than the increase in RPI plus 10% per annum over the same three-year period.
There is a pro-rata scale rounded down to the nearest 1,000 shares between the minimum level of RPI plus 4% and the maximum level of RPI plus 10%.
If the targets are not met, the award will lapse.
As with the executive share option scheme, earnings per share growth has been chosen as the most appropriate performance measure as it directly aligns with the long-term interests of shareholders.
In the light of the current challenging market conditions, as recognised by analysts forecasts, and the necessity of providing a long-term incentive award package which is seen by participants to be appropriately challenging in the current economic environment, the company consulted with a number of its major institutional shareholders with regard to the performance conditions.
As a result the earnings per share growth range will be changed from RPI plus 4-10% to RPI plus 3-8% for awards to be granted during 2008 9.
The remuneration committee is satisfied that this performance condition remains a challenging target.
The performance target will continue to be reviewed for subsequent awards by the remuneration committee to ensure that it is sufciently challenging.
Employee share schemes In common with all other employees, the executive directors are also entitled to participate in the sharesave and share incentive plan.
Further details of these schemes are given later in this report, together with the directors entitlements under them.
Remuneration from other companies Since September 2007 Rooney Anand has served as a non-executive director of Drive Assist Holdings Limited, a company unconnected with the group.
He is entitled to receive and retain for his personal benefit 40,000 per annum from that company by way of directors fees.
Remuneration for non-executive directors The fees paid to the chairman and the other non-executive directors are determined by the board as a whole.
They are agreed after taking external advice and making market comparisons, and relate to the services of the directors in connection with the companys business.
The non-executive directors do not have service agreements and cannot participate in the pension scheme, the bonus scheme or the share option schemes.
Service agreements Newly appointed executive directors are offered a service agreement with a notice period of one year.
In the event of the employment of an executive director being terminated, the committee would pay due regard to best practice and take account of the individuals duty to mitigate their loss.
Rooney Anand, Justin Adams, Ian Bull, David Elliott and Jonathan Lawson, whose contracts with the company commenced on 6 August 2001, 5 September 2005, 9 January 2006, 3 November 1998, and 10 April 2007 respectively, are all subject to one year notice periods from the company.
Those contracts do not contain any additional terms relating to compensation for termination of employment.
The terms of Rooney Anands appointment as chief executive were agreed and set out in a letter dated 24 December 2004.
Non-executive directors are appointed pursuant to letters of appointment for three-year periods.
