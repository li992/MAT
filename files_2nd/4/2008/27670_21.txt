The speci c short-term goals delivered for the balance of 2008 were: Devise and implement a strategy for resolving issues at the Groups US Life operation including Old Mutual Bermuda Devise and implement a new strategy by the end of the first quarter of 2009 Agree a new operating model Replace incumbents of key positions affected by the restructuring Devise and implement a capital plan with the agreement of the Board Win stakeholders support for the agreed strategy.
The Chairman and the Committee assessed Mr Roberts performance against these agreed milestones as a whole, since they had not been allocated individual weightings for this purpose.
It was agreed that Mr Roberts had taken on the role in very dif cult circumstances and had addressed the challenges purposefully and proactively and had made substantial progress in delivering all the crucial elements of these milestones during his first four months in the role.
These included a signi cant restructuring of Group management structures, which involved a number of senior appointments both internal and external, signi cant progress in addressing the problems at US Life including Old Mutual Bermuda and agreeing with the Board a new operating model and capital plan.
All of these actions put the Group on a stronger footing for 2009.
The strategy and operating model implementation will be rolled out during 2009 and so the ultimate impact of these actions will be assessed over that period.
The Committee agreed a final score of 75 percent based on its detailed analysis of the maximum attributable to Mr Roberts performance for this period.
Historic performance targets applicable to share incentives Historically, the vesting of executive share options and, in certain cases, restricted share awards, was subject to the successful achievement of EPS-based targets.
Before 2006, EPS was measured on a UK GAAP basis and, after the introduction of IFRS, on an IFRS basis.
As a result of the acquisition of Skandia, existing unvested awards were converted to a European Embedded Value EEV EPS basis and the 2006 awards were also based on EEV EPS.
Both conversions from UK GAAP to IFRS and subsequently to EEV EPS were validated with KPMG Audit Plc and the rationale for the use of EEV EPS targets following the Skandia acquisition was set out in the Notice of an Extraordinary General Meeting containing the related resolution approved by shareholders in November 2005.
During 2008, the Company decided to convert its embedded value accounting standard from EEV to Market Consistent Embedded Value MCEV.
It was therefore necessary to agree an acceptable conversion basis for EEV EPS-based targets attached to the 2006 share options and bonus-matching restricted share awards, to MCEV EPS.
It was clear on the basis of the conversion agreed that targets for the vesting of share options and bonus-matching restricted share awards made during 2006 would not be met under either method and, as a result, the 2006 options and bonus-matching awards lapsed on 4 March 2009.
The Committee obtains external audit sign-off on attainment of any performance targets as part of its oversight procedures, in which KPMG Audit Plc validates the performance measurement and submits a report to the Committee advising the relative vesting of each speci c award.
A summary of the targets attached to the unvested share options and restricted share awards under the SOP, RSP and OMSA Management Incentive Share Plan MISP is set out in the table below.
Plans covered Year of grant by targets Target 1 Target 2 Target 3 For bonus-matching restricted share For tier 2 of share option awards For tier 3 of share option awards awards and tier 1 of share option between 100% and 200% of above 200% of base salary awards up to 100% of base salary base salary 2007 SOP Growth in IFRS EPS must exceed Growth in IFRS EPS must exceed Growth in IFRS EPS must exceed 2008 MISP growth in UK RPI by at least 9% growth in UK RPI by at least 12% growth in UK RPI by at least15% RSP over the three-year vesting period over the three-year vesting period over the three-year vesting period New targets applicable to share incentives to be granted in 2009 For awards under the bonus-matching plan in 2009, a new target of Return on Average Equity RoAE will be added to the IFRS EPS measure, which has been amended as shown below, so that targets for long-term incentive awards now re ect the two major measures of pro tability and capital management applied across the Group.
Equal weight is attached to the two metrics for the vesting of any award and vesting of each is attained against the three tiers speci ed below.
One-third of each award vests on attainment of both the RoAE and EPS targets at each tier, with pro-rata vesting between tiers, after tier one has been attained.
Targets are tested on a once-only basis after three years from the year prior to the grant and any award or part thereof that does not vest then lapses.
Page 122 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 The targets for vesting of bonus-matching share incentives to be granted in 2009 are set out in the table below: Return on Average Equity Tier 1 Tier 2 Tier 3 % % % RoAE required 10 11 12 Real growth in adjusted operating pro t IFRS earnings per share Growth factor above UK RPI Tier 1 Tier 2 Tier 3 Stock Market growth % % % 50% 9.0 12.0 15.0 0% 0.0 3.0 6.0 Measured by the growth of the JSE ALSI and FTSE 100 indices.
To re ect the current uncertain outlook for stock market levels to which the Groups earnings are substantially correlated the required level of growth in IFRS EPS above UK RPI is dependent on the growth of a composite calculation of the JSE ALSI and FTSE 100 indices between Q4 2008 and Q4 2011.
As re ected in the table above, the EPS targets will increase proportionately to the combined market indices where the targets will be UK RPI plus 0 percent, 3 percent and 6 percent over three years for tiers 1, 2 and 3 respectively where there is no growth in stock markets, to a maximum of UK RPI plus 9 percent, 12 percent and 15 percent where the combined market growth is 50 percent or more over the three years.
Intermediate levels for these targets relative to stock market growth will be interpolated between the points.
Growth will be calculated by the value of 100 invested as follows: 33.33 in the FTSE 100 index average price over Q4 2008 66.67 in the JSE ALSI index average price over Q4 2008 against the value of that investment in calculated by reference to the average price converted into, in the case of the JSE ALSI component, by reference to the average daily exchange rates for the period on the respective indices over Q4 2011.

Maximum for 2009 2,627,500 Page 126 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 STI targets for performance year 2009 The respective weightings attached to the Group metrics shown as a percentage of base salary for the executive directors STI for 2009 are as follows: Mr P Broadley Mr J Roberts Metric Group % Group % IFRS earnings Adjusted Operating Pro t per share 30 45 Return on equity 30 45 MCEV earnings 15 22.5 Subtotal 75 112.5 Personal objectives 75 37.5 In his role as Group Finance Director, Mr P Broadley is responsible to the Board for all financial matters including management control over the internal audit and risk functions.

Share Option and Deferred The purpose of the SOP which is now closed to new awards was to grant share 38,973,188 Delivery Plan SOP options as short-term or long-term incentives to qualifying senior employees.
Grants were phased annually so that no undue incentive arose in relation to any year of maturity.
Shares held under option cannot be transferred, assigned or charged prior to exercise, except on death, and the option would lapse on any attempt to do so.
Restricted Share Plan RSP The purpose of the RSP which is now closed to new awards was: i to assist in the 16,788,536 recruitment of key individuals by making awards of shares, restricted for three or more years, which lapse on prior termination of employment unless special circumstances apply: and ii to support retention of key talent by a contingent share awards that form the deferred element of an annual incentive award, based on performance evaluation for the prior year: and b bonus matching awards.
Shares held under award cannot be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise disposed of prior to vesting, except on death, and the awards would lapse on any attempt to do so.
UK Sharesave Plan Sharesave The purpose of Sharesave which is now closed to new awards was to provide 7,434,016 a savings and investment opportunity for employees of the Groups participating UK businesses, which encouraged share ownership at all levels.
Options were granted for threeor five-year periods at a discount of up to 20% from the market price during a reference period shortly before the date of grant.
Sharesave has been replaced for future awards by the new 2008 Sharesave Plan described above.
The OMSA Broad-Based Employee This plan was designed in the context of the Groups plans to promote black economic 5,433,574 Share Plan empowerment BEE in its wholly-owned South African and Namibian businesses to offer an opportunity of ownership of Old Mutual shares to all permanent staff of those businesses who were not in any of the Companys other share schemes, through a one-off award of shares.
Grants of share awards in connection with the South African BEE transactions were made in October 2005 and in connection with Namibian BEE transactions in April 2007.
There is currently no intention for further awards to be made to South African or Namibian employees under this plan.
During the restricted period, a participant may not dispose of or transfer any of his or her restricted shares or any interest in them.
Page 128 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Employee share plans continued Shares under award or option at Name of Plan Description 31 December 2008 The OMSA Senior Black Management The purpose of the SBP is to help Old Mutual South Africa and Old Mutual Namibia 17,785,998 Share Plan SBP to attract and retain senior black managers in light of the increased competition for talented and experienced black management.
It provides for the award of restricted shares and the grant of share options.
Grants are made in addition to the normal annual share incentive allocations under the OMSA Management Incentive Share Plan described below.
A participant may not dispose of or transfer his rights to the option or the shares related to it without the directors written consent and any attempt to do so would result in the option lapsing.
During the restricted period, a participant may not dispose of or transfer any of his restricted shares or any interest in them.
The OMSA Management Incentive The purpose of the MISP is to attract, retain and reward senior and middle management 47,665,950 Share Plan MISP at Old Mutual South Africa and Old Mutual Namibia.
It provides for awards of both restricted shares and share options on similar terms and conditions to the SRP, SOP and RSP.
Total shares held under award or option at 31 December 2008 135,397,051 Change of control Under the rules of the respective schemes, in the event of a change of control of Old Mutual plc: Restricted shares and options granted under the SRP would vest in full Performance shares and options granted under the PSP would vest: i to the extent that the performance criteria to which such options are subject have been met: and ii on a pro-rata basis to re ect the reduction in the length of the original performance period, although the Committee does have discretion to disapply the length of service pro-rating for compassionate reasons Options granted under the SOP and awards granted under the RSP would vest in full Options granted under the MISP would vest: i to the extent that the performance criteria to which such options are subject have been met and ii on a pro-rata basis to re ect the reduction in the length of the original performance period Restricted share awards granted under the MISP and the OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Plan would vest in full Options and restricted share awards granted under the OMSA Senior Black Management Share Plan would vest in full Options granted under the SAYE and Sharesave would become exercisable to the extent of the savings accumulated.
The Committee has reviewed the operation of the current share incentive schemes, including how discretion is exercised and the grant levels currently applicable, and considers these to be appropriate to the Companys current circumstances and prospects.
Page 129 Financials Governance REMUNERATION REPORT continued Employee Share Ownership Trusts The Group operates a number of Employee Share Ownership Trusts ESOTs, through which it collateralises some of its obligations under employee share schemes.
At 31 December 2008, the following shares in the Company were held in ESOTs: Old Mutual plc Trust Country Shares held in trust 1 Capital Growth Investment Trust Zimbabwe 1,063,577 2 Old Mutual plc Employee Share Trust Guernsey 13,429,570 3 OMN Broad-Based Employee Share Trust Namibia 904,224 3 OMN Management Incentive Trust Namibia 2,234,800 4 OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Trust South Africa 32,131,364 4 OMSA Management Incentive Trust South Africa 83,604,527 4 OMSA Share Trust South Africa 28,056,209 Total 161,424,271 1 The Capital Growth Investment Trust is used to satisfy restricted share awards or Deferred Delivery Shares in Zimbabwe under a locally run scheme.
Any surplus shares held in trust because of non-vesting are taken into account when purchasing shares in respect of future grants.
2 The Old Mutual plc Employee Share Trust is used to satisfy awards under the RSP, SRP and PSP excluding South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe.
Its strategy is to hold shares approximately equal to the number of shares awarded, but not yet vested, at any time.
Any surplus shares held in trust because of non-vesting are taken into account when purchasing shares in respect of future awards.
3 The OMN Broad-Based Employee Share Trust and the OMN Management Incentive Trust were established during 2006 to subscribe for and hold shares in the Company in connection with its Namibian BEE ownership transactions.
The OMN Broad-Based Employee Share Trust holds shares for the purposes of the Namibian awards under both the OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Plan and the OMSA Senior Black Management Share Plan, while the OMN Management Incentive Trust holds shares for Namibian awards under the OMSA MISP.
Awards to white employees in Namibia under the OMSA MISP are settled by the OMSA Share Trust.
4 The OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Trust and the OMSA Management Incentive Trust were established during 2005 to subscribe for and hold shares in the Company in connection with its South African BEE ownership transactions.
The OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Trust holds shares for the purposes of both the OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Plan and the OMSA Senior Black Management Share Plan, while the OMSA Management Incentive Trust holds shares for the OMSA MISP.
Awards to white employees under the OMSA MISP and all awards that have been granted to South African and Namibian employees under the restricted share plan and share option and deferred delivery plan are settled by the OMSA Share Trust.
The strategy has historically been to ensure that suf cient shares were acquired to match at least 90 percent of the obligations of each share incentive grant.
However, as a result of the requirements of the Companys BEE transactions in South Africa and Namibia, it was necessary to place shares allotted as part of the transactions in the relevant BEE employee share trusts immediately, in order to cover the total annual share grant allocations likely to be made to black participants in terms of the BEE transactions up to 2014 and 2016 respectively.
The general practice of the ESOTs shown in the table above save for the BEE-related trusts is not to vote the shares held at shareholder meetings, although bene ciaries of restricted shares may in principle give directions for those shares to be voted.
However, with respect to the OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Trust, the OMSA Management Incentive Trust, the OMN Broad-Based Employee Share Trust and the OMN Management Incentive Trust, the Trustees may, because of BEE considerations, vote any unallocated shares held in these trusts as well as those shares held in respect of any unexercised share options.
The bene ciaries of any restricted shares allocated by these BEE employee share trusts are entitled to vote their relevant shares.
Options granted under the SOP for employees outside South Africa and Namibia, Sharesave and those to be granted under the SRP, PSP and SAYE are currently intended to be settled by the issue of new shares rather than using shares held in an employee bene t trust.
Dilution limits For the purposes of calculating dilution limits, any awards that are satis ed by transfer of pre-existing issued shares such as shares acquired by market purchase through ESOTs and any shares comprised in any option that has lapsed are disregarded.
The Company has complied with these limits at all times.
At 31 December 2008, the Company had 2.41 percent of share capital available under the 5 percent in five years limit applicable to discretionary share incentive schemes and 6.29 percent of share capital available under the 10 percent in 10 years limit applicable to all share incentive schemes.
The issued share capital gure used for this calculation has not been reduced to re ect shares bought back into treasury by the Company.
Subsidiaries share incentive schemes The Companys separately-listed subsidiaries, Nedbank Group Limited and Mutual & Federal Insurance Company Limited, have their own share incentive schemes, which are under the control of the Remuneration Committees of their respective boards and are not further addressed in this Report.
None of the past or present executive directors of the Company has any interest under any such subsidiary share incentive schemes.
Page 130 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Directors interests under employee share plans The following options and rights over shares in the Company were outstanding at 1 January and 31 December 2008 in favour of the executive directors under the employee share schemes described in the Employee share plans section above.

Mr Roberts retained all 283,058 shares.
7 The number of shares awarded under the RSP bonus match on 3 April 2008 was calculated by reference to a price of 122.89p per share, being the price at which the matching shares were acquired by the Old Mutual plc Employee Share Trust.
8 Mr Roberts Sharesave option lapsed on 31 December 2008 as a result of not being exercised within six months of the maturity date.
9 The Sharesave option price was determined as 20 percent below the average of the Companys share price between 5 and 9 May 2005.

Company share price performance The market price of the Companys shares was 55p at 31 December 2008 and ranged from a low of 39p to a high of 169.3p during 2008.
Executive directors shareholding requirements The Committee has established guidelines on shareholdings by executive directors of the Company.
Under these, the Group Chief Executive is expected to build up a holding of shares in the Company equal in value to at least 150 percent of annual base salary within five years of appointment: the equivalent gure for other executive directors is 100 percent of annual base salary.
For the purposes of the calculations, unvested restricted share awards are excluded.
The following table shows Old Mutual plc shares held by executive directors at 31 December 2008 including holdings by connected persons compared to the shareholding requirements prescribed by these guidelines.

The other seven non-executive directors are engaged on terms that may be terminated by either side without notice.
However, it is envisaged that they will remain in place on a three-year cycle, in order to provide assurance to both the Company and the non-executive director concerned that the appointment is likely to continue.
The renewal of non-executive directors terms for successive three-year cycles is not automatic, with the continued suitability of each non-executive director being assessed by the Nomination Committee.
In the absence of exceptional circumstances, the Board has determined that non-executive directors engagements will be terminated at the end of their third three-year cycle.
The original dates of appointment and the dates when the current appointments of the non-executive directors are due to terminate are as follows: Date current Date of original Date of current Current term appointment appointment appointment as director terminates rd Mr N Andrews 1 June 2002 1 June 2008 3 1 June 2011 rd Mr R Bogni 1 Feb 2002 1 Feb 2008 3 1 Feb 2011 nd Mr R Edey 24 June 2004 24 June 2007 2 24 June 2010 nd Mr R Khoza 27 Jan 2006 27 Jan 2009 2 27 Jan 2012 st Mr B Nqwababa 1 April 2007 1 April 2007 1 1 April 2010 st Mr L Otterbeck 14 Nov 2006 14 Nov 2006 1 14 Nov 2009 st Mr R Pym 1 Sep 2007 1 Sep 2007 1 1 Sep 2010 Mr N Broadhurst retired from the Board and also ceased to be Chairman of the Group Audit and Risk Committee and a member of the Remuneration and Nomination Committees at the end of the AGM on 8 May 2008.
