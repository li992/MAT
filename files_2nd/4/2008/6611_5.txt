In an effort to address this, The current economic climate, as well as the change from a we propose that where there has been continuity of executive US-based to a UK-based Chief Executive Of cer, has provided responsibility between initiation of an adverse event and its an opportunity to make some fundamental changes to GSKs emergence as a problem, the adverse event should be taken into remuneration policy.

This means, of course, that we do not intend to with views expressed by investors, particularly those in the UK, penalise an executive for the misjudgements of his predecessor and to re ect better GSKs UK home base.
As such, the most as far as annual bonus is concerned, although the consequences fundamental changes will apply largely to some of the companys of an adverse event for the share price will inevitably reduce the UK-based executives, including the Chief Executive Of cer and potential value of long-term incentives.

roles, will continue to be benchmarked against other global pharmaceutical companies to re ect the market in which GSK Annual Bonus Plan competes for that talent.
We will not operate the additional bonus agged in the 2007 Remuneration Report, but will integrate it within the existing As far as benchmarking the Chief Executive Of cer role is annual bonus structure.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity concerned, this shift from global pharmaceuticals to UK crosswill remain at 200% of salary.
We are reducing the 96% industry companies represents a major change and will have performance threshold for annual plans to 90%, re ecting more a signi cant impact on the structure and quantum of his stretching annual bonus plan targets.
At this time, at least, the proposed remuneration package of the Chief Executive Of cer would be well below the In addition, the Chief Executive Of cer and Chief Financial Of cer median of his pharmaceutical industry peers.
and other Executives who do not participate in the share option plan will also have the opportunity to invest up to half of their annual bonus in GSK shares and this will be matched subject to relative total shareholder return performance over three years.
GSK Annual Report 2008 79 Report of the Directors Remuneration Report continued Aligning performance measures to strategy The performance conditions for the performance share plan will be broadened so that the CET is incentivised against a range of measures.
It is intended that broadly half of the award will continue to be based on relative total shareholder return against other global pharmaceutical companies.
The remaining half will be based on an additional measure or measures to support GSKs strategy over the coming years.
For awards made in 2009, 60% of the award will remain on relative total shareholder return against global pharmaceutical companies.
The remaining 40% will be targeted at generating cash for investment and or return to shareholders.
Accordingly, for 2009 awards, 40% will be subject to the achievement of adjusted free cash ow targets.
The Committee may make adjustments for acquisitions and divestments, currency movements and other distortions which may arise.
Subject to shareholder approval, the 2009 performance share awards will be made following the AGM in May 2009.
To satisfy concerns about transparency, we will disclose the adjusted free cash ow targets for the performance share awards in the announcement to the London Stock Exchange each time an award is made.
Re ecting the long-term nature of the pharmaceutical industry To re ect better the long-term nature of the pharmaceutical industry, the performance period for the performance shares granted to members of the CET will be extended so that half of the total shareholder return element of each award will be measured over three years and half over four years.
The performance period for share options granted to CET members in 2009 will similarly be extended.
In addition, to support further our emphasis on long-term decision making, the timeframes for vesting of awards on retirement and redundancy will be extended to maturity rather than vesting in the year of departure.
Over time, the Committee would like to see the range of longterm performance measures more fully re ect the companys strategic direction eg turnover growth and R&D productivity.
However, before introducing such metrics, the Committee wants to be satis ed that the measures are robust and not capable of creating unintended behaviour.
The Committee believes that the new policy represents a signi cant step forward in supporting the future direction of the business and is in the best interests of shareholders.
