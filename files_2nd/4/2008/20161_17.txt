Background The Company operates in the private equity sector and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.
The majority of the Companys competitors are either partnerships of individuals managing funds for investment on behalf of third parties or unquoted subsidiaries of larger banking or financial services groups.
In the private equity industry the ability of trained and experienced executives to gain substantial rewards remains and therefore maintaining a remuneration structure to support the recruitment and retention of senior executives continues to be critical.
In addition to cash bonuses, it is market practice for investment executives in the private equity sector to be given the opportunity to participate in co-investment and carried interest investment plans which create close alignment of the executives interests with those of investors in the funds that they manage or advise.
The executives put their own money at risk by co-investing and are able to share directly in the future returns on investments, subject normally to a variety of conditions relating to the performance of those investments.
The left hand graph below compares the Companys total shareholder return 3i TSR for the five financial years to 31 March 2008 with the total shareholder return of the FTSE All-Share Index.
The Directors consider that since the Company invests in a broad range of industrial and commercial sectors, this continues to be the most appropriate index against which to compare the Companys total shareholder return.
Additional information is provided by the right hand graph below, which compares percentage changes in the Companys diluted net asset value per share over each of the last five financial years with dividends re-invested with the FTSE All-Share Index total return over the same periods.
This has been included as net asset value growth is one of the tests used in the Companys long-term incentive schemes.

Non-executive Directors The Companys policy for the financial year to 31 March 2009 the coming year for non-executive Directors including the Chairman continues to be to pay fees which are competitive with the fees paid by other financial services companies of broadly similar UK market capitalisation.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible for bonuses, share options, long-term incentives, pensions or performance-related remuneration.
The Company does not currently expect its policy on non-executive Directors remuneration for subsequent financial years to change significantly.
Non-executive Directors fees other than those of the Chairman, which are determined by the Committee are regularly reviewed and determined by the Board as a whole, within the limits set by the Companys Articles of Association from time to time, having taken advice from the Committees remuneration advisers.
Details of non-executive Directors remuneration for the year, which include fees for sitting on or chairing Board committees where relevant, are set out in the table on page 70.
During the year, arrangements were introduced to ensure that non-executive Directors other than those based in the US take part of their basic fee in the form of ordinary shares in the Company: for non-executive Directors this amounted to 1,000 shares a year: and for the Chairman 5,000 shares a year, purchased in November each year.
Executive Directors The Companys policy for the coming year for executive Directors is to provide remuneration and other benefits sufficient to attract, retain and motivate executives of the calibre required.
Variable remuneration comprising annual cash bonuses, deferred share bonuses and long-term incentives is intended to form a substantial component of total remuneration.
When setting executive Directors remuneration, the Committee is able to evaluate corporate performance on environmental, social and governance issues.
a Salaries and bonuses The Committee is sensitive to wider issues including pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group when setting executive Directors pay levels and takes into account the Companys reward strategy generally, before deciding specific packages for the executive Directors.
The average percentage increases in base salaries per annum for members of Management Committee including executive Directors and for other executive staff in the UK employed in the period from 31 March 2007 to 31 March 2008 were 5.6% and 11.5% respectively.
Policy for the coming year for: i the Chief Executive and Finance Director continues to be to pay salaries, and if appropriate discretionary bonuses, which are competitive with those paid by other financial services companies of broadly similar UK market capitalisation.
Salary supplements are paid to both, to enable them to make additional pension provision: and ii executive Directors responsible for investment business, currently only Mr Queen, continues to be to pay salaries, and if appropriate discretionary bonuses, competitive with those paid in the private equity industry.
Executive Directors discretionary annual bonuses are non-pensionable.
Target bonuses for each executive Director are determined by the Committee at the beginning of each year.
Bonus awards are assessed against the achievement of corporate, personal and business targets.
Following consultation with 3is major shareholders in 2007 on executive Directors remuneration, bonus targets were revised for 2007-08.
The Chief Executive and Mr Queen had target bonuses of 125% of base salary, whilst the Finance Director had a target bonus of 100% of base salary.
Bonuses above target will only be paid to executive Directors for outstanding performance, and the maximum is twice the target bonus.
For both the Chief Executive and the Finance Director, any bonus over 100% of base salary will be in shares deferred for two years and for Mr Queen any bonus in excess of 1.5 times target will be in shares deferred for two years.
However, this year the approach for Mr Queen was that any bonus in excess of 1 times target excluding the exceptional bonus referred to in note 1 on page 78 would be paid in deferred shares.
The Committee retains discretion to make adjustments to bonus arrangements in appropriate circumstances.
The main measures used to assess corporate performance for the year were: total shareholder return and change in net asset value per share, both in absolute terms and compared with the FTSE All-Share Index: total non market-driven return: and one to three year internal rate of return compared with performance of other companies in the private equity industry.
In forming its overall judgment the Committee also took into account a number of more detailed indicators of performance and activity, such as the level of investment, realised profits and costs.
The Committees view, after taking account of the performance measures referred to above, was that bonuses above target although below maximum were appropriate for all three executive Directors.
This was in light of strong total return on opening shareholders funds of 18.6% and the fact the greater part of this came from non market-driven factors.
On a three year performance basis, returns outperformed the European private equity industry.
Realised profits on the sale of investments of 523 million were high as were levels of investment at 2,160 million and realisation proceeds at 1,742 million.
Within the maximum of two times target bonus, combined awards ranged from 1.52 to 1.65 times target, which translated into 1.0 to 1.24 times salary in cash and 0.52 to 0.94 times salary in shares deferred for two years.
Report and accounts 2008 3i Group plc 69 Directors remuneration report continued b Long-term incentives During the year, long-term incentive arrangements for the Chief Executive and Finance Director consisted of share options, Performance Share awards and Super-performance Share awards under the 3i Group Discretionary Share Plan the Discretionary Share Plan.
The Discretionary Share Plan The Discretionary Share Plan is a shareholder-approved executive share plan conforming with the Association of British Insurers guidelines on dilution limits.
The level of annual awards of options, Performance Shares and Super-performance Shares is reviewed each year taking account of market practice, individual performance, the specific circumstances facing the Company and calculations of the fair values of awards.
During the year, the Companys policy was that maximum annual awards should be market price options with an aggregate exercise price of six times annual salary and three times salary in respect of Performance Shares and Super-performance Shares.
This was subject to an overall limit on the fair value of all share-based awards of 2.5 times salary.
During the year awards were made to the Chief Executive and to the Finance Director with face values of approximately six times salary in share options, 1.9 times salary in Performance Shares and 1.1 times salary in Super-performance Shares.
The Committees remuneration advisers calculate the fair values of share-based awards.
For the coming year, these fair values have been calculated by the Committees remuneration advisers to be 17% of face value for share options, 52% of face value for Performance Share awards and 24.4% of face value for Super-performance Share awards.
These fair values are subject to re-calculation in changing market conditions.
The Infrastructure Incentive Plan The Infrastructure Incentive Plan is a part-deferred bonus plan established during the year to provide senior members of the Infrastructure team, including Mr Queen, with incentives aligning the interests of the executives with those of the Group and investors in 3i Infrastructure Limited.
The Company does not currently have any plans to alter its policy on executive Directors remuneration for the coming year.

70 3i Group plc Report and accounts 2008 Portfolio and additional Directors report Directors remuneration report Auditors report Financial statements financial information Information for shareholders Share options Options granted under the Companys executive share option plans entitle executives to acquire ordinary shares, at an exercise price based on market price at the date of grant, from the third until the tenth anniversaries of grant.
Vesting of such options is normally subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition, set at the time of the grant, which is calculated over a three-year performance period.
Performance conditions for options granted to Directors since 1 April 2001 are summarised below.
For NAV growth between minimum Award granted NAV growth required for minimum vesting % vesting NAV growth required for maximum vesting % vesting and maximum vesting levels Since At least 31 March 2005 RPI 3 percentage points 30% RPI 8 percentage points 100% The grant vests pro rata In year to At least 31 March 2005 RPI 3 percentage points 50% RPI 8 percentage points 100% The grant vests pro rata Between 1 April 2001 At least and 31 March 2004 RPI 5 percentage points 50% RPI 10 percentage points 100% The grant vests pro rata Notes 1 NAV growth refers to annual percentage compound growth in net asset value per share with dividends reinvested, relative to the annual percentage change in RPI.
2 For options granted after 31 March 2004 there is no opportunity for the performance condition to be retested after the three-year performance period.
These performance conditions are based on increases in net asset value per ordinary share to enable a significant proportion of relevant executive Directors potential remuneration to be linked to an increase in the assets per ordinary share of the Company.
The intention is to approximate to the performance conditions attached to carried interest investment plans in the private equity industry whilst retaining the essential feature of aligning executives interests with those of the Companys shareholders.
The performance conditions were chosen as being appropriately demanding in the prevailing market conditions at the time of grant.
Notes 1 The fair values of awards made in the year were as follows: Mr P E Yea, 993,600 and Mr S P Ball, 621,000.
These fair values have been calculated by the Committees remuneration advisers using a Monte Carlo simulation based on appropriate assumptions.
The fair value of the share options granted during the year was calculated as being 23% of the market value at the date of grant of the shares under option.
69 2 On 16 July 2007, the Company issued 11 B shares for every 8 ordinary shares of 62 88p each existing on 13 July 2007.
This was followed by a share consolidation, of 17 new ordinary 19 69 shares of 73 22p for every 20 ordinary shares of 62 88p.
This was designed to maintain the price per share, other things being equal, at the same level after the bonus issue of B shares as before it.
As a result of this consolidation there was no need to adjust the number of shares comprised in option awards or the exercise price per share and options took effect 19 following the consolidation as options over new ordinary shares of 73 22p.
3 Options granted before 1 April 2001 were granted under The 3i Group 1994 Executive Share Option Plan the 1994 Plan and vested provided a performance condition was met over a rolling three-year period.
This required adjusted net asset value per share after adding back dividends paid during the performance period at the end of the three-year period to equal or exceed the net asset value per share at the beginning of the period compounded annually over the period by the annual increase in the RPI plus 4%.
4 The Committee determines the fulfilment of performance conditions based on calculations which are independently reviewed by the Companys auditors.
These performance conditions require net asset value per ordinary share at the beginning and end of the performance period to be calculated on a consistent basis using the same accounting policies.
Where accounting policies have altered between the beginning and end of the period, the Committee adjusts the net asset value calculations appropriately to ensure consistency.
The Committee also has power to adjust the calculations to reflect circumstances including changes to the capital of the Company.
During the period the Committee made appropriate adjustments to reflect the bonus issue of B shares, the consolidation of the Companys share capital and the repurchase by the Company of its own shares.
5 The market price of ordinary shares in the Company at 31 March 2008 was 830p and the range during the period 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008 was 733.5p to 1,231p.
No Directors exercised share options during the year.
Accordingly, no gains were made by the highest paid director 2007: nil or by all the Directors in aggregate 2007: 402,467.
6 As at 31 March 2008, 16.65 million ordinary shares had been issued or remained issuable in respect of share options granted under Discretionary Share Plans within the past 10 years.
This was within the 5% dilution limit for such plans specified in the guidelines issued by the Association of British Insurers.
As as 31 March 2008, 18.93 million ordinary shares had been issued or remained issuable in respect of awards granted under all employee plans within the past 10 years.
This was within the 10% dilution limit for such plans specified in the above mentioned guidelines.

a Performance Shares Awards made during the year will vest based on the outperformance of the growth in value of a shareholding in the Company with dividends reinvested for the three-year performance period from grant averaged over a 60 day period compared to the growth in value of the FTSE 100 Index with dividends reinvested.
If the growth in value for the Company is below that for the FTSE 100 Index, no part of the award will vest.
If growth in value is the same as the Index, 35% of the award will vest and for outperformance above 8% per annum the full award will vest.
At outperformance between these two levels of performance, the award will vest on a pro rata basis.
Performance Share awards made before 1 April 2007 vest based on the Companys percentage rank by total shareholder return for the three years from grant averaged over a 60 day period compared to a comparator group consisting of the FTSE 100 Index constituents at the grant date adjusted for mergers, demergers and delistings during the performance period.
A companys percentage rank is its rank in the comparator group divided by the number of companies in the group at the end of the performance period expressed as a percentage.
At a percentage rank below 50% no shares vest.
At a rank of 50%, 35% of the shares vest and at 75% all the shares vest.
Between these points shares vest pro rata.
These performance conditions were chosen to align the interests of participants and shareholders by linking remuneration to shareholder returns relative to a comparator index of which the Company is a constituent.
The Committee determines whether conditions have been met based on calculations prepared by the Committees remuneration advisers.
Performance Share awards of ordinary shares and related B shares are detailed below.
These fair values were calculated by the Committees remuneration adviser using a Monte Carlo simulation based on appropriate assumptions.
The fair value of the Performance Shares awarded during the year was calculated as being 52% of the market value at the date of award of the shares subject to the award.
69 2 Ordinary shares held at 1 April 2007 were ordinary shares of 62 88p each.
Adjustment during the year refers to the change in the number of ordinary shares in the award resulting from 19 the consolidation of the Companys share capital on 16 July 2007.
Ordinary shares held at 31 March 2008 were ordinary shares of 73 22p each.
3 For Performance Share awards granted prior to 1 April 2007 including related B shares, dividends during the year including dividends on related B Shares were re-invested net of tax in further ordinary shares of the Company.
These shares, which are in addition to the above Performance Share awards, are required to be held for the remaining vesting period to which they relate, but are not forfeitable.
Such shares attributable to Directors during the year were as follows: Mr P E Yea, 1,605 ordinary shares: and Mr S P Ball, 588 ordinary shares.
4 The market prices of ordinary shares on the dates of vesting of Mr Yeas and Mr Queens awards granted in 2004, shown above, were 10.78 and 11.62 respectively.
5 Bonus issues of B shares were made on: 17 July 2006 on the basis of one B share for each ordinary share held as at 14 July 2006: and 16 July 2007 on the basis of 11 B shares for every eight ordinary shares held as at 13 July 2007.
B shares may, in certain circumstances, be repurchased by the Company at a price of 127p per share.
The B shares detailed above are regarded as forming part of the award from which they derived.

These plans are designed to follow best practice in the private equity industry.
An explanation of how co-investment and carried interest plans operate can be found on pages 120 to 121.
The Companys policy is that awards of carried interest are only normally made to executives who have taken up the opportunity offered to them of participating in co-investment plans.
The Chief Executive and the Finance Director are not eligible to participate in these plans.
Mr Queen has interests in the following co-investment and carried interest plans relating to the areas of the business for which he has responsibility.
Mr Queens interests are shown as a percentage of the relevant pools of investments.

Accrued values can increase and decrease with investment valuations and other factors and will not necessarily lead to a payment of the relevant amount to the participant.

After consultation with major shareholders, it was decided that he would instead receive an exceptional bonus, part of which is to be deferred over the three years to 2009-10.
2 Normally, before any payment to a participant becomes due under the carried interest plans, the Group and funds under its management must first have received back the amount of their investment in the relevant vintage together with a management charge ranging between 1% and 2.5% per annum and a hurdle rate of 8% per annum compound on their investment.
3 The accrued values of the scheme interests are calculated on the basis set out in note 5 on page 89.
4 The total carried interest, for all executives eligible to participate in each plan, does not exceed 15% of the relevant pool of investments made over a specific period usually two years.
The proportion of the total carried interest that is allocated to an executive Director depends, amongst other matters, on the size of their investment team.
During the year the Infrastructure 2005-06 assets and carried interest plan were transferred to 3i Infrastructure Limited.
No Annual Accounts have yet been produced by that company and consequently no accrued value of scheme interest is available.
