The remuneration of the executive Directors in 2008, excluding pension benefits and long term incentives, was as follows: PerformanceCar Other Total Total Date of service Salary related allowance benefits 2008 2007 agreement 000 000 000 000 000 000 a Sir Kevin Smith 24.01.03 748 127 14 5 894 1,430 b c a M J Bryson 01.10.07 337 198 15 26 576 378 b a A Reynolds Smith 14.11.07 383 98 12 5 498 385 d a W C Seeger 11.02.08 365 80 11 93 549 227 a N M Stein 22.08.01 472 105 12 5 594 890 a 2,305 608 64 134 3,111 3,310 a Payments of supplementary allowances to certain executive Directors to assist them towards securing retirement benefits are included in the cash allowances for pension benefit purposes disclosed in the second table on page 70.
The allowances, detailed below, have therefore been excluded from the total remuneration shown in the table above although they are part of the Directors aggregate emoluments for the purpose of disclosure under the Companies Act 1985: Sir Kevin Smith 299,031 2007 287,956 : M J Bryson 37,320 2007 17,780 : A Reynolds Smith 109,920 2007 62,346 : W C Seeger 83,382 2007 30,758 : N M Stein 145,420 2007 134,004. b Appointed to the Board 1 June 2007. c A total of 21,000 of this amount relates to a subsistence allowance to which Mr Bryson was entitled following the relocation of GKNs operational headquarters.
The payment is subject to normal tax and National Insurance deductions.
d Appointed to the Board 10 September 2007.
Under the terms of his service agreement, Mr Seegers emoluments are paid semi-monthly in US$, converted at the exchange rate published in the UK Financial Times on the first business day of the relevant month.
Mr Seeger is a US national who has relocated to the UK in the role of Finance Director.
Additional reimbursement was made by the Company in respect of temporary living costs incurred prior to his relocation.
Mr Seeger had full US Federal and State hypothetical tax withholding through the US payroll in 2008.
As a result of the complicated interaction of the UK and US tax regimes, an additional payment of 254,682 was made by GKN to the UK and US tax authorities on Mr Seegers behalf in order to avoid a period of double taxation.
All subsequent tax refunds resulting from the tax paid by GKN will be refunded to the Company in due course.
A figure of 49,977 is contained within the benefits figure shown, being the best estimate of the amount which is not expected to be refunded based on information available to date.
The 2008 performance-related payments were triggered by the achievement of a number of Group and, where relevant, divisional targets relating to profit before tax, strategy, Lean Enterprise deployment and cash generation which were set in March 2008.
The maximum amount that an individual could receive under the profit element was 80% of salary 85% for the Chief Executive.
In addition, cash flow targets were set for the Group as a whole and, where appropriate, divisional cash flow targets for end June, September and December.
A maximum of 15% of salary could be received under the combined strategy and Lean Enterprise elements 10% for the Chief Executive.
Cash flow targets were achieved in part, resulting in payments of between 7% and 15% of salary.
In relation to profit, only the Aerospace division achieved a level of performance that resulted in a payment of 26% of salary to its Chief Executive, Marcus Bryson.
In relation to strategy performance, achievements resulted in payments of 10% of salary and in relation to Lean Enterprise achievements resulted in payments of 5% of salary.
Actual total payments to executive Directors under the 2008 short term variable remuneration scheme varied between 17% and 56% of salary.
The remuneration of the non-executive Directors in 2008 was as follows: Total Total 2008 2007 000 000 R D Brown 300 270 Sir Ian Gibson 50 H C-J Mamsch 50 45 Sir Christopher Meyer 50 45 a R Parry-Jones 42 J N Sheldrick 61 54 Sir Peter Williams 65 53 568 517 a Appointed 1 March 2008.

The measurement period in relation to the outstanding awards ends on 31 December 2009. b During 2008, no awards vested and no shares were released to Directors.
b The SAYE share option scheme is open to all UK subsidiary employees with six months service or more.
Participants save a regular monthly sum of up to 250 for three years or five years for options granted prior to 2003 and can use these savings and any bonus payable under the scheme to exercise the options.
For options granted prior to 2003, the exercise price was set at the maximum discount permitted by the Finance Act 1989 of 20% below the market price before the start of the savings period.
For options granted in 2003 this discount was reduced to 10% no SAYE share options have been granted since 2003. c The closing mid-market price of GKN shares on the London Stock Exchange on 31 December 2008 was 97p and the price range during the year was 66.75p to 320.75p.
d At 31 December 2008, the total number of GKN shares which had been issued on the exercise of options granted by the Company or were the subject of such options remaining outstanding under the ESOS and the SAYE share option scheme was 7.0 million and 6.8 million respectively.
This represents approximately 0.9% of the issued share capital of the Company at that date in respect of discretionary i. e. executive schemes and 1.9% of the issued share capital of the Company at that date in respect of all i. e. both executive and all-employee schemes.

GKN granted matching shares on a three and a half for one basis i. e. seven matching shares for every two investment shares purchased which were released to participants who continued to hold the investment shares and remained an employee of the GKN Group on the third anniversary of the date of grant.
An additional condition applied to a one for one proportion of the match which required a Group OPIC operating profit before exceptional items as defined for internal reporting purposes after the application of a notional investment charge performance condition to be achieved before the relevant matching shares could be released.

Directors are prohibited from participating in the PGIP: awards detailed below were granted prior to the relevant individuals appointment as a Director of the Company.
Under the PGIP, the shares which are the subject of the awards are capable of release dependent on the extent to which profit growth targets are satisfied by the Company over a three year performance period which commenced on 1 January 2007: the Companys reported profit for 2006 forms the baseline for this performance measure.
The number of shares stated below will be released following the performance period if the minimum targeted compound annual profit growth 6% is achieved.
A maximum of twice the amount of shares will be released on achievement of the maximum profit target 12%, with 1.5 times the number of shares vesting if 9% profit growth is achieved.
No shares will be released and the awards will lapse if the minimum profit target is not achieved.
Release is also conditional upon the satisfaction of a personal shareholding requirement.

The difference between the Directors pension cost shown in this table and the supplementary allowance amount disclosed in note a on page 67 represents GKNs contribution to the Directors qualified and non-qualified defined pension arrangement equivalent to 11% of Mr Seegers gross earnings.
c The accrued annual pension includes entitlements earned as an employee prior to becoming a Director as well as for qualifying services after becoming a Director.
d Less any contributions made by the Director.
e Increase over the year in accrued pension in excess of inflation to which the Director would have been entitled on leaving service.
f A transfer value represents the present value of accrued benefits.
It does not represent an amount of money which the individual is entitled to receive.
The change in transfer value over the year reflects the additional pension earned and the effect of changes in stock market conditions during the year.
Transfer values as at 31 December 2007 were calculated in accordance with version 9.2 of Guidance Note 11 prepared by the Institute Faculty of Actuaries with effect from 30 December 2005.
In anticipation of new transfer value legislation which came into effect on 1 October 2008, the assumptions used to calculate transfer values from the GKN Group Pension Scheme were amended by the Trustees with effect from April 2008.
The change in assumptions resulted in higher transfer values as at 31 December 2008.
As the transfer values as at 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2008 were not directly comparable, the figures for 2007 have been restated.
Actual figures for the transfer value of accrued annual pensions at 31 December 2007 were as follows: M J Bryson 1,955,000: A Reynolds Smith 156,000: N M Stein 707,000.
