44 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Retirement provision Messrs C Bell and J P OReilly are members of the Executive Section of the LPP, details of which are set out in note 33 on page 85 of the Annual Report 2008.
In respect of base salary above the LPP-specific Earnings Cap, Mr C Bell and Mr J P OReilly receive a 30% cash supplement.
Mr A S Ross is no longer accruing pension benefits or receiving any pension-related cash supplement as he has passed his nominal pension retirement date.
He is a member of the Executive Section of the LPP, and his LPP benefits will be increased between his 60th birthday and the date he starts to receive the benefits to reflect the delay in payment, using late retirement factors which apply to all members of the LPP.
Mr B G Wallace is not a member of the LPP and has received a cash supplement of 30% of base salary in lieu of membership of the LPP since he re-joined the Group on 5 March 2007.
The pension benefits he accrued during his previous employment with the Group were transferred to non-Group pension arrangements in 2006 and so are not included in these disclosures.
The transfer value figures below have been provided by the independent actuary appointed by the Trustees of the LPP, in accordance with previous Actuarial Guidance Note GN 11.
The accrued pension benefit is an annual figure.
The transfer value represents the amount that would be paid to another pension scheme if this accrued pension benefit were to be transferred away from the LPP.
Listing rules and Section 7A disclosures Set out below are details of the pension benefits, payable on retirement at age 60, or immediately in the case of Mr A S Ross, to which each of the directors shown is entitled at 31 December 2008.
Mr A S Ross received a tax-free retirement lump sum of 392,000 in 2006: the figures shown below relate to his residual pension after adjustment for this lump sum.
The other figures shown below, including the accrued pensions, are the total pension entitlements in respect of all Pensionable Service with the Company including any service with the Company prior to becoming a director.
For executive directors other than Mr A S Ross, the transfer value increase over the year includes the effect of each executive directors increase in Pensionable Salary, completing a further year of service and being a year closer to their nominal pension retirement date.
For all executive directors, the change in transfer value over the year also reflects changes in market conditions and a change in the LPPs standard transfer value terms.
A transfer value represents a liability of the LPP but not a sum paid or due to the individual.
Mr Ross no longer earns additional pensionable service, or pays any contributions to the Plan, as he is over Normal Retirement Age.
He opted to delay taking his pension rather than for this to start at age 60.
In this circumstance the Rules of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan increase his pension to allow for the fact that it will now be paid for less time.
These increases are set by the Trustees of the Plan not by Ladbrokes to be broadly financially neutral.
For 2008, these increases added 8,000 above inflation to Mr Ross pension.
This increase was larger than the 2007 increase as the Trustees updated the late retirement uplift factors to reflect changes in financial conditions.
As above, the listing rules place a value on this increase in pension, which was 137,000.
