Report on Directors Remuneration Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, the Regulations.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles and complied with the provisions of the 2006 Combined Code Combined Code on Corporate Governance relating to Directors remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, an advisory resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the AGM of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The auditors are required to report on the auditable part of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
The report is therefore divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Part 2 of the Regulations unaudited information Remuneration Committee The Directors who were members of the Remuneration Committee the Committee during the year are shown on pages 32 and 33.
The responsibility for the establishment of a remuneration policy and its cost is a matter for the full Board, on the advice of the Committee.
The recommendations of the Remuneration Committee have been approved without amendment by the Board for submission to shareholders.
The Committee is responsible for developing policy on remuneration for Executive Directors and senior management and for determining specific remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors.
The Committee members have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interests arising from cross directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
During the period under review, the Committee sought the assistance of the Chairman and Chief Executive on matters relating to Directors performance and remuneration.
The Chairman and Chief Executive attend meetings by invitation except when their individual remuneration arrangements are discussed.
No Director takes part in discussions relating to their own remuneration and benefits.
In 2008, the Committee continued to engage Halliwell Consulting and received wholly independent advice on executive compensation and associated share scheme administration.
No other services were provided to the Company by Halliwell Consulting during the year.
The Committee is formally constituted with written terms of reference.
The Committee met three times during 2008 with each Member attending all the meetings.
Background to the Remuneration Committees application of its policy In line with recent shareholder guidance, the Remuneration Committee has not only taken into account the remuneration of the Executives in light of its policy and the performance priorities set for annual bonus and share incentives but also the general performance of the Company in the current economic environment.
However, the Remuneration Committee strongly believes that where performance has been exceptional then the levels of remuneration should be exceptional.
This section of the report summarises the performance of the Company taken into account by the Remuneration Committee when determining Executive remuneration for 2008.
The macro environment, the business background and the principal risks facing the Company are described in detail in the Business Review on pages 7 and 8.
It is extremely pleasing to report that excellent progress has been made across all key areas of the Companys business during 2008.
Despite the extremely difficult global economic conditions now prevailing, which has resulted in an unprecedented and rapid deterioration of the oil price over recent months, Dana delivered record financial results for the full year.
44 Dana Petroleum plc Annual Report 2008 2008 saw the delivery of new record highs in oil and gas reserves, production, revenue and cash flow.
Dana has developed a strong and balanced asset base combining healthy cash reserves, a robust production portfolio delivering strong cash flow, a range of development opportunities and an extensive and exciting exploration programme.
2008 was the most active year of exploration in Danas history with 11 wells drilled during the year, including notable successes in the North Sea and the Nile Delta, and a further 4 wells being drilled at the year end.
These exploration successes have allowed the Group to replace reserves during 2008 by nearly 300%, resulting in a new high for year end proven plus probable reserves of 194.1 mmboe, up strongly from 165.8 mmboe at the end of 2007.
Group Production for the 2008 full year was approximately 39,400 boepd, a 29% year on year growth over 2007, and a second successive year of near 30% growth.
The Group also successfully delivered first oil production from the Grouse development, and sanctioned two further developments during the year, the E18 gas development in the Dutch sector and the Babbage gas development in the UK Southern North Sea.
These projects are expected to add to the production portfolio in 2009 and 2010 respectively.
Further progress has already been achieved early in 2009, with the recently announced acquisition of Bow Valley Energy Ltd, a Toronto Stock Exchange-listed upstream company, together with a successful refinancing with the Bank of Scotland which has secured a new three year US$400 million revolving credit facility.
This acquisition and the refinancing have been undertaken in the most trying of market conditions.
That they have been brought to fruition at this time, is testament to the skills and efforts of Danas talented team of industry professionals, at the centre of which continues to be Danas three-man Executive Director team.
Summary of remuneration philosophy The remuneration philosophy is designed to encourage, reward and retain these Executives based on the following principles: Shareholders interests are best served by remuneration packages which have a large emphasis on performance related pay: emphasis on performance will encourage the Executives to focus on delivering the business strategy: the structure of the package will ensure fair reward for performance such that exceptional remuneration will only be justified where performance is exceptional: and Executives will be encouraged to build substantial personal shareholdings in the Company to further align their interests with those of shareholders.
Remuneration policy 2008 & 2009 The Remuneration Committee applied its remuneration policy in 2008 taking into account the following factors: market conditions affecting the Company, and in particular the current macro economic situation: the recruitment market in the Companys sector: and changing market practice and best practice corporate governance.
The Remuneration Committee intends to undertake a review of the long-term incentive structure during 2009 to ensure that it supports the business strategy going forward in the rapidly changing economic landscape.
The review will also take into account recent pronouncements from the FSA and other regulatory bodies on the use of more risk-based performance metrics to measure long-term performance.
The Remuneration Committees policy during the year was to set the main elements of the remuneration package at the following quartiles in comparison to the Companys Comparator Group: 45 Dana Petroleum plc Annual Report 2008 Report on Directors Remuneration continued Remuneration policy 2008 & 2009 continued Base Salary Annual Bonus Potential Pension Potential Total Short-Term Potential Potential Total Remuneration Available Annual Share Compensation Awards Value Lower to Upper Quartile Upper Quartile Upper Quartile Median to Upper Quartile Upper quartile Median to Upper Quartile The Remuneration Committees Maximum bonus payouts The Company avoids The remuneration package The remuneration package will policy is on appointment to are only earned by considerable cost will provide lower to median provide a lower quartile to median the Board to provide a lower executives for achieving and administrative quartile total short-term total compensation value unless quartile salary which based on exceptional performance.

Throughout this report, references to quartiles are to quartiles in the CG.
It is the Committees current intention to use the same CG to benchmark the Companys Executive compensation in 2009 and as part of the CG for the total shareholder return TSR performance condition attached to awards under the Dana Petroleum plc 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan the LTIP.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee used the constituents of the FTSE 250 as a secondary CG to provide a wider market view on remuneration levels and trends.
The FTSE 250 constituents form the remaining part of the CG for the TSR performance condition attached to awards under the LTIP.
46 Dana Petroleum plc Annual Report 2008 Balance between fixed & variable performance based compensation The application of the Remuneration Committees policy summarised on pages 45 and 46 in relation to the balance between fixed and variable performance based compensation for each Executive Director is shown below for the year ended 31 December 2008: Fixed Compensation 26% 74% T P Cross Variable Compensation Fixed Compensation: 38% 62% D A MacFarlane Salary Benef ts Pension Contribution Variable Compensation: Bonus Payable S M Paton 38% 62% Fair Market Value of LTIP Elements of Executive Directors remuneration Policy 2008: lower quartile to upper quartile 2009 lower quartile to median The table below sets out the salaries for 2008: Name Note 2008 Salary Median 2008 Salary in Comparator Group T P Cross, Chief Executive Officer 1 687,000 699,000 D A MacFarlane, Finance Director 2 310,000 338,000 S M Paton, Technical & Commercial Director 3 290,000 316,000 Notes General The salary increases made by the Remuneration Committee in 2008 reflect a benchmarking exercise undertaken on behalf of the Remuneration Committee by their independent consultants.
The Remuneration Committee conducted the exercise during 2008 due to its concern that the Companys salary levels were becoming too low and uncompetitive compared to the Companys Comparator Group, particularly considering the outstanding achievements of the Executive team in recent years.
The Remuneration Committee is mindful of the need in the current economic climate to exercise prudence when increasing the fixed costs of the Company and therefore has changed its targeted salary policy for experienced Executive Directors from upper quartile to median for 2009.
1 The salary of the CEO reflects the Remuneration Committees view of the importance of this individual to the successful development of the Company and the intense competition for his services in the market.
It is the view of the Remuneration Committee that the Chief Executive is critical to delivering the Companys strategy over the next period given the challenging external environment.
This view has been reflected in the salary level set.
2 The salary of the FD reflects the competitive market in the Sector for FDs with the appropriate level of experience and the current incumbents increasing importance to the future of the Company.
It is the view of the Remuneration Committee that the Financial Director is a critical part of the team required to deliver the Companys strategy over the next period in close co-operation with the Chief Executive.
47 Dana Petroleum plc Annual Report 2008 Executive Director Report on Directors Remuneration continued Elements of Executive Directors remuneration Policy 2008: lower quartile to upper quartile 2009 lower quartile to median continued 3 The salary progression for the T&C Director reflects the Committees policy of bringing new members onto the Board at a comparative lower quartile level of salary and as experience is gained and, subject to development and performance, increasing to the median quartile levels of salary in the CG.
It is the view of the Remuneration Committee that the salary for the T&C Director is now starting to reflect the fact that he has developed into an effective and well performing member of the Executive team the T&C Director was appointed to the Board in May 2006.
When determining the salary of the executives the Committee takes into consideration: the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills, in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity, in particular the levels of base salary at those comparable companies within the FTSE Oil and Gas Producers sector and the CG: the performance of the individual Executive Director: the individual Executive Directors experience and responsibilities: and pay and conditions throughout the Company.
It should be noted that the current expected average UK rise in salaries for 2009 is 6.5%.
This continues to reflect the Groups reliance on a relatively small number of key staff and that, despite the external economic environment, there continues to be a shortage of experienced and skilled professionals in the oil and gas sector.
Annual bonus potential Policy 2008 & 2009: upper quartile Bonuses are typically assessed based on the level of the Companys performance against the following financial and operational priorities: Production Growth Reserves Replacement Execution of Planned Exploration Drilling Programme Delivery of Development Projects Delivery and Completion of New Commercial Transactions HS&E Performance Financial Performance The structure of any bonuses paid is as follows: an individual can elect for up to 100% of any bonus paid to be paid in shares which have to be retained for 24 months: subject to any bonus over 100% of salary must be paid in shares which have to be retained for 24 months: and in all cases 75% of the bonus earned will be paid in cash and 25% in shares which have to be retained for 24 months in determining the number of shares to be awarded the Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion to use the average share price over the relevant period.
The Companys annual bonus scheme caps the maximum bonus potential at 100% of salary for the Finance Director and the Technical and Commercial Director, with a cap of 150% in respect of the Chief Executive.
Bonus payments are not pensionable.
48 Dana Petroleum plc Annual Report 2008 The Remuneration Committee considered the levels of bonus earned in respect of 2008 in light of the following: the Companys long-term ROCE performance see section on LTIP below : the Companys comparative TSR performance see section on LTIP below : and the significant expansion and achievements of the business over the year.
Considering the above, the Remuneration Committee assessed that annual performance was exceptional and that maximum bonus payments were appropriate when judged by the achievements of the Executive team against the above priorities and when looking at a broader picture of the Companys performance over the period.
The general targets for the annual bonus plan are reviewed and agreed by the Remuneration Committee each year to ensure that they are appropriate to the current position of the Company.
The Committee is in no doubt that in the current economic environment, achieving substantial progress in these priority areas will be extremely challenging, given the added demands of cash management and strict financial discipline in a credit constrained world.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any bonus arrangements.
Potential annual share awards Policy 2008 & 2009: upper quartile The Remuneration Committees policy is to provide annual share grants to Executives at the upper quartile level compared to the CG.
Ongoing share incentives, excluding all employee plans, are provided to the Executive Directors solely through the LTIP.
The Remuneration Committee believes that share awards under the LTIP enable the Company to provide a competitive incentive and retention tool which is also cost effective in respect of both shareholder dilution and income statement expense.
Furthermore, the proposed grant of awards with the attached performance conditions ensure that the Companys comparative TSR performance against the CG is at least at the upper decile before Executives will receive the full benefit of their share incentives.
This structure demonstrates the Remuneration Committees desire to correlate incentive arrangements with the achievement of substantial performance.
The following table sets out the main terms of the LTIP and the grants that have been made to the Executive Directors during 2008: Feature CEO FD T&C Note Director Maximum Annual Grant 400% 200% 200% %age of Salary 2008 LTIP Grant: This LTIP grant was made on 9th October 2008 based on a market price - Face Value 2,748,000 620,000 580,000 of 9.32 per share and formed part - Face Value %age of Salary 400% 200% 200% of the 2008 Executive remuneration - Fair Market Value 1,558,000 351,000 329,000 package.

It should be noted that the real value received by the Executive Directors under the share incentive arrangements will be dependent upon the degree to which the associated performance conditions have been satisfied at the end of the three year performance period and the share price of the Company.
The following table sets out the level of release of LTIP awards if the Companys performance measured as at 31 December 2008 continued until the end of the relevant performance period.
49 Dana Petroleum plc Annual Report 2008 Report on Directors Remuneration continued Potential annual share awards continued LTIP Grant ROCE Condition Company TSR Ranking Against Percentage of Award Released CG if Performance Measured as at 31 December 2008 continued to the end of the relevant Performance Period 2006 LTIP Grant Satisfied 54 of 256 companies 74.65% 2007 LTIP Grant Satisfied 20 of 262 companies 100% 2008 LTIP Grant Satisfied 96 of 278 companies 52.0% The operation of the LTIP and the main terms and conditions are set out in the following table: Feature Terms & Conditions Maximum Global Limit p. a.
Global Limit under all elements of the LTIP is 400% of salary p. a.
Operation of the LTIP Maximum Level 1 Grant is 400% of salary less the Level 2 Grant proposed by the Remuneration Committee provided that to receive a Level 1 Grant an Executive must have purchased shares equivalent to 50% of the proposed award level i. e. for an Executive to qualify for a 200% of salary grant under Level 1 of the LTIP he would have to purchase shares equivalent to 100% of his net salary.
Maximum Level 2 Grant is 200% of salary.
Maximum Level 3 Grant is 100% of salary.
Level 3 grants may be made to senior managers within the Group and cannot be made to Executive Directors of the Company.
Performance Conditions Threshold Condition no part of the award will be capable of release unless the Companys average annual ROCE over the three year performance period is at or above 10% p. a.
Main Performance Condition once the Threshold Condition has been satisfied the release of the award will be subject to the Companys comparative TSR performance compared to the CG.
30% of the award will be released for median performance, 65% Level 3 100% for upper quartile performance with full release only for upper decile performance.
The CG for the purposes of the TSR performance condition consists of the constituents of the FTSE 250 and the members of the CG set out on page 46 and those used for benchmarking remuneration.
Basis of performance condition: selection & measurement ROCE was selected as one of the performance conditions for the awards by the Remuneration Committee because: ROCE measures the efficiency with which capital is employed by the management of the Company and therefore is much less vulnerable to peaks and troughs in revenue: ROCE helps to ensure the most effective allocation of capital investment within the business: and ROCE also helps to ensure that any investments by the Company are effectively incorporated and deliver the required level of return on the capital used to make them.
This will provide assurance that the Companys investment strategy will be value driven rather than earnings driven.
Comparative TSR was selected as one of the performance conditions for the awards by the Remuneration Committee as it ensures that the Executives have delivered competitive returns with respect to their peers over the measurement period before being entitled to receive any of their awards irrespective of general market conditions.
50 Dana Petroleum plc Annual Report 2008 The Remuneration Committee determines whether the performance conditions for share awards are satisfied.
Where the performance requirements are based on ROCE, the Committee will use the principles behind the audited figures disclosed in the Companys financial statements, and may take advice from independent advisors as to whether any adjustments are required to ensure consistency in accordance with the terms of the performance conditions.
Where the performance measure is TSR, Halliwell Consulting, the Remuneration Committees advisors, shall calculate the TSR in accordance with the rules of the LTIP and confirm these figures prior to the release of any award.
As stated above, the Remuneration Committee will undertake a review of long term incentives during 2009 to ensure that the structure supports the Companys business strategy going forward, while reflecting the wider economic environment and regulatory framework.
Dilution In accordance with the Association of British Insurers ABI guidelines, the Company can issue a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital in a rolling ten year period to employees under all its share plans.
In addition, of this 10% the Company can only issue 5% to satisfy awards under discretionary or Executive plans.
The Company operates all its share plans within these guidelines.
Benefits in kind Policy 2008 & 2009 The Company provides a cash benefits allowance in lieu of normal benefits in kind for Executives of this level in a company of this size and complexity company car in addition to life assurance cover, private health care and permanent health insurance.
This cash benefit allowance is excluded from the calculation of any other benefit provided by the Company.
Pension Policy 2008 & 2009: upper quartile The Company does not operate a pension scheme for Executive Directors but does, at the Directors option, contribute to the personal pension plans of each Executive Director, or pays cash in lieu of such contributions up to 20% of salary.
Directors contributions are paid in advance of the pension year which starts in April each year.
