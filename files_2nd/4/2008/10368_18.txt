DiRectoRs ReMUNeRAtioN RepoRt Dear Shareholder As chairman of the Remuneration committee, i am pleased to present the Directors Remuneration report for Misys plc.
As our results for the year ended 2007 08 indicate, the company is on track to deliver the improved performance set out in its turnaround strategy.
to achieve this performance and to help secure the continuing improvements that will be necessary to make the turnaround a success, we have attracted new talent to key leadership and management roles.
Many of these recruits are Us executives and professionals, which is not surprising given that over 50% of our revenue comes from the Americas and some of the best talent in our sector is found in this market.
in line with this change the Remuneration committee has undertaken a comprehensive review of executive remuneration policy which has brought about some key changes to our overall remuneration strategy so as to ensure that we continue to attract and retain the best people in our changing business environment.
the committee is mindful that we wish to retain the overall reward package at existing levels which are already competitive for our market, but that changes to the breakdown of this package are necessary to drive results.
to achieve this, a greater emphasis will be put on at risk remuneration such as performance-related bonuses as opposed to base salary.
We are also reshaping share incentive arrangements to reward delivery in the short, medium and long term in line with our turnaround.
For more detailed information on these changes, please see the Remuneration principles section of the Remuneration report.
As the most significant changes to remuneration policy for executive Directors relate to share incentives, it is worth providing a brief history of what was done in the previous financial year and what is proposed going forward.
the transformation incentive plan, which was approved at the extraordinary General Meeting in March 2007, was designed as a one-off incentive plan and no further awards can be made under this plan after January 2009.
Additionally, as mentioned in the committees report last year, the option scheme and the Ltip expire this year.
in addition to being asked to approve the Remuneration report at the Annual General Meeting AGM, shareholders will also be asked to approve the introduction of the following new share plans: A new omnibus plan which will allow for the following types of awards to be made: performance shares awards to acquire shares for no cost: share options traditional market value share options: Matching shares an award of shares at no cost linked to the award of deferred shares under the companys annual bonus plan, the Misys senior executive Bonus plan MseBp : A new share incentive plan for UK employees, plus similar arrangements for employees in other countries.
Details of these proposals are included in the shareholders circular for the AGM on 30 september 2008. i hope that you will support these resolutions.
