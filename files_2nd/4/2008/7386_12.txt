2008 Comparator Group The constituents of the Companys Comparator Group CG for benchmarking remuneration during 2008 were as follows: Name Name Name Acambis Plc Barr Pharmaceuticals Inc Protherics Plc Alizyme Plc Forest Laboratories Inc Shire Pharmaceuticals PLC Allergan Inc King Pharmaceuticals Inc SkyePharma Plc Alpharma Inc Mylan Laboratories Inc Vernalis PLC AstraZeneca PLC Oxford Biomedica Plc Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc Axis-Shield Plc Factors the Remuneration Committee took into account when selecting the Comparator Group included: the industry within which the Company operates, specically taking into account both the international nature of the Companys business and its competitors: the international nature of the Companys current executive team and potential recruits to that team: the market capitalisation, turnover and number of employees of the Company: and the UK listing environment of the Company.
Throughout this report, references to quartiles are to quartiles in the Comparator Group.
Neutec Pharma Plc and CAT Group PLC were removed from the 2008 Comparator Group due to their acquisition during 2007.
Towards the end of 2008, Barr Pharmaceuticals Inc, Acambis Plc, Protherics Plc and Alpharma Inc were also acquired by other companies.
Therefore, the Remuneration Committee will take the opportunity in 2009 to review the constituents of the whole Comparator Group to ensure a Comparator Group which is appropriate for 2009 and on an ongoing basis.
It is currently anticipated that the core of the 2009 Comparator Group will be based on those companies remaining from the 2008 Comparator Group.
The new 2009 Comparator Group will be used as the total shareholder return performance condition comparator group for awards granted in 2009 under the Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The Company has historically used the same comparators for both benchmarking remuneration and the performance condition for awards granted during the relevant year.
The Remuneration Committee will also consider whether to introduce a control benchmarking group based on the FTSE 250 due to the international nature of the 2008 Comparator Group and its likely successor.
qxp 27 3 09 22:45 Page 83 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC 83 Annual report 2008 Ongoing review The Remuneration Committee continues to review the remuneration policy on an annual basis to ensure it remains appropriate for the financial year under review.
Factors taken into account by the Remuneration Committee include: market conditions affecting the Company: the recruitment market in the Companys sector: changing market practice: changing views of institutional shareholders and their representative bodies: and the current economic climate.
It is the current intention of the Remuneration Committee to apply the 2008 policy in 2009.
2008 balance between xed and variable performance-based compensation The chart below demonstrates the balance between the potential xed and variable performance-based compensation for each Executive Director for the year ended 31 December 2008.
Fixed compensation Variable performance is calculated as: compensation is calculated as: Maximum bonus available Salary Fair market value Benets of maximum Pension contribution potential LTIP award Said Darwazah 38% 62% Mazen Darwazah 41% 59% Elements of Executive Directors remuneration Base salary Policy 2008 and 2009 Lower quartile to median The Companys remuneration policy is to set the levels of base salary for the Executive Directors below the median to support a performance-based culture.
When determining the base salary of the Executives the Committee takes into consideration: the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity, in particular the lower quartile and median salary levels of those comparable companies within the pharmaceuticals industry and the Comparator Group: the performance of the individual Executive Director: the individual Executive Directors experience and responsibilities: and pay and conditions throughout the Company.
The following tables summarises the base salary of Executive Directors: Median rise in Comparator Name 2008 salary 2009 salary Rise Group Said Darwazah $630,000 $630,000 0% 8.8% Median $886,000 Lower quartile $574,000 Mazen Darwazah $420,000 $420,000 0% 5.0% Median $458,000 Lower quartile $345,000 After reviewing the above criteria, the Committee has elected not to increase Executive Directors salaries for 2009.
It remains the Committees ongoing policy that, save in exceptional circumstances, only modest rises in base salary should be required.

The following tables summarise the main features of the Companys executive bonus plan.

It is possible for exceptional performance to earn up to a total maximum bonus of 200% of salary.
The maximum bonus potentials for 2009 will remain the same as those applied for 2008.
The bonuses for 2008 have been paid on the basis of the level of the satisfaction of the performance targets.
The table below shows the principal performance targets used for 2008 and their percentage satisfaction.
Percentage of maximum Percentage bonus potential satisfaction Percentage of subject to target of bonus target salary payable Said Darwazah profit after tax 50% 30% 15% Operational milestones 30% 66% 20% Personal business targets 20% 80% 16% Total 51% Mazen Darwazah profit after tax 50% 30% 15% Operational milestones 30% 100% 30% Personal business targets 20% 100% 20% Total 65% The targets for the annual bonus plan are reviewed and agreed by the Remuneration Committee each year to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and position of the Company in order to ensure that they continue to remain challenging.
Underlying performance targets for Executive Directors bonuses were reviewed during 2008 as a part of an overall review of key performance indicators within the Group to ensure that they remained in line with the Groups overall business strategy in 2009.
It is the opinion of the Committee that the overall nature of the conditions remains appropriate for the requirements of the Group in 2009.
Share incentives Policy 2008 and 2009 upper quartile The Remuneration Committees policy is to provide annual share grants to senior executives at a maximum of the upper quartile level compared to the Comparator Group.
Ongoing share incentives are provided to the Executive Directors solely through the LTIP.
The Remuneration Committee believes that share awards under the LTIP enable the Company to provide a competitive incentive and retention tool which is also cost effective in respect of both shareholder dilution and income statement expense.
Furthermore, the proposed grant of awards with the attached 1 performance condition ensures that the Companys comparative Total Shareholder Return TSR performance against the Comparator Group is at least at the upper quartile before executives will receive the full benefit of their share incentives.
This structure demonstrates the Remuneration Committees desire to correlate incentive arrangements with the achievement of substantial performance.
The Remuneration Committee granted the following awards to Executive Directors during 2008.
UQ in CG Percentage percentage Name of salary of salary Said Darwazah 131.68% 223% Mazen Darwazah 118.52% 150% 1 Total Shareholder Return TSR is a measure showing the return on investing in one share of the Company over the performance period the return is the value of the capital gain and reinvested dividends.
It is normally used comparatively and the Company which achieves the best return is ranked number one.
qxp 27 3 09 22:45 Page 85 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC 85 Annual report 2008 The Remuneration Committee granted lower levels of LTIP awards to Executive Directors than indicated in its 2007 report, due to a wider population being granted awards than was originally envisaged and the Company wishing to manage the overall cost of the programme.
This resulted in a scaling down of awards including those made to Executive Directors.
In 2009 the Company will introduce a new Management Incentive Plan detailed later in this report, and will therefore consider LTIP award levels in 2009 in conjunction with the introduction of this new plan, and the consequently smaller population of participants in the LTIP.
The following table summarises the main features of the LTIP in 2008 and its proposed operation during 2009.
2 Maximum annual grant face value as percentage of salary and performance condition Maximum annual grant 300% current normal operating maximum set by the Remuneration Committee 200% The Awards will be subject to comparative TSR performance against the Comparator Group.
20% of Awards will be released for median performance with full release occurring for upper quartile comparative performance.
The Remuneration Committee will also ensure that the underlying financial performance of the Company is consistent with its TSR performance.
When considering this underlying financial performance the factors taken into account by the Remuneration Committee will include profit after tax, revenue growth and the achievement of operational milestones.
Said Darwazah Mazen Darwazah Maximum grants for 2009 face value as a percentage of salary 200% 200% 2 Face Value for awards under the LTIP face value is the aggregate market value of the shares subject to the award at the date of grant.
It should be noted that the real value received by the Executive Directors under the share incentive arrangements will be dependent upon the degree to which the performance conditions are satisfied at the end of the three year performance period and the share price of the Company at this time.
Basis of performance condition selection and measurements Comparative TSR was selected as the performance condition for the proposed awards by the Remuneration Committee as it ensures that the executives have outperformed their peers over the measurement period in delivering shareholder value before being entitled to receive any of their awards irrespective of general market conditions.
The Remuneration Committee will provide a full explanation and justication at the time of the release of the award and why it believes that the underlying financial performance of the Company is consistent with this TSR performance.
The Remuneration Committee determines whether the performance conditions for share awards are satisfied.
The Committee has appointed  LLP to assist in the ongoing calculation of TSR in accordance with the rules of the LTIP.
The Committee will approve these gures prior to the release of any award.
Dilution In accordance with the guidelines set out by the Association of British Insurers ABI the Company can issue a maximum of 10% of its issued share capital in a rolling ten year period to employees under all its share plans.
Under the LTIP rules, grants of no more than 3% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company may be awarded in the first three years following the Companys IPO, undertaken in 2005.
The following table summarises the current level of dilution resulting from Company share plans following the IPO: Share awards as a percentage Share awards as a percentage of issued share capital as at of issued share capital as at 1 December 2008 in a rolling 31 December 2008 granted Type of plan ten year period during the year All Employee Share Plans 0% 0% Discretionary Share Plans 1.375% 0.965% The Company has not implemented any all employee share incentive arrangements.
It is the Companys current intention that the awards granted in 2009 will be satisfied by newly issued shares.
No awards will be issued to satisfy awards under the MIP a summary of which is set out below without prior shareholder approval.
Post employment benets Policy 2008 and 2009 Lower quartile to median The Executive Directors participate in the Hikma Pharmaceuticals Dened Contribution Retirement benefit Plan the benefit Plan in accordance with the Rules of the benefit Plan relevant to employees of the Group based in Jordan.
Under the benefit Plan the Group matches employee contributions made to the benefit Plan.
These are xed at 5% of applicable salary.
Participants are entitled to 30% of the Groups contributions to the benefit Plan after three years of employment with the Group, and an additional 10% in each subsequent year.
The participants interest in the Groups contribution fully vests after ten years of employment.

The Committee, however, wholeheartedly supports the alignment of interests created by a minimum level of executive shareholding and should the make-up of the Board change would consider the introduction of a formal shareholding requirement.
All employee share arrangements During 2008, the Company reviewed the overall structure of management and employee share-based incentives, including the potential benets of operating an All Employee Share plan.
The Remuneration Committee assessed the potential cost of implementation of an all employee plan against its anticipated take-up by employees within the Group.
Following this review, the Remuneration Committee resolved that, given the geographical diversity of the Groups employees, the costs of implementation would not be justied by the potential benets that could derive from such a plan.
Consequently, implementation will be placed on hold, though the matter will be kept under ongoing review.
As part of the review of management and employee incentive structure, the Remuneration Committee resolved to implement a targeted programme to reward the management who are the key value drivers in the business.
Details of this plan are set out below.
Management Incentive Plan MIP Under the MIP, the Company will make grants of nil cost option awards to executive management across the Group based on the satisfaction of annual performance targets.
The key features of the MIP are as follows: the MIP is open to management level employees across the Group below senior executive level: participation in the LTIP will preclude participation in the MIP: participants will be notied of a maximum monetary entitlement, the maximum award level is currently anticipated to be 50% of salary p. a. the value of which will be awarded to participants in the form of nil cost options over shares, based on annual performance against individual and Group KPIs: nil cost options will vest two years after the date of award being approximately three years after the commencement of the financial year to which the award relates, subject to the participant remaining in employment with the Group during this period.
Once the options have been awarded, the continued employment requirement is the only condition for vesting: awards are expected to be satisfied out of shares held for the purpose in the Groups Employment benefit Trust.
no shares will be issued by the Company to satisfy awards without prior shareholder approval in general meeting.
qxp 27 3 09 22:46 Page 87 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC 87 Annual report 2008 Executive Directors contracts Details of the service contracts of the Executive Directors of the Company in force at the end of the year under review are as follows: Name Company notice period Contract date Unexpired term of contract Potential termination payment Said Darwazah 12 months 1 July 2007 Rolling contract 12 months salary and benets Mazen Darwazah 12 months 25 May 2006 Rolling contract 12 months salary and benets The Executive Directors contracts are on a rolling basis, unless terminated by at least 12 months written notice.
This arrangement is in line with best corporate practice for listed companies.
In the event of the termination of an executives contract, salary and benets will be payable during the notice period there will, however, be no automatic entitlement to bonus payments or share incentive grants during the period of notice other than in accordance with the rules of the relevant incentive plan.
The Remuneration Committee will ensure that there have been no unjustified payments for failure on an Executive Directors termination of employment.
There are no special provisions in the contracts of employment extending notice periods on a change of control, liquidation of the Company or cessation of employment.
Mazen Darwazah, who has an executive service contract with the Company as detailed above, will be proposed for re-election at the next Annual General Meeting of the Company, to be held on 14 May 2009.
External appointments The Committee recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to take up non-executive directorships or public sector appointments, and that these can broaden the experience and knowledge of the Director, from which the Company can benefit.
Executive Directors may therefore accept non-executive appointments as long as they do not lead to a conict of interest, and are allowed to retain any fees paid under such appointments.
During the year under review, Said Darwazah and Mazen Darwazah received fees of US$11,850 and US$26,100 respectively, in respect of such appointments.
Non-Executive Directors fees Policy 2008 Upper quartile The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined by the Board based upon recommendations from the Chief Executive officer and Executive Vice Chairman and is within the limits set by the Articles of Association.
The nature of the Companys business is international, requiring the Non-Executive Directors to travel to the USA, Middle East and Europe.
The Board is therefore made up of Non-Executive Directors with a wide range of experience both in the UK and internationally.
The use of options for Non-Executive Directors is very prevalent in the US and also to some extent internationally.
However, as a UK listed company complying with UK best practice it is not considered appropriate to grant options to the Companys Non-Executive Directors.
To ensure that the Company remains able to attract the appropriate calibre of candidate and to take account of its inability to grant options, the Board has therefore set its fee policy at the upper quartile.
The individual basic and committee fees, which are paid in Sterling, are as follows: 2008 2009 Upper quartile Total fee Basic fee Committee fee Total fee fees in CG Name 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Samih Darwazah 150 157.5 157.5 169 Michael Ashton 64 60 7.5 67.5 90 Ali Al-Husry 57 60 60 69 Breffni Byrne 71 60 15 75 90 Ronald Goode 57 60 60 80 Sir David Rowe-Ham 64 60 7.5 67.5 90 12751 p66 p98.
qxp 2 4 09 09:23 Page 88 88 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Governance Annual report 2008 Remuneration Committee report continued A review of the level of Non-Executive Director fees was conducted during 2008.
As no review was undertaken in 2007, in 2008 NED fees fell below the benchmark set by the Group remuneration policy.
The Board therefore commissioned Halliwell Consulting to conduct a study of non-executive remuneration against the Comparator Group, which showed that, in relation to the overall NED fee policy set by the Group, Hikmas NED fees were signicantly out of step with those of its peers.
The Board has therefore resolved that from 1 January 2009, the fees of Non-Executive Directors should be increased.
Given the current economic climate, it was resolved to grant Non-Executive Directors fees for 2009 in the amounts set out above, which represent an approximately 5% increase in the annual fees for all Non-Executive Directors.
The increases move non-executive fees back towards the Groups stated policy, though overall non-executive fees remain below the level set by Group policy.
The Board continues to believe that it is important to ensure that the fees paid to non-executives remain competitive, that they reect the increasingly important role played by non-executives and allow the Nomination Committee to recruit Non-Executive Directors of the appropriate calibre in accordance with the requirements of succession planning.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any bonus plan or share incentive programme operated by the Company and are not entitled to pension contributions or other benets provided by the Company.
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts, but have letters of appointment with the Company.
Each appointment is terminable on one months notice from either the Company or the Director, but is envisaged to be for an initial period of up to 36 months, subject to the terms of the Companys Articles of Association, the Companies Act and shareholder approval.

The Comparator Group has been selected as it is the group of companies whose performance the Company is compared to in determining the release of awards under the LTIP.
The FTSE 250 Index has been selected to provide a broader comparator of the Companys performance and is the main Index in which the Companys shares are included.
