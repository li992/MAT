This has included a full review of plan design, performance measures, market practice and emerging trends in long term incentive arrangements, and has taken into account the published guidelines of institutional shareholder bodies.
The committees appointed remuneration adviser, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has supported the review.
Lord Hollick of Notting Hill As part of the review, the committee has considered its remuneration Senior non-executive director and chairman of the philosophy and policy and has concluded that they continue to remain remuneration committee appropriate to deliver Diageos strategy within a framework of good corporate governance for 2008 onwards.
The key principles of the policy, which are interdependent, are: Our senior executive remuneration arrangements are intended to attract and retain the best global talent.
We believe that pay should vary significantly with performance over both the short and long term.
Our base salaries are generally set around the median of the relevant market for each role.
In exceptional circumstances, base salaries may be positioned above the median if justified by the requirement to recruit or retain key executives.
Such positioning of base salaries ensures market competitiveness.
Annual bonuses are paid in cash after the end of each financial year and are determined by performance in the year against pre-set stretching business targets.
Our long term incentives comprise a combination of share option grants and share awards in each year and vary with three-year EPS and TSR performance respectively.
Our senior executives are required to hold shares in Diageo to participate fully in our share option and share award plans.

77 212833 DIAGEO REPORT P72-95 5 9 08 10:19 Page 78 DIAGEO | ANNUAL REPORT 2008 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED REVIEW OF EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION During the year, the committee undertook a comprehensive review of remuneration arrangements as the existing SESOP is due to expire in October 2009 and the TSR plan expired in August 2008.
As a result of the review, the company will be submitting two resolutions for shareholder approval for two long term incentive plans to replace the existing SESOP and TSR plan at the companys October 2008 AGM.
The proposed new plans are, in many respects, very similar to the existing arrangements.
The committee also reaffirmed that EPS and TSR remain the most appropriate measures of Diageos performance on the basis that they are the best combination of measures for driving optimum business performance that is aligned to shareholder interests.
Targets, under both arrangements, will continue to provide a challenging level of performance expectation.
Key features of the plans are detailed below and summarised in the policy table.
PROPOSED SENIOR EXECUTIVE SHARE OPTION PLAN 2008 SESOP The proposed SESOP will operate in a similar way to the existing plan with some key changes as follows: The primary performance condition will be based on compound annual growth in adjusted EPS over a three-year period, with growth targets set by the companys remuneration committee for each grant.
Options will only vest when stretching EPS targets are achieved.
Vesting is on a pro rata basis ranging from a threshold level of 30% to a maximum level of 100%.
The initial EPS growth targets for the options to vest in full is 10% per annum compound which is equivalent to 33% growth over a three-year period.
The threshold when options start to vest is when EPS grows by an average of 6% compound per annum, equivalent to 19% over a three-year period.
The maximum annual grant under the plan will remain at 375% of salary and the remuneration committee will retain the discretion to grant awards in excess of the maximum limit in exceptional circumstances.
It is anticipated that the first grant of options under the proposed new SESOP will be made to executive directors following the AGM in October 2008.
PROPOSED PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN 2008 PSP The proposed PSP will mirror the existing TSR plan to a significant degree, with the following key changes: The primary performance condition will remain as relative TSR measured over a three-year period with a reduction in the peer group from 17 to 16 other companies reflecting the product and geographic mix of the companys business.
The existing vesting schedule will be simplified, by integrating the multiplier of 150%, so that the maximum vesting is 100% of award for position 1 or 2 and 25% of award for median performance as shown in the table below.
Awards will be adjusted to reflect this change so that broadly the same payout, as a percentage of salary, is achieved under the new vesting schedule as for the current schedule.
The maximum annual award under the plan will remain at 375% of salary, but the remuneration committee will retain the discretion to grant awards in excess of the maximum limit in exceptional circumstances.
Notional dividends will accrue on awards and will be paid out in cash or shares and in accordance with the vesting schedule.
The following table shows the proposed vesting schedule under the PSP and the percentage of the award that will normally be released at the end of the performance cycle: Ranking in peer group 1-2 3456789 10 % of award released 100 95 75 65 55 50 40 25 nil It is anticipated that the first award of performance shares under the proposed new PSP will be made to executive directors following the AGM in October 2008.
REVISED SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES As part of the review of remuneration, the committee reviewed the share ownership guidelines and increased these to further strengthen the alignment between the interests of executive directors and those of shareholders.
From 1 January 2009, the existing share ownership guidelines will be increased to 300% of base salary for the chief executive and 250% for the chief financial officer and are at the upper quartile of Diageos comparator group.

The committee believes it is appropriate to position total remuneration between the median and upper quartile of this group, given the size and complexity of Diageos business globally.
79 212833 DIAGEO REPORT P72-95 5 9 08 10:19 Page 80 DIAGEO | ANNUAL REPORT 2008 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED FIXED AND VARIABLE REMUNERATION The balance between fixed and variable elements of remuneration changes with performance.
The anticipated normal mix between fixed and variable remuneration for executive directors is that for 100 of remuneration earned, 32 will be fixed remuneration and 68 will be performance-related remuneration, excluding pensions and other benefits.
This mix is illustrated in the pie chart below.
In some years, the performance-related remuneration may be higher or lower depending on the performance of the business.
Executive directors remuneration mix 32% 32% 36% Fixed base salary Variable short term Variable long term The board of directors continues to set stretching performance targets for the business and its leaders.
To achieve these stretching targets requires exceptional business management and strategic execution to deliver performance.
This approach to target setting reflects the aspirational performance environment that Diageo wishes to create.
The annual incentive plan aims to reward the delivery of short term performance goals with commensurate levels of remuneration.
Long term incentive plans aim to reward long term sustained performance.
Under both sets of plans, if the demanding targets are achieved, high levels of reward may be earned.
All incentives are capped to ensure that inappropriate business risk taking is neither encouraged nor rewarded.
Base salary The summary table on the previous page sets out the policy on base salary for the executive directors.
Base salaries are generally set around the median of the relevant market for each role and take account of level of experience, performance and the external market.
The committee also has regard to pay conditions throughout the company when deciding annual salary increases for executive directors.
As at 30 June 2008 the annual salaries payable to the chief executive and the chief financial officer were 1,100,000 and 635,000 respectively.
In the financial year ended 30 June 2008 the percentage increase in base salary of the chief executive and chief financial officer were 4.8% and 5.0% respectively.
Annual performance bonus The annual bonus plan is designed to incentivise year on year delivery of short term performance goals that are determined by pre-set stretching targets and measures agreed by the remuneration committee with reference to the annual operating plan.
The committee determines the level of performance achieved based on Diageo's overall financial performance at the financial year end.
The business results for the year ended 30 June 2008 are described in the Business review.
The targets for the last financial year were a combination of measures including profit before exceptional items and tax, net sales and free cash flow.
The level of performance achieved resulted in an actual performance bonus paid equating to 108% of base salary.
The actual bonus payments received by the executive directors are shown in the table 'Directors' remuneration for the year ended 30 June 2008'.
LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLANS LTIPs Current long term incentives comprise a combination of share options under the SESOP and performance share awards under the TSR plan.
These awards are made on an annual basis with the level of award considered each year in light of individual and business performance.
Awards made under both sets of plans are subject to performance conditions normally measured over a three-year period.
The regular review of the performance measures and the vesting schedule used in each plan has ensured that the LTIPs continue to support the business objectives and are in line with current best practice.
Subject to the adoption of the new share option plan and performance share plan by shareholders at the AGM in October 2008, no further awards will be made under the long term incentive plans described below.
Senior executive share option plan 1999 SESOP Options granted under the SESOP cannot normally be exercised unless a performance condition is satisfied.
The current performance condition is based on the increase in Diageos adjusted EPS over a three-year period excluding the effect of movements in exchange rates.
If the increase in this EPS measure is at least 15 percentage points greater than the increase in the RPI over the same period, then all the options can be exercised.
If the increase in this EPS measure is at least 12 percentage points greater than that of the RPI but less than 15 percentage points, half of the options can be exercised.
Re-testing of the performance condition is not permitted on any options.

All conditional rights awarded vest after a three-year period subject to achievement of two performance tests.
The primary performance test is a comparison of Diageos three-year TSR the percentage growth in Diageos share price assuming all dividends and capital distributions are reinvested with the TSR of a peer group of international drinks and FMCG companies.
TSR calculations are converted to a common currency US dollars.
The second performance test requires that there has been an underlying improvement in Diageos three-year financial performance, typically measured by an adjusted EPS measure, for the committee to recommend the release of awards.
Performance cycles from 1 January 2005 Anheuser-Busch Groupe Danone Pernod Ricard Brown-Forman Heineken Procter & Gamble Cadbury plc Heinz SABMiller 1 Carlsberg Inbev Scottish & Newcastle Coca-Cola Nestl Unilever Colgate-Palmolive PepsiCo 1 The peer group for the TSR plan was reviewed during the year due to the takeover of Scottish & Newcastle.
As a result the committee carefully considered a number of alternatives and deemed neither LOreal the existing reserve company for all cycles nor any alternative to be comparable and concluded that three-year TSR performance for all outstanding awards July 2005 onwards would be measured on the basis of a reduced peer group of 16 companies.
This decision ensured that the peer group against which relative TSR performance is measured accurately reflects the product and geographic mix of Diageos business.
The following table shows the percentage of the award that will normally be released at the end of the performance cycle: January 2005 June 2008 Ranking in peer group 1-2 3456789 10 % of award released 150 142 114 94 83 72 61 35 nil For awards made before July 2005 the performance cycles began on 1 January each year.
For awards made after July 2005 the performance cycle begins on 1 July each year.
TSR plan performance The chart below illustrates Diageos historical ranking against the peer group for each performance cycle since the plan was approved by shareholders in 1998.
For performance below the median position 10 no shares are released at the end of the performance cycle.
Historic TSR performance 0 4 3 5 7 7 6 8 8 8 9 9 9 Median 12 15 18 1998 TSR 1999 TSR 2000 TSR 2001 TSR 2002 TSR 2003 TSR 2004 TSR Feb 2005 Sept 2005 award award award award award award award TSR award TSR award Notes The timing of awards under the TSR plan was aligned with the financial year in 2004.
To effect this transition, awards granted on 18 February 2005 were a one-off half size award with a performance cycle that began on 1 January 2005.
Long term incentive plans and change of control In the event of a change of control and at the remuneration committees discretion, outstanding TSR plan awards would be released and outstanding share options would become exercisable, based on the extent to which the relevant performance conditions had been met since the initial award or grant respectively.
81 Ranking in peer group 212833 DIAGEO REPORT P72-95 5 9 08 10:19 Page 82 DIAGEO | ANNUAL REPORT 2008 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED SHARE OWNERSHIP Senior executives are currently required to hold shares in Diageo to participate fully in the share option and share award plans.
This policy extends to the top 80 senior executives and reflects Diageos belief that its most senior leaders should also be shareholders.
Individuals have three years to build up their shareholding from their own resources.
On 1 January 2008 the executive directors met the requirement by each holding company shares equivalent to at least 225% of their base salary.
Shareholding guidelines for executive directors will be increased and, from 1 January 2009, the chief executive and chief financial officer will be required to hold company shares equivalent to 300% and 250% of their base salary respectively.
Eligibility for share plan participation The senior executives are eligible to participate in the broad-based share and option plans Diageo operates for its employees.
These are the tax approved share incentive plan and savings-related share option scheme in the United Kingdom.
PENSION PROVISION Scheme details NC Rose and PS Walsh are members of the Diageo Pension Scheme.
They currently accrue pension rights at the rate of one-thirtieth of base salary each year.
Bonus payments and other benefits are not included in pensionable pay.
The pension at normal retirement age NRA will not be less than two-thirds of base pay in the 12 months prior to retirement less any pension benefits accrued elsewhere.
Subject to the consent of the company, no actuarial reduction is currently applied upon early retirement on or after age 57.
Pensions in payment are increased each year in line with increases in the RPI subject to a maximum of 5% per year, and a minimum of 3% per year.
On death in service, a lump sum of four times pensionable salary would become payable, together with a spouses pension of two-thirds of the executive directors prospective pension.
Upon death after retirement, a spouses pension of two-thirds of the executive directors pension before commutation is payable.
Employee contributions equal to 2% of base pay were introduced on 1 April 2006, increasing at 2% a year up to 6% of base pay by 1 April 2008.
As a result of changes introduced by the Finance Act 2004 affecting the taxation of pensions from 6 April 2006, executive directors were offered the option of having benefits in excess of their personal lifetime allowance LTA provided by an unfunded non-registered arrangement.
Both executive directors have opted to have part of their benefits provided from this unfunded arrangement.
Total pension benefits remain subject to the HM Revenue and Customs limits that were in force on 5 April 2006.
SERVICE CONTRACTS The executive directors have rolling service contracts which provide for six months notice by the director or 12 months notice by the company and contain non-compete obligations.
In the event of early termination by the company without cause, the agreements provide for a termination payment to be paid, equivalent to 12 months base salary for the notice period and an equal amount in respect of all benefits.
The remuneration committee may exercise its discretion to require half of the termination payment to be paid in monthly instalments and, upon the executive commencing new employment, to be subject to mitigation.
If the board determines that the executive has failed to perform his duties competently, the remuneration committee may exercise its discretion to reduce the termination payment on the grounds of poor performance.
PS Walshs service contract with the company is dated 1 November 2005.
NC Roses service contract with the company is dated 14 February 2006.
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS With the specific approval of the board in each case, executive directors may accept external appointments as non-executive directors of other companies and retain any related fees paid to them.
During the year ended 30 June 2008, PS Walsh served as a non-executive director of Centrica plc and of FedEx Corporation and retained the fees paid to him for his services.
The total amounts of such fees paid to him in the year ended 30 June 2008 were 60,000 and $97,000 respectively.
In line with the FedEx Corporation policy for outside directors, PS Walsh is eligible to be granted share options.
During the year ended 30 June 2008, he was granted 4,400 options at an option price of $103.35.
PS Walsh did not exercise any FedEx options in the year ended 30 June 2008.
CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS POLICY, TERMS, CONDITIONS AND FEES Diageos policy on chairmans and non-executive director fees is as follows: The fees should be sufficient to attract, motivate and retain world-class talent.
Fee practice should be consistent with recognised best practice standards for such positions.
The chairman and non-executive directors should not participate in any of the companys incentive plans.
Part of the chairmans fees should be paid in Diageo shares.
Fees for non-executive directors should be within the limits set by the shareholders from time to time.
The former chairman, Lord Blyth, had a letter of appointment for an initial five-year term from 1 July 2000 that was extended by the board to 30 June 2008.
Lord Blyth has now stepped down as chairman and his successor, Dr Humer, commenced his appointment as chairman of the board on 1 July 2008.
Dr Humer has a letter of appointment for an initial five-year term from 1 July 2008.
It is terminable on six months notice by either party or, if terminated by the company, by payment of six months fees in lieu of notice.
The annual fee payable to Dr Humer is 400,000: of this, a proportion will be used for the monthly purchase of Diageo ordinary shares.

Exercisable options are those that have vested and can be exercised in the option period:not exercisable are those options where the minimum holding period has not been completed or the performance conditions have not yet been met.
The option period starts from the earliest month in which the options may be exercised and ends with the month in which the options lapse.
The growth in Diageos EPS over the three years ended 30 June 2008 exceeded the performance condition RPI plus 15 percentage points and these options will become exercisable in full in September 2008.
The effect of movements in exchange rates is excluded from the comparison of the group's EPS performance against the RPI under the SESOP for all current and future grants.

Details of executive share options are shown separately below.
Of this number of shares initially awarded, 35% would be released for achieving position nine in the peer group.
No shares would be released for achievement of position 10 or below.
b This number reflects the maximum number of shares which could be awarded, being 150% of the number of shares initially awarded: the entire amount of these shares would only be released for achieving position one or two in the peer group.
c The three-year performance cycle for the February 2005 TSR award ended on 31 December 2007.
The number of shares released was 61% of the initial award.
This was based on a relative TSR ranking of position eight in the peer group at the end of the performance cycle.
