In light of the performance of the Group in 2008, the Committee awarded no bonus to any executive for the 80% of salary element linked to Group performance.
For the 40% of salary linked to personal performance, the Committee awarded a bonus of 35% of salary to David Lamb and bonuses of 30% of salary to David Bellamy, Andrew Croft and Ian Gascoigne, with half of this bonus being payable in cash, with the remainder being used to purchase St. Jamess Place shares which are held in trust for 3 years under the terms of the deferred bonus scheme.
The level of managements performance was recognised as being very good in highly challenging market conditions.
Metrics against which management performance was assessed included the achievement of objectives set at the start of the year, communication skills, teamwork, performance in relation to new tasks set during the year, risk management and other relevant factors.
