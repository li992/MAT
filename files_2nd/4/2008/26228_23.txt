The above table also shows the increase in transfer value being the current capital value now of the pension ultimately due which shows a disproportionate increase.
This level of increase did not arise as a result of extra accrual but as a result of the adoption, with effect from 1 October 2008, of a new actuarial basis for cash equivalent transfer values.
This was as a result of new legislation and associated regulations.
The new basis produces higher transfer values than the old basis, because of a using a lower discount rate, b the use of the latest mortality assumptions and c the yields on government bonds which are an input into calculating transfer values having fallen over the year.
The increase in accrued pension during the year excludes any increase for inflation.
