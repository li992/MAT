For every eight existing DMSS deferred and investment shares held on 14 November 2008, Executive Directors received the Right the Rights to three new Centrica plc shares at 160 pence per share.
The Rights attaching to deferred shares were automatically tail-swallowed ie such number of Rights were sold as was necessary to raise sufficient funds to take up the balance of unsold Rights, in accordance with the rules of the scheme, and the Rights attaching to investment shares were treated in accordance with the instructions of the Executive or past Director, who had the same choices as ordinary shareholders.
Conditional share awards, including the DMSS matching shares, were subject to an adjustment to reflect the dilutive effect of the Rights Issue and were multiplied by a factor of 1.1233 and their respective market prices at allocation were multiplied by a factor of 0.8902. ii In 2007 and 2008, 20% of gross bonus paid before the deduction of income tax and National Insurance contributions was automatically deferred and invested in Centrica shares deferred shares.
Participants have the opportunity to make a further investment investment shares, funded from net annual bonus, so that the maximum total investment on a gross basis is 50% of the individuals maximum bonus entitlement for the preceding year.
iii At allocation the calculation of the conditional matching shares is made on a gross basis.
Investment shares are grossed up to reflect the impact of income tax and National Insurance contributions for the calculation of the matching shares so that the deferred and investment shares are matched on the same basis.
The number of matching shares that vest will be determined on a straight-line basis from a zero match for no growth in economic profit to a two-times match for growth of 25% or above over a three-year period.
The number of matching shares that will be released following the satisfaction of the performance condition will be increased to reflect the dividends that would have been paid during the three-year performance period.
Dividends are paid on the deferred and investment shares to the participants on the normal dividend payment date.
iv During 2008, operation of the DMSS was delayed due to the Executive Directors and other senior executives being subject to dealing restrictions as a result of the Company being in a prolonged prohibited period under the Companys Model Code.
20% of the annual bonus payable in April 2008 under the AIS was, however, deferred automatically at that time and held until the DMSS could be operated.
The purchase of deferred and investment shares and the conditional award of matching shares were made on 13 October 2008. v DMSS matching shares awarded to Jake Ulrich on 4 April 2007 have been time-apportioned to his date of leaving the Company on 31 July 2008, and adjusted to incorporate the impact of the Rights Issue, as outlined in note i.

Allocations were subject to an adjustment to reflect the dilutive effect of the Rights Issue and were multiplied by a factor of 1.1233 and the respective market price at allocation and vesting date, where applicable, were multiplied by a factor of 0.8902. ii At the end of the performance period to 31 March 2008, the Company ranked 45th in the relevant comparator group.
Consequently, 57.5% of the original allocations were released to participants on 3 April 2008.
The released shares were subject to income tax at the individuals marginal rate and National Insurance contributions NICs at the rate of 1%, based on the unadjusted market value of the shares at the date of vesting.
The income tax and NICs liability was satisfied by the sale of sufficient shares and, accordingly, the Executive Directors only received the net number of shares following disposal, which, to the extent retained and subject to the impact of the Rights Issue effective on 15 December 2008, is reflected in the shareholdings as at 31 December 2008 on page 51. iii At the end of the performance period the Companys TSR performance will be assessed against that of the relevant LTIS comparator group.
If, and to the extent that the performance conditions are met, the relevant number of shares will be released to the Directors at the Trustees discretion as soon as practicable thereafter.
iv The percentage of the allocation eventually to vest is dependent on the satisfaction of performance criteria over a three-year performance period: half of the shares EPS shares will be subject to a performance condition based on the Groups adjusted EPS growth relative to the growth in RPI.
EPS growth will be calculated by comparing the Groups adjusted EPS figure for the financial period preceding the date of allocation with that for the financial period three years later: and half of the shares will be determined by the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR performance relative to the other companies comprising the LTIS comparator group the FTSE 100 at the start of the performance period the TSR shares.
At the end of the performance period, the TSR performance condition will be measured, the same calculation made for all the other 99 companies in the LTIS comparator group and a ranking list will be compiled.
v The first awards under the new LTIS approval was sought and given by shareholders at the AGM held on 19 May 2006 were made to participants other than the Executive Directors on 3 April 2006 on the date that allocations would normally be made under the previous LTIS and within the 42-day period following the release of the Companys annual results.
The awards to the Executive Directors then in office could only be made after shareholder approval, but in order to align their awards with those of other participants, their first awards were deemed to have been made on 3 April 2006 for all purposes of the new LTIS, including the calculation of the number of shares, the adjusted EPS and relative TSR performance tests and the three-year vesting period.
vi Shares were awarded to Mark Hanafin under the terms of the SLTIS on 26 September 2008.
In accordance with the rules of the SLTIS there are no performance conditions attaching to the shares other than continued employment with the Company.
In the event of a change of control the number of shares that vest will not be subject to time-apportionment.
vii Allocations made to Jake Ulrich on 3 April 2006 278,849 and 4 April 2007 295,851, which remained outstanding on 12 May 2008, being the date of his resignation from the Board, have been time-apportioned to his date of leaving the Company on 31 July 2008 and adjusted to incorporate the impact of the Rights Issue, as outlined in note i.

In accordance with the rules of the SESOS the grant is not subject to any performance conditions and is immediately exercisable and will normally remain so until the tenth anniversary of grant.
iii Sharesave Scheme The Company operates an HMRC-approved all-employee savings-related share option scheme in the UK.
The scheme is designed to provide a long-term savings and investment opportunity for employees.

Conditional awards, including ESOS, SESOS and Sharesave grants were subject to an adjustment to reflect the dilutive effect of the Rights Issue and the number of shares under option was multiplied by a factor of 1.1233 and the respective option price was multiplied by a factor of 0.8902. vi The Committee exercised its discretion, in accordance with the rules of the ESOS, to permit Jake Ulrich to exercise his options up to six months from the third anniversary of the last date on which an option was granted ie at any time before 3 October 2009.
All of his options are exercisable except those granted in 2006 which have not yet met the relevant performance conditions.
Under the rules of the Sharesave his outstanding options were exercisable until 31 January 2009.
The closing price of a Centrica ordinary share on the last trading day of 2008 31 December was 266 pence.
The range during the year was 207.50 pence low and 316 pence high, 355 pence prior to adjustment for the bonus element of the Rights Issue.

Mark Hanafin, Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff, who all joined the Company in recent years, are not members of any of Centricas pension schemes.
Centrica Pension Plan CPP The CPP is a funded, HMRC-registered, final salary, occupational pension scheme.
Its rules provide for the following main features: x normal retirement at age 62: x right to an immediate, unreduced pension on leaving service after age 60 at own request with employer consent, or on leaving service at Companys request after age 55: x life assurance cover of four times pensionable salary for death in service: x spouses pension on death in service payable at the rate of 50% of the members prospective pension and, on death after retirement, half of the accrued pension.
Childrens pensions are also payable: x members contributions payable at the rate of 6% of pensionable earnings.
Contributions made by the Executive Directors who are also members of the Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme CUPS are payable at the rate of 6% of their total pensionable earnings above the scheme earnings cap: x pension payable in the event of retirement due to ill health: x pensions in payment and in deferment guaranteed to increase in line with the increase in the RPI a maximum of 6% applies to pension accrued after 6 April 2004 : and x no discretionary practices are taken into account in calculating transfer values.
All registered scheme benefits are subject to HMRC guidelines.
As a result of the changes introduced by Centrica following the 2004 Finance Act, benefits at 6 April 2006 from the registered scheme, the CPP, could not exceed the Lifetime Allowance 1.5 million for the 2006 07 tax year after taking account of retained benefits from all other sources notified to Centrica at this time.
The CUPS provides any additional benefits in excess of the maximum amount that could be provided through the CPP on the members uncapped pensionable earnings.
The benefits that arise under CUPS are treated as being subject to the same rules as apply in respect of the registered portion of members benefits.
No individual will receive benefits from Centrica which, when added to their retained benefits elsewhere at 6 April 2006, exceed two-thirds of their final pensionable earnings.
CUPS is unfunded but the benefits are secured by a charge over certain Centrica assets.
An appropriate provision in respect of the accrued value of these benefits has been made in the Companys balance sheet.

The pension accrual rates for 2008 for Phil Bentley and Jake Ulrich were 2.65% and 3.71% respectively.
ii The increase in accrued pension has been adjusted to exclude inflation by revaluing the accrued pension as at 31 December 2007 by the rate of inflation 5.0% and deducting this from the accrued pension as at 31 December 2008.
The rate of inflation used was 5.0%, the annual rate to 30 September 2008, the date used for pension increases under the scheme.
iii Jake Ulrich retired on 31 July 2008.
Under the rules of the CPP and CUPS Jake Ulrich aged 55 years 5 months on leaving was entitled to an actuarially reduced pension on the standard terms for a normal deferred leaver taking payment of their pension before normal retirement age.
iv The reduction in the transfer values less contributions at 31 December 2008 is due to the change in market conditions which determine the calculation of transfer values.
A change in the transfer value calculation basis was also introduced in September 2008.
Had the transfer value been calculated on the accrued pension at 31 December 2008 but using the calculation basis in force at 31 December 2007, the transfer value of the accrued pension would have amounted to 1,032,100 for Phil Bentley and 4,437,900 for Jake Ulrich.
The difference in the transfer value less contributions would have amounted to 399,620 for Phil Bentley and 1,217,155 for Jake Ulrich.
Pay in lieu of pension provision Under the terms of their contracts of employment, Mark Hanafin, Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff are entitled to a salary supplement in lieu of pension provision.
Mark Hanafin and Sam Laidlaw are each entitled to 40% of base salary, while Nick Luff is entitled to 30% of base salary.
With the exception of 232,500 paid directly by the Company into Sam Laidlaws personal pension plan, these amounts are disclosed in the Directors emoluments table on page 50.
This report on remuneration has been approved by the Board of Directors and signed on its behalf by: Grant Dawson General Counsel & Company Secretary 26 February 2009 55 C Centrica p44-55.
