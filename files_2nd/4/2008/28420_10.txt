118 Prudential plc Annual Report 2008 Directors remuneration report Annual Incentive Plans Performance in 2008 The main business measures considered by the Remuneration Committee and incorporated into the 2008 annual incentive plans were IFRS profit, EEV profit and cash flow against each of which Prudential achieved strong results in 2008 despite the turbulence in the financial markets in the year.
For the 2008 annual bonus plans, the proportions of financial and individual performance for the executive directors were the same as for 2009, as set out in the section on Performance measures in 2009 annual bonus plans on page 105.
For all the executive directors, individual strategic goals formed the objectives against which individual performance was assessed.
These included each executive directors contribution to the group strategy as a member of the plc Board and the specific goals related to their functional and or business unit roles.
The bonuses awarded to the executive directors for 2008 reflect Group and, where applicable, their business units performance against the targets confirmed by the Remuneration Committee in February 2008.
These targets were considered demanding at that time being based on the 2008-10 business plan drawn up prior to the market deterioration which started at the end of 2007.
These targets have not been amended.
As the economic climate further deteriorated in 2008 the challenges presented particularly to the Asia and Jackson businesses have proved exceedingly demanding.
We are fully satisfied that the bonuses awarded properly take account of the absolute performance achieved against the original targets set.
The 2008 financial results under the main business measures incorporated in the annual plans are set out below.
The measures for Jackson were different and are identified later in this section: Group UK Asia M&G notes 2,3 note 3 note 4 note 5 IFRS profit on continuing operations 1,347m 589m 347m 286m EEV profit on long-term business 2,906m 1,037m 1,309m Net cash flow 54m 80 m 5m A comparison with the 2007 results, using constant exchange rates, is set out in the following table.
% increase from 2007 result Group UK Asia M&G IFRS profit on continuing operations 7 12 27 13 EEV profit on long-term business 10 21 15 Change from 2007 result Net cash flow 136m 62m 32 m Notes 1 The 2008 and 2007 profit figures based on reported actual exchange rates were audited by KPMG.
Net cashflow and the conversions at constant exchange rates are not audited.
2 2008 Group performance against the EEV profit and Cashflow in the executive directors annual incentive plans was very strong.
Group IFRS profit was also at a level against the target set which resulted in a payment being triggered.
3 Under the UK annual plan, performance against all the measures was very strong.
UK Net cash flow excludes the With-profits transfer of 279m.
4 Under the Asia annual plan, performance against IFRS and EEV versus the targets was strong but the Asia cash flow achieved did not result in a payment.
5 Michael McLintocks annual bonus plan performance measures include, as well as IFRS profits, growth in third-party funds under management and comparative fund investment performance.
Performance achieved against IFRS profits was good and hence triggered a payment for this measure and fund performance at 68th percentile was very strong.
As for all fund management firms, 2008 saw a fall in the value of funds under management because of the fall in the FTSE.
However, M&G significantly increased market share which was a considerable achievement during such a period of economic turmoil.
Clark Mannings annual plan included a cash flow measure which was not met.
The Jackson senior management bonus pool in which Clark Manning participates depends on Jackson IFRS and EEV profits.
The 2008 pool is some 35 per cent lower than the pool for 2007 reflecting IFRS and EEV results which are approximately 15 per cent lower than in 2007.

In normal circumstances, directors may take up their right to receive shares at any time during the following seven years.
2008 Awards The awards made under the Group Performance Share Plan and the Business Unit Performance Plan in respect of 2008 have a performance period from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2010.
In determining the 2008 conditional share awards the shares were valued at the average share price for the 30 days immediately following the announcement of Prudentials 2007 results, and the price used to determine the number of shares was 662.11 pence.
Group Performance Share Plan Awards under the Group Performance Share Plan are described on page 111. Business Unit Performance Plan Awards under the 2008 Business Unit Performance Plan are described in the section on 2008 and 2009 Business Unit Performance Plan BUPP awards on page 105.

2 Group Performance Share Plan 2006 At 31 December 2008 Prudentials TSR performance was 117 per cent of the TSR performance of the index.

The award payout equals an initial award value adjusted by the change in the Prudential plc share price over the performance period.
In order for any award to be made under the 2005 plan, the growth rate over the performance period must be greater or equal to eight per cent compound growth per annum.
At this level of performance, the initial award value is US$864,240.
If the on-target performance level of 11.5 per cent per annum compound is achieved the initial award value is doubled.
If the annual growth rate is at least 17.5 per cent, the payout increases to a maximum of three times the initial award value.
For performance between these points, payouts are on a straight line sliding scale.
For the 2005 award the results led to a payment of US$4,416,308.
The face values of the awards for Clark Manning have been converted at the average exchange rate for 2008 which was US$1.8518 1 2007: US$2.0015 1.
Michael McLintock Michael McLintocks 2005 and 2006 cash long-term incentive awards were under the M&G Chief Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan that provides a cash reward through phantom M&G share awards and options.
For these awards, the phantom share price at the beginning of the performance period was 1.
The change in the phantom share price equals the change in M&G profit, modified up or down by the investment performance of M&G, over the performance period.
For each year the face value of the share award was 225,000 and the phantom option award had a face value of 367,800.
Provided the phantom share options have value, they may be exercised in part or in full during annual exercise periods after three to seven years from the start of the performance period.
For the 2005 award the phantom share price at the end of the performance period was 2.34.
This resulted in a payment from the phantom share award of 526,500 and a phantom option award of 367,800 units.
Michael McLintock did not exercise any of these options.
For the 2006 award, the phantom share price at the end of the performance period was 1.69.
This will result in a payment of 380,250 from the share element of the award.
Under the rules of Michael McLintocks 2001 phantom option award, a payment of 845,940 was made at the end of the seven year exercise period.
An award under the share element of the M&G Chief Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan with a face value of 1,333,000 was made in 2007.
Following consultations with shareholders an award with a face value of 1,141,176 was made in 2008 under the M&G Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan, approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2008.
