32 33 Directors remuneration report This report has been prepared in accordance with Section 234B of the Companies Act 1985 and the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority together the Regulations.
The report also describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements of the Company will be approved.
The Regulations require the auditors to report to the Company members on the auditable part of the Directors remuneration report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committees principal responsibility is to determine the remuneration of both the Companys Executive Directors and its senior management within broad policies agreed with the Board.
In addition, it reviews the remuneration policy for the Company as a whole.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Executive Directors and the Chairman, not the Committee.
The conclusions and recommendations of the Remuneration Committee were nalised in two formal meetings during the year, but these were preceded by several informal discussions, including some with advisers none of whom had any other connection with the Company.
The members of the Committee were David Mann Chairman, Colin Garrett, Nick Prest, and for part of the year, Jonathan Brooks and Philip Dayer.
Jonathan Brooks and Philip Dayer both joined the Remuneration Committee on their appointment to the Board.
The Chief Executive Richard Longdon is invited to submit recommendations to the Remuneration Committee and both he and the members of the Committee take into consideration relevant external market data as well as the reviews of remuneration for employees of the Group generally.
Remuneration policy The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that members of the Executive management are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Group.
It also aims for a combination of xed and variable payments, benets and share-based awards that will achieve a balance in incentives to achieve short and long-term goals.
The Remuneration Committee has access to detailed external research from independent consultants and during the year engaged New Bridge Street Consultants LLP to review the remuneration of the Executive Directors and senior management and to benchmark their remuneration against comparable companies.
As part of this review, the Board introduced new short-term incentives for Executive Directors and selected employees incorporating a deferred bonus component.
Subject to the achievement of performance conditions relating to a single financial year, these incentive arrangements are intended to reward the recipient partly in cash, payable on announcement of interim and or final results, and partly in ordinary shares in the Company to be delivered on a deferred basis.
Under these incentive arrangements, depending on the extent to which performance conditions are achieved, an overall bonus amount is determined.
Part of this overall bonus amount is payable in cash: an amount equal to the balance which may be up to 50% is used to calculate the number of ordinary shares which the bonus recipient is eligible to receive on a deferred basis.
This is calculated by identifying the number of ordinary shares which could be purchased with the balance at the mid-market closing price of an ordinary share on the dealing day immediately preceding the preliminary announcement of the Companys results for the relevant financial year.
The Board is seeking shareholder approval to establish an Employee benefit Trust EBT and it is intended that the proposed EBT would serve as a mechanism to transfer shares purchased in the market to participants in these short-term incentive arrangements.
The principal terms of the proposed EBT are included in the enclosed notice of Annual General Meeting.
The intention is that the EBT would normally deliver the deferred shares to participants in three equal tranches, one in each of the three years following the year in which an award is made by the EBT, provided that the participant remains an employee or Director of the Group.
If the participant ceases to be an employee or Director, entitlement to all outstanding tranches would fall away unless the cessation occurs by reason of his or her death.
Following the death of a bonus participant, or on a takeover, reconstruction or amalgamation, or voluntary winding up of the Company, the period for which the participant must remain an employee or Director would be reduced below the normal three years and entitlement to delivery of the shares would be accelerated.
There are no arrangements for the delivery of additional matching shares to a participant in any circumstances.
The Board believes that these new incentive arrangements more closely align the interests of Executive Directors and employees with shareholders interests.
Basic salaries In determining the basic salary of each Executive Director the Committee takes account of the performance of the Company as a whole and the performance of the individual in achieving financial and non-financial goals within his areas of responsibility.
Bonus payments The Executive Directors participate in annual performance-related bonus arrangements determined by the Committee.
The arrangements are based substantially or entirely on the performance of the Company as a whole geared towards exceeding internal and external expectations of profit before tax.
Part of this may also be based on the achievement of personal objectives.
Bonus amounts for the year to 31 March 2008 arising under these arrangements were 310,000 for Richard Longdon and 200,000 for Paul Taylor.
One half of these bonus amounts is payable in cash: it is intended that the remainder of the bonus will take the form of a deferred share award where the number of ordinary shares which may be received is determined using the method of calculation described above.
For the year ended 31 March 2008 there was a cap on the bonus that an Executive Director could achieve under these arrangements and the maximum was 100% of basic salary.
In view of the excellent results for the year, the Committee decided to award a further cash bonus equivalent of 20% of salary, bringing the total bonus amounts to 372,000 2007 275,100 for Richard Longdon and 240,000 2007 183,500 for Paul Taylor.
AVEVA Group plc Annual report 2008 Directors' report 34 35 Directors remuneration report continued UNAUDITED INFORMATION CONTINUED Total shareholder return performance graph The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 require the presentation of a performance graph of total shareholder return compared with a broad equity market index for a period of five years.
The following graph shows the Companys performance, measured by total shareholder return, compared with the performance of the techMARK All-Share Index.
Total shareholder return is the share price plus dividends reinvested compared against techMARK All-Share Index, rebased to the start of the period.
Total shareholder return v techMARK All-Share Index 20032008 The Directors consider the techMARK All-Share Index to be an appropriate choice as the Index includes AVEVA Group plc.
Share awards The Remuneration Committee considers that periodic grants of share-related incentives should constitute an important element of the remuneration of the Companys senior Executives, in line with common practice in comparator companies.
The Companys share schemes have therefore been used to provide long-term incentives to assist in creating and sustaining growth in share value.
There are three schemes in existence, the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme, the AVEVA Group plc Long-Term Incentive Plan and the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme 2007.
The number of shares which may be allocated on exercise of any options granted under any of the Companys share option schemes including employee schemes shall not, when aggregated with the number of shares which have been allocated in the previous ten years under these schemes, exceed 10% of the ordinary share capital of the Company in issue immediately prior to that date.
As recipients of these awards, Executive Directors and senior management are required to hold or build share ownership with a value of at least 100% of their then current salary.
Details of the awards made under these schemes are as follows: 2004 05 awards In 2004 the Remuneration Committee commissioned a study by Deloitte & Touche LLP to review the Companys share option schemes and to make recommendations on their development.
The Board accepted those recommendations and, following consultation with shareholders, the Company established the AVEVA Group plc Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP which was approved at the Extraordinary General Meeting held in 2004.
Under the LTIP, options are granted to selected individuals to acquire ordinary shares at an exercise price equal to the nominal value of the shares: these options will be exercisable only if stringent performance criteria are met.
At the Extraordinary General Meeting in 2004, shareholders also approved that the dilution limits under the AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option scheme be extended to enable further awards to be made under this scheme.
In 2004 05, a total of 63,000 options were awarded to Executive Directors under the LTIP.
The condition of exercise for these awards was based on the ranking of the Company in terms of its total shareholder return measured against the techMARK 100 Index.
The option vested in accordance with the following scale: Total shareholder return ranking Percentage vesting of shares subject to option 75% and above 100% Median to 75% Pro rata on a straight-line basis Median 33% Below median Nil The performance conditions were measured three years from the date of grant and all awards vested in full.
2005 06 awards The AVEVA Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme was established in 1996 at the time of the Companys listing on the Ofcial List of the London Stock Exchange.
In 2005 06, a total of 162,816 options under the scheme were awarded to Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee felt that awards made as market value options were better suited at that time to the Companys circumstances.
The performance conditions required to be achieved for the exercise of the option were that Earnings per Share EPS in the financial year ending 31 March 2008 would have grown to no less than 5% above the Retail Price Index per annum from that achieved in the financial year ended 31 March 2005.
The performance condition was judged to be appropriately stretching because of the investment planned in the VNET programme during the period.
AVEVA Group plc Annual report 2008 Directors' report 34 35 UNAUDITED INFORMATION CONTINUED Share awards continued 2006 07 awards In 2006 07 a total of 42,588 share options were awarded to the Executive Directors under the LTIP.
The Committee decided to revert to this scheme, with performance conditions based on growth in EPS, but in this case the average growth in EPS achieved over the three years from 2006 07 to 2008 09.
If average EPS growth is greater than 15% per annum then all of the shares shall vest.
If average EPS growth is less than 7.5% per annum none of the shares shall vest.
If average EPS growth is between 7.5% and 15% then the number of shares that shall vest will be determined by linear interpolation.
The Remuneration Committee considered that these were challenging performance conditions in the context of the Companys budget and market expectations at the time of the awards.
2007 08 awards In 2007 08, a total of 18,234 share options were awarded to the Executive Directors under the LTIP.
The performance conditions are based on average growth in earnings per share over the years from 2007 08 to 2009 10.
If average EPS growth is greater than 11.5% per annum then all of the shares shall vest.
If average earnings per share is less than 9% per annum then none of the shares shall vest.
If average earnings per share growth is between 9% and 11.5% per annum then the number of shares that shall vest shall be determined by linear interpolation.
The Remuneration Committee considered that these were challenging performance conditions in the context of internal and external expectations at the time of the awards.
Service contracts The service contracts and letters of appointment of the Directors include the following terms: Date of contract Date of appointment Notice period months Nick Prest 10 January 2006 11 January 2006 3 David Mann 17 May 2000 8 June 1999 3 Colin Garrett 14 July 2000 1 August 2000 3 Jonathan Brooks 12 July 2007 12 July 2007 3 Philip Dayer 27 December 2007 7 January 2008 3 Richard Longdon 28 November 1996 28 November 1996 12 Paul Taylor 17 October 1989 1 March 2001 9 The Committee considers that the notice periods of the Executive Directors are in line with those in other companies of a similar size and nature and are in the best interests of the Group to ensure stability in senior management.
There are no predetermined special provisions for Executive or Non-Executive Directors with regard to compensation in the event of loss of office.
The Remuneration Committee would be responsible for considering the circumstances of the early termination of an Executive Directors contract and determining whether in exceptional circumstances there should be compensation payments in excess of the Companys contractual obligations.
