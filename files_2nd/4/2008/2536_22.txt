Directors Remuneration Report For the 52 weeks ended 28 September 2008 The following is a report by the Remuneration Committee the Committee which has been approved by the Board of Britvic plc for submission to shareholders.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
It provides the Companys statement of how it has applied the principles of good governance relating to Directors remuneration and is intended to communicate Britvics policies and practices on executive remuneration to the Companys major shareholders and relevant institutions.
In accordance with the Companies Act 1985, a resolution will be submitted to the AGM to approve the Directors Remuneration Report.
Membership of Remuneration Committee During the 52 weeks ended 28 September 2008, the Committee consisted wholly of independent Non-Executive Directors: Chris Bulmer Chairman of the Committee resigned 15 April 2008 Bob Ivell appointed Chairman of the Committee 15 April 2008 Michael Shallow Ben Gordon appointed 15 April 2008 Gerald Corbett appointed 18 June 2008 At the invitation of the Chairman of the Committee, the Chairman of the Board prior to his appointment to the Committee, the Chief Executive and Human Resources Director attend the meetings of the Committee except when their own remuneration is under consideration.
Details of the attendance by Committee Members at Committee Meetings are shown in the Corporate Governance Report on page 40.
Composition and terms of reference The Committees composition and terms of reference are in line with the Combined Code and are available on the Companys website or on request.
Following a recent change, the Combined Code on Corporate Governance provides that the Chairman of the Board may be a member of although not chair a remuneration committee if considered to be independent.
In the light of the significant contribution which can be made by the Chairman of the Board, and his independence, the Company decided that he should be appointed as a member of the Committee on 18 June 2008.
However, the Chairman of the Board absents himself from discussions when his own remuneration is under discussion.
The Committee meets not less than three times a year and has responsibility for: i making recommendations to the Board on the Groups policy on the remuneration of the Companys Chief Executive, Chairman, the Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and other members of the Executive Committee: ii the determination, within agreed terms of reference, of the remuneration of the Chairman and of specific remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors and other members of the Executive Committee, including pension rights, any compensation payments and benefits: and iii the determination of awards under the Companys employee share plans to the Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and other members of the Executive Committee.
The Committee also ensures compliance with the Combined Code in this respect.
Advisors The Committee has appointed an external consultant, Towers Perrin, to advise on executive compensation issues and in developing its performance-related remuneration policy.
From time to time the Company is also advised by Towers Perrin on remuneration-related issues.
The following individuals also provided material advice or services to the Committee during the 52 weeks ended 28 September 2008: Paul Moody Chief Executive.
Doug Frost Human Resources Director.
Michael Mountford Head of Compensation and Benefits.
Remuneration policy To date, the remuneration policy with respect to Executive Directors has been designed to provide market competitive remuneration relative to UK-listed companies of similar size and scope.
The Company believes that in order to meet its remuneration objectives, the remuneration of Executive Directors should comprise a balance between fixed and variable performance-related pay elements with the predominant proportion of potential reward being linked to performance.
As a result, for superior performance, approximately two thirds of total remuneration is performancerelated.
For target performance, approximately half of total remuneration is performance-related.
The Committee constantly reviews remuneration policy to ensure that it is sufficiently flexible to take account of future changes in Britvics business operations and environment and recognises key developments in remuneration practice and alignment to shareholder interests.
Consequently, the policy set out in this report has been applied during 2007 08.
However, following the Committees most recent review a number of changes in policy will be implemented for 2008 09 and are described in more detail below.
The Committee has explained, in some detail, the rationale for these changes to the Companys larger shareholders and the main institutional shareholder bodies prior to the publication of this Report.
In summary, the Committee has decided to revise the current incentive arrangements in place to more closely reflect the evolving needs of the business, changing competitive market norms and best practice developments since the original policy was implemented on IPO in December 2005.
42 Britvic plc Annual Report 2008 The Committee believes that the revisions to Executive Directors packages will both strengthen the link between pay and performance as well as address the shortfall in overall compensation levels which have developed since IPO.
Therefore, in respect of 2008 09 superior performance will mean that approximately three quarters of total remuneration will be performancerelated.
Similarly, for target performance, approximately three fifths of total remuneration will be performance-related.
Remuneration objectives The principal objective of the policy remains the same and is to provide market competitive levels of remuneration, including incentive arrangements, which will reward successful execution of the Companys short-term and long-term strategy.
The Committee believes that this requires: The provision of mid-market base salaries and incentive levels for the sector, with appropriate leverage to reward sustained exceptional performance and support the future growth plans of the Company.
A reward structure that places an appropriate emphasis on short-term and long-term performance to support operating performance and to reward sustained longer-term performance.
Competitive incentive arrangements that are underpinned by a balance of operational and long-term performance metrics to provide both a focus on business performance and alignment with returns to the Companys shareholders.
Components of remuneration Purpose Performance measure Base salary Positions the role and the individual Individual contribution and sustained fairly within a competitive market value in the business.
range derived from a peer group of similar-sized UK-listed companies.
Short-Term Incentive Plan Provides focus on the delivery of PBT 50% : net revenue 25% and the financial targets set out in the free cash flow 25%.
Executive Share Option Plan Provides focus on longer-term EPS growth during the three-year Option plan share price growth.
Reflects sustained delivery of earnings growth.
Performance Share Plan PSP Provides focus on sustained growth.
Relative total shareholder return TSR over a three-year performance period against a peer group of similar sector companies.
From 2008 9 a three-year performance period based on an even split of relative TSR against a peer group of similar sector companies and average Return on Invested Capital ROIC.
Remuneration in practice Base salary Salaries are reviewed annually to take account of market movement, individual contribution and increases elsewhere in the Company.
Directors salaries are benchmarked against a selected peer group of UK companies with similar levels of revenue.
The salaries of other members of the Executive Committee are benchmarked against a selected group of major companies in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods FMCG and Retail sectors, where the Committee sees the primary market for talent at this level.
Short-Term Incentive Plan Targets were approved by the Committee at the beginning of the year and were aligned to internal targets and strategic business objectives for 2007 8.
Up to 60% of salary for the Chief Executive and 50% of salary for the Finance Director is payable for the achievement of target PBT, net revenue growth and free cash flow performance on a 50% 25% 25% basis.
Up to a maximum of 120% and 100% of salary is payable for the achievement of exceptional performance targets for the Chief Executive and Finance Director, respectively.
For 2007 8, a bonus of 69.6% of salary for the Chief Executive and 58.0% of salary for the Finance Director was earned for above target performance against PBT and free cash flow but below target performance in net revenue growth.
Details of PBT and net revenue are shown on page 51 and free cash flow on page 53.
Britvic plc Annual Report 2008 43 Directors Remuneration Report continued Following the review of incentive arrangements mentioned above, the Committee decided that the key short-term operational drivers of the business for 2008 9 remain appropriate and therefore the same bonus structure as applied in 2007 8 should continue.
Therefore bonuses will be paid for achievement of performance targets based on PBT, net revenue growth and free cash flow and will be set at appropriately stretching levels.
The Committee has also decided to increase target and maximum bonus opportunity for Executive Directors to more closely align packages with competitive market norms.
As a result, target and maximum bonus for the Chief Executive will change to 70% and 140% of salary, respectively.
Similarly, target and maximum bonus opportunity for the Finance Director will change to 60% and 120% of salary, respectively.
Executive Share Option Plan Annual grants of options were made at the discretion of the Board over shares in Britvic plc at the market price at date of grant to senior executives 25 in 2007 8.
The level of option grant and the performance conditions are determined and reviewed by the Committee annually.
For 2007 8 the policy was to grant the options over shares worth 200% and 150% of annual salary to the Chief Executive and Finance Director, respectively.
Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
A performance condition is applied such that 40% of the grant vests for the achievement of EPS growth over the three-year performance period equivalent to RPI 3% per annum.
No awards will vest below this threshold level of performance.
For achievement of EPS growth equivalent to RPI 7% per annum over the same period, 100% of the grant will vest, with straightline vesting between threshold and maximum.
Options lapse to the extent that the performance condition is not achieved.
For 2008 9, the Committee has decided to maintain the same focus on long-term EPS growth and believes the current performance range remains sufficiently stretching in the context of the current business outlook and growth strategy of the Company.
However, in accordance with best practice the Committee has also decided to reduce the proportion of the grant vesting at threshold performance from 40% to 25% of the grant.
Furthermore, to more closely align long-term incentives with competitive market norms, option grants over shares worth 300% of salary will apply for the Chief Executive and 250% of salary for the Finance Director.
Performance Share Plan Annual grants of performance shares were made at the discretion of the Board to senior executives and managers 90 in 2007 8.
The awards normally vest at the end of the three-year performance period, to the extent that the performance condition will have been achieved, and lapse to the extent it is not achieved.
For 2007 8 the policy was to grant the equivalent of 50% of annual salary to Executive Directors, calculated on the basis of the market price at the date of grant.
For awards to vest in full under this plan, Britvics TSR must rank in the top quartile of the peer group of the following similar sector companies over the same period: AG BARR Nichols Associated British Foods Northern Foods C&C Group Premier Foods Cadbury Schweppes Reckitt Benckiser Dairy Crest SABMiller Diageo Smith & Nephew Fuller Smith SSL International Greene King Tate & Lyle Marstons formerly Wolverhampton & Dudley Uniq No awards will vest for performance below median, with 40% of the award vesting at median rising to 100% at upper quartile on a straight-line basis.
During 2006 7 and 2007 8 four companies on the original list of comparator companies RHM, Arla Foods, Scottish & Newcastle and IAWS Group were taken over and subsequently excluded from the list.
The Committee considered whether to replace these companies and decided that the remaining 18 companies were sufficient for 2007 8.
The Committee has for 2008 9 decided to revise the structure of the PSP and as a result, vesting of awards under the PSP will be determined on an even split according to the ranking of Britvics relative TSR and on stretching three-year average ROIC targets set at the commencement of each financial year.
For the purposes of the PSP, ROIC will be defined as Operating Profit after Tax divided by Average Invested Capital including Goodwill, expressed as a percentage.
The Committee believes that the introduction of a ROIC performance target provides closer alignment with underlying financial performance than relative TSR growth alone, as well as introducing an appropriate balance with the EPS growth targets set under the Option Plan.
In particular, the Committee believes that ROIC directly aligns pay with an appropriate balance between future investment and capital spending plans and the need to maintain appropriate margins in an uncertain trading environment over the next few years.
44 Britvic plc Annual Report 2008 For 2008 9 the Committee has decided to replace the four companies lost from the original TSR comparator group with Greencore Group plc, Origin Enterprises plc, Wetherspoon J D plc and Glanbia plc thus reinstating a comparator group of 22 companies.
In accordance with best practice, the Committee has also decided to reduce the proportion of award vesting at threshold performance from 40% to 25% of the award in conjunction with an increase in award levels to 100% of salary for Executive Directors.
Therefore, for 2008 9, 25% of awards will vest at three-year average ROIC of 16.8% rising to full vesting on a straight-line basis at ROIC of 18.8%.
No award will vest for three-year average ROIC below 16.8%.
The Committee believes these revisions will both strengthen the effectiveness and competitiveness of the PSP as well as the overall compensation packages for Executive Directors.
Shareholding guidelines In accordance with best practice and further to align the interests of Executive Directors and shareholders, a shareholding guideline is in place.
The guideline requires Executive Directors to acquire a shareholding equal to their annual salary within five years from IPO calculated at the IPO share price.
Until this holding is acquired, the Executive Directors may not sell any shares other than to finance the cost of exercising options and any tax liabilities arising from the vesting of long-term incentive plans, unless approved by the Committee, for example, in cases of financial hardship.
Retirement benefits The Executive Directors currently participate in the defined benefit section of the Britvic Pension Plan the Plan.
The normal retirement age for Executive Directors is 60.
Bonus payouts and other incentive awards are not pensionable.
The Executive Directors also currently participate in the Britvic Executive Top Up Scheme, the Companys unfunded supplementary retirement benefits scheme.
Prior to the legislative changes on 6 April 2006 A-Day, the Top Up Scheme provided pension benefits above the previous HM Revenue & Customs HMRC earnings cap to which the Plan was subject.
Post A-Day, this earnings cap has been removed for future service within the Plan.
For pre A-Day, service the earnings cap is maintained within the Plan and will be indexed by inflation in line with Treasury notification.
The Top Up Scheme is maintained to provide pension benefits above the earnings cap for pre A-Day service and to provide benefits above the new lifetime allowance for post A-Day service.
The defined benefit section of the Plan was originally designed broadly to provide a pension of two-thirds of final salary at normal retirement age, along with life assurance, ill health and dependants pensions.
Following a strategic review of pension policy in 2007 8 the defined benefit rate of pension accrual for Executive Directors for service from 1 July 2008 onwards was reduced by one-third.
The cap on the rate of annual increase to pension in payment was also reduced to 2.5%, instead of the previous 5%, for pension in payment resulting from the reduced rate of pension accrual.
The defined benefit section of the Plan is closed to new entrants.
All new entrants are offered membership of the defined contribution section of the Plan with similar life assurance, ill health and dependants pensions.
Other benefits Executive Directors receive an annual car benefit or allowance and membership of the Companys private medical healthcare plan.
Service contracts The current policy is for Executive Directors service contract notice periods to be normally no longer than 12 months.
The service contracts of the current Executive Directors and the letters of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors include the following terms: Effective Unexpired Notice period Notice period date of term approx.

The Non-Executive Directors letters of appointment have been extended for a further three-year term to 14 December 2011.
There are no special provisions for Executive or Non-Executive Directors with regard to compensation in the event of loss of office.
In the event of the employment of an Executive Director being terminated, the Committee would pay due regard to best practice and take account of the individuals duty to mitigate their loss.
