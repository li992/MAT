Remuneration Report Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors remuneration.
As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on certain parts of the Directors remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information Remuneration Committee The Company has established a Remuneration Committee which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code.
The members of the Committee during the year were David White, David Ross and Jonathan Short, who are all independent Non-Executive Directors and the Committee is chaired by David White.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest other than as shareholders, conflicts of interests arising from cross-directorships or day-today involvement in running the business.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board.
No Director plays a part in any discussion about his or her own remuneration.
In determining the Directors remuneration, the Committee consulted the Executive Chairman Nicholas Vetch about his proposals.
The Committee last year appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP to provide benchmarking advice on structuring and salary levels of the Directors remuneration packages.
Deloitte & Touche LLP are also the Groups auditors.
Remuneration policy Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors of the high calibre required and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders.
The performance measurement of the Executive Directors and the determination of their annual remuneration package is undertaken by the Committee.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the full Board.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors and senior management: 1.
Basic salary is determined by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of each year and when an individual changes position or responsibility.
Appropriate salary levels are set by reference to the performance, experience and responsibilities of each individual concerned and having regard to the prevailing market conditions.
Executive Directors contracts of service which include details of remuneration will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
Performance related bonuses are assessed annually and determined by the Remuneration Committee and are based on a combination of individual and corporate performance during the year.
The bonuses are capped at 50% of annual basic salary, and are directly linked to the Groups profit and operating cash flow performance.
There is no deferrable element of the bonus, and it is non pensionable.
This years annual bonus award represents 10% of basic salary earned in the year.
Pension contributions of 10% of basic salary are paid into a personal pension plan for each Director.
Share options Share options are granted by the Remuneration Committee, and are assessed on an individual basis with a view to motivating and retaining Executive Directors in the longer term.
In accordance with the policy set by the Remuneration Committee immediately prior to the Companys flotation on AIM in May 2000, all Directors share options granted since flotation were subject to performance conditions, all of which were met.
There have been no grants under the Companys share option plans to Directors since December 2002 and the policy is that any future incentivisation of Directors will be under the Long Term Incentive Plan described below.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Approval was granted by shareholders at the 2004 Annual General Meeting for a Long Term Incentive Plan the Plan.
The Remuneration Committee has determined that a new incentive plan using an award of nil-priced options is the most appropriate way to provide a competitive and market-related long term equity opportunity.
The principal reasons for the Remuneration Committee favouring the use of nil-priced options are: the greater alignment of executive reward with shareholder interests: the reduced volatility of nil priced options to general share price movements: and minimising the dilutive impact of the LTIP to the Companys shareholders.
Participation in the LTIP is only available to Executive Directors and selected senior management.
34 Big Yellow Remuneration Report continued The first awards under the LTIP to Directors were made on 6 June 2005 when the market price was 195.5p.
Initial awards have been designed to incentivise the executive team for the period between 2005 and 2010, although it is intended that awards under the LTIP will be made on an annual basis thereafter.
Individual grants of options to Executive Directors for the first three years of the LTIP 2005 2007 have been determined by the Committee see table below and these were disclosed in the 2004 Remuneration Report and approved by shareholders at the 2005, 2006 and 2007 Annual General Meetings.
Additionally, the Committee considered the incentive package of Nicholas Vetch, the Executive Chairman.
Nicholas Vetch has taken on direct responsibility at Board level for the real estate strategy and the execution of the critical driver of the growth in the business.
The Committee considered that 133,333 options should be awarded to Nicholas Vetch, the first such award to him under the LTIP scheme.
This was approved at the 2007 Annual General Meeting.
Philip Burks has stepped down to the role of Non-Executive Director from 30 March 2007, and has not been awarded any further options under the LTIP scheme.
In respect of the current year and in all other grants to Directors beyond those set out above, it is intended that the maximum annual grant of awards will not exceed 100% of a participants annual base salary, except where the Committee considers there to be exceptional circumstances which justify an award above this limit.
For the current year it is proposed that the Directors are awarded LTIPS at less than 100% of salary, as set out below.
These awards will be voted on by Shareholders at the 2008 Annual General Meeting.

Awards will become exercisable subject to the satisfaction of challenging conditions Performance Conditions which will determine how many if any of the awards will vest and become exercisable after the end of the performance period.
The period over which performance will be measured shall not be less than three years.
The committee has considered the performance of the 2005 option grant and determined that the criteria have been met, and the awards have therefore vested.
Performance Conditions will be determined at the sole discretion of the Committee at the time of award and will be objective and linked to the underlying financial performance of the Company.
Any award under the LTIP that does not vest at the end of the specified performance period will lapse.
The extent to which awards granted under the LTIP vest and become exercisable will be determined by reference to the Companys total shareholder return TSR relative to the FTSE All Share Index and the following targets will apply.
Total Shareholder Return Performance Level Amount of Award Vesting % Upper Quartile Full vesting Median to Upper Quartile Pro rata vesting on a straight line basis Median and below Nil The Committee has selected the FTSE All Share Index because it enables the Companys performance to be compared to a broad index that reflects the corporate performance of UK companies.
As such it provides a comparator which demonstrates the Companys overall performance against the prevailing market conditions across the performance period.
Vesting of awards made in May 2005 under the LTIP will also be subject to the growth in the Companys adjusted earnings per share EPS exceeding the UK Retail Price Index RPI by an average of 3 per cent a year over the performance period commencing with the financial year in which the award is made.
The Committee reserve the right to vary the Performance Condition for future grants provided that in its reasonable judgment the new targets are no less challenging in the light of the Companys business circumstances and its internal forecasts.
Sharesave Scheme The Scheme is open to all UK employees including Directors with a minimum of six months service and meets UK Inland Revenue approval requirements, thus enabling all eligible employees the opportunity to acquire shares in the Company in a tax efficient manner.
