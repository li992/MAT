REMUNERATION REPORT 64165 p01-p60 Q7:Layout 1 24 3 09 16:13 Page 46 REMUNERATION REPORT Overview During the year the Remuneration Committee reviewed the remuneration policy in order to: Ensure alignment of the remuneration policy with the business strategy and the creation of shareholder value: Drive a culture of share ownership with particular focus on individuals to increase their holdings of IMI shares: Increase transparency and tighten the relationship between performance and reward: and Ensure that the remuneration policy remains in line with current market and best practice guidelines.
The conclusion of this review was that the broad structure of the remuneration packages continues to be appropriate at this time, but in view of the prevailing, unusually volatile and uncertain economic conditions some changes to incentive arrangements should be made.
Taking into account the changes to the reward plan, it is intended that these proposals as a whole will not give rise to an increase in the total remuneration on an expected value basis of executive directors.
A summary of these changes is set out below: Base salaries: reflecting the wider initiatives to control fixed costs across the Group, no base salary increases have been awarded to the executive directors and the other most senior executives for 2009.
Annual bonus: in recent years, IMI has used a selection of bonus metrics to support the corporate strategy.
This continues and the relevant bonus metrics for 2009 will be profit before tax before restructuring, investigation costs and fines, acquired intangible amorisation and impairment, other income and financial instruments excluding economic hedge contract gains and losses, profit drop through percentage reflecting the priority of minimising the impact on profit of reduced revenues, and cash conversion percentage to ensure that cash is managed effectively across the Group.
Additionally, some non-financial measures including health and safety and improvements in ethics and compliance processes are included in the annual incentive plan.
For all executive directors, the level of bonus normally payable for achieving target performance will be reduced from 60% of salary to 40% in 2009, and the level of stretch performance above target required for maximum bonus will be increased.
The maximum bonus potential for 2009 will be reduced from 150% to 130% of salary for the Chief Executive and from 125% to 115% of salary for the Finance Director.
Finally, the power to seek claw-back of bonuses in certain circumstances has been introduced.
Deferred Bonus Plan: changes are proposed in relation to this share matching plan as follows: i to allow a higher level of match to be available on voluntary deferral of bonus: ii to permit executives to make additional voluntary contributions from their own monies up to their maximum bonus potential and iii to change the performance metrics to be applied to the matching awards.
The necessary amendments to the plan are to be put to shareholders for approval at the annual general meeting and are set out below and in the notice of meeting sent to shareholders with this annual report.
Performance Share Plan: in response to the difficulty in setting a realistic three year earnings per share target at this time, awards made under this plan in 2009 will be solely subject to a relative total shareholder return performance condition for previous grants 50% of the awards were based on relative TSR performance and 50% on earnings per share performance.
No changes to the award sizes are proposed.
Share ownership guidelines: these will be increased if the proposed changes to the matching plan are approved at the annual general meeting.
The proposed new guidelines are 125% of salary for executive directors previously 100% to be achieved within five years of appointment to the Board.
The Remuneration Committee considers that these changes help align the remuneration policy more closely with IMI's corporate strategy and will promote the creation of shareholder value during these challenging times.
The balance of the remuneration package is being shifted towards long term incentives and the higher levels of long term performance related pay can only be earned to the extent that management buy more IMI shares.
The proposed changes have been put to a selection of major shareholders and institutional shareholder representative bodies and responses received in the course of consultation have been positive.
Composition The members of the Remuneration Committee throughout the year were Kevin Beeston Chairman, Terry Gateley, Lance Browne, Anita Frew and Norman Askew, the Companys non-executive Chairman.
Bob Stack joined the committee on 13 June 2008 and Lance Browne retired at the year end.
In accordance with the Combined Code, all of the foregoing non-executive directors were regarded by the Board as independent and Norman Askew was considered independent on his appointment as Chairman of the Company.
46 Remuneration Report 64165 p01-p60 Q7:Layout 1 24 3 09 16:14 Page 47 Role The Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration policy and rewards for the Chairman and the executive Directors.
The committee also reviews the packages of those at the next most senior level of management.
A copy of the Remuneration Committee's terms of reference, which was updated in December 2008, is available from the corporate governance section of the IMI website.
Advice received The committee consulted the Chief Executive, Martin Lamb, regarding the remuneration policy and the packages of the other executive directors and senior managers.
It also received the advice and services of the Finance Director, Douglas Hurt, the Group Human Resources Director, Matt Huckin, the Group Pensions Director, Peter Flanagan, and the Company Secretary, John OShea, who is secretary to the committee.
None of these executives was involved in determining their own remuneration.
Independent remuneration advisors, Hewitt New Bridge Street formerly New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, were appointed by the committee to provide advice on directors remuneration to the committee.
These advisors also attended certain meetings at the request of the committee.
During the year Hewitt New Bridge Street also provided advice to the Group Human Resources Director in relation to his review of remuneration for the senior management group.
The terms of engagement between the Company and its advisors are available on request from the Company Secretary.
Non-executive directors remuneration and terms of appointment The remuneration of the non-executive directors is determined, after reference to external benchmarks, by the Chairman and the executive directors.
The non-executive Chairmans remuneration is determined by the Remuneration Committee in his absence.
The policy on non-executive remuneration is to pay an appropriate level on a comparative basis for their time and work on the Board and its committees.
They do not participate in any bonus or employee share schemes of the Company and no part of their remuneration is conditional upon the performance of the Company.
The Remuneration of the non-executive directors is shown in the table on page 54 and was last reviewed in 2007.
Annual remuneration in 2008 was as follows: Chairman 195,000 Non-executive directors including committee membership fees 45,000 Additional remuneration for chairing a committee 10,000 Additional remuneration for the senior non-executive director 5,000 No changes in these remuneration levels are proposed for 2009.
The Board has established a shareholding guideline for non-executive directors, each of whom is encouraged to build up a holding of at least 7,500 shares, or 10,000 shares in the case of the Chairman, within a reasonable period of appointment.
All of the non-executives held the relevant number of shares at the year end see table of directors interests on page 59.
The normal period for initial appointment and first renewal is three years.
The appointment of the Chairman is set to run until May 2011.
Appointments are made under a letter of agreement subject to retirement by rotation and removal under the Companys articles of association.
There are no provisions for the Company to give notice or pay compensation in relation to the early termination of the appointment of the Chairman or any non-executive director.
There is a provision in the appointment letters to the effect that a non-executive director is normally expected to give one months prior notice of termination to the Company.
The dates and unexpired terms of the letters of appointment for the non-executive directors, which are available for inspection at the annual general meeting and at the Companys registered office, are as follows: Date of letter Unexpired term as at Date appointed of appointment 31 December 2008 as a director Mr N B M Askew 24.01.08 2 years 4 months 14.05.05 Mr K S Beeston 07.03.08 2 years 2 months 08.03.05 Ms A M Frew 16.02.06 2 months 02.03.06 Mr T M Gateley 30.10.06 10 months 01.11.03 Mr R J Stack 21.05.08 2 years 6 months 13.06.08 Appointment renewed for a further 3 years since the year end.
IMI plc Annual Report 2008 47 REMUNERATION REPORT 64165 p01-p60 23 3 09 18:20 Page 48 REMUNERATION REPORT Executive directors remuneration and terms of appointment Statement of policy The Company aims to ensure that remuneration generally and incentives in particular provide strong links between individual performance and shareholder interests.
The remuneration policy also recognises that the Company operates in global and highly competitive markets with the vast majority of its activities outside the UK.
The policy is to provide competitive remuneration packages to attract, motivate, reward and retain executives of the calibre required, and to align their interests with those of shareholders by relating a significant element of the remuneration package to specific performance measures.
The Remuneration Committee considers it to be important to maintain the flexibility to respond to individual circumstances particularly in present economic conditions.
However, its normal approach has been to pay salaries within appropriate market competitive ranges, combined with realistic potentials for above market total compensation if performance is outstanding.
Remuneration comprises basic salaries, annual performance bonuses and benefits in kind, pension arrangements or a cash allowance and participation in a deferred bonus plan and a performance share plan.
In setting the remuneration of each executive director, the Remuneration Committee takes into account their role and responsibilities, skills and individual performance and makes reference to market rates as evidenced by published studies and comparisons with international UK-based groups of a similar size and complexity.
In connection with this the committee considered benchmarking data prepared by Hewitt New Bridge Street.
The committee uses such data with caution in view of the risk of an upward ratchet of remuneration levels.
It also has regard to pay and conditions of employees throughout the Group.
The committee has the discretion to take account of environmental, social and corporate governance matters when setting the remuneration of the executive directors.
The policy of the committee is to set performance conditions which are both stretching but also reasonably attainable in the environment in which the Company is then operating.
The charts below show the fixed and performance related elements of the Chief Executive's remuneration at both target and maximum based on the proposed new incentive arrangements assuming maximum investment in the share matching plan and excluding the impact of changes in share price.
This supports the committees policy that a significant proportion of remuneration should be performance related.
The mix of remuneration for the other executive directors is broadly comparable although their maximum bonus potential and therefore maximum matching plan awards are lower.
Chief Executive Chief Executive Target remuneration Maximum remuneration 43% Fixed pay salary 18% Fixed pay salary 57% Variable pay 82% Variable pay annual bonus and long-term annual bonus and long-term incentive awards incentive awards Consistent with the policy on service contracts, the executive directors service contracts are subject to termination on one years notice by the Company or the executive.
Contractual retirement age for directors is 65.
These contracts do not include any specific provision for compensation payable upon early termination.
It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee to limit any compensation which might be paid in the event of early termination of an executive directors contract to the legal minima, taking into account mitigation and other relevant factors.
48 Remuneration Report 64165 p01-p60 23 3 09 18:20 Page 49 The dates of the contracts and period to normal retirement age for those serving as executive directors during the year are as follows: Date joined Date of Date of service Notice period Period to normal Group appointment contract retirement age as to Board at 31 December 2008 M J Lamb 31.10.86 18.07.96 24.01.08 12 months 16 years 1 month D M Hurt 01.05.06 01.07.06 01.10.06 12 months 12 years 6 months D C Nicholas 08.03.04 08.03.04 01.10.06 12 months 6 years R M Twite 26.09.88 01.02.07 01.02.07 12 months 23 years 5 months In March 2009 David Nicholas gave notice that he will retire as a director on 1 September 2009.
Base salary Salary reviews for the executive directors are conducted annually with any increases effective from 1 January.
Salaries are set by the Remuneration Committee taking into account external benchmark data looking at UK listed companies of similar size, complexity and international presence, the executives role, responsibilities and individual performance and pay conditions elsewhere in the Company.
The normal policy is to pay salaries within appropriate market competitive ranges for each role.
Reflecting the wider initiative to control fixed costs across the Group, the executive directors salaries were not increased in the annual review conducted in December 2008.
The salaries for the 2009 financial year will therefore remain as follows: M J Lamb - 656,000.
The committee acknowledges the leadership example shown by the executive directors and other senior executives in accepting a salary freeze.
Annual bonus Executive directors are awarded annual performance bonuses.
Maximum bonus is only payable if the stretching targets set by the Remuneration Committee are met.
2008 performance year annual bonus The annual bonus targets for 2008 related to profit before tax, before restructuring, investigation costs and fines, acquired intangible amortisation and impairment, other income and financial instruments excluding economic hedge contract gains and losses, organic revenue growth and working capital improvements.
An element of the 2008 bonus was payable at the discretion of the committee reflecting other financial and non-financial performance.
This discretion was not exercised for the executive directors.
The maximum annual bonus potential for 2008 was 150% of salary for the Chief Executive, 125% of salary for the Finance Director and 100% of salary for the two operational executive directors.
The 2008 on-target bonus payouts were set at 60% of salary for the executive directors.
The committee has reserved power to reduce or to delay the payment of annual bonuses in exceptional circumstances.
Performance during 2008 was at record levels of achievement and segmental operating profit increased by 28%, organic revenue growth was 5% and the working capital efficiency was improved.
On this basis the Remuneration Committee determined that bonus payment due in respect of 2008 be 115.9% of salary for the Chief Executive, 100.9% for the Finance Director and 84.9% for the other executive directors 2007: 79.9% for all executive directors.
Annual bonuses are non-pensionable in the case of all executive directors.
These bonuses will be eligible to be put into the new share matching plan if the new plan is approved at the annual general meeting.
IMI plc Annual Report 2008 49 REMUNERATION REPORT 64165 p01-p60 23 3 09 18:20 Page 50 REMUNERATION REPORT 2009 performance year annual bonus Reflecting the changing strategic priorities of the Group, and the current challenging trading environment, the financial performance metrics for executives during 2009 will be profit before tax before restructuring, investigation costs and fines, acquired intangible amortisation and impairment, other income and financial instruments excluding economic hedge contract gains and losses, profit drop through percentage calculated as the change in segmental operating profit as a percentage of the change in segmental revenue, designed to minimise the impact on profits of any fall in revenue, and cash conversion percentage calculated as operating cash as a percentage of segmental operating profit after restructuring costs to ensure that cash is managed as effectively as possible across the Group.
A proportion of the annual bonus potential will also be based on key non-financial targets, including health and safety measures, and improvements in ethics and compliance processes.
Maximum annual bonus potential will be reduced to 130% of salary for the Chief Executive and 115% of salary for the Finance Director for the 2009 performance year only, in recognition of the tougher trading environment.
The maximum bonus potential for the remaining executive directors will remain unchanged at 100% of salary.
In addition, the special measures for 2009 will mean that the on-target bonus payout level for all executive directors will be reduced to 40% of salary from the normal level of 60%.
The committee retains power to reduce or withhold annual bonus payments in exceptional circumstances and following best practice has introduced the power to seek claw-back of future bonuses in certain cases where the bonus should not have been paid in the first place.
The executive directors and senior executives are subject to share ownership guidelines.
To the extent that an individual does not meet their shareholding guideline, then up to 50% of the annual bonus opportunity will continue to be paid in the form of shares and a matching award will be made under the share matching plan.
If the individual meets the shareholding guideline, then the taking of bonus in shares will continue to be encouraged through participation in the new share matching plan but will no longer be compulsorily enforced.
The Remuneration Committee reserves the right to apply discretion in awarding bonuses and performance shares should an executive not achieve the share ownership guidelines within a reasonable period.
Long term incentive arrangements Overview The Company operates two executive share plans: 1. the Deferred Bonus Plan which is a co-investment arrangement: and 2. the Performance Share Plan which is a conventional long term incentive plan.
Deferred Bonus Plan The Deferred Bonus Plan DBP runs in conjunction with the annual bonus plan for executive directors and was approved by shareholders at the 2005 annual general meeting.
Some changes to the DBP are being proposed for 2009, referenced above as the new share matching plan, which require shareholder approval.
The main elements of the proposed changes are mentioned above and further details are set out in the notice of annual general meeting sent to shareholders with this Annual Report.
Under the DBP individuals may currently defer up to 100% of any annual bonus payment they receive into shares and matching shares may be earned, which vest after three years, subject to the achievement of stretching performance conditions.
Shareholder approval is being sought to allow participants to purchase additional shares for deferral from salary or other monies to bring their overall annual contribution up to a total amount equal to 100% of their maximum bonus potential, subject to annual Remuneration Committee approval.
The committee intends to allow such a level of investment in 2009 subject to shareholder approval of the new matching plan.
For awards in 2008 and previous years, the maximum level of match was 1:1 for the executive directors and 1.25:1 for the Chief Executive.
For awards in 2009 and beyond, it is intended that, subject to shareholder approval, a higher level of match up to 2:1 would be available for shares that are voluntarily purchased through deferred bonus or other monies.
The current levels of match will continue to apply to up to 50% of annual bonus that is to be compulsorily paid in shares where an executive has not met their share ownership guideline.
50 Remuneration Report 64165 p01-p60:Layout 1 24 3 09 12:49 Page 51 To date, the matching share awards have been subject to economic profit, also known as economic value added EVA, based performance conditions.
The EVA performance conditions attached to the awards were tiered with linear progression within each band.
The calculation of EVA is based on segmental operating profit after tax, with appropriate adjustment for restructuring costs, less a capital charge on the invested capital in the business reflecting IMIs cost of capital.
Further details of the performance conditions attaching to existing awards are set out in the notes to the table on page 57.
Current economic conditions were not foreseen when DBP awards outstanding were made and some deterioration against the excellent track record of economic value added can be expected.
The first DBP awards were made in 2006, and were based on performance for the period 2006 to 2008.
Based on a three year cumulative economic value added measure these will vest at 100% of maximum.
For the matching awards to be granted in 2009, it is proposed that, subject to shareholder approval, the economic profit performance condition will be replaced with a series of performance measures.
The performance measures are: Relative total shareholder return against an international comparator group over the three year performance period as used in the Performance Share Plan and subject to the same general financial underpin as used in the Performance Share Plan.
This will account for one third of the potential award.
The other two thirds of the award will be determined by targets set annually over the three year period.
In the first year these targets include: Profit before tax as defined above for the 2009 annual bonus plan : and Profit drop through percentage and cash conversion also as defined above for the 2009 annual bonus plan.
It should be noted that the use of annual performance targets is only being proposed during these uncertain economic times.
It is hoped that in 2010 there will be greater clarity and the committee will return to the principle of using three year performance targets rather than annual targets.
It is intended that awards made under the share matching arrangements will be satisfied through shares purchased in the market.
Performance Share Plan The Performance Share Plan PSP was also introduced in 2005 with shareholder approval and allows for share-based awards worth up to the normal policy maximum of 100% of annual salary.
Details of the awards made under the PSP are contained in the table of directors awards on page 56.
The vesting of awards is subject to the satisfaction of stretching performance conditions over a three year period.
For awards in 2008 and before, one half of the award is subject to an earnings per share EPS performance condition and the other half to a comparative total shareholder return TSR target.
EPS was chosen as an appropriate measure because it rewards absolute growth in underlying earnings and because the Remuneration Committee believes it works well in combination with TSR which is a comparative measure.
TSR is well understood and accepted as a performance measure for long term incentives and links rewards to shareholder value.
Details of the performance conditions attached to awards granted under the PSP are shown in the notes to the table on page 56.
PSP awards The first PSP awards were made in 2005 and were based on performance for the period 2005 to 2007.
These awards vested on 13 May 2008 at 50% of maximum nil vesting for the TSR element and full vesting for the EPS element.
The PSP awards made in 2006 will vest on their relevant dates during 2009 at 70.1% of maximum 20.1% of TSR and 50% of EPS.
In light of current economic conditions, EPS performance is expected to deteriorate in 2009 and this will impact PSP awards made in 2007 and 2008.
Relative TSR is not an absolute measure that can be assessed midway through a performance period.
2009 awards In response to the difficulty in setting a realistic three year EPS target at this time, awards granted under the plan in 2009 will only be subject to a relative TSR performance condition.
In 2010, it is hoped to return to a mix of three year EPS and TSR performance targets.
IMI plc Annual Report 2008 51 REMUNERATION REPORT 64165 p01-p60 23 3 09 18:20 Page 52 REMUNERATION REPORT The TSR comparator group for awards made in 2008 and awards to be made in 2009 is shown below: Name Country Name Country Amada Japan Invensys United Kingdom Atlas Copco A Sweden Johnson Matthey United Kingdom BBA Aviation United Kingdom Manitowoc United States Bodycote International United Kingdom Meggitt United Kingdom Borgwarner United States Metso Corporation Finland Charter United Kingdom NSK Japan Cobham United Kingdom Parker-Hannifin United States Cookson Group United Kingdom Pentair United States Eaton United States Rotork United Kingdom Emerson Electric United States Sandvik AB Sweden Enodis United Kingdom Seco Tools B Sweden Fanuc Japan SKF B Sweden FKI United Kingdom SMC Japan Flowserve Corp United States Spectris United Kingdom GKN United Kingdom Spirax-Sarco Engineering United Kingdom Halma United Kingdom Sulzer AG Switzerland Heidelberg Druck Germany THK Japan Honeywell United States Tomkins United Kingdom IDEX Corp United States Tyco International United States Illinois Tool Works United States Weir Group United Kingdom Ingersoll-Rand United States Yaskawa Electric Japan Country is shown as country of primary listing.
Enodis and FKI ceased to be independent in 2008 and are now excluded from the TSR comparator group.
TSR is defined as the movement in the share price during the performance period on a local currency basis.
In calculating TSR adjustments are made to take into account capital adjustments and changes and dividends which are assumed to be reinvested in shares on the ex-dividend date.
The vesting schedule for the awards subject to the TSR performance condition is as follows: Ranking Vesting Upper quartile top 25% or above 100% Between median and upper quartile Pro-rata between 25% and 100% Median 25% Below median 0% To ensure that TSR reflects improvement in the underlying performance of the Company the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the financial performance of the Company over the performance period warrants the level of vesting as calculated under the TSR condition.
Where the Remuneration Committee has to make this review on the vesting of a PSP award it has committed to disclose the factors that it reviewed and give a commentary on its decision.
The performance condition for the second 50% of the 2008 PSP awards is based on the Companys compound annual earnings per share growth over a three-year period.
The Remuneration Committee sets the EPS targets in respect of each annual 52 Remuneration Report 64165 p01-p60 23 3 09 18:20 Page 53 award at the level it considers appropriately stretching given the conditions in which the Company is operating.
The vesting schedule for the awards subject to the EPS performance condition granted in 2008 is as follows: Compound EPS growth Vesting 15% per annum 100% Between 6% and 15% per annum Pro-rata between 25% and 100% 6% per annum 25% Less than 6% per annum 0% 25% will vest if compound earnings per share growth is 6% per annum during the three-year performance period: all will vest if the Companys compound annual earnings per share growth is 15% per annum or higher: and awards will vest on a straight line basis if the Companys EPS growth is between these points.
The EPS measure for 2008 PSP awards was based on IFRS earnings per share subject to certain adjustments including the elimination in whole or in part of the after tax cost of restructuring, investigation costs and fines, acquired intangible amortisation and impairment, other income and financial instruments excluding economic hedge contract gains and losses.
Awards under the Performance Share Plan will be satisfied through shares purchased in the market.
Share ownership guidelines Executive directors are currently encouraged to acquire and maintain a shareholding in the Company with a value equal to 100% of their annual salary.
Martin Lamb and David Nicholas were expected to meet the guideline by 30 June 2008 and Douglas Hurt and Roy Twite had three years from their date of appointment to reach the guideline level.
Those executive directors required to meet the guidelines by 30 June 2008 did so although the position at the year end was affected by reduction in the share price.
The levels of holdings in 2008 were as follows: Executive director Level of share ownership Level of share ownership at 30.06.08 holdings and at 31.12.08 holdings and share price and 2008 salary share price and 2008 salary M J Lamb 134% 90% D M Hurt 57% 41% D C Nicholas 161% 100% R M Twite 84% 52% If the proposed new share matching arrangements and changes to the DBP are approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting, then it is intended to increase the shareholding guidelines to 125% of salary for all the executive directors to be achieved within a two year period or, for new appointments, within a five year period from appointment to the Board.
SAYE plan The Company operates an HM Revenue and Customs approved savings-related share option scheme which is open to the majority of the Groups UK employees, including the UK-based executive directors, and allows the grant of options to all participants at a discount of up to 20 per cent below the market price.
Such schemes are not subject to performance conditions and offer tax incentives to encourage employees to use their own money to purchase shares in their employers business or group.
All Employee Share Ownership Plan The UK-based executive directors also participate in an All Employee Share Ownership Plan which is open to the majority of the Groups UK employees.
In May 2009 shares to a value equal to the lesser of 3,000 and 0.75% of each participants basic salary will be acquired at market value by the trustee of the plan in respect of their participation during 2008.
The plan is not operated subject to specific performance conditions but the level of shares awarded to participating employees is set taking into account performance, in particular that of the UK operations of the Group.
Eligible employees are also able to invest up to 1,500 annually in a tax-efficient manner in purchasing partnership shares under the plan.
Each of the executive directors makes the maximum contribution from their salary towards partnership shares under the plan.
Up to two matching shares may be awarded for every one partnership share acquired under the plan, although the policy to date has been not to award any matching shares.
Save as indicated below, the remainder of this report has been audited.
IMI plc Annual Report 2008 53 REMUNERATION REPORT 64165 p01-p60:Layout 1 24 3 09 12:50 Page 54 REMUNERATION REPORT Pension entitlement UK-based executive directors except for Douglas Hurt participate in the IMI Pension Fund.
Their normal retirement age under the Fund is 65, although Martin Lamb and David Nicholas may elect to retire and receive a pension at any time after age 57 without any actuarial discount and Roy Twite may retire at any time after age 60 without actuarial discount.
On death after retirement a dependants pension is provided equal to two-thirds of the members pension for Martin Lamb and David Nicholas, and 50% of the members pension for Roy Twite.
Should Martin Lamb or David Nicholas die within the first five years of retirement a lump sum is also paid equal to the balance of five years' pension payments.
For Roy Twite the dependants pension is increased to 100% of the members pension for the remainder of the five year period.
Pensions in payment, in excess of any guaranteed minimum pension, are increased each year in line with price inflation up to a maximum of 5% in respect of pension built up before 1 January 2006, and 2.5% in respect of pension built up after 1 January 2006.
Martin Lamb 'opted-out' of the IMI Pension Fund in April 2006 and receives a cash allowance equal to 35% of his basic salary instead of accrual for future service from that date, although accrued benefits generally continue to be linked to final salary inflation and Fund benefits were preserved in relation to ill-health retirement, death-in-service and termination after age 50 including where twelve months termination notice is given by the Company after age 49 for redundancy or otherwise at the Companys instance.
Douglas Hurt and Roy Twite each received a taxable cash allowance equal to 35% of their basic salary instead of pension benefits Roy Twite having 'opted-out' of the IMI Pension Fund from 31 January 2007, retaining a deferred pension in respect of pensionable service to that date.
The policy regarding pension arrangements for new appointments will be flexible to take account of the individual position, the cost of pension arrangements to the Company, including in particular the cost of defined benefits, and the alternative forms of pension provision.
However, the norm would not be to offer defined benefits to new executive directors.
External appointments Executive directors may accept one external appointment with the consent of the Board, and are normally allowed to retain fees from external non-executive directorships.
Martin Lamb was appointed a non-executive director of Severn Trent Water plc on 29 February 2008 and received fees in the period to 31 December 2008 of 35,351.
54 Remuneration Report 64165 p01-p60:Layout 1 24 3 09 12:51 Page 55 Up to half of the bonus payments shown above must be invested in the share matching arrangement as described above in the case of all eligible executive directors until their share ownership guideline has been met.
Remuneration shown above as salaries for non-executive directors includes fees of 240,000 2007: 203,000.
No compensation for loss of office was paid to or receivable by any director in 2008 and none was payable in respect of the 2007 retirement of Wayne Whitney.
No such compensation will be paid to David Nicholas when he retires from the Board in September 2009.
Benefits in kind provided to executive directors consist of the provision of private health care arrangements, life insurance and All Employee Share Ownership Plan awards.
All executive directors elected for a cash alternative, instead of a company car.
Sums paid by way of taxable allowances in the above table include cash allowances instead of company car and pension benefits.

2 The accrued pensions at the end of the year represent the annual deferred pension to which each executive director would have been entitled had he left the service at the end of the year.
This is based on completed pensionable service and pensionable earnings at the relevant date.
The calculation of the accrued pension for Mr Nicholas depends upon the benefits he has in other pension arrangements retained benefits.
The value of these retained benefits has been estimated based on the historic information held on our files and as summarised in the schedule attached to Mr Nicholas annual benefit statement as at 31 March 2008.
No allowance is made for the value of benefits that may be derived by the executive directors from payment of additional voluntary contributions.
3 The increase in the accrued pension during the year reflects normal deferred pension increases for Mr Twite, and the completion of further pensionable service if any and the increase in pensionable earnings for other executive directors.
The accrued pension at the relevant date represents the annual deferred pension to which each executive director would have been entitled had they left service at that time.
The deferred pensions increase with inflation so the increase in the accrued pension over the year net of inflation, represents the additional pension built up.
The transfer values that would be payable from the IMI Pension Fund at the relevant date are also shown in the table, together with the transfer value at the end of the year of the increase in the accrued pension over the year net of inflation.
A transfer value is the estimated capital value of the future pension payments in retirement, determined by the Funds Trustee in accordance with the appropriate statutory requirements and, where relevant, with the actuarial professional guidance note GN11 published by the Board for Actuarial Standards.
During the year, the Trustee reviewed the method and assumptions underlying the calculation of transfer values to reflect the changes in the legislation applicable from October 2008, and the Trustees views on future investment strategy, investment returns and life expectancy.
As a result of this review transfer values increased for all members, other than those close to retirement.
Under the method and assumptions used by the Company to account for the costs associated with its defined benefit pension schemes see note 20 to the financial statements on pages 96 to 101, the aggregate value of the accrued benefits as at 31 December 2008 for the executive directors was 6.17m 2007: 7.83m.
b EPS growth of 6%, 12% and 24% above RPI, respectively, for awards worth one, two and three times salary at option price.
c 50% of award based on comparative TSR with an EPS underpin with vesting at median 30% vests to upper quartile full vesting and 50% based on real annual EPS growth of between 3% 30% vests to 12% full vesting per annum for 2007 and 2006 awards and 15% for 2005 awards.
For details of the TSR comparator group used for 2005 and 2006 awards please refer to the 2006 Remuneration Report.
d 50% of the 2008 awards were based on comparative TSR subject to the Remuneration Committee being satisfied that the relative TSR position reflects underlying performance with vesting at median 25% vests to upper quartile full vesting, and the remaining 50% on EPS growth of between 6% per annum 25% vests to 15% per annum full vesting over the three-year performance period.
The award price is the exercise price for awards structured as options and the price used to calculate the number of shares for PSP awards to UK participants in the PSP which are structured as deferred share awards or nil cost options and, in each case, is determined by reference to an average middle market quotation without discount.
Notional gains on share options exercised shown in above are based on the mid-market price at the date of exercise.
The closing price of the Companys ordinary shares at 31 December 2008 was 271.75p per share and the price range during the year was 220p to 533.5p.
