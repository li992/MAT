28 Remuneration Report The Board of Directors presents its Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2008.
A resolution to approve this report will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 23 April 2009.
Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee theCommittee is responsible for setting the Chairmans and each executive Directors remuneration.
The Committees current terms of reference were adopted on 25 February 2004 and are available on the Companys website or from the Group Company Secretary.
The Committee is comprised of three non-executive Directors, NicholasWrigley Chairman, DavidThompson and Neil Davidson, all of whom the Board considers to be independent.
The number of meetings held during the year and the Committee membersattendance is set out on page 36 of the Corporate Governance Report.
Chairman As previously announced JohnWhites retention of executive duties was transitional and during 2008 his executive responsibilities were transferred to other Board members.
As a result the Committee reviewed its policy on the Chairmans remuneration and amended it to be more consistent with that of a Chairman of a FTSE 250 company.
MrWhite has a letter of appointment dated 25 February 2009 to his role as Group Chairman which is subject to a six month notice period.
JohnWhites salary was reduced to 290,000 p. a. with effect from 1 October 2008 and from that date he will not participate in a bonus scheme, receive a pension salary supplement, LTIP awards or other benefits, save he will remain a member of the Groups private medical scheme.
Remuneration policy The objective of the policy is to have a remuneration package which will retain the talented executive team and be performance orientated.
The executive  policy has a higher than typical emphasis on performance related pay.
The Committee considers that the policy ensures that the executive  is in line with market standards and best practice, closely aligning the Directorsinterests with those of shareholders.
The Committee reviewed its policy for the remuneration of executive Directors in light of the current market conditions for UK housebuilders, and sought independent advice from Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS, who are leading advisors on executive remuneration.
HNBS were appointed by the Committee and do not provide any other service to the Company: however their parent company does provide advice on the Groups pension schemes.
In addition, the Committee consulted with the Group Chairman and the Group Chief Executive, although neither participated in any discussion relating to their own remuneration.
The remuneration of the executive Directors consists of different elements of pay and benefits, which make up the whole remuneration package.
The components include basic salary, annual bonus, long term incentive plan awards and pension.
Basic salaries were set on 1 January 2007 at broadly market median levels and increased by 3% on 1 January 2008.
Annual bonus is performance related and the performance targets are set on measures that the Committee considers will align executive remuneration with .
The performance conditions were previously set on profit before tax and earnings per share targets.
As the Companys current strategic targets are geared towards cash generation, in 2009 the annual bonus targets will be based one half on profit before tax and one half on a cash generation target.
The performance targets will be set annually to incentivise executive Directors to achieve excellent Company performance in accordance with both the Companys strategy and market conditions.
LongTerm Incentive Plan LTIP Awards are also designed to align the executive Directors interests with the Companys longer term financial performance and with the interests of shareholders.
The performance conditions attached to the vesting of LTIP Awards granted in 2008 were based on the Companys Total Shareholder Return versus a comparator group of the constituents of the FTSE 100 and the Companys Return on Capital Employed ROCE.
As the Companys current strategic targets are geared towards cash generation, the Committee considers that the ROCE performance condition is no longer an appropriate measure of future performance.
For 2009 awards the ROCE performance condition will be replaced with a new cash generation performance condition.
David Bryant has informed the Board that he intends to retire at the end of 2009 and step down as an executive Director at the Annual General Meeting on 23 April 2009.
It has been agreed that his Group responsibilities will be transferred to other Group directors on 1 July 2009, when Mr Bryant will assume the role of Eastern Regional Chairman, a senior role below board level.
As a result of this change of role the Committee has determined that Mr Bryants remuneration will be amended from 1 July 2009.
Mr Bryant will not be granted an LTIP award in 2009.
Full details of both the quantum of the individual components of the packages, payable to executive Directors and the structure of annual bonus, LTIP awards and pension provision, are summarised on the following pages.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2008 29 Remuneration Report continued Basic salary In view of current trading conditions no increase has been awarded to executive directors basic salaries for 2009.
The basic salaries will be as set out below: 2009 2008 Mike Farley 633,450 633,450 Mike Killoran 412,000 412,000 David Bryant 272,950 272,950 Mr Bryants basic salary will reduce on 1 July 2009 to reflect his change in role until his retirement on 31 December 2009.
Annual bonus Annual bonuses are performance related and non-pensionable.
No annual bonus payments will be made to executive Directors for 2008 as performance targets were not met.
Previously an executive Director could receive a maximum of 100% of a bonus in cash, with any excess bonus being paid in shares which vested in two equal tranches one year and two years after the date on which the bonus was awarded.
Details of Bonus Shares are shown on page 32.
There are two performance targets for annual bonuses that may be earned for 2009, Group profit before tax PBT and cash generation.
The Committee considers that these targets will incentivise the Directors in line with the Groups strategic aims set out on page 6.
The Committee has determined that the total level of potential annual bonus payable to the executive Directors in 2009 will be changed and capped at one hundred percent of basic salary.
For 2009 annual bonuses the Committee has determined an appropriate sliding scale around a target figure for both PBT and cash generation.
Recognising the difficult market conditions faced by the housebuilding industry the Committee has amended the sliding scale and target figures to reflect the current conditions but also to incentivise the executive Directors in 2009.
Mr Bryant will participate in the executive Directorsbonus scheme until 30 June 2009, his annual bonus targets will be pro rated accordingly.
Maximum annual bonus potential for 2009 as a percentage of salary 2009 2008 Mike Farley 100% 250% Mike Killoran 100% 250% David Bryant 100% 175% Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The executive Directors may be granted awards under the Companys LTIP up to a maximum value of 250% of basic salary.
During 2008 Mike Farley received an LTIP award of 200% of basic salary and Mike Killoran and David Bryant received an award of 150% of basic salary.
In 2009 the Committee intends to make awards at 150% and 100% of basic salary to Mike Farley and Mike Killoran respectively.
In 2008 JohnWhite received an LTIP award of 200% of his then basic salary.
Neither JohnWhite or David Bryant will be granted any further LTIP awards.
LTIP awards vest after a three year performance period if the performance conditions attached to the awards are met.
The performance conditions relating to LTIP awards made in 2006 have not been achieved and as a result no shares will vest in 2009 in respect of these awards.
For the awards made in 2007 and 2008 the performance conditions were based onTotal Shareholder Return TSR versus a comparator group of the constituents of the FTSE 100 and Return on Capital Employed ROCE, with 50% of an award linked toTSR and 50% linked to ROCE.
TheTSR performance condition was median to upper quartile performance for between 25% to 100% of this part of the award to vest.
The ROCE target was 15% to 22% for between 25% to 100% of this part of the award to vest.
The Committee considered this provided a good blend between rewarding stock market performance and long term financial performance.
The Committee is however amending the performance conditions for awards to be made in 2009.
Reflecting that the Company is now a constituent of the FTSE 250 the award based onTSR performance will measure the CompanysTSR against the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding InvestmentTrusts as at the date of grant.
The Committee considers the FTSE 250 to be the most appropriate benchmark against which to compare the CompanysTSR, as there are an insufficient number of large housebuilders to provide a robust comparator group.
One half of an award will be linked toTSR performance and the vesting schedule will be 25% of this part of the award for median performance, with sliding scale increases until full vesting at or above upper quartile performance.
As the Companys current strategic targets are geared to cash generation, the Committee considers that the performance condition relating to ROCE is not appropriate in the current circumstances.
For awards granted in 2009, the ROCE performance condition will be replaced with a new cash generation performance condition.
One half of an award will be linked to cash generation.
If the Groups cumulative cash generated from operating activities over the three year period is 85% of target then 20% of this part of the award will vest, rising to 100% of this part of the award vesting for cash generation of 125% over target, with a sliding scale in between.
The precise target range is considered to be too sensitive to be able to disclose in advance.
There will be full details of the range in the disclosure of vested awards in the future.
For grants in future years, the Committee will review the performance conditions in the light of the outlook for the house building sector at that time.
Persimmon Plc Annual Report December 2008 30 Remuneration Report continued Pension The executive Directors are members of the Groups defined benefit pension scheme.
The normal retirement age for executive Directors is 60.
The Committee had previously agreed that an executive Director who elected to cease accruing further service in the Groups defined benefit scheme from 6April 2006 would instead receive a salary supplement of 30% of basic salary.
The Committee considers that the salary supplement is cost neutral to the Company.
Mike Farley and David Bryant have elected not to accrue any further service in the scheme.
However their pension will continue to be based on their pensionable salary at the date of leaving the Group or scheme and they remain members of the scheme for life insurance purposes.
A salary cap for pension purposes was introduced in 2007.
Mike Farley and David Bryants pensionable salary caps are 432,600 and 266,255 respectively, which is below their basic salaries.
David Bryant will remain an active member of the Scheme after 1 July 2009, and he will continue to receive a salary supplement of 30% of his revised basic salary.
Mike Killoran elected to continue service in the scheme and accrues benefit after 6 April 2006 at 1 45th of his basic salary for each year of service.
Mike Killorans service in the scheme prior to this date was subject to the HMRC Earnings Cap and his scheme cap for service up to 5 April 2006 is currently 119,645.
The pensionable salary caps for the executive Directors will increase annually in accordance with their increase in basic salary, up to a maximum of 5% p. a.
As basic salaries have not increased for 2009, neither will the pensionable salary caps.
Benefits in kind Each of the executive  also includes fully financed cars or cash car allowance, membership of the Group private medical scheme, the Group income protection scheme, subscriptions and some telephone costs.
These benefits are not pensionable.
David Bryant will continue to receive these benefits when he assumes his new role until his retirement on 31 December 2009.
All employee share scheme The executive Directors may also participate in the Companys Save asYou Earn Scheme, which is open to all permanent employees who have more than six monthsservice.
Service contracts All executive Directors have service contracts and in line with the recommendations of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, the notice period for each executive Director does not exceed 12 months.
The contracts expire on the Directors 60th birthday.
In circumstances following a change of control or where dismissed in breach of contract, an executive Director is entitled to payments for termination of employment, but in no circumstances will such payments exceed 12 monthsremuneration.
The executive Directorscontracts are all dated 24 April 2002 but are effective from 1 January 2002.
JohnWhite, Hamish Leslie Melville, DavidThompson and NicholasWrigley will retire at the 2009 Annual General Meeting and are offering themselves for re-election.
None of these Directors have service contracts.
Share ownership guidelines The Committee has for some time encouraged significant long term share ownership of the Companys shares by the executive Directors.
In order to comply with best practice, formal share ownership guidelines were established in 2002.
As a result, the Committee now requires each executive Director to hold Persimmon shares.
Mike Farley has to hold a minimum value of shares equivalent to three times his basic salary and the other executive Directors are required to maintain shareholdings equivalent in value to two times their basic salary.
JohnWhite is required to hold shares which vest pursuant to the Synergy Incentive Plan for the period of his term as Chairman, except for sales of shares to pay income tax and National Insurance due on the exercise of the award.
The Committee recognises that executive Directors may be required to sell sufficient shares in the Company to satisfy any tax liability arising on the vesting of Bonus Shares or the exercise of options and vesting of awards granted under the Companys LTIP and Synergy Incentive Plans from time to time.
External appointments None of the executive Directors currently has an external appointment.
Should an executive wish to take up an external appointment, he must first seek approval from the Group Chairman and or the Group Chief Executive.
