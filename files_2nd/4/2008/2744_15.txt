GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS Directors Remuneration Report Remuneration Committee and Advisers Reference is made on page 49 of the Corporate Governance Statement, where there is a summary of the role of the remuneration committee.
Cairns remuneration committee operates within terms of reference set by the Board.
These are reviewed periodically to ensure that the remuneration committee remains up to date with best practices appropriate to Cairn, its strategy and the business environment in which it operates.
The terms of reference are available on request from the Company Secretary.
The deliberations and decisions of the remuneration committee are governed by the provisions in the Listing Rules and the Combined Code appended to the Listing Rules and the remuneration committee has followed these provisions and those of the Companies Act 1985 as amended and the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
In accordance with the requirements of this legislation, a resolution to approve the remuneration committees report will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
As and when the remuneration committee deems appropriate, it takes external advice on remuneration from a number of sources.
During the year it consulted with Hewitt New Bridge Street an independent executive compensation consultancy appointed by the committee on various aspects of the directors remuneration packages.
The Companys legal advisers, Shepherd and Wedderburn LLP and auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, also provided assistance to the committee in respect of the Companys share option schemes and long-term incentive plans.
Advice obtained from Ernst & Young LLP is purely in relation to their independent verification of the Companys achievement against performance criteria applicable to the Companys share option schemes and long-term incentive plans.
The current members of the remuneration committee are Hamish Grossart chairman, Mark Tyndall, Todd Hunt and Jim Buckee.
Ed Story served as a member of the committee during the year until his resignation with effect from 15 January 2009.
Jim Buckee was appointed as a director of the Company and member of the remuneration committee, also on 15 January 2009.
As explained in the corporate governance statement, Hamish Grossart will resign as chairman and as a member of the committee with effect from 19 May 2009 and will be replaced by Jim Buckee as chairman and by Norman Murray as a member.
The Chief Executive is not a member of the remuneration committee but may attend its meetings by invitation and is consulted in respect of certain of its proposals although the Chief Executive is not consulted or involved in any discussions in respect of his own remuneration.
The remuneration committee determines and agrees with the Board the overall remuneration policy for the executive directors and the members of the CEC.
The remuneration committee also determines, within the terms of the agreed policy and having consulted with the Chief Executive about their proposals, specific remuneration packages for each of the executive directors, including pension rights and any compensation payments to be paid on termination.
Remuneration Policy Overview Cairns policy on executive directors remuneration for the current year and subsequent financial years is that the overall remuneration package should be sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate high quality individuals capable of achieving the Groups objectives and thereby enhancing shareholder value.
The package is generally weighted more towards variable pay and, in relation to the variable pay element, the package is weighted more towards long-term performance.
In designing the remuneration structures of the executive directors, the committee takes into account pay policies within the Group as a whole.
Each executive directors remuneration package currently consists of basic salary, benefits, annual performance-related bonuses, a long-term incentive plan, a defined contribution pension if appropriate and life assurance of four times basic annual salary.
The package is designed to support the Groups business strategy and to provide an appropriate incentive to maximise individual and corporate performance, whilst ensuring that overall rewards are market competitive.
Details of the individual components of the package and of contracts are given below.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors takes the form solely of fees, which are agreed by the executive members of the Board and the Chairman, having taken independent advice on appropriate levels, within an overall limit determined by shareholders.
The fees are designed to attract experienced individuals and reflect the responsibilities of the role.
The fees stated on page 70 are in respect of all responsibilities undertaken by the non-executive directors, including membership of Board committees.
Remuneration Policy Proposed Changes in 2009 At this years AGM, in addition to the standard advisory vote on this remuneration report the Companys shareholders will be asked to approve resolutions relating to the adoption of new share schemes that will be used to grant awards and options over ordinary shares to the Companys senior executives and employees in 2009 and subsequent years.
Further details in relation to this proposal are set out below and in the Circular to shareholders accompanying this Annual Report and Accounts.
60 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS Directors Remuneration Report Continued Basic Salary and Benefits Basic salary is reviewed annually by the remuneration committee and any changes take effect from 1 January each year.
In deciding appropriate levels, the committee relies on objective benchmarking which gives up-to-date information on remuneration practice within a comparator group of similar companies within the sector.
Following a review carried out by Hewitt New Bridge Street in July 2008 the basic salaries of the executive directors were increased to 552,000 for Sir Bill Gammell, 402,500 for Dr Mike Watts and 345,000 for each of Malcolm Thoms, Phil Tracy, Jann Brown and Simon Thomson.
These increases took effect from 1 January 2008 and represented the first increase in executive directors salaries since 2006.
The executive directors salaries have been retained at these levels for the year 2009.
Also with effect from 1 January 2008 and following the review carried out by Hewitt New Bridge Street in July 2008, the non-executive directors fees were increased to 200,000 for Norman Murray, 105,000 for Hamish Grossart and 60,000 for each of the other nonexecutive directors.
In addition to this a fee of 10,000 is payable to the chairman of each of the audit and remuneration committees.
The non-executive directors fees for 2009 were retained at 2008 levels.
Benefits available to the executive directors comprise a company car, permanent health insurance, private health insurance and death in service benefit.
Share Options Current Arrangements Details of the Groups current share option plans are as follows: 1.
1996 Second Share Option Scheme 1996 Scheme 2.
2002 Unapproved Share Option Plan 2002 Plan 3.
2003 Approved Share Option Plan 2003 Plan 4.
Cairn India Share Option Schemes Cairn India Schemes.
1996 Scheme The 1996 Scheme was adopted in 1996 and expired in May 2006.
The date of grant of the last award of options under the 1996 Scheme was 1 October 2002.
Details of the options outstanding as at 31 December 2008 under the 1996 Scheme are set out in Note 7 of the Notes to the Accounts.
2002 Plan and 2003 Plan The principal difference between the 2002 Plan and the 2003 Plan is that the approval of the Inland Revenue was not sought for the 2002 Plan.
The 2003 Plan was approved by shareholders at the 2003 AGM and subsequently by the Inland Revenue.
Following the adoption of the 2006 Plan see below, no further awards will be granted under the 2002 Plan or the 2003 Plan.
The date of grant of the last award of options under these arrangements was 4 July 2006.
Options granted under the 2002 Plan and the 2003 Plan are exercisable three to ten years following the date of grant and are subject to performance conditions on exercise.
In the case of all outstanding options under these arrangements, the option holder may only exercise their awards if Cairns share price has increased by 5% on a compound basis over the period from the date of grant of options up to the date they are exercised.
In addition, the percentage increase in Cairns share price over the period must be at least equal to or greater than the percentage movement in the FTSE Oil & Gas Index.
2006 Plan The 2006 Plan was approved by shareholders at an EGM held in November 2006, conditional on the flotation of Cairn India becoming effective, which occurred on 9 January 2007.
The date of grant of the first award of options under the 2006 Plan was 29 March 2007 with a performance period commencing on 9 January 2007.
No options have been or will be granted under the 2006 Plan to the Companys executive directors or to any employee or director of the Cairn India Group.
The 2006 Plan, together with the 2006 LTIP described below, were intended to reflect the fact that, following the flotation of Cairn India, there were two distinct arms to the Groups business namely, a majority shareholding in Cairn India and an exploration and production business owned and operated by the Capricorn Group and therefore sought to incentivise employees of the Group in relation to the arm s which they could affect.
The 2006 Plan enables selected employees excluding those that are employed by the Cairn India Group to be granted phantom options which are equity settled over units in the Capricorn Group see below under 2006 LTIP for how these units are created and valued.
On the exercise of an option, participants will generally become entitled to such number of Cairn shares as have a market value equal to the notional gain that they realise i. e. the difference between the notional exercise price attributable to their option and the price of the units in respect of which their option has been exercised.
However, the extent to which options become exercisable will be dependent on continued employment with the Group and the extent to which pre-determined performance conditions are met over a specified period.
CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 61 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS Directors Remuneration Report Continued All options granted under the 2006 Plan are currently subject to a Capricorn unit price target measured over a three-year performance period.
Under this target, vesting will occur as follows: Average annual compound growth in Percentage of Capricorn units comprised in option that vest Capricorn unit price over the performance period 0% Less than 5% 50% 5% 100% 10% or more 50%-100% on a straight-line basis More than 5% but less than 10% Notwithstanding the above condition, no part of an option will vest unless the notional total shareholder return TSR of a Capricorn unit over the performance period is sufficient to place it at or above the median level in the same comparator group of companies that is used for the purposes of the Capricorn awards granted pursuant to the 2006 LTIP see below.
None of the directors holds any options under any of the Companys share option plans.
Since 1999, the long-term incentives for executive directors and certain other senior executives have been made pursuant to long-term incentive plans and therefore no options have been granted to these individuals under any of the Companys share option plans since that time.
Share Options proposed arrangements Over recent months, significant issues have been identified in relation to the mechanism used to place a value on the units over which options have been granted pursuant to the 2006 Plan.
As explained in the Circular to shareholders accompanying this Annual Report and Accounts, the remuneration committee has decided that, in view of these concerns, it is no longer appropriate to continue with the current unitised structure of this arrangement.
As a result, it is seeking shareholder approval at the AGM to introduce new share option schemes that will replace the 2006 Plan for all future grants.
Further details in relation to these new schemes are set out in the Circular.
It is, however, worth noting that their terms effectively mirror those of the 2006 Plan summarised above, save that awards will be granted over ordinary shares in the Company rather than units.
The remuneration committee is currently assessing how to treat outstanding options that have already been granted under the 2006 Plan.
As and when a preferred approach has been identified, appropriate proposals will be put to shareholders for their consideration and approval.
Cairn India Schemes As part of the arrangements surrounding its flotation, Cairn India established the following share option schemes pursuant to which options to acquire its shares can be granted: the Cairn India Senior Management Plan: the Cairn India Employee Stock Option Plan 2006 : and the Cairn India Performance Option Plan 2006.
These arrangements brief details of which are set out in Note 7 of the Notes to the Accounts have been or will be used to grant options to selected employees and executive directors of Cairn India and its various subsidiary undertakings.
None of the executive directors of the Company participates, or will participate, in any of the Cairn India Schemes.
Long-Term Incentive Plans current arrangements Details of the Groups current LTIPs are as follows: 1.
Cairn Energy PLC Long-Term Incentive Plan 2002 2002 LTIP.
Cairn Energy PLC Long-Term Incentive Plan 2006 2006 LTIP.
2002 LTIP Details of directors awards granted pursuant to the 2002 LTIP, which was implemented in 2002, are given on pages 97 and 98.
The 2002 LTIP was superseded by the 2006 LTIP, further details of which are set out on page 98.
The date of grant of the last award under the 2002 LTIP was 24 April 2006.
Participants have been granted Tier One and Tier Two awards under the 2002 LTIP.
Performance conditions for each are determined by the remuneration committee and the calculation of shares vesting based on these conditions is subject to independent verification by Ernst & Young LLP.
Performance Conditions Tier One A Tier One award is an award of Cairn shares with the vesting and release of all part of those shares being dependent upon the executive remaining an employee and achievement of performance conditions over a performance period of three years.
The vesting of all outstanding Tier One awards is subject to a TSR target that is calculated in two steps, each of which must be satisfied.
62 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS Directors Remuneration Report Continued Step One First, the TSR of a Cairn share during the performance period is compared to the average TSR performance of the companies comprising the relevant FTSE Index the Index at the beginning and at the end of the performance period details of the FTSE Indices used are set out on page 64.
If Cairns TSR performance exceeds the average TSR performance of the Index, then the step one test has been passed.
The step two test is then used to calculate how many if any Cairn shares that are the subject of the award will vest.
Step Two Under step two, the TSR of Cairn shares is compared to the TSR of a share in each company in a comparator group comprising exploration, production and integrated oil companies over the performance period details of the relevant comparator groups are set out on page 65.
Each company is then ranked in order of TSR performance.
Cairns position in the comparator group list then determines how many if any Cairn shares that are the subject of the award will vest, as follows: Percentage of Cairn shares comprised in Tier One Award that vest Ranking of Cairn in relevant comparator group 0% Below median 20% Median 100% Upper quartile or above 20%100% on a straight-line basis Between median and upper quartile In addition, no Tier One award will vest unless the remuneration committee is satisfied that there has been a satisfactory and sustained improvement in Cairns underlying financial position and performance over the performance period.
Performance Conditions Tier Two A Tier Two award is a share appreciation right over a number of notional Cairn shares.
The maximum potential benefit a participant may receive under a Tier Two award is calculated by comparing the increase in Cairns share price over the performance period with |the change in the average share price of the comparator group over the same period.
The increase in Cairns share price if any over the rise or fall in the average share price of the comparator group over the performance period is then multiplied by the number of notional shares that are the subject of the award.
This gives rise to a monetary figure which is then converted into an actual number of Cairn shares using the market value as at the date of vesting.
Where there has been a fall in Cairns TSR, no Tier Two award will vest.
Vesting of the Tier Two award is then subject to a further TSR target which is calculated in two steps, each of which must be satisfied.
Step One This step is the same as step one of the performance conditions in respect of Tier One.
Step Two Under step two, the TSR of Cairn shares is compared to the TSR of a share in each company comprised in the comparator group over the performance period.
As with Tier One awards, each company is then ranked in order of TSR performance.
Cairns position in the comparator group list then determines how many if any shares that are the subject of the award will vest, as follows: Percentage of Cairn shares comprised in Tier Two Award that vest Ranking of Cairn in relevant comparator group 0% Below upper quartile 40% Upper quartile 100% Number one position 40%-100% on a straight-line basis Between upper quartile and number one position In addition, no Tier Two award will vest unless the remuneration committee is satisfied that there has been a satisfactory and sustained improvement in Cairns underlying financial position and performance over the performance period.
Release of shares following vesting At the end of the performance period, 50% of vested shares under both Tier One and Tier Two awards are transferred to participants immediately, and the remaining shares are transferred at the end of one year.
FTSE indices used for 2002 LTIP For the first step of the TSR target described above, for 2005 awards, the Companys performance is measured against the FTSE 250 Index.
The remuneration committee reviewed this performance condition in March 2006 and decided to measure awards made in 2006 against the FTSE 350 Index.
CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 63 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS Directors Remuneration Report Continued Comparator groups used for 2002 LTIP The table below shows the comparator groups applicable to: awards made in 2005: and awards made in 2006.
For awards made in 2006 Burrens performance was tracked up to the date on which the offer to acquire it became unconditional and thereafter tracked the interest rate payable for a short-term gilt.
2006 LTIP The 2006 LTIP was approved by shareholders at the EGM held on 17 November 2006, conditional on the flotation of Cairn India becoming effective, which occurred on 9 January 2007.
The 2006 LTIP enables selected executive directors and employees excluding those that are employed by the Cairn India Group to be granted conditional awards over two separate pools of notional units, the first relating to Cairn India Cairn India Units and the second relating to the Capricorn Group Capricorn Units together, Units.
For the purposes of the 2006 LTIP, each of these Cairn India Units and Capricorn Units is ascribed a notional price.
On any day, the price of a Cairn India Unit is equal to the price of a Cairn India share, as quoted on the BSE and the NSE of India the Exchanges.
The price of a Capricorn Unit is calculated by taking the total value of the Capricorn Group and dividing it by the number of Capricorn Units created for the purposes of the 2006 LTIP.
For these purposes, the value of the Capricorn Group is generally determined by deducting i the value of the Companys holding in Cairn India: and ii the amount of any cash held by the Company that is to be returned to shareholders, from the total market capitalisation of the Company.
The extent to which an award over Cairn India Units a Cairn India Award or an award over Capricorn Units a Capricorn Award together, Awards vests will be dependent on continued employment within the Group and the extent to which pre-determined performance conditions relating to Cairn India or the Capricorn Group are met over a specified period see below.
Following the vesting of an award, the participant will then generally become entitled to such number of Cairn shares as have a market value equal to the aggregate price of the vested Units.
Only 50% of these shares will be transferred to the participant immediately.
The remaining 50% will be held for a further year.
The first awards under the 2006 LTIP were made on 29 March 2007 with a performance period commencing on 9 January 2007.
Performance conditions All awards granted to date under the 2006 LTIP are subject to a relative TSR target measured over a three-year performance period.
For the purposes of applying this measure to any Cairn India Award, the TSR of a Cairn India share is used.
For a Capricorn Award, the condition is based on the notional TSR of a Capricorn Unit.
Under the TSR condition, the extent to which a Cairn India Award or Capricorn Award vests is determined by comparing the TSR of a Cairn India share or Capricorn Unit as appropriate over the performance period with the TSR of a share in each company in a comparator group.
The tables below show the comparator groups for Awards granted under the 2006 LTIP.
For awards made in 2007 Burrens performance was tracked up to the date on which the offer to acquire it became unconditional and thereafter tracked the interest rate payable for a short-term gilt.
The way in which this multiplier operates is as follows: Multiplier applied to determine the number of TSR of a Cairn India share over TSR of a Capricorn Unit over Cairn India Units Capricorn Units that actually vest the performance period the performance period 1 40% or less 75% or less 1.33 80% or more 150% or more 1-1.33 on a straight-line basis Between 40% and 80% Between 75% and 150% Notwithstanding the performance of a Cairn India share or Capricorn Unit against the above targets, no part of any Award will vest unless the remuneration committee is satisfied that there has been an overall satisfactory and sustained improvement in the performance of the Company as a whole over the performance period.
The 2006 LTIP is designed to provide the executive directors and other senior executives with a long-term incentive based on the performance of the particular arm of the business that they can affect.
As such, the performance conditions described above are deemed appropriate by the remuneration committee.
Individual limits The total value of Units over which an individual may be granted Awards under the 2006 LTIP during the period commencing on 9 January 2007 i. e. the date of its adoption and ending on the final day of the Companys financial year ending 31 December 2007 could not exceed 400% of his her rate of annual base salary.
In any subsequent financial year of the Company, the total value of Units over which an individual may be granted Awards during that year must not exceed 300% of his her annual base salary save in exceptional circumstances where a 400% limit may be applied.
These limits are broadly consistent with those that applied under the 2002 LTIP and reflect the remuneration committees policy of placing a significantly higher weighting on variable pay rather than fixed pay.
Long-Term Incentive Plans proposed arrangements For the same reasons as noted above in relation to the 2006 Plan, the remuneration committee has concluded that it is no longer appropriate to continue with the current structure of the 2006 LTIP, insofar as it relates to Capricorn Units.
As a result, it is seeking shareholder approval at the AGM to introduce a new long term incentive plan that will replace the 2006 LTIP for all future grants.
Further details in relation to this new LTIP are set out in the Circular to shareholders accompanying this Annual Report and Accounts.
It is, however, worth noting that its terms are largely identical to those of the 2006 LTIP summarised above, save that awards will be granted over ordinary shares in the Company rather than Units.
The remuneration committee is currently assessing how to treat outstanding awards over Capricorn Units that have already been granted under the 2006 LTIP.
Share Scheme Dilution In any ten-year rolling period, the number of shares that may be issued in connection with the 2006 LTIP and 2006 Plan, when added to the number of unissued shares that have been allocated in that same period under any other discretionary share scheme adopted by the Company, cannot exceed 5% of Cairns issued ordinary share capital.
In addition, in any ten-year rolling period, the number of shares that may be issued in connection with the 2006 LTIP and 2006 Plan, when added to the number of unissued shares that have been allocated in that same period under any other employees share scheme adopted by the Company, cannot exceed 10% of Cairns issued ordinary share capital.
Annual Cash Bonus Scheme Cairns annual cash bonus scheme applies to all employees and executive directors.
Bonuses under the scheme are based on individual and Company performance measures.
Individual performance is measured through the Companys performance management system.
Company performance measures are based on annually defined key performance indicators KPIs.
The KPIs for 2008 encompassed various portfolio growth and operational performance targets, the substantial majority of which were met.
For employees other than executive directors, only the individual and Company performance measures determine the overall bonus award.
The bonus award to the executive directors is subject to two additional performance measures, being performance against annually defined corporate objectives and reserve replacement performance.
For 2008, this resulted in one-quarter of the award being determined by individual performance, one-quarter by Company performance, one-quarter by performance against corporate objectives and one-quarter by reserve replacement performance.
The corporate objectives for 2008 are commercially 66 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTS Directors Remuneration Report Continued sensitive and are therefore excluded from this report, as are the 2009 corporate objectives.
The choice of these measures, and their respective weightings, reflects the committees belief that any short-term incentive compensation should be tied both to the overall performance of the Company and to those areas of its business that each individual can directly influence.
The maximum level of bonus award for the executive directors for 2008 was up to 100% of salary.
The actual bonuses awarded to the executive directors for performance in 2008 are shown in the table on page 70.
The maximum level of bonus award for other senior executives for 2008 was 40% of salary.
The bonus cap for all other employees for 2008 was between 25% and 40%.
The remuneration committee has the discretion to award bonuses in addition to those payable under the annual cash bonus scheme in recognition of particular efforts or achievements by employees, including executive directors.
No bonuses of this kind were awarded to executive directors during 2008.
A similar structure with equivalent maximum bonus potentials will operate in 2009.
Pension Arrangements The Company operates a defined contribution group personal pension scheme in the UK.
With effect from 1 June 2008, the previous scheme the Cairn Energy PLC Retirement Benefits Scheme was replaced with a new scheme the Capricorn Oil Group Pension Plan.
The scheme remains non-contributory and all UK permanent employees are eligible to participate.
The Company contributes 10% of basic annual salary 15% in respect of senior executives on behalf of all qualifying employees.
Dr Mike Watts and Jann Brown were members of the Cairn Energy PLC Retirement Benefits Scheme until 31 May 2008 and of the Capricorn Oil Group Pension Plan from 1 June 2008.
Each received a contribution equal to 15% of their respective annual basic salaries.
Simon Thomson and Malcolm Thoms each have an individual personal pension plan and received a contribution from the Company equal to 15% of their respective annual basic salaries.
Sir Bill Gammell and Phil Tracy each received an amount equivalent to 15% of their respective annual basic salaries in the form of additional salary as their pension arrangements are fully funded.
Further details of the contributions made by the Company in respect of each executive director are set out in the table on page 70.
The Company is also the principal employer for a Small Self-Administered Scheme.
Sir Bill Gammell is the sole member of this scheme.
The Company is not contractually obliged to make any contributions into this scheme on behalf of Sir Bill Gammell and did not do so during the year.
Service Contracts The Companys policy is for all executive directors to have contracts of service that can be terminated by either the director concerned or the Company on giving 12 months notice of termination.
In the event of early termination by the Company other than as a result of a change of control, the executive directors would be entitled to loss of salary, benefits and pension contributions for the notice periods.
Depending on the circumstances of termination, the executive directors may be entitled, or the remuneration committee may exercise its discretion to allow the executive director, to retain a proportion of their outstanding awards under long-term incentive arrangements but only to the extent that any applicable performance conditions have been met.
The committees policy on early termination is to emphasise the duty of the terminated party to mitigate any loss caused by the early termination to the fullest extent practicable.
On a change of control of the Company resulting in the termination of a directors employment, each of the directors is entitled to compensation of a sum equal to his her annual basic salary as at the date of termination of employment.
Each of the non-executive directors has a letter of appointment in terms of which he is appointed for a fixed three-year period, subject to the Companys Articles of Association, which provide for retirement by rotation at least once every three years.
The letters of appointment set out the time commitment expected by the Company and can be terminated with immediate effect by either the director concerned or the Company.
The Board is satisfied that each of the non-executive directors commits sufficient time to fulfil his duties as a director of the Company.
None of the non-executive directors has any conflict of interest that has not been disclosed to the Board in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association.
The executive directors service contracts and non-executive directors letters of appointment are available for inspection on request and will be available for inspection before and during the AGM to be held on 19 May 2009.

Details of the positions held and the fees receivable are set out in the table below.
Position held Fees 2008 Executive Director Sir Bill Gammell Non-executive director, Artemis AiM VCT plc 12,500 1 Malcolm Thoms Non-executive director, Revus Energy AS 30,438 2 Jann Brown Non-executive director, Hansen Transmissions International nv 30,559 Notes: 1 Malcolm Thoms ceased to be a director of Revus Energy AS on 22 December 2008.
His fees reflect the period from 1 January 2008 to that date and were payable partly in cash and partly in shares.
2 Jann Brown was appointed a director of Hansen Transmissions International nv on 16 May 2008 and her fees reflect the period from that date to 31 December 2008.
The Board believes, in principle, in the benefits of executive directors accepting positions as non-executive directors of other companies in order to widen their skills and knowledge for the benefit of the Company, provided that the time commitments are not unduly onerous.
The appointment of any executive director to a non-executive position with another company must be approved by the Board.
In the case of a proposed appointment to a company within the oil and gas industry, permission will only be given if the two companies do not compete in the same geographical area.
