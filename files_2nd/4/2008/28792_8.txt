AUDITED SECTIONS OF THE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT The following sections of the Report have been audited: the Directors remuneration table, the sections on the long-term incentive plan and pension contributions, and the executive Directors pension table.
REMUNERATION AND CONFLICTS COMMITTEE The remuneration packages of individual executive Directors are determined by the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee which comprises Charles Bailey as Chairman, Andrew Knight and James LeighPemberton all of whom are considered by the Board to be independent, non-executive Directors.
Lord Rothschild, Duncan Budge and David Haysey liaise closely with the Committee, although they do not take part in any discussions relating to decisions on their own terms and conditions of employment.
Determination of the remuneration of the non-executive Directors, within the limits imposed by the Articles of Association, is the responsibility of the Board as a whole.
The Remuneration and Conflicts Committee is also responsible for the operation of the long-term incentive plan for executive Directors.
Remuneration Policy The Company complied in the year under review with the provisions relating to Remuneration Committees incorporated in the Combined Code issued in June 2006 the Code.
The Remuneration and Conflicts Committee aims to set executive remuneration at an appropriate level to attract, retain and motivate Directors of requisite calibre.
Any arrangements made to provide longer term incentives will aim to encourage and reward performance and to benefit shareholders.
The Remuneration and Conflicts Committee aims to compare remuneration packages of similar financial institutions to the Company and models its decisions on the median position of those institutions.
In setting policy and making decisions, the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee gives full consideration to the provisions on the design of performance-related remuneration set out in Schedule A of the Code.
Directors Remuneration Directors remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2008 is shown below, with comparative total remuneration figures for the previous year.
212016 RIT R&A pp20-pp39 29 5 08 19:20 Page 33 33 Basic Salary, Salary Supplements and Bonus Basic salaries for the executive Directors are reviewed annually by the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee and the last review was at 31 March 2008.
For the current year, to 31 March 2009, Lord Rothschilds salary is 401,567 per annum 2007 8: 386,122 per annum, Duncan Budges salary is 295,271 per annum 2007 8: 283,914 per annum and David Hayseys salary is 224,968 2007 8: 216,315 per annum.
Lord Rothschild received a salary supplement of 20% of his basic salary, amounting to 77,224 in the year ended 31 March 2008 year to 31 March 2007: 73,899.
This is included in the other benefits figure disclosed above.
The supplement is equivalent to the value of his pension contributions foregone since his election to opt out from the Companys pension scheme following advice received ahead of the pension tax reforms that came into force on 6 April 2006.
The salary supplement shall continue to be paid at the same proportion to salary in future.
For similar reasons, Mr Budge elected for the Group to cease making contributions on his behalf into the defined benefit section of the RITCP Pension and Life Assurance Scheme, with effect from 6 April 2006.
From that date Mr Budge has received a salary supplement equivalent to 42% of his basic salary, or 119,244 for the year ended 31 March 2008 2007 8: 114,109.
The Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee, has adopted an Executive Bonus Plan.
The Plan provides that each executive Director, and such other participants as may be determined by the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee, shall be entitled to an annual bonus.
The amount payable under the Executive Bonus Plan is calculated by reference to the Companys three-year moving average outperformance over the three most relevant total return indices.
The indices are currently the FTSE All-Share Total Return Index, the Investment Trust Net Assets Total Return Index and the Morgan Stanley Capital International Total Return World Index expressed in Sterling.
The percentage of salary payable as a bonus rises on a straight line basis from 0% to 100%, if the average annual outperformance is between 0% and 7%.
Thereafter, the percentage of salary payable as a bonus to Lord Rothschild and Mr Budge rises from 100% in a straight line to the maximum bonus payable under the Plan of 125%, if the average annual outperformance is between 7% and 10%.
Although this was also the basis of Mr Hayseys bonus entitlement in 2006 7, his entitlement under the Plan was doubled during the year to 31 March 2008, reflecting a change in his responsibilities.
He had previously managed a discrete portfolio of global equities which entitled him to a separate bonus on the investment performance.
This arrangement ended on 1 December 2007 in order to facilitate his principal responsibility for the portfolio as a whole.
The bonuses payable under the Plan to Lord Rothschild, Mr Budge and Mr Haysey in respect of the year ended 31 March 2008 amounted to 334,806 year ended 31 March 2007: 174,734, 246,182 year ended 31 March 2007: 128,481 and 250,096 31 March 2007: 97,890 respectively.
In addition to the bonus entitlements under the Executive Bonus Plan, all three executive directors received a 1,000 bonus which was paid to the Groups employees in December 2007 year ended 31 March 2007: 1,000.
Long-term Incentive Plan The adoption of a Share Appreciation Rights plan the SAR Plan was approved by shareholders on 10 July 1996, as it constituted a related party transaction under Stock Exchange rules, given the participations of Lord Rothschild and Duncan Budge.
Under the SAR Plan, participants are entitled to elect to receive a cash bonus.
The amount of the bonus will represent the increase, since the date of grant, in the Companys share price multiplied by the notional number of shares.
This is, however, conditional on any increase in the share price, plus dividends paid, exceeding the increase in the Retail Price Index plus 3% per annum for any three year period between the date of grant and the tenth anniversary thereof.
The Board, on the recommendation of the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee, resolved in March 2005 that the performance condition relating to any further grants after that date under the SAR Plan shall apply only to the fixed three year period from the date of grant.

212016 RIT R&A pp20-pp39 29 5 08 19:20 Page 35 35 Performance Graph In accordance with The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, a performance graph which measures the Companys total shareholder return calculated by reference to the Companys share price, including dividend reinvestment against that of a broad equity market index is shown below.
For this purpose the Committee considers that the Morgan Stanley Capital International Total Return World Index in Sterling, the FTSE All-Share Total Return Index and the Investment Trust Net Assets Total Return Index are the most suitable indices for comparative purposes.
The graph below therefore compares the Companys total shareholder return to that of these three indices over the last 5 years.

However, on their receiving advice ahead of the implementation of new pensions legislation in April 2006, contributions to the Scheme on their behalf ceased with effect from 31 December 2005 and 6 April 2006 respectively.

212016 RIT R&A pp20-pp39 29 5 08 19:20 Page 37 37 Directors Service Contracts It is the policy of the Remuneration and Conflicts Committee not to grant service contracts with notice periods in excess of one year.
