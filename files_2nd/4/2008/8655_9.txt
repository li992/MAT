Information not subject to audit Remuneration committee and advisers The remuneration committee the committee determines on behalf of the board the Companys policy on the remuneration and terms of engagement of the executive directors and senior executives.

Rice Mr. F. M. Everard The committee members have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided.

The committee operates under clear written terms of reference, confirms that its constitution and operation comply with the principles which are set out in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, and has applied the principles in Section 1 of the Code throughout the year.
Number of Number of meetings held meetings attended Mr. A. R. C. B. Cooke chairman 33 Mr. M. Storey 33 Mr. C. J.
Rice 33 Mr. F. M. Everard 33 The committee met three times in the period under review.
Mr. T. C. Harris, as executive chairman of the board, also attended committee meetings, at the invitation of the chairman of the committee.
Mr. T. C. Harris was consulted on matters relating to the other executive directors who report to him.
The committee has appointed an independent firm of remuneration consultants, Hewitt New Bridge Street Hewitts, as its principal external adviser on matters of executive directors remuneration.
During 2008 Hewitts carried out a review of certain aspects of executive director remuneration, which the committee has taken into account in making certain amendments to executive director and senior management remuneration, further details of which are set out in this report.
Remuneration policy for executive directors Main principles James Fisher and Sons Public Limited Company operates in a highly competitive international environment.
For the Company to continue to compete successfully, it is essential that the level of remuneration and benefits offered achieves the objectives of attracting, retaining, motivating and rewarding the necessary high calibre of individuals at all levels across the Company.
The Company therefore sets out to provide competitive remuneration to all its employees, appropriate to the business environment in those countries in which it operates.
To achieve this the remuneration package is based upon the following principles: Total rewards should be set at appropriate levels to reflect the competitive market in which the Company operates, and to provide a fair and attractive remuneration package.
Reward elements should be designed to reinforce the link between performance and reward.
The majority of the total remuneration package should be linked to the achievement of appropriate performance targets.
Executive directors incentives should be aligned with the interests of shareholders.
This is achieved through setting performance targets to reward increase in shareholder value, and through the committees policy to encourage shareholding by executive directors.
The remuneration strategy is designed not only to align with the Companys fundamental values of fairness, competitiveness and equity, but also to support the Companys corporate strategy, as a significant contributor to competitive advantage.
A cohesive reward structure with a timely pay review process, consistently applied to all employees, with links to corporate performance is seen as critical in ensuring all employees can associate with, and are focused on, the attainment of the Companys strategic goals.
qxd 26 3 09 5:43 pm Page 23 James Fisher and Sons Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 The Company also seeks to align the interests of shareholders and employees at all levels by giving employees opportunities and encouragement to build up a shareholding interest in the Company.
Through a series of share plan initiatives, under the UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme, the majority of employees of the Company, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, have the opportunity to take up a shareholding interest.
In September 2008 an offer was made to all eligible staff.
In addition in 2008 awards were made under the Long Term Incentive Plan to certain senior executives.
Elements of remuneration The executive directors total remuneration currently consists of base salary, annual bonus coupled with an Executive Share Option Scheme, Long-Term Incentive Plan, pensions and other benefits.
The performance-related elements, when valued at target performance levels, comprise more than 50% of the package excluding pension benefits.
The committee decided in 2005 that further awards under the Share Matching Scheme should be suspended, and that the Executive Share Option Scheme and the Long-Term Incentive Plan should provide the long-term incentives for executive directors.
Each of the above elements of remuneration is explained in the pages which follow.
Base salary Base salaries are a fixed annual sum payable monthly in cash.
The committees policy is to set the salary for each executive director within a range around the market median for similar positions in appropriate comparator companies.
Salaries for individual directors are reviewed each year by the committee, recognising the individuals performance and experience, and developments in the relevant employment market.
Following the review conducted by Hewitts in 2008, the base salaries of the executive directors and certain senior executives were increased with effect from 1st September 2008 in order to move them into line with comparator companies.
Benefits in kind These principally comprise car benefits, life assurance and membership of the Groups healthcare insurance scheme.
These benefits do not form part of pensionable earnings.
Annual cash bonus Each executive director is eligible to participate in an annual performance-based cash bonus scheme.
The committee reviews and sets bonus targets and levels of eligibility annually.
Subject to overall performance, 70% of the bonus is based on financial targets derived from the strategic and annual plan, and 30% of the bonus is based on individual achievement and personal objectives.
The maximum level of bonus that could be earned by an executive director in 2008 was 70% of base salary.
These annual bonuses are not pensionable by the Company, although the director can use them to support a personal pension.
In 2005 the Share Matching Scheme was suspended, details of the awards made until 2005 under this scheme are shown on page 28.
Under the Share Matching Scheme, executive directors and senior management could elect to invest up to a maximum of 100% of bonus in ordinary shares to be held by the Employee Benefits Trust: provided that the shares lodged are held in the Trust for three years, the participant will receive the original shares, plus additional shares equal in number to the original shares.
The committee does not intend to make further awards under the Share Matching Scheme.
Bonuses for the year to 31 December 2008 are shown in the table on page 25.
Other senior executives also achieved a cash bonus for last year.
Long Term Incentive Plan Longer-term business performance improvement is rewarded under the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, which was approved by shareholders in 2001.
The committee may award shares annually up to a maximum of 100% of annual salary to main board directors and senior executives, subject to the achievement of a performance target, over a three year performance period.
In 2008 the committee set award levels for main board directors under the LTIP at 50% of salary annually and under the performance target, applicable in 2008, no award vests unless the increase in the Companys diluted earnings per ordinary share over the performance period, at least equals the rate of inflation plus 9%.
Earnings per share was selected as a performance condition as an appropriate measure of profitable growth to generate shareholder value.
Other senior executives participated in the LTIP in 2008.
Following the review conducted by Hewitts in 2008 and having consulted with major shareholders, the committee resolved to make certain changes to the Scheme in order to bring it more into line with market practice.
The principal changes comprise increasing the size of the maximum award made in normal circumstances to 75% of salary and introducing a sliding scale for vesting of awards, with one third of the award vesting where growth of diluted earnings per share of RPI plus 9% is achieved over the three year performance period, to full vesting where growth of RPI plus 18% is achieved over the same period.
These changes move the scheme from a single hurdle structure to a sliding scale, with reduced reward towards the bottom end of the scale compared to previous incentives but the potential for greater reward than before for performance at the top end of the scale.
These changes have been approved by the committee for awards made in 2009 and thereafter.
qxd 26 3 09 5:43 pm Page 24 James Fisher and Sons Plc Annnual Report and Accounts 2008 Report on Directors Remuneration continued Executive Share Option Scheme The Company has for some time operated an Executive Share Option Scheme the 1995 Scheme.
Under the 1995 Scheme options to acquire ordinary shares at an exercise price no lower than the market value as determined in accordance with the Scheme rules of a share at the date of grant could be awarded at the discretion of the committee subject to an overall limit of four times base salary.
Details of options held by directors under the 1995 Scheme are set out on page 26.
The options may be exercised following the attainment of a performance condition measured over a continuous period of three years and which demonstrates the increase in diluted earnings per share achieved exceeds inflation and is at least 9%.
A new Executive Share Option Scheme was approved by shareholders in May 2005 the James Fisher and Sons Public Limited Company 2005 Executive Share Option Scheme the ESOS.
The ESOS provides for the grant of options to acquire shares at a price equal to market value at the date of grant.
Options over shares with a market value not exceeding 100% of a participants base salary may be granted under the ESOS annually.
Options under the ESOS will be granted subject to a performance target which must be achieved before exercise based on the total shareholder return TSR performance of the Company relative to a comparator group.
The committee firmly believes that the use of relative TSR as a performance measure is an appropriately objective measure of the Companys success that will both reflect relative management performance and align the interests of shareholders and executives.
The comparator group comprises companies forming the FTSE Small Cap Index as a whole, excluding investment trusts.
If at the end of a performance period, usually three years, the Company ranks in the upper quartile of the comparator group, all of the options will vest.
If the ranking is at the median level, 40% of the options will vest.
No options will vest for performance below median.
For intermediate rankings between upper quartile and median, a proportionate number of options will vest reducing on a straight-line basis.
Options which do not vest at the end of the performance period will lapse.
Details of awards made to directors under the ESOS are on page 26.
Savings Related Share Option Scheme All eligible employees including executive directors have the opportunity to participate in the James Fisher Savings Related Share Option Scheme.
This is a HM Revenue and Customs approved all-employee share plan.
HM Revenue and Customs does not permit performance conditions to be attached to the exercise of options.
Under the Scheme, participants are granted options over James Fisher and Sons Public Limited Company ordinary shares.
Each participant may save up to 250 per month over a three, five or seven year savings period to purchase the Companys shares.
For the 2008 invitation to participate, the exercise price was at market value of an ordinary share at the time the invitations to subscribe for options were issued.
Executive chairmans remuneration package Mr. Tim Harris, Executive Chairman has an agreed annual salary of 332,750 per year.
In 2008 he was entitled to participate in the annual bonus scheme and awarded LTIP shares together with options under the ESOS.
The Executive Chairman is not in the Companys pension scheme but he is a member of the Companys health scheme and he receives a cash sum in lieu of a company car.
Details of the Executive Chairman and other directors emoluments are set out on page 25.
Service contracts It is the committees policy that executive directors are employed on contracts subject to no more than 12 months notice.
In line with this policy, the Executive Chairmans employment agreement is subject to six months notice by either side.
Other executive directors employment agreements are subject to twelve months notice by either side.
There is no predetermined provision for compensation on termination within executive directors service agreements.
The service agreements do not have a fixed term.
If it becomes necessary to consider termination of a service contract, the committee will have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including mitigation, when determining any compensation to be paid.
