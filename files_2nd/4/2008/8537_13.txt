Remuneration policy The Companys principal remuneration policy aim is to ensure that compensation o ered is appropriate to attract, retain and motivate executive Directors and sta with the ability and experience to deliver the Companys strategy and grow the business, having regard to the challenging economic conditions and competition for such people in the markets in which the Company operates.
In formulating its policies the Committee has regard to and balances the following factors: a the remuneration packages o ered to executives in companies competing in the same markets as the Company: b the remuneration practice in the markets in which the executive is principally based: c the need to align the interests of the executive with those of the shareholders: d the performance of the individual executive and of the Company as a whole: and e any amounts payable to executives in respect of services performed for the associates of the Company.

The Executive Bonus Plan applying to Russell Taylor, Neil Jones and Edward Strachan through Kyzyl Tan for the 2008-09 financial year is based upon achievement of a sliding scale of compound growth targets based upon headline pro t before tax as it was last year.
No bonus is payable unless the minimum growth target is achieved.
Long-term incentives In recent years the Company has operated Performance Share Plans and Share Option Schemes as its share based arrangements.
At the time of preparing this report, the Committee was in the process of reviewing the Companys share based long term incentive policy.
Any fundamental change to the policy will be highlighted in the Companys Notice of Annual General Meeting.
Performance Share Plans The Company has operated the ITE Group plc Employees Performance Share Plan 2004 and the ITE Group plc Key Contractors Performance Share Plan 2004.
Awards can be made to executives and senior management over shares worth up to 100% of base salary each year, and under the latter scheme to key individuals who are not Group employees.
It is the Committees intention that the aggregate earnings per share targets as set out on page 49 will be set for any awards made in the financial year commencing 1 October 2008.
This performance condition has been chosen by the Committee to take account of the Companys biennial business cycle and to incentivise management to deliver sustained headline earnings per share performance over the relevant three year period.
The targets are based upon a compound rate of growth in headline diluted earnings per share over the comparable gure achieved in the year ended 30 September 2008.
The targets are calculated for each of the three performance years, taking account of any material events which are not annually recurring and aggregated into an Aggregated headline diluted earnings per share target.
The Committee will, for the purposes of third party veri cation, con rm with external advisers the extent to which these targets are met.
Executive Directors will be required to retain shares of a value equal to 25% of the after-tax gain made on the vesting of awards under the Plans, until they have built up a shareholding equal to 1x salary.

Edward Strachans remuneration as a Director from 1 October 2008 is 37,000.
In addition, Edward Strachan is remunerated as a consultant through the Companys agreement with Kyzyl Tan.
The agreement with Kyzyl Tan was a three year contract to provide the services of Edward Strachan to the Company from 1 October 2005 to 30 September 2008, and is now continuing on the same terms, save for the higher maximum bonus percentage as detailed above, and on a six month rolling notice period.
The base consultancy fee under this agreement for the year commencing 1 October 2008 is 328,000.
Kyzyl Tan is entitled to a bonus based upon the same targets and criteria as the Executive Bonus Scheme, which is capped at 100% of Kyzyl Tans base consultancy fee and Edward Strachans remuneration as a Director for the year ending 30 September 2009 i. e. 365,000 in total.
Under the Kyzyl Tan contract, Edward Strachan is required to reside in the markets where his management responsibilities are based and Kyzyl Tan is entitled to a living away from home allowance of up to $90,000 for its employee for each year of the contract.
The Remuneration Committee considers that Edward Strachans unique knowledge and skills of managing the exhibition business in the regions for which he is responsible, together with the requirement for him to reside abroad, warrants the Company entering into a consultancy contract.
The Committee rmly believes that this contract is in the best interests of the Company.
Consistent with market practice, there are no service contracts or other employment arrangements with any of the executive Directors with xed terms or notice periods in excess of one year or terms which would expose the Company to compensation payments in excess of one years total remuneration.
