Relations with shareholders The Committee is strongly committed to open and transparent dialogue with shareholders on remuneration matters.
The Committee consults extensively with key institutional investors and various representative bodies to obtain their views on, and support for, proposed changes to the remuneration packages of the Directors and senior executives.
Remuneration policy and practice Non-executive Directors The Board, with the benefit of independent professional advice, determines the fees of the Non-executive Directors.
When deciding an appropriate level of fee for the responsibilities taken on by the Non-executive Directors, the Board considers the responsibility and time commitment required to fulfil the role, taking into account the number of meetings required to be attended, the time required for reading Board and other papers, the duties associated with membership or chairmanship of Board Committees or in the case of Sir John Craven chairmanship of the Board, and the significant overseas travel required of all Non-executive Directors by the Company.
Overview Review of Operations Financial Review Sustainable Development Review Governance Accounts Operating Statistics 2008 Annual Report and Accounts Lonmin Plc Remuneration Committee Report 39 for the year ended 30 September 2008 Remuneration policy and practice continued Executive Directors and senior executives The Committees remuneration policy is geared towards providing a level of remuneration which attracts, retains and motivates Directors and senior executives of a suitable calibre to execute the Companys strategic plans but, at the same time, ensures remuneration is consistent with best practice and aligned with the interests of the Companys shareholders.
Importantly, no Director plays any part in setting his own remuneration.
In setting remuneration within this framework, the Committee seeks to give the individuals every encouragement to enhance the Companys performance whilst ensuring that they are fairly, but responsibly, rewarded for their personal contributions.
It also takes into account levels of pay and rates of annual increase elsewhere in the Group.
The Committees strategy is a carefully balanced blend of fixed and performance-related pay geared to deliver over the short, medium and long term.
The Committee also has regard to the significant level of competition for experienced, talented managers in the mining industry, both globally and specifically within South Africa, and the need to ensure that the Company maintains an adequate retention hold over its key executives.
The structure of the remuneration offered to the executive Directors and senior executives and the underlying principles on which the package is predicated are detailed below.
Element Purpose Basis of delivery Base salary Reflects market median levels based on role and Base salary is benchmarked against other UK listed individual skill and experience companies of comparable size and only where Pay is linked to performance as measured in the appropriate a peer group of international companies in annual performance review APR process the mining sector Individual performance and contribution recognised through APR process to ensure market competitiveness Pension Provides a market competitive level of provision with Defined contribution funding or cash-settled salary good flexibility while minimising risk to the Company supplement at executives choice Annual bonus Incentivises achievement of annual objectives Balanced scorecard based on combination of corporate consistent with the short to medium term strategic and personal objectives further details on page 44 needs of the business DABP Incentivises stretch performance Half of award subject to demanding EBIT targets Forces alignment with shareholders interests by Half of award subject to demanding RTSR targets requiring executives to put value at risk through further details on page 45 mandatory deferral Measured over a 3 year period Strong retention incentive Maximum reward will only occur for upper quartile performance LTIP Incentivises long term value creation Half of award subject to demanding EBIT targets Alignment with shareholder interests through Half of award subject to demanding RTSR targets delivery in shares further details on page 47 Strong retention incentive Measured over a 3 year period Upper quartile performance should lead to potential Maximum reward will only occur for top decile upper quartile total reward performance The same basic remuneration principles will apply for 2009.
However, for the coming year, in order to support a focus on crucial shortterm operating imperatives, the annual bonus opportunity will be increased, coupled with a higher mandatory deferral into shares.
Executives will not be eligible to earn any matching shares on their deferred bonus, in order to ensure that there is no increase in the overall incentive opportunity.
LTIP awards for executive Directors will be unchanged.
Benchmarking methodology The Committee routinely analyses remuneration practices in two groups of comparable companies, the first being UK listed businesses of comparable size and scope to Lonmin, the second being direct international peers in the mining sector with whom the Company is in direct competition in the recruitment of experienced executive talent.
The aim of the Remuneration Committee is to ensure that our remuneration framework is competitive with the latter without being out of step with the former.
In this way, the Committee aims to avoid generating excessive reward for Lonmins Directors and senior executives whilst ensuring that the Companys reward structures are capable of reaching top quartile levels, where justified by performance.
Full details of each element of the Directors remuneration packages are set out on page 41 together with an analysis on page 42 showing the various elements of remuneration as a percentage of base salary.
com 40 Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2008 Performance graphs The primary role of the Directors is to deliver value to shareholders and it is against this backdrop that their remuneration must be assessed.
The graphs below show the value, at 30 September 2008, of 100 invested in Lonmins shares five years previously, compared with the current value of the same amount invested at the same date in the FTSE Mining Sector, the FTSE All Share index and the FTSE 100 index, assuming dividends are reinvested in each case.
The Company is a constituent of all these indices the FTSE 100 since June 2006 and the Board believes that these comparisons most fairly illustrate the Companys performance in delivering value to shareholders relative to both the market as a whole and its UK listed peers.

6 No Director received any expense allowances or any compensation for loss of office during the year.
7 Brad Mills employment was terminated on 7 October 2008 and he received a termination payment consistent with his service agreement, and full details are disclosed on page 54.
Non-executive Directors fees The fees payable to the Non-executive Directors are set by the Board and are designed to ensure the Company attracts and retains individuals of the highest calibre and is in line with recognised best practice.
The Board commissions an independent review of Nonexecutive Directors fees every two years, the most recent of which was conducted in January 2007.
Following the 2007 review, no change was made to the Non-executive Directors base fees but chairmanship and committee membership fees were increased.

com 42 Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2008 Make up of executive Directors remuneration The remuneration attributable to each of the three executive Directors serving at the year end in respect of the year was comprised of the following broad elements: Brad Mills Alan Ferguson Ian Farmer 4% 11% 12% 3% 1% 14% 14% 14% 18% 3% 36% 6% 38% 40% 6% 33% 25% 22% Base salary 624,000 Base salary 351,538 Base salary 422,500 Annual bonus 386,880 Annual bonus 213,990 Annual bonus 366,344 Deferred annual bonus match 106,463 Deferred annual bonus match 20,110 Deferred annual bonus match 35,481 Long-term incentive plan 320,138 Long-term incentive plan 119,704 Long-term incentive plan 157,335 Pension 249,600 Pension 103,900 Pension 126,750 Benefits-in-kind 78,743 Benefits-in-kind 28,563 Benefits-in-kind 16,845 1 Benefits in kind are stated at their taxable value or the cost incurred by the Company where not taxable.
2 The cash bonus amount is the pre-tax amount payable in respect of the year and is stated before partial deferral into the DABP.
3 The DABP Matched Award is the matching award in respect of the bonus deferred relating to year ended 30 September 2007 and is stated at the fair value in a manner consistent with IFRS.
However, if the threshold conditions noted elsewhere in this report are not obtained, no payment will be made.
4 The valuation of the LTIP award made during the year has followed the same principles as the DABP Matched Award and is similarly at risk.
5 Pension is cash amounts paid either to the executive or at their option into a defined contribution pension scheme.
Fixed pay for executive Directors and senior executives Base salary Whilst the Remuneration Committee tends to have regard to total compensation, including performance-related elements, individuals inevitably focus on headline basic pay, especially at the point of recruitment, as this forms the major part of the guaranteed reward.
For this reason, the Company needs to offer salaries at around median market levels so that it is able to attract and retain suitable directors and executives but without paying more than is necessary.
Salaries are reviewed once annually, as at 1 October, taking into account annual performance review data.
The year-on-year changes in salaries were 4% in the case of Brad Mills and Ian Farmer.
Ian Farmers salary was, following his appointment as CEO, subsequently increased by 57% with effect from 28 September 2008.
Alan Fergusons salary was increased by 2.5% at 1 October 2007 and was subsequently increased by 12% with effect from 1 July 2008.
Increases in salaries of the senior executives and individuals in the United Kingdom increased by 4%.
The salaries of our general workforce in South Africa increased by 10%.
Senior executives and managers based in South Africa are offered a wage equating to the market norm of total cost to company, with all benefits in kind converted into a cash allowance within this structure.
Participation in short and long term incentive schemes is in addition to the basic wage.
Not including the executive Directors, the remuneration of 26 other senior executives, the majority of whom are employed in South Africa, fall within the purview of the Remuneration Committee.
The base salaries of those individuals based in the United Kingdom and the total cost to company remuneration of individuals employed in South Africa fall within the following bands: Salary band Number of executives up to 50,000 0 50,001 to 100,000 1 100,001 to 150,000 18 150,001 to 200,000 4 200,001 to 250,000 2 250,001 to 300,000 1 Overview Review of Operations Financial Review Sustainable Development Review Governance Accounts Operating Statistics 2008 Annual Report and Accounts Lonmin Plc Remuneration Committee Report 43 for the year ended 30 September 2008 Benefits in kind Benefits in kind for the executive Directors variously comprise the provision of a fully-expensed car, the provision of annual health checks and private medical insurance for the individual and his dependants.
All executive Directors and senior executives are provided with a limited amount of independent financial planning and tax advice, and life assurance.
Mr Mills was also provided with a contribution towards his accommodation costs in London for the period ended 25 March 2008.
Finally, the Company purchases income continuance insurance in respect of all employees in the London office, including the UK-based executive Directors.
Pensions Pensions in context of total compensation The Committee wishes to provide executives with access to market-competitive pension products, without exposing the Company to the potentially open-ended obligations associated with defined benefit pension provision.
Since the closure to future accrual of benefits of the UK final salary pension plan, the Lonmin Superannuation Scheme the Scheme on 1 July 2007, UK-based executives have been provided with a pension supplement, expressed as a percentage of their basic pay, which may be paid at the executives choice as a pension contribution or an additional taxable cash payment.
Ian Farmer and Alan Ferguson have elected for their entitlements of 20% 30% from 28 September 2008 and 30% of base salary respectively to be paid in cash.
Brad Mills elected to have his entitlement of 40% of base salary paid as a contribution to the Companys defined contribution pension scheme.
All employees with a final salary link in force at the date of closure of the Scheme have been provided with a non-bonusable salary supplement for five years from that date, in partial compensation for the loss of the link to future salary growth for their accrued benefits.
Ian Farmer is affected by this provision and receives a non-pensionable and non-bonusable salary supplement of 33,900 per annum.
The contractual lump sum death in service cover has been increased from four times salary to eight times salary for this group, to reflect the loss of value associated with the removal of the previous spouses pension, and income continuance insurance was extended to all employees in recognition of the withdrawal of the facility to claim an ill-health early retirement pension.
All members of the Scheme were offered transfer values during August 2007.
Under an agreement reached between the Company and the trustees, the Company offered to enhance the standard level of transfer value offered by the trustees to an amount equal to the level of funding carried in the Scheme in respect of that members benefits.
This offer was accepted by Ian Farmer and by John Robinson, a former Director who also retained a deferred pension entitlement in the Scheme and payments to their receiving pension vehicles were made in November 2007.
All uninsured member benefits were secured with an insurance company in April 2008 and the Scheme commenced winding-up on 11 July 2008, with all member benefits being augmented by a flat 15% through a distribution of surplus.
The winding-up is substantially complete and is expected to be finalised during 2009.
Defined contribution arrangements The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme, the Lonmin Retirement Plan, for the benefit of all its UK employees.
This is a registered arrangement structured as a group personal pension scheme.
As noted above, Brad Mills was a member of this scheme and the Company contributed 249,600 into this scheme as an employer contribution during the year ended 30 September 2008.
Pensions generally No element of any Directors remuneration other than basic salary is pensionable.
Except as disclosed above, the Company has given no undertakings to arrange or bear the cost of any other pension benefits for any Director.
No former Director enjoys pension benefits in excess of those provided, in accordance with the provisions of the trust deeds and rules, to all members of the relevant scheme.
Life assurance From 1 July 2007, as a former member of the UK defined benefit pension scheme, Ian Farmer has been provided with life assurance benefits of eight times salary, as noted above, as a contractual benefit.
Brad Mills was and Alan Ferguson is entitled to life assurance benefits of four times annual salary under their contracts of employment.
The Company has secured all of these benefits through life assurance policies written as excepted life arrangements.
com 44 Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2008 Performance-related pay for executive Directors and senior executives Short-term incentive arrangements The Committee believes that participation in a short-term incentive scheme enhances the focus of the executive Directors and key senior executives by providing a meaningful incentive to outperform and ensures that the management team is appropriately focused on business-critical outcomes.
The Company provides the opportunity to earn an annual cash bonus through a balanced scorecard approach, assessing performance under four broad headings, being as follows the weighting generally attaching to each component is quoted as a percentage of overall bonus opportunity : Executive Directors Percentage of bonus Actual payment opportunity on offer for for the year target performance % of bonus opportunity SHEC 15.00% Safety number of fatalities at Marikana 2.50% 3.75% Safety improvement in lost time injury frequency rate 2.50% 3.75% Community score in annual baseline survey 5.00% Nil Environment 5.00% Nil Shareholder alignment 17.50% Audited underlying EBIT 17.50% 26.25% Production and growth 27.50% Platinum sales 10.00% Nil Capital Projects Index 7.50% 3.39% Operating Costs ex D&A 10.00% Nil Personal objectives 40.00% 1 Delivery of key projects 40.00% 30.46% Total 100.00% 67.60% 1 Average for Ian Farmer, Alan Ferguson and Brad Mills.
As explained earlier in this report, the Companys remuneration policy is designed to provide a robust link between reward and performance.
This is clearly demonstrated by the corporate balanced scorecard result of 37.14%.
The bonus elements and relative weightings detailed above were selected as these best captured the steps needing to be taken to improve the delivery of value to shareholders and all were capable of objective measurement and independent verification.
The Directors and senior executives also had the opportunity to earn bonus from achievement of personal objectives comprising 40% of the total bonus opportunity.
The average total bonus pay-out for Brad Mills, Ian Farmer and Alan Ferguson was 67.60% of target.
For each individual element, three levels of attainment were set: Threshold: the minimum level of attainment for which the Committee felt payment could be warranted, with generally 75% of the target amount for that element being payable.
Target: based on the Companys budget, at which 100% of the bonus for that element becomes payable.
Stretch: representing a significant level of outperformance and also acting as a cap on the bonus due for that element, with 150% of the target amount for that element being payable.
The scheme design provides for payment for the year ending 30 September 2008 of 100% of base salary to executive Directors for overall performance at the target level with the bonus, therefore, being capped at the stretch level of 150% of base salary.
All results have been independently reviewed including, where appropriate, scrutiny by the external auditors and the Committee has subjected the scorecard to a detailed assessment before authorising payment.
Of the bonus resulting, two-thirds is usually settled in cash and a minimum of one-third on an after-tax basis invested in the Companys Deferred Annual Bonus Plan on behalf of the executive concerned.
For bonuses in respect of the year ending 30 September 2008, as a result of the potential bid for the Company, relevant employees were informed that it was unlikely that the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan could be operated.
As a result of that potential bid not progressing, the Remuneration Committee considers that it would be appropriate to offer participation in the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan, on the basis of the retention opportunity that it offers to the Company, and so selected senior management including the executive Directors are being offered the opportunity to defer a proportion of their after-tax bonus and invest it in Lonmin shares under the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan.
Of necessity, the design of bonus plans will evolve from year to year, in line with the Companys strategic needs.
The Committee monitors the competitive environment and will devise amended or new plans in future years to ensure that the Company can continue to recruit, retain and motivate the most able senior executives, and that they are given the clearest possible incentive to deliver exceptional value to shareholders.
Overview Review of Operations Financial Review Sustainable Development Review Governance Accounts Operating Statistics 2008 Annual Report and Accounts Lonmin Plc Remuneration Committee Report 45 for the year ended 30 September 2008 Performance-related pay for executive Directors and senior executives continued Deferred Annual Bonus Plan DABP As noted above, executive Directors are being offered the opportunity to participate in the DABP, pursuant to which a minimum of onethird of the net cash bonus due to each executive could be invested in the DABP, with the ability to elect to invest any greater amount up to the whole of their net bonus.
The funds invested are used to buy Lonmin shares in the open market via the Companys employee benefit trust.
At the date the shares are purchased, the trustees make a Matched Award to the executive which, subject to the attainment of performance conditions, could enable matching of the number of shares bought by the executive of up to one for one, on an after tax basis.
The purpose of the Plan is, therefore, to provide Directors and executives with a direct personal stake in the delivery of value to shareholders, and to ensure that the interests of management and shareholders are demonstrably and fully aligned.
The awards made in December 2004 were subject solely to a Relative Total Shareholder Return RTSR performance condition.
The awards made in December 2005 and December 2006 are subject to performance conditions comprising two independent components with three levels of attainment threshold, target and stretch and straight-line interpolation between these points.
The two measures are RTSR and Earnings before Interest and Tax EBIT.
These measures were chosen because the Committee felt they best reflected both the key imperative on management and the delivery of operating profit and also provided an equal focus on the delivery of value to shareholders over the longer term.
Further discussion of how the Committee implements the EBIT performance condition is given on page 49.
The performance conditions are summarised below: % of component Year of award Basis of performance conditions Performance conditions Performance of award released 2004 100% RTSR TSR relative to a group of Threshold median 50% 13 comparator companies Target 60th percentile 75% Stretch 75th percentile 100% 2005 50% RTSR TSR relative to a group of Threshold median 50% 15 comparator companies Target 60th percentile 75% Stretch 75th percentile 100% 50% EBIT EBIT: growth targets % Threshold 50% FY2005-2008 Target 75% Stretch 100% 2006 50% RTSR TSR relative to a group of Threshold median 50% 20 comparator companies Target 62.5th percentile 75% Stretch 75th percentile 100% 50% EBIT EBIT: audited profit for FY2009 Threshold 50% Target 75% Stretch 100% 2007 50% RTSR TSR relative to a group of Threshold median 20% 20 comparator companies Target 75th percentile 70% Stretch 90th percentile 100% 50% EBIT EBIT: audited profit for FY2010 Threshold 20% Target 60% Stretch 100% Following the 2007 Annual General Meeting, to improve the retention characteristics of the Plan, a mandatory bonus deferral of bonuses was introduced, commencing with those paid in November 2007.
Where there is a mandatory bonus deferral, such an amount is forfeitable should the executive leave during the three year performance period, other than for good leaver reasons.
In return, the Matched Award is made on the basis of two shares for each Invested Share acquired.
Half of the shares subject to the Matched Award will normally vest at the end of the performance period, subject to the employee remaining with the Group and to the extent that the related Invested Shares are retained.
One quarter of the shares subject to a Matched Award will vest subject also to satisfaction of a total shareholder return performance condition and a further quarter subject to a profit target.
The employee will also be able to apply the remainder of their bonus to acquire Invested Shares without risk of forfeiture that will be matched on a 1:1 basis, subject to satisfaction of the performance conditions.
As reported above, for bonuses in respect of the year ending 30 September 2008, the Remuneration Committee has determined that the DABP would be operated based solely on a voluntary deferral on the terms set out above, save that the Committee determined that the EBIT target would be substituted for an absolute share price target.
The Committee does not disclose the EBIT targets, where applicable, for reasons of commercial sensitivity and because of regulatory constraints but will do so retrospectively at the conclusion of the relevant performance period.
It believes the profit growth targets and the new share price target to be stretching, yet realistic.
On 5 December 2007, awards were made under this Plan to the executive Directors and to a number of senior executives.
The midmarket closing share price on that date was 3258p.
Details of the awards are included in the table of Directors interests.
On 27 December 2007, 60% of the Matched Awards granted in December 2004 vested.
com 46 Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2008 Performance-related pay for executive Directors and senior executives continued Co-Investment Plan CIP The Committee is keen to ensure that it maintains a level of outstanding incentive awards for senior executives that it judges adequate to retain their services in the face of strong global competition.
A CIP was therefore initially entered into with Brad Mills shortly after he joined the Company in 2004 and which vested in May 2007.
A new CIP was adopted by shareholders at the 2007 Annual General Meeting.
In essence, this arrangement permits the Committee to invite selected executives to invest up to 200% of salary or, in the case of Mr Mills, in May 2007, 2.5m with net of tax investments included at their grossed-up value in Lonmin shares in return for the grant of a Matched Award over twice the number of Invested Shares.
Matched Awards will normally vest at the end of a three year performance period, subject to the executive remaining with the Group and to the extent that the related Invested Shares are retained and the applicable performance targets are met.
Should a participant leave employment before the end of the performance period due to injury, disability, ill health or death, the participants Invested Shares will be released and the shares comprising the Matched Award will vest at the discretion of the Committee, who will have regard to the proportion of the vesting period that has elapsed and to the extent that any applicable performance targets have been satisfied at that time.
If a participant leaves for any other reason, their Invested Shares will be released and the Matched Award will lapse, unless the Committee decides to vest or continue part or all of it, on such terms as it sees fit.
For the initial operation of the new CIP, Mr Mills was the only executive invited to participate.
He elected to invest 95,505 shares being a rollover of the shares resulting from the previous Matched Award in the new CIP.
In line with the commitment given to shareholders, the Committee capped the number of shares ranking for a Matched Award at 63,180 shares, having a market value of approximately 2.5 million, and the Company made a Matched Award over 126,360 shares on 21 May 2007.
One-sixth of the shares subject to the Matched Award were to vest subject to continued service.
The remainder of the shares were subject to the same TSR and EBIT targets that apply in the 2007 LTIP as summarised below but with 75% of those shares subject to the TSR target and 25% subject to the EBIT target.
These targets were chosen by the Committee to emphasise the need for the longer term delivery of value to shareholders.
Half of the shares comprising the Matched Award including the shares subject solely to continued service would vest for threshold TSR and EBIT performance and all of the shares would vest for maximum performance, with straight-line vesting between these points.
As Mr Mills ceased employment on 7 October 2008, his CIP award is no longer subsisting.
Further details in relation to Mr Mills severance arrangements are set out on page 54.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP This Plan is designed to ensure that the Company can offer long-term incentives to executive Directors and senior executives that do not rely solely on share price appreciation to deliver the desired benefit, as is the case with traditional share option schemes.
The Committee believes that it is vital to be able to offer such incentives to ensure that those best placed to deliver value for shareholders have a direct personal interest in so doing.
The annual granting of LTIP awards provides participants with the opportunity to earn sufficient reward, by delivering value to shareholders, that they are motivated to stay in the Groups employment.
An award under this Plan entitles the recipient to receive shares at no cost, subject to attainment of stretching performance conditions which are detailed further below.
Overview Review of Operations Financial Review Sustainable Development Review Governance Accounts Operating Statistics 2008 Annual Report and Accounts Lonmin Plc Remuneration Committee Report 47 for the year ended 30 September 2008 Performance-related pay for executive Directors and senior executives continued Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP continued Awards have been made under this Plan since May 2004.
The 2005 award was subject to a performance condition that relied solely on RTSR.
Since 2006, the RTSR condition has applied to 50% of the award with the balance subject to an EBIT performance condition, being the attainment of an absolute level of audited EBIT for the relevant financial year, fully reflecting the impact of metal prices and foreign exchange.
The Committee believes that the two components of the performance condition provide an appropriate incentive to focus on the short and longer term drivers of shareholder value.
As with the DABP EBIT performance condition, the Committee feels unable to publish the targets, however, it is satisfied that they should prove stretching, yet realistic, and there will be full retrospective disclosure, including that of the market forecast range and consensus at the time the targets were set.
The performance conditions are summarised below: % of component Year of award Basis of performance conditions Performance conditions Performance of award released 2005 100% RTSR TSR relative to a group of Threshold median 35% 15 comparator companies Target 70th percentile 50% Stretch 90th percentile 100% 2006 50% RTSR TSR relative to a group of Threshold median 35% 20 comparator companies Target 75th percentile 60% Stretch 90th percentile 100% 50% EBIT EBIT: audited profit for FY2008 Threshold 35% Target 63% Stretch 100% 2007 50% RTSR TSR relative to a group of Threshold median 20% 20 comparator companies Target 75th percentile 70% Stretch 90th percentile 100% 50% EBIT EBIT: audited profit for FY2009 Threshold 20% Target 60% Stretch 100% 2008 50% RTSR TSR relative to a group of Threshold median 20% 20 comparator companies Target 75th percentile 70% Stretch 90th percentile 100% 50% EBIT EBIT: audited profit for FY2010 Threshold 0% Stretch 100% Awards were made to the executive Directors and a number of senior executives on 29 July 2008 when the closing mid-market share price was 2392p.
The award made to Mr Mills was equivalent to 150% of his annual base salary and Ian Farmer and Alan Ferguson both received awards equivalent to 100% of their annual base salaries.
Awards were also made to certain senior new hires on 1 February 2008 and 8 May 2008.
The closing mid-market share price on those dates was 3046p and 3408p respectively.
On 30 September 2008, awards made under the LTIP in September 2005 vested.
Lonmin finished 8th in the comparator group of 16 companies and therefore 38% of the award vested.
com 48 Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2008 Performance-related pay for executive Directors and senior executives continued Stay & Prosper Plan The Committee regularly reviews the incentive arrangements offered to managers, particularly in South Africa where there is severe competition for talent in the mining sector, to ensure the Group is able to provide an appropriate level of reward and incentive whilst remaining consistent with current best practice.
Following such a review in 2005, the Committee concluded that the existing share schemes did not adequately meet the requirements for this category of employees and, therefore, a cash based incentive plan was implemented for the Groups South African employees, the purpose of which was to provide a significant retention tool whilst also providing sufficient incentive opportunity to align the interests of managers with those of shareholders.
The executive Directors are not permitted to participate in this Plan.
When first introduced in 2005, the Plan consisted of two components.
75% of the award, called the performance award, was subject to a RTSR performance condition whilst the remaining 25% retention award was subject to a continued employment condition.
Following a further review in 2006, the Committee determined that a more significant retention incentive was necessary in view of the increasingly competitive global market for skilled and experienced individuals.
The weighting of the Plan was changed to a 50% retention award and a 50% performance award using the same EBIT performance condition as that applicable to the 2006 LTIP award and a similar vesting schedule.
There are no good leaver provisions attached to the retention award and vesting of the performance award in good leaver situations is subject to the discretion of the Committee.
Awards are linked to a notional number of shares which are awarded at nil cost and participants receive cash after tax at the end of three years based on the prevailing market value of that proportion of the total award that vests.
The main award was made on 29 July 2008 to senior managers based in South Africa on terms substantially unchanged from those of the prior year.
Awards were also made on 1 February 2008 to senior managers who had joined Lonmin in South Africa since the August 2007 award date.
In addition, a special award under the Plan was made to 272 senior managers, all of whom are based in South Africa on 28 March 2008.
The need for the special award arose due to continuing recruitment and retention issues in South Africa in a highly competitive global market for mining talent.
The weighting of the special award was a 50% retention award and a 50% performance award using a matrix based on production Pt ounce target and cost unit cost per Platinum ounce.

Lonmin finished 8th in the comparator group of 16 companies and therefore 38% of the Performance award vested which together with the retention award gave an overall vesting of 54% of the total award.
To strengthen the alignment between participants in this Plan and Shareholders, a resolution will be proposed at the January 2009 AGM to enable awards to be made on a share-settled basis.
Overview Review of Operations Financial Review Sustainable Development Review Governance Accounts Operating Statistics 2008 Annual Report and Accounts Lonmin Plc Remuneration Committee Report 49 for the year ended 30 September 2008 Scarce Skills Retention Plan One of the key findings resulting from the 2006 review referred to earlier was that many of the individuals who had been identified as having rare and valuable skills necessary to the Companys future vision were at significant risk of poaching by our global competitors.
In order to mitigate this risk and at the same time encourage loyalty, the Committee implemented a bespoke retention plan, the Lonmin Scarce Skills Retention Plan.
This was a one-off award made to 74 senior managers, the vast majority of whom are based in South Africa.
The executive Directors did not participate in this Plan.
Awards made under this Plan comprise a notional share-based award which is settled in cash provided the individual is still employed by the Company three years after the award.
There is no performance condition and there are no good leaver provisions.
Since its implementation in 2006, there have not been, and the Committee does not envisage that there will be, any further awards made under this Plan.
Performance condition philosophy The Committee considers the appropriateness of each performance condition prior to approving the grant of each award.
With the exception of awards made under the Stay & Prosper and the Scarce Skills Retention Plans, each of the Plans mentioned above uses relative total shareholder return as part or the whole of the performance condition.
The Committee believes that this measure links the actual returns delivered to shareholders with the executive remuneration earned through the successful delivery of our strategy.
In addition, the Committee believes that this test provides a measurable and objective reflection of true performance for shareholders in light of the variability introduced into reported results by metal prices and exchange rates particularly between the South African Rand and the US Dollar.
The Committee also recognises that the underlying financial performance of the business is an important driver of shareholder value and, in order to provide an effective and robust link between the business needs and the remuneration of the Companys executives and managers, the EBIT test was introduced for awards made under the CIP, DABP, LTIP and the Stay & Prosper Plan.
The Committee believes that growth in EBIT is independent of stock market conditions and is a key operational metric by which the business is measured.
The EBIT targets used are based on audited numbers shown in the published accounts of the Company and so provide total transparency and a link between performance and pay.
Where the Group acquires new businesses, the EBIT impact would normally be excluded from the assessment of performance conditions by the Committee, unless the targets had previously been adjusted specifically to include acquired profits or losses.
The Committee would also have regard to the cost of capital associated with such acquisitions, to ensure that shareholder value was properly taken into account in this context.
Performance conditions are assessed using independently verified data.
Relative TSR is assessed by  LLP, acting on behalf of the Committee, using data normalised into US Dollars sourced from Datastream or other independent providers.
EBIT assessment utilises the audited financial results of the Company.
com 50 Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2008 The comparator group of companies The Remuneration Committee regularly reviews the comparator group used for the Companys long-term incentive arrangements to ensure that it remains relevant to the Companys stated strategy and therefore aligns executives appropriately with shareholders.
For awards made from 2006 onwards, the Committee decided to broaden the group to twenty comparator companies to provide a more statistically sound and relevant comparator group.

The legacy schemes expired in March 2007 and, although an ESOS is contained within the rules of the Shareholder Value Incentive Plan, the Committee has not made any grants under that scheme.
The purpose of the legacy schemes was to align Directors and employees interests with those of shareholders.
Since 1994, this has been achieved by making the exercise of options by all participants subject to stretching but realistic performance conditions relating to the delivery of value to shareholders, which must be met before the option can be exercised.
Details of these for the Companys various tranches of executive share options that remain outstanding are as follows: Options granted in or after 1998 but before 2002: exercise is subject to attainment of a performance condition that the total return to shareholders over a consecutive thirty-six month period must be greater than the total return on the Mining Sector of the FTSE Actuaries Share Indices.
Options granted in or after 2002: whilst exercise remains subject to achievement of total shareholder return greater than that on the Mining Sector of the FTSE Actuaries Share Indices, this must be achieved in one of the periods of three, four, five or six years following the date of grant, in each case relative to a fixed base year.
The performance conditions attaching to all outstanding options have been attained and these options duly became exercisable.
Sharesave The Company historically offered an Inland Revenue approved Savings Related Share Option Scheme to all UK-remunerated employees, including the executive Directors.
Under this Scheme, the participant enters into a savings contract and in return is granted an option over the Companys shares to be funded by the balance on their savings account at the end of the contractual savings period.
The option price may, at the Committees discretion, be at a discount of up to 20% to the prevailing mid-market price at the date of invitation.
With the exception of the 2005 award, the Company has historically granted all such options with a 20% discount, including those held by Ian Farmer.
The Sharesave Scheme expired in March 2007.
Share schemes generally Except under the Sharesave Scheme, no options have been granted that have an exercise price at a discount to the market price at the time the exercise price was set.
No options or awards of any kind have been granted to Non-executive Directors.
Directors are strongly encouraged to hold the shares issued to them upon the exercise of options and awards.
Dilution Options granted under ESOS and Sharesave with the exception of the December 2005 award are satisfied with new-issued shares.
Awards under the CIP, LTIP or DABP are satisfied either with shares purchased in the market by the Companys offshore employee benefit trust or the issue of new shares.
Awards under the Scarce Skills Retention Plan and current awards under the Stay & Prosper Plan are cash settled.
The table below shows the Companys current commitment to issue new shares in respect of its long-term incentive schemes assuming all performance conditions are met and all award holders remain in employment to the vesting date: %age %age of issued of issued 30.09.07 share capital 30.09.08 share capital Undiluted issued share capital refer to note 26 to the accounts 156,151,895 156,383,233 The Lonmin Executive Share Option Scheme 523,077 0.33 249,736 0.16 The Lonmin Share Option Scheme 27,034 0.02 12,834 0.01 The Lonmin Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1994 24,973 0.02 19,696 0.01 Co-Investment Plan Matched Award 126,360 0.08 126,360 0.08 Co-Investment Plan Invested Shares 95,505 0.06 95,505 0.06 Long Term Incentive Plan 448,098 0.29 499,972 0.32 Deferred Annual Bonus Plan 109,872 0.07 73,193 0.05 Total 1,354,919 0.87 1,077,296 0.69 Directors shareholding obligation Ultimately, the Committee believes that the most powerful way to ensure that the actions of the Directors are best aligned with shareholders interests is for the Directors to build up and retain personally significant holdings of the Companys shares.
As a matter of policy, the Board expects all Directors to maintain a shareholding including vested but unexercised share incentives equal in value to 100% of their basic pay or, in the case of Non-executive Directors, fees and 150% in the case of the Chief Executive.
In this way, shareholder value becomes a paramount principle underlying all Board decisions, since real personal wealth will be at stake.
Failure to achieve these targets may result in exclusion from participation in some or all of the incentive schemes that the Company operates.

Value at risk Based on the shares and share options and awards held at 30 September 2008 assuming full vesting and having accounted for any relevant exercise costs, the following table illustrates the value each executive Director has at risk and how this component of personal wealth has fluctuated during the year, using the lowest, highest and closing share prices for the year of 2108p, 3718p and 2274p respectively, for illustrative purposes: Number of Executive Director shares Low High Closing Brad Mills 260,596 5,493,364 9,688,959 5,925,953 Ian Farmer 35,821 755,107 1,331,825 814,570 Alan Ferguson 5,790 122,053 215,272 131,665 Number of Executive Director options awards Low High Closing Brad Mills 331,224 6,982,202 12,314,908 7,532,034 1 Ian Farmer 64,029 1,333,213 2,364,080 1,439,501 Alan Ferguson 26,939 567,874 1,001,592 612,593 1 Ian Farmers interests comprise 2,343 shares at an exercise price of 705p Non-Group directorships Save as noted below, no executive Director holds any executive directorship or appointment outside the Group.
It is both the Companys policy and generally a requirement of the individuals contract of employment that no executive Director may take up such an appointment without the approval of the Board.
The Board believes that, in the right circumstances, the holding of non-executive directorships and similar appointments by executive Directors can be useful and appropriate if they help those involved gain additional skills and experience or promote the interests of the Group and do not necessitate an excessive time commitment.
com 54 Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 30 September 2008 Non-Group directorships continued The Board would not normally agree to an executive Director taking on more than one non-executive directorship of a FTSE 100 company or the chairmanship of such a company.
Whilst it would be considered on a case-by-case basis, any individual holding such a role outside the Group would generally be permitted to retain any fees or other payments relating to that appointment.
Ian Farmer was a non-executive director of Incwala Resources Pty Limited for the year under review and is a director and former president of the International Platinum Association.
Brad Mills was appointed Chairman of the International Council on Mining and Metals in October 2007.
Neither Mr Mills or Mr Farmer received any remuneration in respect of their services to these organisations.
Service contracts The Company complies fully with the provisions of the Combined Code relating to service contracts.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for settling any payment to be made when an executive Directors employment ends and has full regard to the provisions of the Combined Code and other components of best practice in this area.
Severance arrangements Brad Mills employment with the Company terminated on 7 October 2008 and he ceased to be a Director on 9 October 2008.
Under the termination provisions of his contract of employment, Mr Mills received a payment of 1,365,491 less legally required deductions on the termination of his employment and a further payment of 386,880 less legally required deductions in respect of bonus for the financial year ended 30 September 2008.
These payments were made in lieu of those which would have been received by Mr Mills during his contractual notice period and, as such, the Company was bound to make these payments without reduction.
Mr Mills also participated in a number of share-settled incentive and retention schemes.
Following extensive discussions, and taking into account the performance of the Company and the length of time that awards had been held, the Remuneration Committee resolved that Mr Mills would receive 165,000 shares in the Company and a cash payment of 191,000, in each case subject to applicable taxation and other deductions.
These amounts represented the vesting proportions applied to each of Mr Mills awards and a cash payment in respect of dividend equivalents on the shares which vested and other cash-settled matters.
Mr Mills requested, and the Remuneration Committee agreed, that the cash sum in lieu of dividends be reduced and the number of shares increased by an equivalent amount, and these variations are included in the figures above.
The agreed vesting levels resulted in Mr Mills forfeiting over half of the awards which had been made to him under the incentive and retention schemes.
Full details of Mr Mills share awards are set out in the table on page 52.
Directors service contracts and letters of appointment Director Date of contract letter Unexpired term Termination arrangements Executive Directors Brad Mills 4 February 2004 Rolling contract Contract terminable on expiry of 12 months notice amended 19 November 2004 from the Company and 6 months notice from Brad Mills.
