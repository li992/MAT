NORTHUMBRIAN WATER GROUP PLC 46 ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2008 Directors remuneration report Information not requiring audit The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee of the Board the Committee determines the remuneration and terms of employment of the Chairman of the Company, executive directors of NWG and NWL and a further seven senior managers, in accordance with a remuneration policy approved by the Board.
The Committee pays particular attention to the remuneration of senior executives who are not board members.
The terms of reference for the Committee are published on NWGs website in the about us: corporate governance section or a copy can be requested from the Company Secretary.
The Committee members are Martin Ngre Chairman, Sir Patrick Brown, Alex Scott-Barrett, who are all considered by the Company to be independent, and Sir Derek Wanless.
The membership of the Committee was therefore, compliant with the Combined Code throughout the year.
The Committee met three times during the year with 100% attendance by all members.
As the Committee works closely with NWLs Remuneration Committee, Committee papers and minutes are circulated to all NWL and NWG non-executive directors, who can give their views direct to the Committee Chairman and can attend meetings if they wish.
The Committee again received advice during the year from Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS and also from the Managing Director although never about his own remuneration.
HNBS continues to assist the Committee in maintaining best practice in relation to remuneration.
HNBS does not provide any other service to the Company.
The Committee is always available to engage with major shareholders and their representatives to discuss remuneration matters, although no such approaches have been received.
During the year the Committee: agreed bonuses for 2006 07: agreed salaries for 2008 09: decided the vesting percentage to be applied to the LTIP awards made on 22 December 2004, which vested on 22 December 2007: granted LTIP awards on 13 December 2007 to vest in December 2010 : and set performance targets for executive directors and senior managers.
Remuneration policy The Committee considers the principles and provisions of the Combined Code when setting its policy and believes it is fully compliant.
The policy of the Company, which applied throughout 2007 08 and applies for 2008 09 and subsequent financial years, is to provide remuneration that is sufficient to attract, retain and motivate directors of the quality required to run the Company successfully, whilst paying fairly.
Although HNBS provides the Committee with detailed comparative data on other companies in the sector, the Committee is aware of, and avoids the risk of, remuneration being ratcheted up as a result of benchmarking exercises.
For example, when reviewing the pay practices of water companies this year, it noted that the market level of annual bonus had increased, but it has not followed suit and increased annual bonus potential at NWG.
Consistent with its fair pay policy, when considering the remuneration packages of senior executives and directors, the Committee takes into account pay awards to other employees in the Group.
The Committee also considers environmental, social and governance issues when setting remuneration terms.
The remuneration policy of the Committee is: that the setting of base salaries is largely influenced by individual contributions and internal relativities rather than external comparators: the annual bonus plan recognises the interests of all of the Companys stakeholders shareholders, customers and employees rather than being focused solely on profit: and management shares in the longer term value created for the Companys investors, but equity incentive schemes should only reward if there is clear outperformance of the market and other relevant companies.
NORTHUMBRIAN WATER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2008 47 Elements of remuneration The remuneration of the executive directors comprises basic salary and benefits, including pension and participation in the Companys SIP, all of which are fixed pay, and a performance related annual bonus and LTIP awards.
The relative importance of the fixed and variable performance related elements is monitored and, while the Committee recognises the importance of the performance related elements, it has not created a scenario where high levels of incentive pay promote risk taking in order to secure personal reward.
For executive directors in 2008 09, on-target annual bonus is 35% of salary and the expected value of longer term incentives is 55% of salary.
This is not a small sum, but it is less than the executive directors total fixed pay.
Basic salary and benefits The basic salaries paid to each director during the year are set out in Table 1 on page 51.
Data received from HNBS over the years has consistently indicated that the Managing Directors basic salary is significantly less than the market rate paid to his counterparts at other quoted water companies.
When defining the market rate, the Committee has regard to the comparator groups market capitalisation, turnover and complexity and adjustments are made to ensure that an appropriate comparison is made.
However, John Cuthbert declined the Committees proposed salary increase in 2006 and 2007.
This year he has accepted an increase and, as from 1 April 2008, his annual basic salary is 295,000 previously 270,000.
Chris Greens salary, from 1 April, was increased to 225,000 from 210,000 and, again, it was noted by the Committee that this is still below the market rate.
Benefits provided to the executive directors include membership of a defined benefit pension scheme, car allowance and healthcare.
Pensions The main features of the Northumbrian Water Pension Scheme are set out in note 25 to the financial statements.
Basic salary is the only pensionable element of the executive directors remuneration packages.
The executive directors pensions were modified with effect from 1 January 2008, in line with the changes proposed for the pension scheme as a whole, and the executive pension arrangements were closed to new entrants on that date.
The accrued defined benefit pensions and corresponding transfer values for the executive directors are set out in Table 6 on page 54.
Annual bonus Since 2005 06, the annual bonus plan reflects the interests of all of the Companys stakeholders.
Maximum annual bonus potential for the executive directors for 2008 09 continues to be 70% of salary, which is apportioned as follows: Maximum bonus available as a Stakeholder Bonus metric % of salary Shareholders Profit before tax PBT 40 Customers Overall Performance Assessment OPA rating 5 Employees Percentage lost time through sickness 5 Bespoke personal targets 20 Total 70 The PBT bonus is based on actual PBT performance compared to the budget PBT set by the Board at the beginning of the year.
PBT has been chosen because it is a primary financial measure for the Company, for which the executive directors are accountable.
In 2007 08, PBT of 170.3 million was higher than the budget and, consequently, 29% out of the maximum 40% allocated to PBT is payable.
NWLs estimated OPA score for 2007 08 is 345, against a range for bonus purposes of 342 to 413, being the published range of performance across the ten water and sewerage companies in 2006 07.
NWLs score was adversely affected by sewer flooding caused by severe weather conditions and, as a consequence, no bonus is payable in respect of the OPA rating.
The year end percentage of time lost through sickness was 3.25%, against a target of 2.95%.
No bonus was therefore payable in respect of this metric.
NORTHUMBRIAN WATER GROUP PLC 48 ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2008 Directors remuneration report continued In 2007 08, John Cuthberts personal targets related principally to maintaining key financial ratios and measures, ensuring that good relationships are maintained with major investors, ensuring proper implementation of reporting under the Transparency Directive, implementing pension scheme changes and succession planning.
Chris Greens personal targets were focused mainly on the maintenance of key financial ratios and measures, relationships with major investors and analysts, disposal of surplus properties and upgrading financial systems.
Taking account of performance against personal targets and the OPA, PBT and lost time performance, bonuses equal to 47% of basic salary were approved for payment to John Cuthbert and Chris Green.
Bonus payments are included in Table 1 on page 51.
The Committee is aware of Guideline 3.2 of the ABI Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure and is satisfied that neither the executive directors annual bonus targets nor the LTIP performance conditions are likely, inadvertently, to motivate irresponsible behaviour.
LTIP Under the LTIP, executive directors and senior managers may receive, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, annual conditional awards of shares in the Company.
All awards have three year pre-vesting performance conditions.
These are described in detail below but, in summary, the current policy is for half of an award to be subject to relative total shareholder return performance against the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts and the other half to be subject to a relative return on capital target as monitored by Ofwat.
At last years AGM, shareholders approved an increase in the maximum individual award that can be made under the LTIP.
It is now an award over shares worth 100% of annual salary at grant, but only the executive directors participate at this level.
Full details of the levels of award and performance conditions are shown in Table 2 on page 52.
The Remuneration Committee, with advice from HNBS, has reviewed the LTIP and is still of the view that it remains the most appropriate equity incentive plan, particularly in the light of the Companys dividend policy.
Total shareholder return TSR remains an appropriate performance measure because it ensures that executives are rewarded fairly for value created for the Companys investors.
Relative return on capital employed was chosen as a complementary measure because: it directly compares NWLs financial performance against that of its peers: it is objectively measured and verified by a third party Ofwat : there is no subjectivity in determining what level of return would be a good and excellent result it being a relative measure to which quartile analysis is applied : and the comparative approach should be able to deal with the five year pricing reviews without the Remuneration Committee having to reset targets.
For the awards granted on 13 December 2007, the three years to be reviewed are 2007 08, 2008 09 and 2009 10.
Over the three year performance period, the return on capital employed will be calculated on a compounded annualised return basis.
In addition, awards will only vest if the Committee is satisfied that the Companys TSR performance is consistent with the underlying business performance of the Company.
An independent firm is engaged by the Committee to calculate the TSRs and to assess the extent to which the performance conditions have been met, so that the process is rigorous and transparent.
In the event of a change of control, the Committee would determine the extent to which the performance conditions had been met and the proportion of the performance period that had elapsed in deciding whether or not any vesting of awards would take place.
The LTIP award, granted on 22 December 2004, became available to vest on 22 December 2007.
The Committee instructed  PwC to assess the level of vesting of this award.
PwC reported that 73% of the award was available to vest being 100% of the award relating to the Companys TSR performance against the FTSE 250 Index and 60% of the award relating to the Companys TSR performance against the other listed water companies.
Prior to vesting, the Committee satisfied itself that the recorded TSR performance was a genuine reflection of the Companys underlying performance.
Details of the number of awards which lapsed and those which were exercised by the directors of the Company are shown in Table 3 on page 53.
NORTHUMBRIAN WATER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2008 49 Non-executive directors fees The Companys remuneration policy is that the Chairman and the non-executive directors should receive a fixed fee for their normal duties.
Reflecting the added responsibilities and time commitment, chairing the Remuneration and Audit Committees attracts an additional fee over the non-executive directors standard base fee.
Fees payable during 2007 08 and the Companys policy from 1 April 2008 are: 2007 08 Policy for fee 2008 09 Chairman 150,000 157,500 Non-executive director base fee 35,000 36,750 Audit Committee chairing fee 10,000 10,500 Remuneration Committee chairing fee 5,000 5,250 The Chairman and the non-executive directors do not receive benefits in kind and do not participate in bonus, pension or share schemes operated by the Company.
Details of non-executive directors remuneration are set out in Table 1 on page 51.
Directors interests in LTIP awards The directors conditional interests in the ordinary 10 pence shares of the Company, awarded in accordance with the terms of the LTIP as at 31 March 2008, are set out in Table 3 on page 53.
Ordinary 10 pence shares required to fulfil LTIP awards which have vested may be provided by the Northumbrian Water Group plc Employee Trust, through Northumbrian Water Share Scheme Trustees Limited.
The Trustees are Sir Patrick Brown, Martin Ngre and Anita Frew a non-executive director of NWL.
At 31 March 2008, the Trust held a total of 443,507 ordinary 10 pence shares.
This represents 0.08% of the Companys total issued share capital, so is materially less than the 5% restriction on shares that can be held in trust.
In line with the ABI Guidelines, dividends are waived on these shares and the voting rights attached to these shares will not be exercised at the AGM.
Share dilution The Companys share plans contain dilution limits that comply with the ABI Guidelines.
Shares for both the LTIP and SIP schemes are provided by purchase on the market.
There has, therefore, been no dilution to date and there is no commitment to issue new shares in relation to either scheme.
Performance graph The TSR performance graph is shown at Table 4 on page 53.
Service contracts All non-executive directors are appointed for a term of 12 months with a six month notice period for the Company and the director.
The executive directors have service contracts with 12 months notice periods and which expire when the directors reach normal retirement age.
Details of the contracts of the executive and non-executive directors who served during the year are shown in Table 5 on page 54.
Terms and conditions of appointment of non-executive directors are available for inspection at the Companys registered office during normal business hours and at the AGM.
The terms of appointment set out the expected time commitment for each non-executive director.
External appointments of executive directors The Boards position on external appointments is described in the corporate governance report on page 41.
To date, no fees for external appointments have been retained by executive directors.
Directors interests in shares The directors beneficial interests in the ordinary 10 pence shares of the Company, as at 31 March 2008, are set out in Table 7 on page 55.

Actual grants to executive directors related to shares worth 40% of salary.
Performance conditions Comparison of TSR with two comparator groups over three years: 1 70% of award depends on the Companys TSR performance against other listed water companies: AWG plc, Bristol Water Group plc, East Surrey Holdings plc, Kelda Group plc, Pennon Group plc, Severn Trent plc and United Utilities plc: and 2 30% of award depends on the Companys TSR performance against the FTSE 250 Index, excluding investment trusts.
East Surrey Holdings plc fide-listed on 28 October 2005 and Bristol Water Group plc fide-listed on 18 May 2006.
AWG plc fide-listed on 21 December 2006.
These companies have been left in the comparator group for the purpose of the awards and their performance was frozen on the date each company fide-listed.
This means that a constant TSR has been applied at each date after the fide-listing.
Vesting schedules 1 30% vests at median performance with sliding scale based on ranking to 100% if the Company tops the group.
Where the Companys TSR performance is below the median performance of the comparator group, none of that element of the award will vest.
2 30% vests if the Companys TSR equals the FTSE 250 Index, increasing to 100% if the Companys TSR outperforms the Index by at least 6%.
Where the Companys TSR performance is less than that of the Index, none of that element of the award will vest.

The service contracts of the executive directors do not contain provisions relating to compensation for termination.
In the event of termination by the Company, the Remuneration Committee would make recommendations to the Board on what payments, if any, should be made to the director, depending on the circumstances of the termination, and taking into account the provisions of the Combined Code discouraging payment for failure.
The Company would also expect directors to seek to mitigate their loss.
Contracts do not provide for compensation for loss of office in excess of fees accrued.
