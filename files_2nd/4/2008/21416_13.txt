Directors remuneration report Consideration of matters relating to directors remuneration The remuneration policy is set by the board and is described below.
Individual remuneration packages of executive directors and the chairman are determined by the remuneration committee within the framework of this policy.
The remuneration committee consists of the non-executive directors and during the year the members included Dudley Fishburn as the chairman, Andy Pomfret, Dan Jones and Gordon Hamilton.
The company views each of these directors as independent.
The committee met four times during the year.
The committee receives advice from a variety of sources on issues where it considers it appropriate.
Hewitt New Bridge Street advised the committee on ongoing issues.
The committee also calls on specialist advice from a variety of additional sources including Bluen Advisory Services Limited for pensions advice, Watson Wyatt publications for salary data, Equiniti for employee share incentives matters, and internal advisers including the chief executive and the company secretary who present to the committee on specic issues.
Remuneration policy statement The directors believe that performance-related remuneration is an essential motivation to management and staff, and this policy will form the basis for determining executive directors remuneration for the current and forthcoming financial years.
The general philosophy underlying the reward strategy for executive directors is the same as that applied to all other employees.
Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the company and data on comparable positions in other similar organisations are taken into consideration when determining executive directors remuneration.
The companys policy is to remunerate the executive directors and other management fairly in such a manner as to facilitate the recruitment, retention and motivation of suitably qualied personnel.
The Talent Management function has an input into the design of the remuneration arrangements and the operational risk is taken into account when setting performance targets.
The measurement of the executive directors performance and the determination of their annual remuneration package is undertaken by the remuneration committee.
The main elements of the remuneration package payable under the service agreement of each executive director comprise basic salary, short-term incentive payments, pension contributions, share-based incentives and other benets.
Other benets include private medical insurance for the director and his immediate family, permanent health insurance, death in service benefit at four times annual salary, accident and travel insurance, healthclub membership, season ticket, car parking and the provision of either a company car or a monthly car allowance.
In line with Lloyds market practice, there are no upper limits on the amounts payable to individuals under short-term incentives.
The committee has considered whether it is appropriate to set an upper limit and has agreed that such a limit would adversely affect the companys competitive position and would not be in the interests of shareholders.
The incentive payments, which comprise short-term incentive payments and share incentive plans, are awarded on a discretionary basis and are determined by the committee in respect of performance of both the individual and the company.
The main factor inuencing bonus share awards is the return on equity of the group.
The policy is to ensure that a material proportion of each executive directors overall remuneration is performance-based to align executive directors interests with those of shareholders.
Therefore, as the return on equity of the group has reduced this year, the committee reected this in the bonus payments made to directors in relation to 2008 which are lower than in previous years.
The board, on a bi-annual basis, determines the remuneration of the non-executive directors with details set out below.
No director plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
The directors believe that a key element of the remuneration strategy is the share incentive plans that further align the interests of participants in the plans with shareholders interests.
Entitlements under certain plans are subject to the achievement of performance conditions as described below under share incentive plans.
Traditionally, Lloyds underwriters participated in the provision of their personal capital to syndicates in which they worked.
With the move to corporate provision of capital, individual membership of Lloyds has declined dramatically.
The committee feels that having personal capital at risk in the syndicate is an important part of the remuneration policy and provides a healthy counterbalance to incentivisation through bonuses and long term incentive awards.
The company has operated the Beazley Staff Underwriting Plan for this purpose since 2004 and currently all the executive directors are participants with between 30% and 50% of their salaries at risk as capital commitments.
These capital commitments can be lost in full if underwriting performance is poor.
Section headings marked indicate the information in that section has been audited.
com Service contracts The company has service contracts with executive directors.
It is company policy that such contracts contain notice periods of not more than 12 months.
Details of the contracts currently in place for executive directors and their basic salary for 2009 are as follows: Annual salary Provision for Date of contract Unexpired term Notice period compensation A F Beazley 450,000 6 Nov 2002 n a 12 months Nil N H Furlonge 255,000 6 Nov 2002 n a 12 months Nil J G Gray 285,000 6 Nov 2002 n a 12 months Nil D A Horton 350,000 1 Jun 2003 n a 12 months Nil N P Maidment 260,000 6 Nov 2002 n a 12 months Nil C A Washbourn 260,000 6 Dec 2006 n a 12 months Nil the unexpired term is not applicable as each of the executive directors contract is on a rolling basis Subject to the notice requirements described above, there is no provision in the service agreements for compensation to be payable on early termination of the contract.
The company will normally phase any payments of compensation which will also be subject to negotiation and mitigation.
Non-executive directors The fees of non-executive directors, other than the chairman, are determined by the board.
When setting fee levels consideration is given to levels in comparable companies for comparable services.
No non-executive director participates in the companys incentive arrangements or pension plan.
Non-executive directors are appointed for xed terms, normally for three years, and may be reappointed for future terms.
Non-executive directors are typically appointed through a selection process that includes the candidate bringing the desired competence and skills to the group.
The board has identied several key competencies for non-executive directors to complement the existing skill-set of the executive directors.
"These competencies are as follows: t OTVSBODF TFDUPS FYQFSUJTF t ""TTFU NBOBHFNFOU TLJMMT t 1VCMJD DPNQBOZ BOE DPSQPSBUF HPWFSOBODF FYQFSJFODF t 3JTL NBOBHFNFOU TLJMMT BOE t 'JOBODF TLJMMT A bi-annual review of the fees and other income payable was carried out by the board in December 2008."

3 The directors have deferred bonus entitlements to support their underwriting through Beazley Staff Underwriting Limited.
4 JG Rowell left the Group on 11 December 2008.
The termination payment comprises amounts payable in respect of Johnny Rowells 2008 bonus and in lieu of notice.
com Salary The remuneration committee reviews salaries annually, taking into account levels in comparable positions in other similar financial companies.
It also considers the performance of the group, individual and average salary increases for employees across the whole group.
The annual salary reviews take place in December of each year and the remuneration committee decided that there should be no salary increases awarded for 2009 for the executive directors for the second year running, as a measure to contain costs and to reect the lower profits delivered in 2008 as well as increase awareness for cost management in the business.
Short-term incentives Enterprise bonus pool A scheme based on achieving stretching target returns on group equity with minimum hurdles to be met has been established that better aligns the interests of directors and staff with shareholders.
A proportion of this pool is allocated among executive directors at the discretion of the committee.
In determining the award levels for 2008, as the groups return on equity had reduced compared with 2007, the bonus pool was smaller and the level of awards made was reduced.
No awards of deferred shares were made to directors in respect of 2008 financial year.
Retention plan In addition to the enterprise bonus pool, senior executives will be eligible to receive conditional awards of ordinary shares under the retention plan.
The retention plan is operated on a discretionary basis based on performance to ensure key individuals have an adequate retention package and the first grant of awards was made in April 2005.
The remuneration committee has concluded that the award of retention shares should be targeted at key staff where retention is essential to the business.
The total number of shares awarded to date has been 8,619,330 of which 7,806,055 ordinary shares are held by the employee benefit trust.
Pensions The company provides pension entitlements to directors that are dened benefit in nature.
Details of the entitlements of those who served as directors during the year are as follows: Increase in Transfer value Transfer value Increase in Accrued accrued benets Increase in of A less of accrued transfer value benefit at excluding accrued benets directors benets at less directors 31 Dec 2008 ination A including ination contributions 31 Dec 2008 contributions N H Furlonge 139,243 2,617,080 300,905 J G Gray 27,982 1,359 486,657 50,016 N P Maidment 32,273 1,566 360,235 13,373 CA Washbourn 15,107 734 182,972 6,239 The trustees agreed the new transfer value regime basis in January 2009.
During the year Andrew Beazley transferred his pension entitlement out of the scheme at a valuation of 4.2m The transfer values have reduced during the year despite a stronger mortality basis because the discount rates in payment have been increased and inationary expectations reduced.
Future service accruals ceased on 31 March 2006 for the Beazley Furlonge Limited Final Salary Pension Scheme.
The pension benets for directors and staff are now provided by way of a dened contribution scheme arranged through Fidelity, which is non-contributory.
The company contributes 15% of salary for directors.
Andrew Beazley and Nick Furlonge do not participate in this plan but, instead, receive a salary supplement in lieu of pension.
No other pension provisions are made.
The normal retirement age for pension calculation purposes is 60 years.
A spouses pension is the equivalent of two-thirds of the members pension before any commutation payable on the members death after retirement.
Beazley Annual Report 2008 57 Directors remuneration report continued Share incentive plans The company operates a variety of long-term, share-based incentives, including tax-approved and unapproved option plans, a longterm incentive plan LTIP and a save-as-you-earn scheme SAYE, which are detailed below.
In 2005 it was agreed that in the future share option grants other than those under the Beazley SAYE scheme which have substantial tax advantages for participants are to be made only in exceptional circumstances, e. g. recruitment, when the terms of those share options will reect best practice prevailing at that time.
In particular, there will be no retesting of performance conditions on those grants.
Existing options will be honoured and allowed to run their full course.
The long-term incentive plan Participation in the LTIP is restricted to employees and full-time executive directors of the Beazley Group.
Participants are selected on a discretionary basis and receive awards of free shares in the form of a nil-cost option, thus, no exercise price is payable.
The options will normally be exercisable subject to meeting the performance conditions set out below and provided that the participant continues in the employment of the company at that date between the third and tenth anniversaries of grant.
The LTIP awards that were granted in March 2005 met the performance criteria established in part and over 90% of the options vested.
The maximum normal levels of grants that may be made under the LTIP to one individual is one times salary in any financial year, measured by the value of ordinary shares put under award at the time of the award.
Dividends are not currently accrued on ordinary shares prior to vesting and the number of shares awarded is not therefore adjusted.
The committee will keep this issue under review for future awards.
Awards are measured by total shareholder return TSR and net asset value NAV performance.
The company decided upon these measures as TSR aligns the interests of directors with shareholders by requiring superior TSR performance and NAV is a key measure of the companys financial performance.
The LTIP performance conditions were originally set when the scheme was established by board resolution on 6 November 2002.
The performance conditions were amended at an extraordinary general meeting on 14 March 2005 for grants made after that date.
Shares worth up to 50% of salary NAV Basic Shares Regardless of the TSR performance, 50% of the Basic Shares will be received if NAV growth is at least the risk free rate of return plus 5% per year.
TSR Regardless of the NAV growth, 25% of the Basic Shares will be received for median TSR performance and 50% of the Basic Shares will be received for upper quartile TSR performance.
For TSR performance between median and upper quartile the number of Basic Shares which will be received is determined on a straight-line basis.
Shares worth more than 50% NAV of salary Regardless of TSR performance, 50% of the Additional Shares will be Additional Shares received if NAV growth is at least the risk-free rate of return plus 10% per year.
For out-performance of the risk-free rate of return of between 5% and 10%, the number of Additional Shares which will be received is determined on a straight-line basis.
TSR Regardless of NAV growth, 50% of the Additional Shares will be received if top decile TSR performance is achieved.
For TSR performance between upper quartile and top decile performance, the number of Additional Shares which will be received is determined on a straight-line basis.
com The companys TSR growth is compared with that of members of a comparator group comprising eight companies from the insurance sector the comparator group over a three-year period starting with the year in which the award is made.
"The comparator group is dened as the Lloyds vehicles listed on the London Stock Exchange and includes the following companies: t ""NMJO t #SJU OTVSBODF t $BUMJO SPVQ t $IBVDFS t BSEZ t JHIXBZ t JTDPY tBODBTIJSF PMEJOHT t PWBF SPVQ Details of entitlements under this plan, which are all subject to the above performance conditions, for directors who served during the period, are set out in the next table."
The unapproved share option plan Participation in the unapproved plan is restricted to employees and full-time executive directors of the Beazley Group, although it is the committees intention to only make awards under this plan in exceptional circumstances.
Participants are selected on a discretionary basis.
No payment is required for the grant of an option and the limit on grants when aggregated with awards under the LTIP is shares with a face value of one times salary or two times salary in exceptional circumstances.
Under both the approved and unapproved share option plans, options are subject to performance conditions and typically vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, provided that the participant has remained in employment to that date.
"The performance conditions require the companys NAV plus dividends per share growth to increase as follows over a three-year period: t ""O PQUJPO NBZ CF FYFSDJTFE PWFS BMM PSEJOBSZ TIBSFT VOEFS PQUJP O JG UIF DVNVMBUJWF HSPXUI JO ""7 QMVT EJWJEFOET QFS TIBSF JT FRVBM to or exceeds the risk-free rate of return this being dened as the average yield of UK gilts with maturity dates within the next five years in the relevant period plus 10% per annum: t ""O PQUJPO NBZ CF FYFSDJTFE PWFS IBMG UIF PSEJOBSZ TIBSFT VOEFS PQUJPO JG UIF DVNVMBUJWF HSPXUI JO ""7 QMVT EJWJEFOET QFS TIBSF JT equal to the risk-free rate of return plus 5% per annum: t 'PS QFSGPSNBODF XIFSF UIF DVNVMBUJWF HSPXUI JO ""7 QMVT EJWJEFOET QFS TIBSF FRVBMT B OVNCFS CFUXFFO UIF SJTL GSFF SBUF PG return plus 5% and 10% per annum, the number of ordinary shares over which an option can be exercised will be calculated on a straight-line basis between these two points: t 'PS PQUJPOT HSBOUFE CFGPSF JG UIF PQUJPO JT OPU GVMMZ FYFSDJTBCMF BU UIF FOE PG UIF UISFF ZFBS QFSJPE JU XJMM CF SF UFTUFE PODF on the fourth anniversary of the date of grant, from a xed base."

The performance conditions above were set when these plans were established by board resolution on 6 November 2002.
These performance conditions were considered to be appropriate as they impose demanding performance requirements, while ensuring that shareholders also receive attractive returns over the performance period.
The unapproved and approved options granted in 2004 vested in part following the announcement of the results for the year ended 31 December 2006 and the balance of the options were available to be re-tested following the announcement of the results for the year ended 31 December 2007.
Overall 100% of the options vested.
The approved share option plan Participation in the approved plan is restricted to employees and full-time executive directors of the Beazley Group.
The terms and conditions are consistent with the unapproved plan, except that the plan has been approved by HM Revenue and Customs HMRC.
Beazley Annual Report 2008 59 Directors remuneration report continued Save-as-you-earn scheme A SAYE scheme was launched in May 2003 for the benefit of staff.
The scheme rules were approved by HMRC.
The grants made up to 2007 schemes were administered by Yorkshire Building Society and the 2008 award administration has been undertaken by Equiniti.
The scheme offered a three-year savings contract period with options being offered at a price of 93p for grants in 2006, 114.5p for the grants in 2007 and 126.5p for grants in 2008 representing the maximum allowed discount of 20%.
Monthly contributions are made through payroll deduction directly to individual bank accounts on behalf of participating employees.
All employees who had completed their probationary period prior to the closure of the invitation period were considered eligible to participate in the scheme.
Savings-related share option plan for US employees The Beazley Group plc savings-related share option plan for US employees the Plan permits all eligible US-based employees to purchase shares of Beazley Group at a discount of up to 15% of the shares fair market value.
The plan is designed to comply with the terms of Section 423 of the US Internal Revenue Code.
Participants elect to participate by entering into a savings contract under which the participant agrees to have a portion of his or her compensation withheld in a savings plan for the purpose of exercising options granted under the Plan.
The maximum amount of compensation that may be withheld each month under all savings contracts for any participant may not exceed 250.
After a two-year period, participants may exercise their options to purchase Beazley shares at the exercise price.
The shares purchased are non-transferable for at least 12 months following exercise.
Unexercised options lapse 27 months after the date on which the options were granted.
Options may be exercised early in the event of an employees death or retirement, certain other cessations of employment and certain Beazley Group change in control events.
The Plan, by its terms, will terminate on 5 May 2016, which is the tenth anniversary of its adoption.
The share plans permit 10% of the companys share capital to be issued pursuant to options LTIP awards in a 10-year period.
Since November 2002, 2.6% of this allowance 2.6% has been allocated for option and LTIP awards.
Directors share scheme interests Details of share options of those directors who served during the period are as follows: Earliest date Scheme At 31 Dec 2007 Awarded Exercised Lapsed At 31 Dec 2008 Ex.
com With a total of 349,581,443 issued shares at 31 December 2008 net of shares held in Treasury the directors held 3.0%.
As beneciaries of the employee benefit trust, the executive directors are deemed to be interested in the shares held by the trust which at 31 December 2008 amounted to 12,584,189 ordinary shares.
Underwriting interests on syndicate 623 The incentive arrangements for directors and key decision makers in the business include an element of downside risk through the deferment of future bonuses that will be at risk if the syndicate declares losses through the participation in Beazley Staff Underwriting.
To date, over 80 employees of the group have committed to put at risk 3.9m of bonuses to the underwriting results of syndicate 623.
Of the total at risk, 2.5m has already been deferred from the bonuses awarded.
The following directors participated in Syndicate 623 through Beazley Staff Underwriting Limited: 2008 year of 2009 year of account capacity account capacity A F Beazley 454,545 283,661 N H Furlonge 300,000 283,661 J G Gray 300,000 283,661 D A Horton 300,000 283,661 N P Maidment 300,000 283,661 C A Washbourn 300,000 283,661 The directors believe that it is important that the incentive arrangements include an element of downside risk to align further with the interests of capital providers.
The directors participate in the underwriting and have exposure to underwriting results through participation in Beazley Staff Underwriting Limited that provides an indirect involvement in the results of the syndicate.
Annual general meeting A resolution will be proposed at the forthcoming annual general meeting to be held on 23 April 2009 to approve this directors remuneration report.
