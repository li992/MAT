Directors remuneration report Directors remuneration report The directors present their remuneration report which covers the remuneration of both executive and non-executive directors and certain senior executives.
The report has been approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by the chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
The first section of the report contains unaudited information and the second section audited information.
The report will be subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting AGM in April 2009.
Section 1: Unaudited information The role of the Remuneration Committee The Committee reviews and approves the annual salaries, bonus arrangements, service agreements and other employment conditions of the executive directors and certain members of the senior executive management team designated by the Board, taking due account of pay and conditions in the Group as a whole.
It also approves the design of, and determines targets for, any performance related bonus pay schemes operated by the Group, approves the total annual payments made under such schemes, reviews the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and shareholders and approves the awards of long-term incentives.
The full terms of reference of the Committee are published on the Companys website.
Membership and operation The Committee comprises all non-executive directors including the Chairman and is chaired by David Dunn.
None of the Committee members has any day to day involvement in the running of the Company, nor do they have any business or other relationship that could affect, or appear to affect, the exercise of their independent judgement.
The Committee met three times during the year.
Other directors and employees of the Company who attended some, or all, of the meetings during the year and provided advice and services to the Committee were Mike Humphrey Group Chief Executive, Pamela Broughton Group VP Personnel, Graham Myers Group Financial Controller Treasurer and Louise Scott Company Secretary.
All have the appropriate qualifications and experience to advise the Committee on aspects of the Groups policies and practices.
Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS provided advice on the level of salary increases in the market place for consideration as part of the annual pay review of the executive directors and senior executives carried out in November 2008.
HNBS provide no services to the Company other than those relating to the provision of the executive remuneration advice.
A more detailed review of the remuneration packages of the executive directors and senior executives is planned to take place during 2009.
Policy on directors and senior executives remuneration The key objectives of Crodas executive remuneration policy are: n to ensure that individual rewards and incentives are comparable with those provided by similar companies having regard to the Groups turnover, business sector and market worth and the need for skills to manage international businesses n to enable the Group to attract and retain high calibre people n to give full consideration to the relevant principles on directors remuneration set out in the 2006 FRC Combined Code n to ensure a balance between fixed and performance related remuneration, the latter being related to objective measurement of the financial performance of the Company.
The Committee believes that the interests of shareholders and directors are more closely aligned by the operation of short-term incentives which encourage the achievement of stretching profit targets and under which rewards may be delivered in the form of cash and shares, combined with share-based long-term incentives that reward performance against three year earnings per share and relative total shareholder return targets.
Components of executive directors remuneration Basic salary The Committee considers that it is difficult to identify companies who are true comparators with the Companys operations and so the basic salaries of the executive directors are set by reference to those paid by companies comprising FTSE 250 manufacturing companies similar in size and scope of operations to those of Croda and a group of companies with comparable market capitalisations and international scope to those of Croda.
The salaries are paid monthly in cash and are reviewed annually with effect from 1 January.
As mentioned above, HNBS provided information on increases in salary levels, which was utilised by the Committee as part of its deliberations on the annual salary review for executive directors and other senior executives.
Performance-related annual bonus The Company operates bonus schemes for its directors and senior executives.
Bonus payments are not pensionable.
The 2008 bonuses for executive directors were calculated by reference to the amount by which the income for the year, which is defined as the Group EBITDA for continuing operations before exceptional items and any charges or credits under IFRS2 Share based payments less a notional interest charge on working capital employed during the year the 2008 income, exceeded the income for 2007 calculated on the same basis the base income.
Bonuses are payable on a graduated scale once the 2008 income exceeds the base income by inflation defined as the harmonised index of consumer prices CPI, with maximum bonuses due at CPI plus 17%.
Income is measured after providing for the cost of any bonuses.
The maximum amount of bonus payable is 100% of salary with the net element of any bonus in excess of 50% of salary being compulsorily invested in the Croda International Bonus Co-investment Plan BCIP.
Bonuses earned by each director in respect of 2008 are included in the table of directors remuneration on page 29 and represent 100% of basic salary, based on achievement well in excess of the maximum bonus targets set at the start of the year.
The maximum bonus opportunities have been set at these same levels for 2009.
The performance targets will again require out-performance of last years EBITDA before bonuses become eligible for payment.
The Committee remains comfortable that the structure of the annual bonus does not encourage the pursuit of strategies that may involve inappropriate risk-taking and that the mandatory reinvestment of bonuses in excess of 50% of salary into shares in any year is considered to strengthen further alignment with shareholders and foster a longer-term link between annual performance and reward.
25 Directors remuneration report Long-term incentives Long-term incentives are provided to executive directors through two long-term incentive plans, the BCIP and the Croda International Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP which were both adopted in 2005.
These replaced the Senior Executive Share Option Schemes.
It is the Committees policy, subject to unforeseen circumstances, that these will comprise the sole long-term elements of the total remuneration package of executive directors for the foreseeable future.
It is also the Committees policy to continue exercising its right to decide the number of LTIP awards to be granted to each executive director.
BCIP The BCIP operates in conjunction with the annual bonus schemes and allows participants to invest a proportion of their net annual cash bonus in Company shares.
It is compulsory for employees whose gross bonus exceeds 50% of their annual salary to invest the excess, net of tax, in shares unless they are within three years of anticipated retirement date.
Participants have to agree to hold the invested shares for three years in return for which they receive a conditional award entitling them to additional shares subject to the achievement of the BCIPs performance condition.
The maximum number of shares over which an award can be granted to an employee in a single year is limited to shares having a market value not exceeding 100% of the employees salary.
For the first awards which were made in 2006, the vesting of 100% of the award is conditional on Crodas earnings per share before exceptional items exceeding CPI over the three year performance period.
The performance condition has been met.
A revised performance condition adopted in 2007 is structured to require the achievement of a sliding scale of adjusted earnings per share growth EPS targets in excess of retail price inflation RPI : 2006 Awards Post 2006 Awards Adjusted EPS growth Proportion of Adjusted EPS growth Proportion of over the three year period award vesting over the three year period award vesting Less than CPI No vesting Less than RPI 12% No vesting CPI 100% RPI 12% 30% RPI 24% 100% Straight-line vesting occurs between these points If the performance target is met the shares will be transferred automatically to the employee.
If the employee does not retain their invested shares until the release date their award lapses.
It is intended that the same performance target will be applied to any BCIP awards made in 2009.
LTIP Participation in the LTIP is limited to executive directors and the most senior executives.
Annual awards of shares are made based on a percentage of salary with the maximum entitlement being shares having a market value of 100% of the employees salary.
Awards are subject to performance conditions measured over a period of not less than three years.
The target for awards made in 2005 and 2006 was set so that awarded shares will vest if the growth in Crodas EPS exceeds CPI plus 3% each year over the three year performance period with 50% vesting at this level, and the maximum 100% vesting for performance of CPI plus 9% each year.
For performance between these two levels, the awards will vest on a straight-line basis.
A revised performance condition for awards made after 2006 is split into two separate parts, each with a separate performance condition.
Half of any LTIP award will vest based on a condition measuring the Companys relative total shareholder return TSR against the constituents of the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
There are a limited number of direct competitors to Croda and the Committee was mindful of the dangers inherent in operating a relative TSR-based performance condition with a comparator group comprised of only a small number of companies.
The FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts was, therefore, considered an appropriate comparator group by the Committee.
Vesting will take place on the following sliding scale: Rank of the Companys TSR against the FTSE 250 excluding Investment Trusts Vesting % TSR part Below median 0% Median 30% Upper quartile 100% Between median and upper quartile 30% - 100% pro rata The remaining half of the award will vest based on the same EPS growth condition that is set for the BCIP, with 30% of this part of the award vesting for EPS growth of RPI 12%, rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting for EPS growth of RPI 24%.
26 Directors remuneration report Directors remuneration report 2005 & 2006 Awards Post 2006 Awards Adjusted EPS growth Proportion of award Adjusted EPS growth Proportion of award over the three year period vesting EPS part over the three year period vesting EPS part Less than CPI 9% No vesting Less than RPI 12% No vesting CPI 9% 50% RPI 12% 30% CPI 21% 100% RPI 24% 100% Straight-line vesting occurs between these points Straight-line vesting occurs between these points If the performance target is met the shares will be transferred automatically to the employee.
Awards made in 2009 will remain in line with awards made in prior years for executive directors.
The Committee believes that this is entirely appropriate given the strong trading performance delivered in 2008, Crodas share price performance during the course of a turbulent year for global stock markets and the need to retain and motivate the highly performing and well regarded management team.
Senior Executive Share Option Schemes Following the adoption of the BCIP and the LTIP, the operation of the Senior Executive Share Option Schemes has been discontinued except in relation to options already granted.
Under the terms of the schemes, options were granted subject to performance conditions.
The only options now outstanding were granted between 2000 and 2003.
Basic EPS before exceptional items must grow at RPI plus 7% per annum for 100% of the options allocated to be exercisable.
The performance period commences at the date of grant and lasts for a minimum of three years and a maximum of ten years until an average growth rate of at least RPI plus 3% per annum over the whole period has been achieved.
With earnings growth at RPI plus 5% per annum, 75% of the options are exercisable and at RPI plus 3% per annum 50% of the options are exercisable.
Mike Humphrey is the only director who holds these options and details of his options are shown in the table on page 31.
It is the Companys current intention to satisfy awards under the BCIP and the LTIP and the exercise of share options primarily from shares held in the Employee Share Ownership Trust and shares purchased in the market and not by the issue of new shares.
Details of shares held for this purpose are given in note 25 on page 72.
Share ownership policy The Company has adopted share ownership guidelines which apply to all executive directors and members of the Group Executive Committee and the Finance Committee.
Executives are required to build up a target shareholding of shares with a market value equivalent to 100% of salary from time to time through a combination of share purchases and the retention of incentive shares.
On the exercise of SAYE and executive share options or the vesting of LTIP and or BCIP awards, executives are required to retain shares from the shares awarded representing 50% of the after tax gain until the target is met or exceeded.
The target is expected to be reached within 5 years.
Pension and other benefits Croda has a number of different pension plans in countries in which it operates.
Pension entitlements for Crodas executives are tailored to local market practice, the length of service and age of the participants.
The principal pension plans in the UK are defined benefit schemes which provide a pension based on a proportion of final salary.
The Company is flexible in the manner in which pension provision is made for executive directors with the aim of balancing the needs of the director against the liability of the Company.
Hence, it makes contributions by direct contribution to the Croda defined benefit pension scheme or by way of a cash supplement in lieu of pension benefits to enable the funding of personal pension arrangements.
Other customary benefits such as company cars or car allowances, health benefits, the UK SAYE Scheme and the Croda Share Incentive Plan which are available to all eligible UK employees, are made available to executive directors.
Benefits in kind are not pensionable.
The Committee reviews the individual components and the balance of these components from time to time.
Components of senior executives remuneration There are nine members of the Group Executive Committee and Finance Committee in addition to the two executive directors.
The reward structure for these senior executives is similar to that of the executive directors although their level of long-term incentive award differs.
27 Directors remuneration report Service contracts and external appointments Policy The Committees policy on executive directors service contracts is for them to contain a maximum notice period of one year.
In respect of termination, the Committees policy is to deal with each case on its merits, in accordance with the law and any further policy adopted by the Committee at the time.
In the event of early termination, other than for cause, the relevant directors then current salary and contractual benefits would be taken into account in calculating any liability of the Company.
The principal contractual benefits provided in addition to salary are the provision of a car, pension and medical insurance and life assurance.
Annual bonuses and long-term incentives are non-contractual and are dealt with in accordance with the rules of the relevant schemes.
Specific contracts Mike Humphrey entered into a new service contract on 21 December 2005 which is terminable by the Company on one years notice and by Mike Humphrey on six months notice.
The Company may also terminate the contract at any time with immediate effect and Mike Humphrey would be entitled to receive compensation equivalent to twelve months salary plus the value of his pension benefits valued at 20% of basic salary, bonus entitlement 50% based on the assumption that performance targets are deemed to have been achieved and the value of other benefits, payable in equal monthly instalments for twelve months or, if less, the remaining period of any notice period not yet completed.
Such payments would discontinue or reduce to the extent that he obtained alternative employment.
Sean Christie has a service contract dated 15 December 2006 with substantially the same terms as those of Mike Humphreys contract except that there is no entitlement to bonus on termination by the Company with immediate effect.
External appointments Executive directors are permitted to accept external non-executive appointments with the prior approval of the Board.
It is normal practice for executive directors to retain fees provided for non-executive appointments.
During the year Sean Christie was a non-executive director of Cherry Valley Farms Limited for which he received fees of 25,000.
Apart from service agreements and share schemes, no director has had any material interest in any contract with the Company or its subsidiaries requiring disclosure under the Companies Act 2006.
Policy on non-executive directors remuneration The Board is responsible for determining the policy on, and level of, the remuneration of non-executive directors.
The aim is to attract non-executive directors who through their experience can further the interests of the Company through their stewardship and contribution to strategic development.
The Boards policy is to provide cash fees at a level commensurate with companies of Crodas size, not to grant share options to non-executive directors, and to encourage non-executive directors to establish a holding of Croda shares.
Components of non-executive directors remuneration Non-executives pay comprises cash fees, paid monthly.
All non-executive directors are reimbursed for travel and related business expenses reasonably incurred in performing their duties.
Non-executive directors fees are determined on the basis of current fee levels in similar businesses together with their time commitment and responsibilities and are reviewed by the Board at least every two years.
The Chairmans fees are determined by the Group Chief Executive and the other members of the Board and, since 1 January 2007 these have been 140,000.
Following review in November 2008 the fee was increased to 153,000 with effect from 1 January 2009.
The fees of the remaining non-executive directors are determined by the Chairman and the executive directors.
Since 1 January 2007 the basic annual fee for a non-executive director has been 37,500, with an additional 5,000 for chairing a committee and the Senior Independent Director receiving an additional 2,500.
Following a review in November 2008 the fees were increased from 1 January 2009 to 41,000 for each non-executive director, with an additional 6,000 for chairing a committee and 3,000 for the Senior Independent Director.
Terms of appointment The Chairman and non-executive directors have letters of appointment for an initial fixed term of three years subject to earlier termination by either party on written notice.
In each case, this term can be extended by mutual agreement.
They have no entitlement to contractual termination payments.
The dates of their initial appointments are set out below.

Pension rights Prior to 6 April 2006, Mike Humphrey accrued pension benefits under the Croda International Supplemental Scheme CISS.
He will be entitled on retirement at age 60 to a pension equal to his accrued pension at 5 April 2006 accrued at a rate of twothirds of his annual pensionable remuneration as at 5 April 2006, pro-rated by the ratio of his actual service accrued prior to 5 April 2006 and prospective service to age 60, increased to age 60 at the rate which applies to all preserved pensions in the CISS.
If Mike Humphrey retires before age 60 a reduced pension is payable unless retiring at the Companys request.
In the event of death, a pension equal to two-thirds of the directors pension would become payable to his surviving spouse.
Mike Humphreys pension in payment is guaranteed to increase in line with the rate of inflation up to a maximum of 10% per annum.
During 2008, Mike Humphrey was paid 104,004 2007: 93,000 in addition to his basic salary to enable him to make independent provision for his retirement.
Sean Christie accrues pension benefits under the CISS with an accrual rate of 1 60th and an entitlement to retire at age 65.
If Sean Christie retires before age 65 a reduced pension is payable unless retiring at the Companys request.
In the event of death, a pension equal to 50% of the directors pension would become payable to his surviving spouse.
Sean Christies pension in payment is guaranteed to increase in line with the rate of inflation up to a maximum of 2.5% per annum.
Both Mike Humphrey and Sean Christie are also entitled to death in service benefits from the CISS.

2 The figure represents the difference between the total accrued pension at 31 December 2008 and the corresponding pension at the beginning of the year.
3 The figure represents the difference between the total accrued pension at 31 December 2008 and the corresponding pension at the beginning of the year after an adjustment to exclude inflation was provided as required under paragraph 9.8.
4 Transfer values are quoted on the basis recommended by the scheme actuary for valuation of accrued benefits if the member had transferred benefits to another approved scheme on the relevant date.
The increase decrease in transfer value between 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2008 takes account of changes in market conditions over the period.
5 The figure represents the difference between transfer values of the accrued benefits at 31 December 2008 and 31 December 2007, less contributions paid by the director.
6 The figure represents the transfer value of the increase in accrued benefits over the period, adjusted for inflation, less contributions paid by the director.
7 Following the changes to the basis for the calculation of cash equivalent transfer values reported last year, the basis was further amended during 2008.
In the light of significant changes in market conditions, and based on actuarial advice, the trustee of the CISS amended the basis by removing the equitybased market adjustment factor with effect from 30 September 2008.
Had the existing adjustment been retained, increases to the published FTSE net equity dividend yield would have resulted in the calculation of inappropriately low transfer values for members several years away from retirement age.
In the case of Mr Christie, the transfer value figure as at 31 December 2008 would have been around 40% lower if the old adjustment had been retained.
In the case of Mr Humphrey, the transfer value figure as at 31 December 2008 would have been around 10% lower, reflecting the fact that Mr Humphrey is closer to the age at which his pension is payable on an unreduced basis.
Members of the CISS have the option to pay voluntary contributions.
Neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in this table.
