REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with The Directors Report Regulations 2002, the Regulations.
The auditors are required to report on the auditable part of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
The report is therefore divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing policy on remuneration for executive directors and senior management and for determining specific remuneration packages for each of the executive directors.
Kenneth Minton is Chairman of the committee with Andrew Robb and Roger Wood acting as committee members.
The Remuneration Committee received wholly independent advice on executive compensation and incentives from Halliwell Consulting during the year.
No other services were provided to the company by Halliwell Consulting during the year.
The Remuneration Committee is formally constituted with written terms of reference which set out the full remit of the committee.
A copy of the terms of reference is available to shareholders by writing to the Company Secretary whose contact details are set out on page 2.
The terms of reference are also available on the companys website at www.
The Remuneration Committee met 3 times during the year and all members were in attendance.
Remuneration policy overview The Remuneration Committee has adopted a remuneration policy so that total levels of compensation encourage and reward high performance and attract and retain individuals of the right calibre to ensure the company meets its objectives.
It is the opinion of the Remuneration Committee that shareholders interests are best served by focusing a greater proportion of total remuneration on performance related compensation.
Short and long-term incentives are structured so as to align directors interests with those of shareholders by rewarding them for enhancing shareholder value.
It should be noted that the real value received by the executive directors under the share incentive arrangements will be dependent upon the degree to which the associated performance conditions have been satisfied at the end of the three year performance period and the share price of the company at this time.
This ensures that substantial rewards are only received when value has been created in the business.
23 PayPoint plc The companys comparator group for the purposes of benchmarking remuneration and comparative total shareholder return TSR performance under the PayPoint Long-Term Incentive Plan the LTIP for awards granted to the end of year under review is set out below: Acal plc Diploma plc Alphameric plc Fibernet Group plc Autonomy Corporation plc Gresham Computing plc BATM Advanced Communications plc Intec Telecom Systems plc Big Yellow Group plc Ricardo plc BPP Holdings plc Spring Group plc BTG plc Surfcontrol plc Detica Group plc Tribal Group plc Dl com plc The comparator group companies are drawn from the FTSE All Share Support Services and Software and Computer Services Indices and were selected on their comparability in terms of market capitalisation and size to the company.
Over 50% of the executive directors total remuneration packages are based on performance related elements.
The main elements of these packages and the performance conditions are described below.
Basic salary The Remuneration Committees policy is to set base salaries at median level.
When determining the salary of the executive directors, the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills, in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity, in particular the median salary levels of those companies within the comparator group.
These factors are considered in parallel with the following:  the performance of the individual executive director:  the individual executive directors experience and responsibilities: and  pay and conditions throughout the company.
Annual performance related bonus The annual bonus plan for the period ended 30 March 2008 provided for a maximum cash bonus of 50% of salary.
Executive directors were also eligible to participate in the PayPoint plc Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSB.
Under the DSB they are able to choose to defer up to 50% of the bonus awarded i. e. up to 25% of salary and acquire shares Bonus Shares, with the opportunity of an additional award of shares Matching Shares of an equivalent value to the gross bonus deferred i. e. up to 25% of salary which equates to a maximum bonus potential of 75% of salary.
The companys bonus plan for the period ended 30 March 2008 was based on the achievement of growth of economic profit operating profit after tax and a charge for capital employed based on the companys cost of capital.
Based upon the actual results for the period 91% of the maximum bonus is payable.
The Remuneration Committee believes that this will encourage a focus on both profit and capital efficiency which are key to driving shareholder value and which are implicit in the calculation of economic profit.
The Remuneration Committee reviews and agrees targets at the beginning of each financial year and adjusts those targets for any acquisitions during the year.
Bonus payments are not pensionable.
24 The results are set out below: 80% payment 100% payment threshold threshold for 110% for on plan delivery of plan delivery Actual results 000 000 000 Economic profit 15,821 17,403 16,713 Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSB The DSB was approved by shareholders prior to admission and was adopted by the company on admission.
Executive directors and senior executives of the company are able to participate in the DSB.
The maximum individual limit under the DSB is such that the maximum value of cash bonus, Bonus Shares and Matching Shares in any bonus year shall not exceed 100% of a participants salary.
The release of Matching Shares is subject to:  minimum earnings per share growth of the company of RPI 3% p. a. over a three year period: and  the participant still being employed by the company at the end of the three year deferral period from the award date.
If a participant disposes of any of the Bonus Shares during the three year deferral period a corresponding proportion of Matching Shares will be forfeited.
The executive directors elected to defer 50% of their cash bonus received in respect of the year ending 25 March 2007.
During the year Bonus Shares were purchased and Matching Shares awarded under the DSB based on the value of bonus deferred.
Details of the awards made under the DSB during the year are set out on page 30.
Since the year end all the executive directors have elected to defer 50% of the bonus earned in the current year in shares.
It is intended that Bonus Shares and Matching Shares awards will be made under the DSB in May 2008.
Long term incentives The LTIP was approved by shareholders prior to admission and adopted by the company on admission.
Executive directors and senior executives are eligible to participate in the LTIP.
Under the rules, the maximum annual award that can be made to an individual is 150% of salary.
Eligible executives are awarded rights to acquire a maximum number of shares at the beginning of a three year period, a proportion of which they will be entitled to acquire at the end of that period depending on the extent to which if at all the challenging performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the time of the allocation is made are satisfied.
During the year Dominic Taylor received an LTIP award equivalent to 120% of salary and George Earle and Tim Watkin-Rees received LTIP awards equivalent to 100% of salary.
Awards made in the year were granted as conditional awards of shares.
Details of the LTIP awards made during the year are set out on page 29.
During the year the first tranche of the LTIP awards were released in full and exercised by the executive directors, details are on page 29.
25 PayPoint plc The performance conditions for the awards made during the year under the LTIP are set out in the following table: TSR position against comparator group LTIP % of shares released Below median 0% Median 30% Upper quartile 100% There is proportionate vesting between points.
In addition to the above comparative TSR performance of the company, the Remuneration Committee will, in any event, satisfy itself that the recorded TSR is a genuine reflection of the underlying financial performance of the company before the release of any share awards under the LTIP in accordance with the ABI guidelines, e. g. growth in earnings per share or economic profit.
Comparative TSR was selected as the performance condition for LTIP awards by the Remuneration Committee as it ensures that the executives have outperformed their peers in the comparator group over the measurement period in delivering shareholder value before being entitled to receive any of their awards irrespective of general market conditions.
Performance measurement The Remuneration Committee determines whether the performance conditions for share awards are satisfied.
Where the performance requirements are based on earnings per share, the Remuneration Committee will use the principles behind the audited figures disclosed in the companys financial statements, and may take advice from independent advisors as to whether any adjustments are required to ensure consistency in accordance with the terms of the performance conditions.
Halliwell Consulting, the Remuneration Committees advisors shall calculate the TSR where used as the performance measure.
Performance conditions under the LTIP and DSB are not subject to re-testing.
26 Total Shareholder Return TSR performance graph The graph shows the companys performance, measured by TSR, compared with the constituents of the FTSE All Share Support Services Index and the companys comparator group since admission.
300% Comparator group 250% FTSE All Share Support Services Index PayPoint plc 200% 150% 100% 50% Sept. 04 Mar.
08 The Remuneration Committee consider the FTSE All Share Support Services Sector Index a relevant index for TSR comparison as the index members represent the broad range of UK quoted support service companies comparable to the companys business.
PayPoint plc Share Incentive Plan SIP The SIP was approved by shareholders prior to admission and adopted by the company at admission.
