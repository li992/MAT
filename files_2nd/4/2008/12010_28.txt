The figures quoted above have not been adjusted to reflect this arrangement.
Until 31 March 2006 the Company operated a Supplementary Pension Scheme which mainly funded pension provision above the Earnings Cap and provided benefits in tax-paid lump sum form at retirement.
Appropriate figures have been included in the accrued pension totals shown above.
Since 1 April 2006 pension service benefit above the Earnings Cap level has been provided in the Pennon Group Executive Pension Scheme as described in vi Provision for Pension on page 49.
Directors have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions: neither the contributions nor the resulting benefits are included in the table shown above.
 a Shareholdings The number of ordinary shares of the Company in which Directors held beneficial interests at 31 March 2008 and 31 March 2007 were: 2008 2007 2008 2007 Ordinary shares Ordinary shares Ordinary shares Ordinary shares Director 40.7p each 40.7p each Director 40.7p each 40.7p each Gerard Connell Chris Loughlin 18,987 9,734 Colin Drummond 188,277 125,043 Kate Mortimer 1,974 1,951 David Dupont 166,063 99,655 Dinah Nichols Ken Harvey 7,209 7,209  40.7peach  Directors   ,  : Colin Drummond 119 David Dupont 61 Chris Loughlin 227 Kate Mortimer 8 There have been no other changes in the beneficial interests or the non-beneficial interests of the Directors in the ordinary shares of the Company between 1 April 2008 and 30 May 2008.
Pennon Group Annual Report and Accounts 51   continued b   In addition to the above beneficial interests, the following Directors have or had a contingent interest in the number of 40.7p ordinary shares shown below, representing the maximum number of shares to which they would become entitled under the Groups Long-Term Incentive Plans should the relevant criteria be met in full: Conditional Conditional Value of shares Conditional Date of end of awards awards Market price upon vesting awards period for qualifying Director and date held at made in upon award Vesting in before tax held at condition to be of award 1 April 2007 year in year year 000 31 March 2008 fulfilled Colin Drummond 16 9 04 101,070 269.83p 85,909 516 27 9 05 40,140 356.67p 40,140 26 9 08 18 9 06 41,363 498.62p 41,363 17 9 09 29 8 07 53,859 557.00p 53,859 28 8 10 David Dupont 16 9 04 96,015 269.83p 81,612 490 27 9 05 40,140 356.67p 40,140 26 9 08 18 9 06 41,363 498.62p 41,363 17 9 09 29 8 07 53,859 557.00p 53,859 28 8 10 Chris Loughlin 18 9 06 36,099 498.62p 36,099 17 9 09 29 8 07 49,371 557.00p 49,371 28 8 10 The amount of the awards and the market price upon award for the awards made on 16 9 04 and 27 9 05 have been adjusted in the ratio three for one consequent upon the Companys share capital split on 31 July 2006.
With the exception of the Awards marked the Awards relate to the Companys Restricted Share Plan RSP.
The Awards marked relate to the Companys new Performance and Co-investment Plan PCP which succeeded the RSP in 2007.
Details of the PCP and the performance conditions applicable to these Awards are set out in section iii Long-Term Incentive Plan on page 48 of this report.
Because of the existence of unpublished price sensitive information, no RSP awards were made during 2003 to the Executive Directors.
Accordingly, with shareholders approval, the usual award was made in 2004 together with a further award of shares equivalent to 75% of basic salary.
85% of this award vested on 15 September 2007 at a market price of 600.99p per ordinary share as the performance criterion had been partially met.
The balance of the share awards of 15% lapsed on 15 September 2007.
Bob Baty, a former director of the Company who retired on 31 July 2006, also received on 15 September 2007 54,887 ordinary shares of a total value of 330,000 at that date market price of 600.99p each which vested in him from a total award of 64,573 ordinary shares adjusted as set out below made on 16 September 2004 at a market price of 269.83p each pursuant to the provisions of the RSP.
The balance of the shares awarded to Bob Baty lapsed on 15 September 2007.
As reported in last years annual report the number of shares awarded to him had been adjusted pro rata to his period of employment with the Company during the restricted period of the award.
It is anticipated that some but not all of the 2005 award will vest in September 2008 as the performance criterion has been partially met.
The performance criterion applicable to the 2004, 2005 and 2006 RSP Awards was: the total shareholder return TSR achieved by the Company in the performance period must be greater than that of the company at or nearest to but not above the 50th percentile position of the comparator group.
If the TSR performance condition is met then 50% of an award will vest with 100% vesting if the Company achieves the position equal or closest to, but not above, the 75th percentile position of the comparator group.
The achievement of a position between the 50th and the 75th percentile positions will result in vesting in steps reflecting the number of companies within that third quartile of the comparator group.
The comparator group consists currently of 10 of the water only, water and sewerage, electricity and gas companies in the FTSE Utilities Index and quoted on the London Stock Exchange.
The TSR of each company in the comparator group is measured by Hewitt Associates Limited assuming that all dividends are reinvested and is calculated by taking the average market value of each companys shares for the whole of March before the beginning of the relevant three year performance period and comparing this to the average market value of the same shares for the whole of March at the end of the three year period.
During the year the Directors received dividends on the above shares in accordance with the conditions of the RSP as follows: Colin Drummond 33,867: David Dupont 23,584: Chris Loughlin 6,696.

The amount of the awards made on 28 6 04, 10 8 05 and 26 7 06 have been adjusted in the ratio three for one consequent upon the Companys share capital split on 31 July 2006.
A further conditional award of shares will be made in 2008 09 to the value of the amount of the performance related cash bonus shown in the Emoluments of Directors table on page 50.
Paragraph ii Performance Related Bonus on pages 47 and 48 set out the provisions relating to the conditional award of shares pursuant to the Plan.
During the year the Directors received dividends on the above shares in accordance with the conditions of the long-term incentive element of the Plan as follows: Colin Drummond 10,031: David Dupont 9,529: Chris Loughlin 1,113.
It is anticipated that all of the shares will vest under the 10 8 05 award in 2008 09 as the criterion is expected to be met.
