The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2008 26 Directors remuneration report Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7a of the Companies Act 1985.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to Directors remuneration in the Combined Code.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements are subject to approval.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on the part of the Directors remuneration report subject to audit and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with Schedule 7a of the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Regulations.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information Remuneration Committee The Company has established a Remuneration Committee the Committee which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code.
The members of the committee during the year were John Jackson, Tony Hughes, Andrew Thomas until 6 February 2008, and David Richardson until 8 August 2008 who were all independent non-executive Directors.
The Committee is currently chaired by Tony Hughes.
None of the Committee has any personal financial interest in the Company other than as shareholders.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board.
No Director plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
In determining the other executive Directors remuneration for the year the Committee consulted Alan Jackson non-executive Chairman about its proposals.
Hewitt New Bridge Street appointed independent advisers who provided no other services to the Group during the year provided advice to the Committee, encompassing all elements of the remuneration packages.
Remuneration policy Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors of the high calibre needed to progress and develop the Group and to reward them for top quartile sector performance and enhancing value to shareholders.
The performance measurement of the executive Directors and the determination of their annual remuneration package are undertaken by the Committee.
In addition, the Committee determines the remuneration for the Chairman.
The remuneration of the other nonexecutive Directors is determined by the Board.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for executive Directors: Basic annual salary and benefits for 2009 no increases were applied to any Directors salary: Annual bonus payments which cannot exceed 120% of basic salary for 2009 100% in 2008 for executive Directors: Long-Term Incentive Plan awards: and Pension arrangements.
The Companys policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the executive Directors should be performance related.
As described below, for 2009 executive Directors may earn annual incentive payments of up to 120% of their basic salary together with the benefits of the participation in the Long-Term Incentive Plan.
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the Company or Group.
There is no requirement for Directors to remit fees earned from appointments outside of the Company or Group to The Restaurant Group plc.
Andrew Page was appointed as a non-executive director of Arena Leisure plc on 1 December 2008 and received remuneration as a non-executive director of Arena Leisure plc of 3,750 in 2008.
Basic salary An executive Directors basic salary is determined by the Committee prior to the beginning of each year and when an individual changes position or responsibility.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers the Group as a whole and by reference to remuneration levels at other companies in the leisure and hospitality sectors.
Basic salaries were reviewed in December 2007 with increases taking effect from 1 January 2008.
They were again reviewed in December 2008 although no salary increases for executive Directors were awarded with effect from January 2009.
In addition to basic salary, the executive Directors receive pension contributions and certain benefits-in-kind, principally a car or car allowance, and health and life insurance.
Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2008 27 Annual bonus payments The annual bonus is based on the achievement of stretching profit before tax targets and personal objectives.
Performance targets are set annually as part of the budgeting process and performance is reviewed against those targets at the end of the financial year.
The maximum performance related bonus that can be paid in respect of performance in 2009 is 120% 2008: 100% of basic annual salary and for significant bonuses to be paid, performance must be outstanding.
For any bonus payment made between 75% and 100% of salary there is a reinvestment commitment for the Director into shares in The Restaurant Group plc, and these shares can form part of the matching element described in the Long-Term Incentive Plan detailed below.
This reinvestment requirement will be waived if an executive Director has a shareholding with average acquisition cost of greater than one times their salary.
Given the importance to the Group of retaining the executive management team of the Group in this current highly challenging economic climate, when the Committee met at the end of 2008 it formed the view that it would be appropriate to increase the potential bonus level for 2009 for executive Directors from 100% to 120%.
However it was also determined that any additional bonus potential would be payable only upon the achievement of a significant out-performance of the Group against the 2009 plan and its comparator sector.
Long-term incentives The Company operates the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP or Plan, and the 2003 Save As You Earn SAYE Scheme under which awards may be granted to executive Directors.
Long-Term Incentive Plan The 2005 LTIP is the primary long-term incentive scheme of the Company.
Under the terms of the LTIP, individuals may receive an award of conditional free shares Conditional Awards with a face value at grant of up to 100% of salary per annum, vesting at least three years after grant subject to performance conditions and continued employment.
In addition, the Plan has the flexibility to grant conditional awards on a matching basis, pro rata to the number of shares purchased via the annual bonus Matching Awards.
Matching Awards may be granted over shares worth up to 37.5% of base salary per annum.
The aggregate value of annual awards Conditional and Matching is capped at 137.5% of base salary.
Under the Plan, the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to increase this cap to 200% of salary if the Committee decides there are exceptional circumstances in relation to retention and recruitment of employees.
The Remuneration Committee has determined that exceptional circumstances do currently exist in relation to the retention of certain key employees and Directors and it has therefore determined that it may be appropriate to exercise its discretion to make awards in respect of the aggregate of Conditional and Matching shares of up to 200% of salary in 2009.
In prior years, the performance criteria have been a mix of Total Shareholder Return TSR and Earnings Per Share EPS.
In respect of awards to be made in 2009, the Committee has reviewed the appropriateness of maintaining the mixed EPS and TSR vesting criterion.
Against a background of significant economic uncertainty it was determined that a TSR-based criterion would most closely align the interests of shareholders and employees.
Accordingly, for the 2009 award to be granted after the announcement of the 2008 results the Committee considers that Total Shareholder Return TSR is the most appropriate measure of performance.
The performance condition attached to the Conditional and Matching Awards is based on TSR performance measured against the constituents of the FTSE Travel & Leisure Index excluding airline companies over a single three-year period from March 2009 to March 2012.
This award will vest between 30% for median performance increasing on a straight line basis to 100% for upper quartile performance.
Shareholding guidelines Following the approval of the LTIP, shareholding guidelines for executive Directors were introduced, linked to the out-turn of the Plan.
At the time Conditional and Matching Awards vest under the Plan or any other executive plan established in the future, there is a requirement to retain no fewer than 50% of the shares net of taxes vesting under an LTIP award until a shareholding with a market value calculated by reference to purchase price equal to 100% of base salary is achieved.
SAYE Scheme The Company also operates a SAYE Share Option Scheme, the 2003 SAYE Scheme, for eligible employees under which options may be granted at a discount of up to 20% of market value.
Eligible employees are full time employees and executive Directors who have worked for the Group for at least one year.
Under the terms of the Scheme the eligible employees are able to purchase shares under a three-year savings contract.
Awards under the SAYE scheme were made in 2004, 2006 and 2008 to eligible employees and Directors.
Pension arrangements Executive Directors have individual pension arrangements in the form of personal pension plans.
The Company makes a contribution at a rate of up to 20% of basic salary towards funding each executive Directors pension plan.
To the extent that this funding exceeds the relevant current HMRC limit, the surplus may be paid as a salary supplement.
There are no unfunded pension promises or similar arrangement for Directors.
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2008 28 Directors remuneration report continued Performance graph As required by the Regulations, the graph below compares the Companys TSR performance with the FTSE 350 Travel and Leisure Share Index for each of the past five years.
The FTSE 350 Travel and Leisure Share Index has been selected for this comparison because it is the index most relevant to gauging the Companys relative performance.
This graph shows the value, by 31 December 2008, of 100 invested in The Restaurant Group plc on 31 December 2003 compared with the value of 100 invested in the FTSE All-Share Index and the FTSE 350 Travel and Leisure Share Index.
The other points plotted are the values at intervening financial year-ends.

However, it may be necessary occasionally to offer longer initial notice periods to new Directors.
All executive Directors have contracts which are subject to one years notice by either party.
In the event of early termination including following a change of control in the Company, the Directors contracts provide for compensation in line with their contractual notice period.
The details of the executive Directors contracts are summarised in the table below: Date Notice of contract period Andrew Page 28 August 2002 1 year Stephen Critoph 7 July 2004 1 year Trish Corzine 31 March 2003 1 year Non-executive Directors The service contracts of the non-executive Directors were each set for an initial three-year period thereafter renewable for periods of three years.
They are required to submit themselves for re-election every three years and the Board believes this to be appropriate in the Companys circumstances.
Tony Hughes was elected and John Jackson was re-elected in 2008.
Alan Jackson will stand for re-election at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 6 May 2009.
In addition and in accordance with best practice, John Jackson is also standing for re-election at the Annual General Meeting as he has served on the Board for more than nine years.
The non-executive Directors appointments were made as follows: Date of appointment as non-executive Director Notice period Alan Jackson 9 November 2005 1 year John Jackson 1 October 1996 Nil Tony Hughes 1 January 2008 Nil Alan Jackson was previously Executive Chairman of the Company, and was appointed in March 2001.
From 1 January 2006 he has held the position of non-executive Chairman.
All non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration with the exception of Alan Jackson is determined by the Board based on a review of fees paid to non-executive Directors of similar companies and reflects the time commitment and responsibilities of each role.
The basic fee paid to the non-executive Directors excluding Alan Jackson in the year was 50,000 2007: 45,000 pro rated by tenure of service.

Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2008 31 The Group plans to make awards under the LTIP scheme following the publication of preliminary results in March 2009.
In order to obtain taxfavoured treatment for the Group and the participants, it is planned that part of the value will be delivered to the participants using HM Revenue and Customs HMRC approved options.
These approved options have the same vesting and exercise conditions as awards under the Plan.
The maximum number of plc shares that will ultimately vest under the award will be restricted to a level similar to awards made in previous years.
Similarly, the maximum gross value a participant will ultimately receive under a combination of both the LTIP award and approved option will be at a similar level to awards made in previous years.
2003 Under the 2003 Mirror Scheme the performance criteria that must be met requires the Companys EPS to grow at an annual rate of the Retail Price Index plus 2.5% over the three-year period prior to exercise of the option.
No further awards may be made under the 2003 Scheme following the adoption of the LTIP.
LTIP 1 these are Conditional Shares awarded under the LTIP scheme.
They are free shares awarded to the Directors should the performance criteria be met.
The vesting criteria are dependent on EPS growth of the 2008 results compared with the 2005 results and TSR performance, and this vesting criterion has been met in full.
Consequently the Conditional Shares will become exercisable with effect from 4 March 2009.
LTIP 2 these are Matching Shares awarded under the LTIP scheme.
They are free shares and are conditional on the Directors acquiring and retaining a certain number of shares by 7 May 2006 for the respective Director to be entitled to the Matching Shares available under the scheme, and the performance criteria be met.
The vesting criteria are dependent on earnings per share growth of the 2008 results compared with the 2005 results and this vesting criterion has been met in full.
Consequently the Matching Shares will become exercisable with effect from 4 March 2009 to those Directors and employees who have retained their deposited shares for the full period.
LTIP 3 these are Conditional Shares awarded under the LTIP scheme.
The vesting criteria are dependent on EPS growth of the 2009 results compared with the 2006 results and TSR performance.
LTIP 4 these are Matching Shares awarded under the LTIP scheme.
They are free shares and are conditional on the Directors acquiring and retaining a certain number of shares by 30 June 2007 for the respective Director to be entitled to the Matching Shares available under the scheme, and the performance criteria be met.
The vesting criteria are dependent on earnings per share growth of the 2009 results compared with the 2006 results.
LTIP 5 these are Conditional Shares awarded under the LTIP scheme.
The vesting criteria are dependent on EPS growth of the 2010 results compared with the 2007 results and TSR performance.
LTIP 6 these are Matching Shares awarded under the LTIP scheme.
They are free shares and are conditional on the Directors acquiring and retaining a certain number of shares by 30 June 2008 for the respective Director to be entitled to the Matching Shares available under the scheme, and the performance criteria be met.
The vesting criteria are dependent on earnings per share growth of the 2010 results compared with the 2007 results.
For the Conditional Awards to executive Directors made in 2008, two separate performance conditions apply to proportions of the award.
The performance condition attached to 50% of the Conditional Awards requires average annual EPS growth from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2010 of between RPI plus 4% to RPI plus 10% p. a. for between 30% and 100% of this part of the award to vest i. e. between 15% and 50% of the total award.
The performance condition attached to the other 50% of the Conditional Awards is based on TSR performance measured against the constituents of the FTSE Travel & Leisure Index over a single three-year period from 1 March 2008 to 1 March 2011.
This award will vest between 30% for median performance increasing on a straight line basis to 100% for upper quartile performance of this award to vest i. e. between 15% for median and 50% for upper quartile performance of the total award.
Awards will vest on a straight line basis between minimum and maximum thresholds.
For Matching Awards, there is a 0.3:1 match for average EPS growth of RPI plus 4% p. a. rising on a straight line basis to the full 1:1 match for average EPS growth of RPI plus 10% p. a.
Performance against the TSR and EPS targets will be independently calculated and reviewed by the Committee.
Note 1 : Alan Jackson was granted an option over 2,400,000 ordinary shares on 5 June 2001 at an exercise price of 45p per share.
This option was divided into three tranches of 800,000 shares, each of which may only be exercised if certain performance criteria are met.
The Companys share price must meet a specified target, which is 75p in the case of the first tranche, 105p in the case of the second tranche and 135p in the case of the third tranche.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying performance of the Group before any tranche of the option can be exercised.
For the second and third tranches, half of each tranche of the option may be exercised after three years and half after four years in each case following the date of the grant.
Each tranche of the option will lapse six years following the date of the grant if the target share price has not by then been met.
If, however, the target share price relating to any tranche of the option is met within this period that tranche will remain exercisable until ten years following the date of grant.
If a change of control of the Company occurs, Alan Jackson is entitled to exercise the option in full.
The Companys share price has met the criteria of the three tranches and the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying performance of the Group.
Alan Jackson has exercised all of those options available to him under the first and second tranches, and has exercised half of the third tranche.
Approval This report was approved by the Board of Directors on 4 March 2009 and signed on its behalf by: Tony Hughes Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
