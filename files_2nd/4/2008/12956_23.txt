Key principles of our remuneration policy The key principles of our remuneration policy are to: provide competitive rewards to attract and retain executives of the highest calibre who are willing to work around the world and spend significant amounts of time or be based in West and or East Africa: apply demanding key performance indicators outputs, including financial and non-financial measures of performance: link a significant component of pay to individual and company performance to encourage and reward superior performance and to motivate our executives to facilitate the success of the company in creating value for our shareholders: ensure remuneration arrangements are equitable and facilitate the deployment of human resources around our businesses: and limit severance payments on termination to pre-established contractual arrangements that do not commit the company to making unjustified payments.
