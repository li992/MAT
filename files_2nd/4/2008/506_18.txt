Remuneration Committee: Composition, Responsibilities and Operation The names of the members of the Committee who served during the year ended 31 December 2008 are as follows: Nigel Northridge Chairman Roy McGlone resigned 1 September 2008 David Hamill Robert MacLeod The Committee has been entirely composed of Independent Non-executive Directors throughout the year.
The members of the Committee have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided, no potential con icts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day operational responsibility within the Group.
The Committees principal function is to determine the policy on remuneration for the most senior executives of the Group and to approve the speci c remuneration of the Executive Directors and the Company Secretary, including their service contracts.
The Committee also has responsibility for making a recommendation to the Board in respect of the remuneration of the Chairman.
The Committees remit therefore includes, but is not restricted to, basic salary, bene ts in kind, performance related awards, share options and share awards, Longterm Incentive Schemes, pension rights, and any compensation or termination payments.
In exercising its responsibilities the Committee has access to professional advice, both inside and outside the Company, and consults with the Chairman and Group Chief Executive.
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
The full Terms of Reference of the Committee are available on our website at http: ir.
There are a number of external advisers appointed by the Company who advise on remuneration matters for the wider workforce and also provide advice to the Committee from time to time.
Principal advisers in the year were as follows: Kepler Associates provided remuneration consultancy with respect to basic salary, bonus plans and executive Long-term Incentive Plans.
New Bridge Street Consultants provided advice on the implementation and administration of share plans.
Mercer Human Resource Consulting provided advice on retirement bene ts in the UK and overseas and administers the Groups UK fide ned bene t pension scheme.
Remuneration Policy The Committee has applied the following policy for the remuneration of Executive Directors throughout 2008.
It is intended that, subject to any change in circumstances or best practice, this policy will apply in 2009 and in future years.
Annual Salaries Salaries are determined by a combination of the individuals contribution to the business and the market rate for the position.
The Company aims to pay the market median for standard performance and pays up to the market upper quartile for upper quartile performance.
On occasions it may be necessary to pay above the market median to attract people of the right calibre to meet the needs of the business.
In setting annual salaries, as with other elements of remuneration, the Committee has discretion to consider all relevant factors, including performance on environmental, social and governance issues.
The appropriate market rate is the rate in the market place from which the individual is most likely to be recruited.
The Company operates in a number of market places throughout the world where remuneration practice and levels differ.
This can result in pay and bene t differentials between the Executive Directors.
In arriving at an appropriate market rate, we commission studies from our advisers, who carry out in-depth research on the practices of Aggrekos peer group in the UK to establish accurate benchmarks.
The same approach is taken for expatriate and overseas salaries where reference is made to the appropriate data for the geographical location.
54 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Directors Report The Companys pay systems are designed to allow progression that re ects an individuals contribution to the business and to control overall cost.
Pay and bene t structures are designed to be cost effective to be able to attract and retain a high-quality executive management team whilst achieving best value for shareholders.
The Company is always mindful of the need for good corporate governance in respect of pay and bene ts for all its employees including Directors.
Performance related elements of Remuneration At least 50% of Executive Directors cash remuneration is related to performance: performance targets are related to audited measures such as Return on Capital Employed, Trading Pro t or Group Diluted Earnings per Share.
In designing the performance-related elements of remuneration for Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee has sought to achieve a balance between incentives which drive short-term performance with those that reward long-term growth in shareholder value.
For all Executive Directors, the potential awards available under the long-term incentives are larger than those available under short-term incentives.
Executive Directors thus have a strong incentive not to sacri ce the long-term creation of value for short-term performance, and the Committee is satis ed that the Companys incentive structure does not raise environmental, social or governance risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
Annual Bonus Scheme The purpose of the Annual Bonus Scheme is to drive the short-term performance of the Group.
Targets are measured against the performance of the business in a financial year.
Bonuses are paid following Audit Committee approval of the previous years trading results, at which point the targets and quanta of bonuses for the current year are set.
Bonuses for Executive Directors with regional management responsibilities will generally have half of their bonus related to the performance of their area of the business, and half related to Group Diluted Earnings per Share D-EPS : bonus targets are related to performance against the budgets approved by the Board.
The Group Chief Executive and Finance Directors bonuses are measured exclusively against D-EPS.
In 2008 the maximum bonus earnings for the Group Chief Executive and the Regional Director responsible for North America were 125% of salary, and of other Executive Directors 100% of salary.
Long-term Incentive Programme A Long-term Incentive Programme was introduced in 2004 and revised with the approval of shareholders in 2008.
Its purpose is to balance the Annual Bonus Scheme by providing an incentive which rewards long-term growth in earnings, returns on capital and share price appreciation.
It also aids retention of talented senior managers.
The Programme is implemented annually and consists of two distinct elements: the Performance Share Plan PSP and the Co-investment Plan CIP.
In 2008 120 individuals about 4% of employees were invited to join one or both of the Plans.
The CIP and PSP have common performance measurement periods three years and performance criteria compound annual growth over the performance period of D-EPS and Return on Average Capital Employed.
The PSP is a nil-cost conditional award of shares, some, all, or none of which vest depending on performance against the targets: the number of shares conditionally awarded is related to the salary of the individual concerned and their level within the Company.
Since its inception, the largest Performance Share Plan award has been equivalent to 100% of the recipients salary, although the rules of the scheme permit higher levels.
The CIP offers individuals the opportunity to subscribe shares in Aggreko up to a maximum value of 30% of their salary each year they are invited to join the Plan: if they hold those shares for the entirety of the performance measurement period, they will be entitled to receive a minimum award of one share for every two they subscribed, plus a performance-related award of a further two shares for every three they subscribed.
The performance criteria for the Long-term Incentive Programme are set annually: in 2008 they were: 75% of the award will be measured against the real compound annual growth in D-EPS over the three-year performance measurement period in a range of 3% to 10%.
No performance shares will be awarded against this element if performance is less than 3% and awards will increase straight-line to the maximum at 10% growth.
25% of the award will be measured against the average return on capital employed over the performance period in a range of 23% to 25%.
No performance shares will be awarded against this element if performance is less than 23% and awards will increase straight-line to the maximum at 25% ROCE.
In addition to the above, and to reward truly exceptional performance, the number of shares awarded to participants in the Long-term Incentive Programme may be increased by between 1.3 and 2.0 times if the real compound annual growth in D-EPS over the three-year performance measurement period is in a range of 13% to 20%.
Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 55 Remuneration Report continued Sharesave Plans The Board believes that Sharesave schemes are valuable in aligning the interests of employees and shareholders, and the Company seeks to make it possible for as many employees as practicable to join the scheme or its various proxies.
The Aggreko Sharesave Plans are normally offered annually to employees and Executive Directors who have at least three months continuous service, and allow a maximum of 250 per month to be saved and converted into Aggreko shares at the end of either three or five year periods.
Executive Share Option Schemes Prior to 2004 senior executives were invited to participate in an Executive Share Option Scheme at the discretion of the Committee.
Following the implementation of the Performance Share and the Co-investment Plans, no further grants have been, or will be, made under these existing Executive Share Option Schemes.
The allocation of Executive Share Options was based on multiples of remuneration dependent upon the 1 seniority and job size of the individuals appointment, with the maximum multiple of 1 3 times remuneration in any one year being available to Executive Directors.
All executive options that have been granted are subject to performance conditions based on both total shareholder return TSR and growth in Earnings Per Share EPS.
TSR is calculated by reference to the increase in the Companys share price plus dividends paid.
EPS is Basic Earnings Per Share as disclosed in the Group Income Statement.
At the time when the individual wishes to exercise the option which can only normally occur after three years have elapsed since grant, the growth in the Companys TSR is compared with that of the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding investment trusts over a speci ed period.
If the Companys TSR matches or exceeds that index, and the Companys EPS growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index plus 3% per annum, over a speci ed period, the option is capable of exercise.
For options granted after 25 April 2001, retesting of performance conditions is limited to six monthly intervals between 3 and 5 years after the date of grant.
For options granted before 25 April 2001, testing of the performance conditions is made with reference to EPS growth over three consecutive years prior to the date of exercise and TSR is measured for the period from the date of grant to the date of exercise.
Retention of Shares by Executive Directors The Committee has adopted a policy that encourages Executive Directors to use the Long-term Incentive Plans and Executive Share Option Schemes to acquire and retain a material number of shares in the Company with the objective of aligning their long-term interests with those of other shareholders.
Under this policy, on vesting of share grants, Executive Directors, who are not within five years of their normal retirement age, should hold at least 50% of the net proceeds in shares until their aggregate holding is equivalent to at least 100% of their salary.
Other Bene ts Other bene ts, including pensions, are based on current market practice and take into account long-term trends in provision.
Further details on pension provision are set out on pages 59 and 60.
Service Contracts and Notice Periods All of the Executive Directors have service agreements that require one years notice of termination from the individual and one years notice of termination from the Company.
Derek Shepherd has a service contract that expires on 1 May 2009 while other Directors have a normal retirement age of 60.
On early termination, Executive Directors are entitled to basic salary and bene ts for the notice period at the rate current at the date of termination.

He is permitted to retain his earnings from that position and these earnings amounted to 48,000 for the year ended 31 December 2008 2007: 46,515.
Remuneration of Chairman and Non-executive Directors The Board, within the limits set out in the Articles of Association, determines the remuneration policy and level of fees for the Non-executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee recommends remuneration policy and level of fees for the Chairman to the Board.
Remuneration comprises an annual fee for acting as a Chairman or Non-executive Director of the Company.
Additional fees are paid to Non-executive Directors in respect of service as Chairman of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and as Senior Independent Director.
When setting these fees, reference is made to information provided by a number of remuneration surveys, the extent of the duties performed, and the size of the Company.
The Chairman and Non-executive Directors are not eligible for bonuses, retirement bene ts or to participate in any share scheme operated by the Company.
