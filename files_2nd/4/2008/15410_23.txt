In June 2005, the Committee decided to suspend granting options under the 2000 Scheme.

Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2008 91 STATUTORY INFORMATION HOW WE RUN THE BUSINESS HOW WE PERFORMED WHAT WE DO OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR Directors remuneration report Directors pension provision Iain Ferguson and John Nicholas are not members of the Tate & Lyle Group Pension Scheme Group Scheme and accordingly they accrue no pension benefits.
Instead, they receive cash allowances included in the Pension Allowance column in the table on page 89 from which they make their own pension arrangements.
Stanley Musesengwa and Stuart Strathdee are members of the Group Scheme and the information below sets out the disclosures required for them under both the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.

The figure shown represents the amount of pension benefits, based on service, pensionable earnings and, where appropriate, transferred pension rights, which would have been preserved for each director had he left service on 31 March 2008.
For each director, the figure represents the difference between the accrued pension at 31 March 2008 and the corresponding pension a year earlier.
No allowance is made for inflation.
The figures shown include an adjustment for inflation in accordance with the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
The figures shown represent the transfer value, calculated in accordance with Guidance Note 11 issued by the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries and adopted by the Board of Actuarial Standards, of the inflation adjusted increase in the total accrued pension for the year, net of the Directors own contributions.
The figures shown represent the transfer value, calculated in accordance with Guidance Note 11 issued by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries and adopted by the Board of Actuarial Standards, of the accumulated total accrued pension at 31 March 2007.
The figures shown represent the transfer value, calculated in accordance with Guidance Note 11 issued by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries and adopted by the Board of Actuarial Standards, of the accumulated total accrued pension at 31 March 2008.
During the course of the year, the actuarial basis used within the Tate & Lyle Group Pension Scheme for the purpose of determining transfer values in accordance with Guidance Note 11 was amended by the Trustee, generally resulting in an increase in transfer value amounts.
The transfer values quoted have been calculated using the actuarial bases that applied at each reporting date.
Part of the increase in the transfer values over the year is attributable to the change in actuarial basis.
The figures shown represent the increase in the transfer values from 31 March 2007 to 31 March 2008.
The transfer values quoted have been calculated using the actuarial bases which applied at each reporting date, net of the Directors own contributions.
As announced on 2 May 2008, Stanley Musesengawa will leave Tate & Lyle on 31 July 2008.
Stanley Musesengawa has worked for Tate & Lyle for over 28 years, most of which were in Africa.
The value of his pension accrued during his service in Africa is minimal and significantly less than would have been the case had he served that time in the UK.
Accordingly, the Committee has decided to augment his total accumulated pension value by around 290,000 in excess of his contractual entitlement.
This will bring his total accumulated pension value to the level of the Lifetime Allowance permitted under the UK tax regime to partially offset the negative impact of his African service on his pension entitlement.
The final pension payable to Stanley Musesengawa will still be very considerably less than a comparable director who had completed his service in the UK.
The number of shares shown as at 31 March 2008 for Iain Ferguson, Stanley Musesengwa, John Nicholas and Stuart Strathdee includes shares acquired in relation to the Deferred Bonus Share Plan as detailed in the table on page 90.
All the above interests are beneficially held.
There were no changes in directors interests in the period from 1 April 2008 to 21 May 2008.
No director had interests in any class of shares other than ordinary shares.
The Register of Directors Interests, which is open to inspection, contains full details of directors shareholdings and options to subscribe for shares.
