ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 65 Aricom, Portman, Aluminium Corp of China, Mitsubishi Materials Corp, Outokumpo OYJ and Cleveland Cliffs Inc. Of these comparator companies, Portland was acquired by Cleveland Cliffs Inc on 11 December 2008 and awards made in 2009 will be measured against a resulting comparator group of 21 companies.
The performance condition will be measured over the three year period from 1 January 2008 until 31 December 2010 and the final number of shares released to employees will depend on the final ranking of the Company against its comparators in terms of Total Shareholder Return.
If the ranking is equal to the upper quartile then 100% of the allocated shares will be released: if the ranking is equal to the median ranked company then 25% of the allocated shares will be released.
Between these two levels of performance, vesting is on a pro-rata basis.
No shares will be released if the ranking is below median.
In addition to the above, the awards will not vest unless the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the Companys Total Shareholder Return over the performance period reflects the underlying financial performance of the Group.
The Committee considers that Total Shareholder Return remains the most appropriate measure of long-term Company performance, providing alignment of interests between management and shareholders, and therefore intends that 2009 LTIP awards will be subject to the same performance condition.
Any acquired comparator companies will be dropped from the comparator group.
In 2008, the maximum level of award under the LTIP was set at 200% of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 150% of base salary for the Chief Financial Officer, based on the average market value of the shares over the five days preceding the date of grant.

Pensions and benefits Both Executive Directors are members of the ENRC Personal Pension Plan, a defined contribution pension scheme.
An employer contribution of 10% of base salary is made to the Plan on behalf of each Executive Director, subject to the UK Governments annual cap on such contributions.
Accordingly, for the year ended 31 December 2008 amounts of 150,000 and 60,000 were paid into the Plan in respect of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer respectively.
Benefits comprise life assurance, private healthcare, travel insurance and income protection insurance.
