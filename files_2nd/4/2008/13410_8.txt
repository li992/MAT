The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain financial instruments, share based payments and retirement benefit obligations.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the following restatements have been made to the comparative amounts: i The consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2007 has been restated for final fair value adjustments applied to the 2007 acquisition of OI Plastics.
For further information see note 28 to the consolidated financial statements.
ii The definition of exceptional items was changed in 2008 to exclude the amortisation of certain acquired intangible assets, comprising acquired customer contracts and relationships and acquired technology and patents, and to exclude fair value changes on non hedge accounted financing derivative financial instruments and hedge ineffectiveness on financing derivative financial instruments.
These items have been excluded from exceptional items as they are recurring in nature and are now presented separately on the face of the consolidated income statement.
The following accounting standards and amendments to existing standards are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group.
This new standard requires identification and reporting of operating segments on the basis of internal reports that are regularly reviewed by the Board in order to allocate resources to the segment and assess its performance.
The Group will adopt IFRS8 from 1 January 2009. ii IAS23 Revised Borrowing Costs.
This revision of an existing standard requires the capitalisation of borrowing costs directly attributable to an acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale as part of the cost of that asset.
The Group will adopt IAS23 Revised from 1 January 2009. iii IFRS3 Revised Business Combinations.
This revision of an existing standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations with certain changes which could impact the Group.
For example, all payments to purchase a business must be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date with some contingent payments subsequently remeasured at fair value through the consolidated income statement.
In addition, all transaction costs must be expensed.
The Group expects to adopt IFRS3 Revised from 1 January 2010. iv IAS27 Revised Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements.
This revision to an existing standard requires an entity to attribute total recognised income and expense to the parent company and any minority interest even if this results in the minority interest having a deficit balance.
It specifies that changes in a parent companys ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in the loss of control must be accounted for as equity transactions.
It also specifies how an entity should measure any gain or loss arising on the loss of control of a subsidiary, whereby at the date when control is lost, any investment retained in the former subsidiary will have to be measured at its fair value.
The Group expects to adopt IAS27 Revised from 1 January 2010.
There are no other accounting standards or IFRICs that are not yet effective that would have an impact on the Group.
Key estimates and assumptions The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, ultimately actual results may differ from those estimates.
The key estimates and assumptions used in these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
Goodwill impairment testing Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment in accordance with the accounting policy for goodwill set out below and in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
The recoverable amounts of cash generating units are determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations require the use of estimates which include cash flow projections for each cash generating unit and discount rates based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific risks associated with particular cash generating units.
Valuation of acquired intangible assets Identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business must initially be recorded at fair value.
The acquisition of Rostar in 2008 resulted in significant customer contracts and relationships being recognised by the Group.
These intangible assets were valued using the income approach.
The underlying premise in applying this approach is that the value of an asset can be measured by the present value of the cash receipts and cash payments to be received and made over the life of the asset.
In applying this methodology certain key judgements and estimates were required to be made in respect of future gross cash flows and the discount rate.
Retirement bene t obligations The consolidated financial statements include costs in relation to, and provision for, retirement benefit obligations.
There are two principal funded defined benefit pension plans in the UK and US and an unfunded retiree medical plan in the US.
The costs and the present value of any related pension assets and liabilities depend on such factors as life expectancy of the members, the salary progression of current employees, the returns that plan assets generate and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the liabilities.
The Group uses estimates based on previous experience and third party actuarial advice in determining these future cash flows and in determining the discount rate.
If the discount rate was to fall by 0.5%, the net liabilities of the plans at 31 December 2008 would rise by approximately 95m 2007: 120m.
If equity values were to fall by 10%, then the plan assets at 31 December 2008 would fall by approximately 75m 2007: 90m.
The accounting policy for retirement benefit obligations is set out below and details of the assumptions used for the two principal pension plans and the retiree medical plan are set out in note 24 to the consolidated financial statements.
74 Rexam Annual Report 2008 1 Principal accounting policies continued Income taxes Judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes.
There are many transactions and calculations whose ultimate tax treatment is uncertain.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes are likely to be due.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities based on estimates of future taxable income and recoverability.
Where a change in circumstance occurs, or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax balances in the year in which that change or outcome is known.
The accounting policy for income taxes is set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise Rexam PLC and all its subsidiaries, together with the Groups share of the results of its associates and joint ventures.
The financial statements of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are prepared as of the same reporting date using consistent accounting policies.
Intercompany balances and transactions, including any unrealised profits arising from intercompany transactions, are eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are entities where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanied by a share of more than 50% of the voting rights.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are included until the date on which the Group ceases to control them.
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanied by a share of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights.
Joint ventures are entities over which the Group has joint control, whereby the strategic, financial and operating decisions relating to the venture require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control and are generally accompanied by a 50% share of voting rights.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
If the Groups share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its investment in the associate or joint venture, the Group does not recognise further losses unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.
All acquisitions are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair values, at the acquisition date, of the assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group, together with any costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree are measured initially at fair value at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised as goodwill.
Foreign currencies The financial statements for each of the Groups subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are prepared using their functional currency.
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates.
The presentation currency of the Group is sterling.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.
Exceptions to this are where the monetary items form part of the net investment in a foreign operation or designated as hedges of a net investment, or designated as cash flow hedges.
Such exchange differences are initially recognised in equity.
The balance sheets of foreign operations are translated into sterling using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the income statements are translated into sterling using the average exchange rate for the year.
Where this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, the exchange rate on the transaction date is used.
Exchange differences on translation into sterling arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign operation, any cumulative exchange differences held in equity are transferred to the consolidated income statement.
Following the acquisition of Rostar, which had the Russian rouble as its functional currency, the functional currency of Rexams pre existing Russian business was changed, with effect from 1 January 2008, from the US dollar to the Russian rouble.
This change was made to reflect the primary economic environment in which the combined business operates.
The principal exchange rates against sterling used in these consolidated financial statements are as follows: Average Closing Average Closing 2008 2008 2007 2007 Euro 1.26 1.04 1.46 1.37 US dollar 1.86 1.48 2.00 1.99 Revenue recognition Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration, net of rebates and trade discounts.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the Group has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods to the buyer, when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group, typically on delivery of goods.
The Group makes certain advance payments to customers in relation to contracts which are charged in the consolidated income statement over the useful economic lives of the contracts.
Rexam Annual Report 2008 75 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies continued Exceptional items Items which are exceptional, being material in terms of size and or nature are presented separately from underlying business performance in the consolidated income statement.
The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide an indication of the Groups underlying business performance.
The principal events which may give rise to exceptional items include the restructuring and integration of businesses, significant changes to retirement benefit obligations, gains or losses on the disposal of businesses, major asset impairments and significant litigation and tax claims.
The definition of exceptional items was changed in 2008 as explained above.
Retirement bene t obligations The Group operates defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution pension plans.
A defined benefit pension plan is one that specifies the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement.
The Group operates both funded defined benefit pension plans, where actuarially determined payments are made to trustee administered funds, and unfunded defined benefit pension plans, where no such payments are made.
The asset or liability recognised in the consolidated balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets at the balance sheet date.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated, at least triennially, by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method and is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
The current service cost and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are included in operating expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Past service costs are similarly included where the benefits have vested, otherwise they are amortised on a straight line basis over the vesting period.
The expected return on assets of funded defined benefit pension plans, less administration expenses of pension plans, and the interest on pension plan liabilities comprise the pension element of the net finance cost in the consolidated income statement.
Differences between the actual and expected return on assets, experience gains and losses and changes in actuarial assumptions are included in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
A defined contribution plan is one under which fixed contributions are paid to a third party.
The Group has no further payment obligations once these contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised in the consolidated income statement when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is likely.
The Group also provides post retirement healthcare benefits retiree medical to certain of its current and former employees.
The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on an employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period.
The consolidated income statement and consolidated balance sheet treatment with respect to retiree medical is similar to that for defined benefit pension plans.
These obligations are valued by independent actuaries, usually on an annual basis.
Share based payment The Group operates various equity settled and cash settled share option schemes.
For equity settled share options, the services received from employees are measured by reference to the fair value of the share options.
The fair value is calculated at grant date and recognised in the consolidated income statement, together with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of options that will eventually vest.
Vesting conditions, other than market conditions, are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
For cash settled share options, the services received from employees are measured at the fair value of the liability and recognised in the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period.
The fair value of the liability is measured at each balance sheet date and at the date of settlement with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated income statement.
IFRS2 Share based Payment has been applied to equity settled share options granted after 7 November 2002 and to all cash settled share options.
The Rexam Employee Share Trust holds ordinary shares in Rexam PLC which are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
Interest Interest on cash and cash equivalents and borrowings held at amortised cost is recognised in the consolidated income statement using the effective interest method.
Interest includes exchange differences arising on cash and cash equivalents and borrowings, where such exchange differences are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Interest includes all fair value gains and losses on derivative financial instruments, and corresponding adjustments to hedged items under designated fair value hedging relationships, where they relate to financing activities and are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Interest relating to payments made over an extended period of development of large capital projects is added to the capital cost and amortised over the expected lives of those projects.
Non hedge accounted financing derivative financial instruments fair value changes and hedge ineffectiveness on financing derivative financial instruments are separately disclosed, within interest, on the face of the consolidated income statement.
Segment reporting The Groups primary reporting format is business segments and its secondary format is geographic segments.
A business segment is a component of the Group that is engaged in providing a group of related products and is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographic segment is a component of the Group that operates within a particular economic environment and that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of components operating in other economic environments.
Non specific central costs are allocated on the basis of net assets excluding investments in associates and joint ventures, net borrowings, deferred tax, current tax and non current tax.
76 Rexam Annual Report 2008 1 Principal accounting policies continued Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
At the date of acquisition, goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions on or before 31 December 1997 has been deducted from equity.
Gains and losses on the disposal of a business include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the business sold except for any goodwill deducted from equity.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is presented in goodwill and goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates and joint ventures is presented in investments in associates and joint ventures.
Internally generated goodwill is not recognised as an asset.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation begins when an asset is available for use and is calculated on a straight line basis to allocate the cost of the asset over its estimated useful life as follows: Acquired computer software 2 to 3 years Computer software development Up to 7 years Acquired customer contracts and relationships 5 to 20 years Acquired technology and patents 5 to 20 years Development projects Up to 5 years The cost of intangible assets acquired in an acquisition is the fair value at acquisition date.
The cost of separately acquired intangible assets, including computer software, comprises the purchase price and any directly attributable costs of preparing the asset for use.
Computer software development costs that are directly associated with the implementation of major business systems are capitalised as intangible assets.
Expenditure on research is recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement as incurred.
Expenditure incurred on development projects is capitalised as an intangible asset if it is probable that the expenditure will generate future economic benefits and can be measured reliably.
The amortisation of certain acquired intangible assets, comprising acquired customer contracts and relationships and acquired technology and patents, is separately disclosed within operating profit on the face of the consolidated income statement.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost comprises purchase price and directly attributable costs.
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated.
For all other property, plant and equipment, depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis to allocate cost, less residual value of the assets, over their estimated useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings Up to 50 years Leasehold buildings Shorter of 50 years or lease term Manufacturing machinery 7 to 17 years Computer hardware Up to 8 years Fixtures, fittings and vehicles 4 to 10 years Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least at each financial year end.
Impairment of assets This policy applies to all assets except inventories, deferred tax assets, financial assets and non current assets classified as held for sale.
At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired.
Where an indicator of impairment exists, the Group makes an estimate of recoverable amount.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is written down to its recoverable amount.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use and is determined for an individual asset.
If the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is determined.
Discount rates reflecting the asset specific risks and the time value of money are used for the value in use calculation.
When an asset is written down to its recoverable amount the impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement in the year in which it is incurred.
Impairment losses incurred in a cash generating unit or group of cash generating units are applied against the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units.
Where no goodwill exists, the impairment losses reduce the other assets of the cash generating units.
Should circumstances change which result in a reversal of a previous impairment loss, the value of the asset is increased and the reversal is recognised in the consolidated income statement in the year in which it occurs.
The increase in the carrying amount of the asset is limited to the amount of which would have been recorded had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.
Impairment losses applied to goodwill are not reversed.
Rexam Annual Report 2008 77 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies continued Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined on a first in first out or a weighted average cost basis.
Cost comprises directly attributable purchase and conversion costs and an allocation of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion and selling costs.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement comprise cash at bank and in hand, money market deposits and other short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are presented in borrowings within current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
Assets and liabilities classi ed as held for sale The assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are available for immediate sale in their present condition and a sale is highly probable within one year.
Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amount is recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
Non current assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated or amortised and any future write down to fair value less costs to sell will be recognised as an impairment loss.
Grants Grants received in respect of property, plant and equipment are capitalised and released to the consolidated income statement in equal instalments over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group.
Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the liability and finance charge to produce a constant rate of interest on the finance lease balance outstanding.
Assets capitalised under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Leases other than finance leases are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Any incentives to enter into operating leases are recognised as a reduction of rental expense over the lease term on a straight line basis.
Income taxes The tax expense represents the sum of current tax, non current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax and non current tax are based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the consolidated income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax arising from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than an acquisition, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, is not recognised.
Deferred tax is measured using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement, unless the tax relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the tax is recognised directly in equity through the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when a present obligation exists in respect of a past event and where the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions for restructuring are recognised for direct expenditure on business reorganisations where plans are sufficiently detailed and well advanced, and where appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken on or before the balance sheet date.
Provisions are discounted where the time value of money is considered to be material.
Dividends Final equity dividends to the shareholders of Rexam PLC are recognised in the period that they are approved by the shareholders.
Interim equity dividends are recognised in the period that they are paid.
78 Rexam Annual Report 2008 1 Principal accounting policies continued Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments utilised by the Group include interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and forward aluminium, resin and energy commodity contracts.
Certain derivative financial instruments are designated as hedges in line with the Groups risk management policies.
Hedges are classified as follows: i Fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability.
ii Cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecasted transaction.
iii Net investment hedges where they hedge exposure to changes in the value of the Groups interests in the net assets of foreign operations.
For fair value hedges, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and similarly recognised in the consolidated income statement.
For cash flow hedges and net investment hedges, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity, with any ineffective portion recognised in the consolidated income statement.
When hedged cash flows result in the recognition of a non financial asset or liability, the associated gains or losses previously recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the consolidated income statement in the same period in which the hedged cash flows affect the consolidated income statement.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges and embedded derivatives that are not closely related to the host contract are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.

Of the total deferred tax assets, 29m 2007: 14m are recoverable within one year.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balance net.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised where it is probable that they will be recovered.
In recognising deferred tax assets, the Group has considered if it is more likely than not that sufficient future profits will be available to absorb tax losses and other temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets of 45m 2007: 35m have not been recognised in respect of losses, tax credits on dividends and other temporary differences due to the uncertainty of the availability of suitable profits in the foreseeable future.
The principal items on which no deferred tax assets have been recognised are tax losses of 90m 2007: 60m and UK tax credits on foreign dividends of 20m 2007: 18m.
There is no expiry date on either of these items.
No deferred tax has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
If the earnings were remitted in full, tax of 278m 2007: 205m would be payable.

The cash flow projections used in these calculations were based on the financial budget for 2009, as approved by senior management in January 2009, and the plans for 2010 and 2011, as approved by management in October 2008 together the budget projections.
The plans for 2010 and 2011 have been adjusted, where appropriate, to reflect any significant expected changes in trading or market conditions since October 2008.
Cash flows beyond the three year period have been extrapolated using a growth rate not in excess of the long term average growth rate in the sectors and countries in which each cash generating unit or group of cash generating units operate.
The principal accounting policies confirm that the calculation of value in use requires the use of estimates which, although based on managements best knowledge, may ultimately differ from actual results.
The discount rates used in the goodwill impairment calculations have a significant impact.
The pre tax discount rates used for the cash generating units for which the carrying amount of goodwill is significant in comparison with the total Group are as set out below.
2008 2007 % % Beverage Cans Europe 11 11 Beverage Cans USA 11 11 Beverage Cans Brazil 16 14 Plastic Packaging Healthcare, Closures and Personal Care 11 11 Other key assumptions used in the recoverable amount calculation include: i Sales and margins.
Forecasts are based on sector level analyses of sales, markets, costs and competitors used for the budget projections.
Consideration is given to past experience and knowledge of future contracts.
ii Raw materials and energy price inflation.
Forecasts for aluminium are based on forward prices at the time the budget projections are prepared and take into account pass through of costs and hedging.
Forecasts for other raw materials and energy are based on inflation forecasts and supply and demand factors.
Management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any cash generating unit to exceed its recoverable amount.

Customer credit facilities for new customers must be approved by designated managers at business level or by senior sector management.
Credit limits are set with reference to trading history and reports from credit rating agencies.
Customer credit facilities are reviewed at the sales order entry stage and at the time of shipment so as not to exceed customer limits.
Overdue accounts are regularly reviewed and impairment provisions are created where necessary.
As a matter of policy, all outstanding trade balances greater than three months are fully provided except as approved by senior sector management and with due regard to the historical risk profile of the customer.
The Group has extremely low historical levels of customer credit defaults, due in part to the blue chip multinational nature of many of its customers and the long term relationships it has with them.
There were no new customers in 2008 where the Group considered there was a risk of significant credit default.
There are no trade and other receivables that would otherwise be past due or impaired whose terms have been renegotiated.

Proceeds from these have been used initially to pay down drawings under a revolving credit facility but will ultimately refinance 370m of medium term notes which mature in March 2009.
The Group has a range of bank borrowings maturing between 2009 and 2012.
These facilities may generally be drawn in a range of freely available currencies and are at floating rates of interest.
In addition the Group has a subordinated bond and a number of medium term notes in issue.
The subordinated bond is denominated in euros with a maturity of 2067.
It was issued at a fixed rate of interest but has been swapped to US dollar floating rates of interest through the use of cross currency and interest rate derivatives.
The medium term notes are denominated in euros and sterling with maturities between 2009 and 2013.
They were issued at fixed rates of interest although some have been swapped to floating rates of interest in euro and US dollar through the use of cross currency and interest rate derivatives.
Those medium term notes not swapped to floating rates of interest are denominated in euros and are issued at a fixed rate of 4.375% per annum.

Market values have been used to determine the fair values of available for sale financial assets, bank overdrafts and floating rate loans.
The carrying value of trade and other receivables and trade and other payables are assumed to approximate their fair values due to their short term nature.
The fair values of the US public bond, subordinated bond and medium term notes have been determined by reference to quoted market prices at the close of business on 31 December.
As the US private placement is not a publicly traded instrument, its fair value has been approximated using the market value of the US public bond, which has a similar maturity date.
The fair values of interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, fixed rate loans and finance leases have been determined by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts has been determined by marking those contracts to market against prevailing forward foreign exchange rates.
The fair value of forward commodity contracts has been determined by marking those contracts to market at prevailing forward prices.
Rexam Annual Report 2008 97 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 23 Financial instruments continued ii Financial risk management The Group bases its financial risk management on sound economic objectives and good corporate practice.
Group Treasury operations are carried out under strict policies and parameters defined by the Rexam Board and supervised by its Finance Committee.
Group Treasury is not operated as a separate profit centre nor does it enter into any transactions for speculative purposes.
The Groups major operational hedges comply with IAS39 and hedge accounting treatment is applied.
Some smaller trading exposures are hedged on an economic basis and hedge accounting treatment is not applied where the compliance burden is deemed to be onerous and the income statement volatility arising is not expected to be significant.
a Market risk: currencies Currency risks arise from the multi currency cashflows within the Group.
These risks arise from exchange rate fluctuations relating to the translation of balance sheet items of foreign subsidiaries translation risk and from currency flows from sales and purchases transaction risks.
The policy regarding translation risk is to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange movements between overseas currencies and sterling arising on the translation of the value of non UK operations into sterling for reporting purposes.
This is achieved by borrowing a proportion of debt, either directly or through the use of cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts, in currencies which match or are closely linked to the currencies of the overseas businesses.
This approach also provides some protection against the foreign exchange translation of overseas earnings as it matches the currency of earnings to the currency of the interest expense.
These amounts are included in the consolidated financial statements by translation into sterling at the balance sheet date and, where hedge accounted, offset in equity against the translation movement in net assets.
The policy regarding transaction risk is to hedge the reported net transaction exposure in full less an allowance for variability in forecasting.
This is generally achieved through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts with amounts hedged being based on the reporting from individual Group businesses.
None of the foreign exchange derivative instruments at 31 December 2008 related to derivative trading activity, although some fair value gains and losses were taken to the consolidated income statement because IAS39 hedge accounting treatment was not applied.
Foreign exchange derivative instruments are used for hedging general business exposures in foreign currencies such as the purchase and sale of goods, capital expenditure and dividend flows.
Transactional foreign exchange risks are hedged by Group Treasury unless it is a legal requirement in the country where the foreign exchange risk arises that hedging is carried out locally.
In this case, hedging is carried out by the individual responsible for treasury within the local business, but still operating within the overall Group policy on foreign exchange management.
The net consolidated balance sheets of the Group at 31 December, split by underlying significant currencies, is set out below.

The objective of the Groups interest rate risk management is to manage its exposure to the impact of changes in interest rates in the currencies in which debt is borrowed.
Group policy is to keep between 20% and 80% of interest at fixed rates.
Interest rate risk is managed through the issue of fixed rate debt and through the use of interest rate derivatives that are used to manage the overall fixed to floating mix of debt, which was 48% fixed and 52% floating at 31 December 2008 2007: 32% and 68%.
Group Treasury operates within a broad framework in respect of the mix of fixed and floating rate debt, as the optimum blend will vary depending on the mix of currencies and the Groups view of the debt markets at any point in time.
98 Rexam Annual Report 2008 23 Financial instruments continued Cash at bank earns interest at floating rates based on bank deposit rates in the relevant currency.
Short term deposits are made for varying periods of between one day and three months depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group and earn interest at the respective short term deposit rates.
Other floating rate financial instruments are at the appropriate LIBOR interest rates as adjusted by variable margins.
Interest on floating rate financial instruments is re-priced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on fixed rate financial instruments is fixed until maturity of the instrument.
Some interest rate swaps used to manage the Groups fixed to floating debt mix, while economically effective, are ineligible for hedge accounting treatment.
Fair value gains and losses on these hedges are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
In 2008, there was a net loss of 2m 2007: 2m on fair value changes on financing derivative financial instruments, disclosed separately within interest in the consolidated income statement.
c Market risk: commodity prices Changes in the market price of commodities used by the Group create commodity risk.
Group policy is to manage these risks through both its supply chain management and through use of financial derivatives.
Where financial derivatives are used, the Group uses mainly over the counter instruments transacted with banks, which are themselves priced through a recognised commodity exchange, such as the London Metal Exchange.
The Group manages the purchase of certain raw materials, including aluminium, resin and energy costs through physical supply contracts which, in the main, relate directly to commodity price indices.
With regard to aluminium, which represents the Groups largest commodity exposure, the policy is to eliminate as far as possible any market price variability through hedging in tandem with contractual commitments.
For other commodities, the policy is to hedge a reducing proportion of exposure over typically three years ahead, the extent of the forward cover taken is judged according to market conditions and prices of futures prevailing at the time.
None of the commodity derivative financial instruments at 31 December 2008 related to derivative trading activity, although some fair value gains and losses were taken to the consolidated income statement because IFRS hedge accounting was not applied.
The commodity hedges mainly relate to contracted and expected future purchases of aluminium, but also include resin and energy.
d Market risk: sensitivities A sensitivity analysis for financial assets and liabilities affected by market risk is set out below.
Each risk is analysed separately and shows the sensitivity of financial assets and liabilities when a certain risk is changed.
The sensitivity analysis has been performed on balances at 31 December each year and therefore is not representative of transactions throughout the year.
The rates used are based on historical trends and, where relevant, projected forecasts.
Key methods and assumptions made when performing the sensitivity analysis net of hedging : a For the floating rate element of interest rate swaps, the sensitivity calculation is performed based on the floating rates as at 31 December each year and the number of days since the last interest rate reset date.
b The translation impact of overseas subsidiaries is not included in the sensitivity analysis.
c The sensitivity analysis ignores any tax implications.
Currencies The foreign exchange rate sensitivity analysis set out in the table below is based on foreign currency positions, other than each Group entitys own functional currency, on the balance sheet at 31 December.
The analysis includes only risks arising from financial instruments and gives the estimated impact on profit before tax and equity of a reasonable increase and decrease in exchange rates between currency pairs with significant currency positions.

Rexam Annual Report 2008 99 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 23 Financial instruments continued Interest rates At 31 December 2008, if the US dollar interest rate was increased or reduced by 2% with all other variables held constant, profit before tax would reduce or increase by 21m, respectively 2007: 1% and 4m, mainly as a result of US dollar denominated floating rate debt.
There was no significant interest rate risk relating to equity in either year.
Commodity prices There was no price risk relating to the income statement since all commodity derivatives are treated as cash flow hedges, with movements being reflected in equity.
At 31 December 2008, if the aluminium price was increased or reduced by 20% with all other variables held constant, equity would increase or decrease by 68m, respectively 2007: 10% and 27m.
Equity prices The Group is not subject to any significant equity price risk.
e Liquidity risk The Group monitors its liquidity to maintain a sufficient level of undrawn committed debt facilities, thereby ensuring financial flexibility.
As at 31 December 2008, Rexam had 732m of undrawn committed debt facilities available, 2007: 707m.
The increase in undrawn committed facilities reflects Rexams action to reduce liquidity risk in response to deteriorating conditions in the financial markets.
Since 31 December 2008, 480m of new committed debt facilities have been signed with maturities ranging between February 2011 and April 2011.
Group Treasury mitigates refinancing risk by raising its debt requirements from a range of different sources and with a range of maturity dates.
As at 31 December 2008, committed debt maturities ranged from less than one year 13% of drawn debt 2007: less than two years 18% of drawn debt to 2067 24% of drawn debt 2007: 2067, 32% of drawn debt.
No more than 42% of drawn debt 2007: 32% of drawn debt expires in any one financial year.

There are no significant concentrations of credit risk associated with financial instruments of the Group.
Credit risk arises from exposures to external counterparties.
In order to manage this risk, the Group has strict credit quality measures that are applied to counterparty institutions and also limits on maximum exposure levels to any one counterparty.
To manage credit risk, the maximum limits for Group bank exposures held under company policy are set out below by counterparty credit rating category.
These limits are used when making investments and for the use of derivative instruments.
The table also sets out the Groups financial asset exposure at 31 December for each counterparty credit rating category.

This objective is always subject to an overriding principle that capital must be managed to ensure the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
The Group is able to adjust its capital structure through the issue or redemption of either debt or equity and by adjustment to the dividend paid to equity holders.
The Group uses a range of financial metrics to monitor the efficiency of its capital structure, including its weighted average cost of capital and net debt to EBITDA and ensures that its capital structure provides sufficient financial strength to allow it to secure access to debt finance at reasonable cost.
At 31 December 2008, the Groups net debt to EBITDA for financial covenant purposes was 2.7 times 2007: 2.2 times.
The Group aims to keep this ratio within the range 1.25 times to 3.5 times.
For this purpose net debt is broadly net borrowings adjusted to exclude interest accruals, certain derivative financial instruments and an equity portion of the subordinated bond and reflects non sterling amounts at average exchange rates.
EBITDA is underlying operating profit from continuing operations after adding back depreciation and amortisation of computer software and adjusted to include acquisitions on a pro forma basis and excludes disposed businesses.

These swaps hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of medium term notes which mature in 2009 and 2013 2007: 2009 and 2013.
The cross currency swaps hedge changes in the fair value of the euro subordinated bond which matures in 2067.
Ineffectiveness gains of 29m were included in interest in 2008 2007: 1m.
Cash ow hedges The Group has designated forward foreign exchange, aluminium commodity, resin commodity and gas commodity contracts as cash flow hedges.
Forward foreign exchange contracts hedge foreign currency transaction risk and mature between 2009 and 2010 2007: between 2008 and 2009.
The aluminium commodity, resin commodity and gas commodity contracts hedge anticipated future purchases of aluminium, resin and gas respectively, and mature between 2009 and 2011 2007: aluminium between 2008 and 2009.
Not hedge accounted Derivatives are not used for trading purposes.
However, under IAS39 some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is more appropriate.

The resulting returns for equities, bonds and cash were then reduced to allow for administration expenses.
The mortality assumptions used in valuing the liabilities of the UK pension plan in 2008 and 2007 are based on the standard tables PA92 as published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.
These tables are adjusted to reflect the circumstances of the plan membership.
The life expectancy assumed for male pensioners aged 65 is 21.2 years 2007: 19.6 years and for female pensioners aged 65 is 24.3 years 2007: 22.4 years.
The life expectancy at age 65 assumed for male non pensioners currently aged 45 is 23.4 years 2007: 21.8 years and for female non pensioners currently aged 45 is 26.7 years 2007: 24.5 years.
The mortality assumptions used in valuing the liabilities of the US pension plans in 2008 are based on the RP2000 combined active and retiree mortality table projected to 2006 2007: RP2000 combined active and retiree mortality table projected to 2006 weighted 70% blue collar and 30% white collar.
The life expectancy assumed for male pensioners aged 65 is 17.8 years 2007: 17.8 years and for female pensioners aged 65 is 20.2 years 2007: 20.2 years.

Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive all shareholder documents, to attend, speak and exercise voting rights, either in person or by proxy, on resolutions proposed at general meetings and participate in any distribution of income or capital.
The directors may refuse to register a transfer of ordinary shares where such transfer documents are not lodged by acceptable means or proof of title is required.
Ordinary shares are held by the Rexam Employee Share Trust Trust for the satisfaction of options granted through the Long Term Incentive Schemes LTIP, Deferred Bonus Incentive Scheme DBIS and in part, through the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS.
The independent trustee of the Trust has the same rights as any other shareholder.
The options granted under the Companys other share incentive schemes are satisfied from the issue of new ordinary shares.
Participants do not hold any voting rights on the ordinary shares under option until the date of exercise.
There are no restrictions on the voting rights of holders of ordinary shares nor any known agreements between holders of ordinary shares under which financial rights are held by any person other than the registered holder, or voting rights or the transfer of ordinary shares are restricted.
Rexam Annual Report 2008 109 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 27 Share based payment Rexams equity settled share based payment schemes comprise the LTIP, DBIS, ESOS and the Savings Related Share Option Schemes SAYE.
Rexams cash settled share based payment scheme is the Phantom Stock Plan Phantoms.
LTIP Annual grants of options over ordinary shares are made to executive directors and certain senior executives.
The Total Shareholder Return TSR of Rexam is measured and compared to a comparator group of listed companies.
The percentage of share options that actually vest is dependent upon Rexams comparative TSR over a three year measurement period, commencing on 1 January of the year in which the option is granted.
If performance targets are met, share options vest on 1 January, three years after the start of the measurement period and can be exercised at a nominal cost to the employee.
The expiry date is six years and eleven months after the grant date.
DBIS A grant of options was made during 2007 to an executive director.
The number of shares that vested was measured over 2007 against a non market based condition relating to an OI Plastics operating profit target.
The option may be exercised at nominal cost to the participant for a period of three months from 1 January 2010 and, subject to the director being an employee of the Group at the time, will expire on 31 March 2010.
ESOS Annual grants of options over ordinary shares are made to certain senior management.
For grants up to and including 2006, shares vest if a performance target annual growth rate of pre determined economic profit is met over the three year measurement period.
No performance target was set for the 2008 and 2007 grants and the options will vest three years after the grant date, provided the participant is an employee of the Group at that time.
Share options are exercisable three years after grant date and expire ten years after grant date.
The exercise price is set at market value using the market price of a Rexam ordinary share at the grant date.
SAYE All employee SAYE schemes are open to eligible employees resident in the UK and Ireland.
Annual grants of options over ordinary shares are currently made at an exercise price of 80% of the market value of Rexam shares at the grant date.
Share options vest three, five or seven years after the commencement of the savings contract, depending on the term selected by the employee at grant and expire six months after vesting.
Phantoms This scheme operates in the same way as the ESOS with the same terms and conditions.
Grants are made to senior management located outside the UK and Europe and are settled in cash.

Historical volatilities are arrived at using a period comparable with the expected life of the option.
The correlation coefficient for the LTIP is calculated using the correlation matrix for the TSR simulation using three year daily historical stock price series for each company in the comparator group, including Rexam, from the beginning of the measurement period.
A ten year life is initially assumed to calculate the fair value of phantoms.
As the fair value is updated at each subsequent valuation the expected life is reduced for each year until exercise.
