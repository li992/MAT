This approach was followed in setting salaries for the Executive Directors from 1 January 2009, as set out below, where 2008 salaries are also shown for comparison.
This was set initially at a lower level than the other Executive Directors with regional responsibilities as he was new to the role.
A higher increase was applied to Ranald Spiers in January 2009 to reflect his increasing experience in the role.
The 3% increase awarded to all Directors, with the exception of Ranald Spiers, is in line with average increases for our UK employees.
Annual bonus International Powers Executive Directors are eligible to participate in an annual performance bonus plan, which is awarded for the achievement of stretching individual and collective, financial and non-financial targets over the financial year.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for all Executive Directors is 100% of base salary.
The target level of payout for each of the financial measures is set at 67% of the maximum and this becomes payable typically upon achieving budgeted levels of performance.
The table below sets out for each Executive Director the performance measures, which reflect the extent to which the Remuneration Committee believes they are both relevant to the Executive Directors role and open to influence by the individual.
The Committee undertakes an annual review into whether the most appropriate measures are used for the Executive Directors bonus arrangements.
These measures of EPS, free cash flow and PFO are the KPIs used to monitor the financial performance of the business.

The Remuneration Committee always maintains discretion to ensure that bonus awards are appropriate in the context of both the economic environment and the Companys performance.

Pension benefits The pension arrangements for Philip Cox, Mark Williamson and Ranald Spiers are provided through the Senior Section of the International Power Group of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme ESPS, which is an Her Majestys Revenue and Customs HMRC registered scheme.
The scheme provides for: a normal retirement age of 60 an accrual rate that targets two-thirds of pensionable salary at normal retirement age death-in-service benefit of four times capped salary a spouses pension on death in retirement of two-thirds of the Executives pre-commutation pension The member pension contribution is the lower of 6% of uncapped salary and 15% of the notional earnings cap, which is based on the limits previously imposed by HMRC.
The benefits provided through the scheme are also restricted by an earnings cap based on that previously imposed by HMRC.
To compensate for this, the scheme benefits are supplemented by additional life assurance cover and the provision of a non-pensionable cash allowance.
The cash allowance comprises the balance of 33% of salary which is the limit that the Committee has established to provide all pension benefits less the employer contribution and the cost of the additional life assurance.
Governance 93 The pension arrangements for Tony Concannon and Steve Riley are also provided through the Senior Section of the International Power Group of the ESPS, but they are not restricted by the HMRC earnings cap as they joined the scheme prior to 1 June 1989.
The scheme provides for: a normal retirement age of 60 an accrual rate that targets two-thirds of pensionable salary at normal retirement age death-in-service benefit of four times salary a spouses pension on death in retirement of two-thirds of the Executives pre-commutation pension The Executives pension contribution is 6% of uncapped salary.
The Company does not supplement this arrangement.
The pension arrangements for Bruce Levy are provided through a 401k Savings Plan, a Retirement Plan and a Supplemental Retirement Plan, which are money-purchase schemes operated by International Power America, up to a total cost to the Company of 33% of salary.
Further information on the Executive Directors pension benefits for 2008 can be found within the audited section of this Report, on pages 95 to 99.
