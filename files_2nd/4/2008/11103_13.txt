Remuneration Report This report contains the information required by the Companies Act 1985 and the relevant parts of the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
The Board of Directors report that the Company has complied with these regulations throughout the year under review.
Information not subject to audit The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration of the Groups Chairman and executive directors, and reviews that of senior executives.
The members of the Committee who served during the year are listed in this Annual Report.
The Committee members have no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no director is permitted to be involved in any decisions as to his or her own remuneration.
Remuneration policy The remuneration packages of directors are reviewed by the Committee at least annually on the same basis as any other employee of the Group.
The review takes into account market practice and performance of the individual and of the business.
Other factors taken into account include the experience and responsibility of the individuals concerned.
During the year the Committee commissioned a benchmarking exercise by New Bridge Street Consultants LLP covering all aspects of directors remuneration including share incentives and other performance related reward plans.
The Committee also receives information from various independent sources on directors remuneration.
The components of the Groups remuneration packages are detailed below.
Policy is structured to provide a mix of remuneration to ensure that no one component or measure dominates and that interests are aligned over different time periods with other employees and shareholders.
Remuneration policy does not conflict with the Companys approach to environmental, social and corporate governance matters.
Packages include basic salary, annual bonus based on pre-tax earnings per share and a long term incentive plan based on total shareholder return.
It also includes optional participation in a risk reward investment plan.
Salary Directors salaries are set by reference to those prevailing in the market, particularly within other major retail companies, and according to individual performance, experience and responsibility.
Annual performance related bonus The executive directors participate in an annual performance related bonus scheme which is based on a formula determined by the Committee measuring the performance of the business.
The performance measure is earnings per share before tax, which must increase by 5% prior to any bonus becoming payable.
The formula includes an upper limit of 100% of salary and earnings per share growth must reach a demanding level of at least 20% for the maximum bonus to be earned.
Long term incentive plan A new ten year plan was approved by shareholders at the 2006 Annual General Meeting.
Invitations to participate are generally issued annually to executive directors and senior executives.
Under the plan, performance is measured over periods of three years, which commence annually, by comparing total shareholder return TSR against approximately 20 other UK listed retail companies.
The comparator group of companies for the three year performance period to January 2008 was as follows: Alliance Boots GUS Marks & Spencer N Brown Body Shop JJB Sports Matalan Signet Burberry J Sainsbury MFI Furniture Tesco Carpetright Kesa Morrisons W H Smith Dixons Kingfisher Mothercare Woolworths Findel The Committee determines which companies are to be added to or removed from the comparator group.
For periods ending January 2010 onwards Body Shop, MFI Furniture and Matalan have been removed from the comparator group and replaced by Debenhams, Carphone Warehouse and French Connection.
For periods ending January 2011 onwards Alliance Boots has been removed from the comparator group.
27 Rem Remuneration Repor uneration Report t Following the merger of Boots Group with Alliance Unichem on 31 July 2006, data for Boots Group is used prior to the merger date and data for the merged entity thereafter.
Similarly, following the demergers of GUS and W H Smith data for the appropriate demerged entity Home Retail Group and W H Smith is used after the date of the demerger.
The Committee considers that the comparator group consists of UK listed companies which are most comparable to Next in size or nature of their business.
The Committee believes that comparison against a group of retail companies is more likely to reflect the Companys relative performance against its peers, thereby resulting in appropriate awards being made.
The graph below shows relative TSR of the Company over five years when compared with the FTSE All Share index and FTSE General Retailers index.
This illustrates the Companys performance against a wide all-share UK index and against other companies in the same sector.
Next plc Performance Chart 2003-2008 Total Shareholder Return 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 Re-based to 31 January 2003 100 Next plc FTSE General Retailers FTSE All Share Awards are granted provisionally at the start of each three year performance period and remain subject to performance conditions over the life of the plan before any entitlement is earned.
If no entitlement has been earned at the end of a three year performance period then the award for that period will lapse and there is no retesting.
If TSR is below the median ranking company there will be no entitlement to any of the award.
Median performance earns an entitlement to a minimum percentage of the maximum award.
For performance above the median the entitlement will rise, with the maximum award being earned for performance which places the Company at or above a pre-determined ranking in the comparator group.
Irrespective of where Company performance ranks, no award will be made unless the earnings per share of the Company has increased by at least the increase in the Retail Price Index over the period.
The maximum award allowed under the current rules of the plan is 200% of basic salary 300% in exceptional circumstances.
For the performance period commencing February 2005 the maximum award was 100% of basic salary.
The Committee has generally restricted the maximum potential share award below that possible under the rules of the plan.
The New Bridge Street Consultants benchmarking exercise indicated that the level of awards was uncompetitive.
Accordingly, the Committee has concluded that the maximum level of awards to be made for periods commencing after January 2008 should be increased in line with current market levels, whilst making the performance hurdles more demanding.
This will reduce the level of award that vests at the median performance level and the maximum award will only vest if the Companys TSR is in the upper quintile of the comparator group.
28 Rem Remuneration Repor uneration Report t Details of potential awards granted for outstanding performance periods and the performance criteria for maximum awards based on a comparator group of approximately 20 companies are as follows: Maximum potential award Performance periods granted % of basic salary % of maximum potential Ranking for commencing Directors Other employees award at median ranking maximum award 1 February 2005 70% 70% 30% Upper quartile 1 February 2006 & 2007 100% 80% 30% Upper quartile 2 February 2008 150% 120% 20% Upper quintile 1 Incremental awards were made to Mr Angelides, bringing his maximum share award to an equivalent of 100% of salary for the performance periods commencing February 2004 and 2005 and 130% of salary for the performance period commencing February 2006.
The additional 30% awards are contingent on his remaining with the Group for a five year period to January 2009.
2 The maximum potential award made to Mr Wolfson for the performance period commencing February 2008 is 200% of basic salary.
The Company has discretion as to whether entitlements earned are payable in Next shares or cash and to date it has allowed participants the choice.
Entitlements earned are not pensionable and are based on salary and share price at the start of the performance period.
Individuals included in the plan have not received grants under the management share option scheme in the same year.
Risk Reward investment plan The risk reward investment plan was first implemented in 2004 in order to provide a retention incentive for directors and senior employees who were being targeted by Nexts competitors.
A similar plan with additional retention provisions was put in place after shareholder approval was obtained at an Extraordinary General Meeting in July 2005.
Shareholders also approved the implementation of further plans at the 2006 and 2007 AGMs, but the Committee decided it was not appropriate to offer this incentive in either of the years to January 2007 and 2008.
The Remuneration Committee believes the plan remains effective in retaining key employees and, subject to shareholder approval at the 2008 AGM, intends to implement a new plan during the coming year which will be broadly similar to that implemented in 2005.
Full details of the 2005 Plan were included on page 22 of the 2006 Remuneration Report, the main elements of which are repeated below.
In July 2005 following approval by the Remuneration Committee, the Group made a special contribution of 1,198,000 to the Next 2003 Employee Share Ownership Trust the ESOT to acquire listed warrants issued by Goldman Sachs Jersey Limited.
These warrants are held on revocable trusts for executives who made personal investments totalling 499,000 including 266,000 by directors from their own resources in financial contracts, the success of which is based on the market price of Next shares in July 2009.
The returns on the warrants and the financial contracts are materially the same and will vary between a minimum of zero if the final share price is then 20.50 or less and a maximum of approximately five times the initial investment.
The maximum value will only be achieved if the final share price is at or above 25.00.
On maturity of the warrants, any returns accruing to the ESOT will only be distributed either in Next shares and or cash to those participants who have remained with Next.
Based on the share price of 14.93 over the three months to July 2005, the Companys share price must increase by July 2009 at the equivalent of an annual compound growth rate of 8.3% adjusted for the difference between assumed dividends payable and actual dividends paid in order for there to be any return on the initial investment.
In order to achieve maximum value the annual compound growth rate would be 13.8%.
29 Rem Remuneration Repor uneration Report t In addition, the Group also acquired 172,368 warrants direct from Goldman Sachs Jersey Limited in order to hedge its potential employers national insurance contributions liability in respect of the plan.
Based on a share price of 11.16 on 17 March 2008, Nexts share price must increase by more than 79% in the period up to July 2008 if any return is to accrue for participants in the plan that was implemented in July 2004, and more than 83% in the period to July 2009 for the 2005 plan.
Management share options The management share option plan was approved by shareholders in 2005 and will be due for renewal in 2015.
The plan provides for options over shares, exercisable between three and ten years following their grant, to be allocated to Group employees excluding main board directors and senior executives who participate in the long term incentive plan at the discretion of the Board.
Options can either be approved where the beneficiary may qualify for tax relief or unapproved.
The total number of options which can be granted is subject to shareholder approved limits and there are no cash settlement alternatives.
Options are set at the prevailing market price at the time of grant.
The maximum total market value of shares i. e. the acquisition price of shares over which options may be granted to any person during any financial year of the Company is three times salary, excluding bonuses and benefits in kind.
This limit may be increased to five times salary in circumstances considered by the Remuneration Committee to be exceptional, for example on the grant of options following recruitment.
Grants are generally made annually.
The exercise of options is subject to a performance condition where the percentage growth in earnings per share of the Group over a three year period must exceed RPI and a further 3% per annum.
If this performance condition is not met at three years from the date of grant, the options lapse.
No options were granted to directors or changes made to existing entitlements in the year under review.
No employee has received option grants under the scheme and been included in the long term incentive plan in the same year.
Share based incentives are currently satisfied from shares held by the ESOT.
The Board has approved the use of market purchases into treasury where necessary for the future settlement of these obligations.
Sharesave options The sharesave option scheme was approved by shareholders in 2000 and will be due for renewal in 2010.
Invitations to participate are generally issued annually to all employees.
The scheme operates on a save-as-you-earn principle and is subject to a maximum contribution limit of 250 per month per employee.
Options are granted at the prevailing market rate less a discount of 20% and are exercisable three, five or seven years from the date of grant.
A similar scheme is operated by the Company for its employees in the Republic of Ireland.
Sharesave options granted to directors in the year under review are detailed on page 35.
Group pension plan Executive directors are eligible for membership of the Next Group Pension Plan the Plan which has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs and consists of defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The trustee of the Plan is a limited company, Next Pension Trustees Limited the Trustee.
The Board of the Trustee includes members of the Plan, a pensioner member and an independent director who is also the Chairman of the Trustee.
Two of the directors are member nominated directors and cannot be removed by Next: the other directors, including the independent director, are appointed by and can be removed by Next.
All directors of the Trustee receive a fee for their services, including those directors who are also employees of Next.
Pensioner and member representatives have been elected as member nominated directors.
No director of the Company is a director of the Trustee.
The Plans investments are kept separate from the business affairs of the Next group and the Trustee holds them in trust.
Responsibility for investment of the Plans funds has been delegated by the Trustee to professional investment managers.
30 Rem Remuneration Repor uneration Report t Defined contribution section Employees of the Group can join the defined contribution section of the Plan.
Members elect to pay either 3% or 5% of their pensionable earnings which is matched by the Company.
For death prior to retirement, a lump sum of three times the members basic salary at the previous April is payable along with the current value of the members fund.
Defined benefit section The defined benefit section of the Plan was closed to new members in 2000 but is being continued for the benefit of existing members.
This section provides members with a retirement benefit of one sixtieth or one eightieth depending on chosen member contribution rate of final pensionable earnings for each year of pensionable service.
This section also provides a lump sum death in service benefit and dependants pensions on death in service or following retirement.
For death prior to retirement a spouses pension of 60% of the members prospective pension is payable.
A lump sum of up to three times the members final pensionable earnings plus a return of the members contributions with interest is also payable.
For death after retirement a spouses pension of 60% of the members pre-commutation pension is payable.
A lump sum equivalent to the balance of five years pension is payable if death occurs within five years of retirement.
If death occurs after leaving service but before the pension becomes payable i. e. as a deferred pensioner, a spouses pension of 60% of the accrued deferred pension is payable along with a lump sum equal to the members own contributions with interest.
Childrens pensions are only payable on death in service.
In the case of ill-health retirement only the accrued pension is payable.
All benefits are subject to Plan limits.
Increases to pensions in payment are at the discretion of the Trustee although pensionable service post-1997 is subject to limited price indexation.
For all current Plan members, pensionable earnings are comprised of basic pay, overtime and, prior to 1 October 2006, annual performance bonuses.
No other items of remuneration are taken into account.
From 1 October 2006, sales and profit related bonuses are no longer taken into account.
Members contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings, whilst the Company currently makes contributions at the rate of 17.5%.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit sections financial position was undertaken as at 30 September 2005 and concluded that the Plan had a 19% deficit of assets compared with actuarial liabilities.
The deficit in the scheme at 26 January 2008 calculated in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards was 45.8m: further details are given in Note 22 to the financial statements.
Certain members whose accrued or projected pension fund value exceeds their personal lifetime allowance are provided with appropriate benefits through an unfunded, unapproved arrangement where they so elect.
The relevant members contribute towards the additional cost of providing these benefits by paying 5% of pensionable earnings into the Plan.
From 1 October 2006, the normal retirement age under the Plan was increased from 60 to 65.
Specific information in respect of executive directors pension entitlements is detailed below.
Service contracts Each of the executive directors has a rolling service contract which is terminable by the Company on giving one years notice.
The Committee will ensure that in the event of any termination payment being made to a director full account will be taken of that directors duty to mitigate any loss and where appropriate the Committee may seek independent professional advice prior to authorising such payment.
Apart from service contracts no director has had any material interest in any contract with the Company or its subsidiaries.
Other benefits Executive directors receive benefits which may include the provision of a fully expensed company car or cash alternative, private medical insurance, annual subscriptions to appropriate professional bodies and staff discount when purchasing the Groups merchandise.
Other employees are also eligible for certain of these benefits.
31 Rem Remuneration Repor uneration Report t Non-executive directors Remuneration of the non-executive directors of the Company is determined by the Chairman and the executive directors.
Remuneration consists of a basic fee for services in connection with Board and Board Committee meetings.
Additional fees are paid for the roles of Chairman of the Remuneration Committee, Chairman of the Audit Committee and Senior Independent Non-executive Director.
Letters of appointment do not contain notice periods, however non-executive directors are appointed in the expectation that they will serve for a minimum of six years, subject to satisfactory performance and successful re-election at Annual General Meeting.
Non-executive directors receive a discount when purchasing the Groups merchandise but do not participate in any of the Groups bonus, pension, share option or other incentive schemes.

Mr Barton served as a non-executive director until his appointment as Chairman on 17 May 2006.
32 Rem Remuneration Repor uneration Report t Mr Wolfson was the highest paid director in the current and previous year.
The Company also paid a pension under the unfunded, unapproved arrangement to a former director of the Company of 33,754 2007: 32,771.
Long term incentive plan Estimated monetary values were included in the January 2007 Remuneration Report for the three year performance plan which matured at that date based on a share price of 2092p on 20 March 2007.
Performance conditions of the plan are detailed above.
Awards were made subsequent to the Report on 28 March 2007 when the share price was 2353p.
Adjustments to the estimated monetary value together with the final award have therefore been included in the table below.
A further three year performance period of the plan matured in January 2008.
The total shareholder return of the Company over this period ranked twelfth in the comparator group of 22 listed retail companies.
As this was below the median position, no award vested.

There have been no other changes to awards under the long term incentive plan during the year.
33 Rem Remuneration Repor uneration Report t Directors pension entitlements All executive directors are members of the defined benefit section of the Next Group Pension Plan.
Directors and some senior managers receive an enhancement from the Plan, increasing the accrual of their retirement benefit up to two thirds of their final pensionable earnings on completion of 20 years pensionable service at age 65 for members who joined before October 2000.
The lump sum payable on death in service for directors and some senior managers is enhanced to four times pensionable salary.
Pension entitlements of the executive directors who held office during the year are as follows: Increase in Transfer value Increase in Age at Years of Accrued accrued of accrued transfer value January pensionable annual annual annual pension less directors 2008 service pension pension 2008 2007 contributions 000 000 000 000 000 S A Wolfson 40 13 201 20 1,985 1,219 736 C E Angelides 44 15 185 18 2,309 1,356 931 D W Keens 54 21 294 34 5,698 3,125 2,552 A J Varley 57 24 260 30 5,746 3,330 2,400 Years of pensionable service shown above may include bought in service from the transfer of other pension entitlements into the Plan.
Mr Wolfson and Mr Angelides have elected to join the unfunded, unapproved pension arrangement and the accrued annual pension set out above includes their membership of that arrangement.
The Trustees revised the basis of calculation of transfer values with effect from 1 January 2008, which resulted in significant increases in respect of all members of the plan including directors.
These changes were made to bring the transfer basis in line with current regulatory guidelines and reflect the improved expectations of future longevity.
Of the total increase in transfer values of 6,708,000 for the directors above, 4,131,000 resulted from the change in method of calculation with the remaining increase due to additional service and ageing of the directors, increases in salary and changes in financial market conditions.
Due to movements in bond yields, which underlie the basis of calculation of transfer values, the increase in transfer values over the year can be significantly higher for members nearer to retirement than for younger members.
Directors pension arrangements are subject to the same actuarial reduction as other employees on termination or early retirement.
Directors interests Directors beneficial interests in shares and share options at the beginning of the financial year, or date of appointment if later, and at the end of the year, were as follows: Ordinary shares of 10p each Options over ordinary shares of 10p each 2008 2007 2008 2008 2007 2007 No.
The options held by Mr Wolfson and Mr Angelides and 239 shares at an option price of 1514p held by Mr Varley have option prices which exceeded the market price of Next plc shares on 26 January 2008.
Share options granted to or exercised by directors during the year were as follows: No.

The market price of shares at 26 January 2008 was 1375p and the range during the year then ended was 1294p to 2437p.
The executive directors are also together with other employees discretionary beneficiaries under the ESOT and, as such, were each considered to be interested in the 4,587,161 shares owned by the Trust at 26 January 2008.
