42472 Accounts:42472 Accounts 21 4 08 18:22 Page 46 46 | Alliance Trust PLC Report & Accounts This section of the Report and Accounts explains the remuneration structure that the Company operates and how the Directors various incentive plans are structured to ensure that rewards match performance.
The purpose of our remuneration policy is to align rewards to the achievement of a real return for our remuneration shareholders across all economic cycles.
By real return we mean a return substantially above the rate of inflation.
Our multi-asset class strategy is intended, over time, to reduce the link between our investment performance and the performance of volatile stock markets.
This is unlike many other investment trusts whose objective is simply to do better than their peer group.
For this reason we have decided our senior management team should be challenged to deliver real growth in shareholder value, irrespective of market conditions, and should therefore be incentivised to make the right decisions to invest capital where it can create real long-term value for shareholders, be that in stock markets around the world, property, private equity or our own financial services businesses.
Consequently we have structured our long-term incentive plan for senior management around a measure of real return for shareholders, by providing a steadily growing income from dividends while taking care to ensure that the underlying value of the shareholders investment is not eroded by inflation.
The measure we are using for our plan, which was approved by shareholders last year, is based on the growth in the Retail Prices Index RPI and only offers any reward when the value of shareholders investments grows year-on-year at a rate significantly ahead of RPI.
We are also committed to maintaining a low Total Expense Ratio TER compared to other global growth and global growth and income investment trusts.
Part of this will be achieved by exercising tight control over our expenses.
Improving investment returns is, however, just as important and to achieve this we need the right people and systems in place to manage the portfolio.
We can only compete to attract and retain such people by having a remuneration policy that allows them to be rewarded with a share of the value they create for shareholders and with an attractive remuneration package with the right balance between fixed and variable pay.
Equally the policy needs to ensure that they are not rewarded if they fail to deliver that value.
Our fundamental commitment is to safeguard our shareholders interests by ensuring that the remuneration packages do not reward poor performance and that we do not pay our directors The purpose of our remuneration and staff significantly in excess of market norms.
policy is to align rewards to the This report deals firstly with the Executive Directors a summary achievement of a real return for table of salary and benefits can be found on page 52 and then our shareholders across all provide details on page 52 of the Non-Executive Directors remuneration.
Executive Directors The Remuneration policy for Executive Directors is built on the following core principles: Variable pay will form a significant proportion of the total package.
Base salaries will be set at no more than the market median for jobs of a similar size and complexity.
Total direct compensation base salary plus annual and long term incentives will reflect the Companys performance, with the goal of being upper quartile for upper quartile performance.
Benefits will be no more than median Differential pension benefits will be taken into consideration in setting the total remuneration package.

Base Salaries To ensure that the Committee is kept up to date with current salary and benefit trends it receives advice from independent consultants who are appointed by the Committee and who do not provide other services to the Company.
The advice they give covers all aspects of the remuneration package.
The consultants used throughout the year were the Hay Group.
In respect of salary, a decision was taken this year that no movement be made to bring the Directors closer to the median of their peer group, but a modest increase to allow for inflation was made.
The base salaries from 1 February 2007 and 1 February 2008 of the Executive Directors are shown in the table below.

In particular, there was a move to align the long term element of their variable pay component with the objective of providing a long term real return to shareholders.
These awards only vest if the performance targets are met.
They pay nothing if the Company does not not significantly outperform inflation and pay increasing amounts as more value for shareholders is added with at maximum less than 1% of added value going to the Directors with over 900m going to shareholders.
This year, after receiving advice on market trends from the independent consultants, and considering Company and personal performance measures, there were no changes made or proposed to the long term incentive arrangements.
In addition to salaries and the other payments benefits detailed on the previous pages the Directors received the following benefits.
Annual Bonus For Executive Directors this can amount to 100% of salary with up to 50% being dependent on Company performance and up to 50% being dependent on the achievement of specific business or individual targets.
This year the Company performance target was to achieve a Total Return of 7.72%.
In the event this target was not achieved.
Consequently, no payment was made under this element of the annual bonus.
For the next financial year the Company has adopted a corporate return target which comprises three elements, each equally weighted.
These are share price performance against a target of RPI plus 3%, NAV performance against a target of the FTSE All-World Index and the achievement of a dividend increase in excess of RPI.
Based on the achievement of specific business and or individual targets, the Executive Directors were awarded the following annual bonuses in respect of the financial year to 31 January 2008.
The payments shown in the table below were payable after the end of the year.

The balance can either be taken as cash or applied to the LTIP at the individuals choice.
Long Term Incentive Plan This is a discretionary plan approved by the shareholders at the 2007 Annual General Meeting, which provides the largest potential element of compensation for the Executive Directors and other senior managers.
Under this arrangement participants are given the right to acquire further shares in the Company at nil cost.
On Katherine Garrett-Coxs appointment a separate agreement was entered into with regard to the payments she received on taking up her role.
This agreement required at least half of her initial payment being made to a long term plan with the same performance conditions as the LTIP.
The awards made to Katherine Garrett-Cox are described as Share Awards and the details are shown on the next page.
