Some are of a similar size to Pearson, while others are larger, but the method which the committees independent advisers use to make comparisons on remuneration takes this into account.
All have very substantial overseas operations.
We also use selected media companies in North America.
We use these companies because they represent the wider executive talent pool from which we might expect to recruit externally and the pay market to which we might be vulnerable if our remuneration was not competitive.
