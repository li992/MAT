Babcock International Group PLC 45 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Remuneration report This Report will be submitted for approval at the AGM on 10 July 2008.
Remuneration Committee Who is on it?
The members of the Committee throughout the year each served throughout the year were all independent Non-Executive Directors: D J Shah Committee Chairman J Rennocks Sir Nigel Essenhigh J Crookenden Their biographical details are on page 36.
Each member attended the three formal meetings of the Committee during the year and took part in informal meetings as necessary.
The Committee determines the remuneration packages of the Chairman, Executive Directors and certain other senior Group executives.
How does the Committee operate?
The Committee meets formally at least twice a year.
The Committee also meets on an ad hoc basis as may be necessary.
The Company Secretary attends meetings as secretary to the Committee.
The Group Chairman and the Group Chief Executive attend formal meetings by invitation of the Committee, except when their own remuneration is being discussed.
The Deputy Chairman attends some meetings as an observer.
The Inbucon Group Limited Inbucon provides the Committee with independent, market-based advice on director and senior management remuneration.
Inbucon is formally retained, with the Committees approval, by the Company acting through the Company Secretary.
Inbucon does not provide other services to Group companies.
What is the Companys remuneration policy?
The remuneration policy for executives has two objectives: to ensure that the remuneration structure for senior executives is competitive, so that when taking account of job complexity, responsibility, skills and experience, the remuneration package is at least at a similar level for comparable post holders in the market in which the Company has to compete in recruiting and retaining such executives: and where the Company achieves or exceeds predetermined performance criteria, to share with those executives a fair proportion of the value of that performance.
The link between remuneration policy and strategy is made through the performance criteria used in both the annual bonus and long-term incentive schemes with the intention that executives have remuneration packages overall that are fair and allow enhanced rewards for the delivery of superior performance.
Level and balance of remuneration Market comparison In reviewing remuneration, the Company considers data relating to both companies generally of a similar size as well as to remuneration specifically in the support services sector.
Level of remuneration The Committee sets the level of overall remuneration so that upper quartile rewards can be earned for upper quartile performance, having set basic packages bearing in mind the median for comparable companies.
Babcock International Group PLC 46 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Remuneration report continued Balance of remuneration The balance of remuneration for Executive Directors is set so that the major part of overall remuneration is subject to performance, both shortand long-term.
The balance for the Group Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director is shown in the graphs below, with L-TIP awards being valued on a projected value basis and assuming full achievement of bonus potential.
Mr Campbell, as part-time Chairman, has a remuneration package in which the performance related element is over 50% of potential remuneration.
Internal relativity The Committee is sensitive to the need to set Directors remuneration having regard to pay and conditions in the Group as a whole and is satisfied that the approach taken by the Company is fair and reasonable in light of current market practice and the best interests of shareholders.
Basic pay Basic pay is considered against comparable companies in terms of size comparing revenues, number of employees and market capitalisation, and companies in the support services sector.
Against these data sources taken as a whole, the Companys basic pay is at or about the median.
Basic pay is reviewed annually.
In June 2007, the Company made a major strategic move when it acquired Devonport Management Limited DML and its subsidiaries.
This acquisition transformed the size of the Group.
The Committee therefore asked Inbucon to carry out a review to ensure that in the changed circumstances remuneration packages remained in line with remuneration policy when tested against relevant comparative data.
The salary for Mr Tame had already fallen behind market before this step-change in the size of the Group and the increase in his remuneration also reflects this.
Babcock International Group PLC 47 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Performance-related rewards Annual bonus schemes Of the Directors, only Mr Rogers, Group Chief Executive, and Mr Tame, Group Finance Director, receive annual bonuses.
These are performance-related and the scheme is set by the Committee each year.
The Committees policy is currently to focus the schemes on profit and or earnings growth.
For the year ended 31 March 2008, the annual bonuses payable to Mr Rogers maximum 100% of eligible salary and Mr Tame 80% were originally structured as follows: a bonus of 20% was dependent on hitting budgets for profit before tax and cash flow.
The balance 80% for Mr Rogers and 60% for Mr Tame depended on growth in profit before tax over the prior financial year, with maximum pay-out for this element being achieved at 20% growth in profits.
However, the acquisition of Devonport Management Limited DML part-way through the year made a meaningful and appropriate year-on-year profits growth comparison difficult.
The DML acquisition was financed in part by a placing of newly-issued shares and in part by borrowings.
Against this background, the scheme was amended to provide for maximum bonus to be paid if the revised Group budget, inclusive of DML, was achieved with no diminution in actual earnings per share before exceptionals and amortisation of acquired intangibles as against the original pre-acquisition budget for earnings per share.
Mr Rogers and Mr Tame earned maximum annual bonus for financial year 2007 08.
For the financial year 2008 09 the Committee is again setting annual bonuses for Mr Rogers and Mr Tame principally by reference to growth, using growth in earnings per share before amortisation of acquired intangibles, but, unless the Committee otherwise decides, after exceptionals EPS, with the balance by reference to hitting profit before tax and cash flow budgets.
The relative proportions as between reward for growth and reward for achieving budget will be as described above.
Maximum bonus will be paid for achieving budget and 20% growth in EPS.
Annual bonus schemes for divisional managing directors also include performance measures dependent on growth in divisional profits and or achievement of budgeted divisional profits and cash flow according to the objectives for the division concerned.
Bonus schemes for senior Group managers other than Directors reflect the schemes for Mr Rogers and Mr Tame, but with lower maximum bonus potential.
The Committee has discretion to reduce or extinguish bonuses in light of health, safety or environmental performance.
Annual bonuses are not pensionable.
Long-term incentives Each year since 2003, qualifying Directors and certain senior Group employees have been granted performance-related long-term incentives in the form of awards of nil-price options under the Babcock 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan L-TIP.
Before 2003 they were granted performance-related market-priced share options under the Babcock 1999 Approved and Unapproved Executive Share Option Schemes.
It is the intention of the Company that shares needed to satisfy options for Directors and awards under the L-TIP will be purchased in the market to the extent not already held in the employee share trusts at the date the options or awards were granted or are exercised.
During the financial year, L-TIP awards were made to each of Mr Campbell, Mr Rogers and Mr Tame over shares having a market value on award of 100% of their qualifying basic salaries.
Awards were also made to a small number of other senior managers.
The vesting of the L-TIP awards depends on company performance.
Half of each award vests according to comparative Total Shareholder Return performance against a specific comparator list and half on earnings per share growth.
The performance criteria are set out on page 52.
Details of options and L-TIP awards held by the Directors are set out on pages 50 and 51.
For certain divisional senior managers, but not the Companys Directors, there is a cash-based long-term incentive scheme focused on divisional performance and with particular features to aid retention.
The performance targets are set by reference to divisional profit targets and return on capital employed or operating cash flow, as most appropriate to the divisions business.
A similar scheme is in place for senior Group employees but not the Companys Directors based on EPS growth over the performance period.
Target bonuses under these schemes vary between participants but will not normally exceed a years basic salary for on-target performance, with maximum payout for out-performance capped at 150% of target bonus.
Babcock International Group PLC 48 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Remuneration report continued Performance graph The graphs below were prepared by Inbucon.
They show the total shareholder return for a holding in the Companys shares for the period from 1April 2003 to 31 March 2008 relative to a holding of shares representing respectively the FTSE All-Share Index excluding investment trusts and the FTSE 350 Support Services Sector.
The calculation of the return assumes dividends are reinvested to purchase additional equity.
This FTSE All-Share Index excluding investment trusts is the same index as has been used for this purpose in earlier Remuneration reports, as it is a broad index that allows comparison of the Companys performance against the performance of the stock market as a whole.
Support Services is the sector in which the Companys share price is reported.
Over the five-year period, the Company has substantially out-performed both indexes.
An investment of 100 in the Company on 1 April 2003 would have been worth assuming the dividends were reinvested in further Company shares 721 at 31 March 2008.

Details of share-based awards held by the Directors are to be found on pages 50 and 51.
Salary or fee includes cash allowances other than any in lieu of pension benefits not forming part of basic salary and also car allowances where applicable.
For Mr Rogers the payment is in lieu of all pension benefits.
For Mr Tame, the payment is in lieu of pension benefits on that part of his basic salary as exceeds the earnings cap for the pension scheme see detailed explanation under Directors Pensions below.
Annual bonuses were paid by reference to revised annual salaries following the acquisition of DML.
For Mr Tame benefits comprised home to work travel expenses, medical insurance and accommodation expenses.
For Mr Rogers they comprised medical insurance.
For Sir Nigel Essenhigh they comprised home to work travel expenses.
Return Index Rebased Babcock International Group PLC 49 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 The fees for Lord Hesketh reflect his additional duties as Deputy Chairman.
Mr Rennocks and Mr Shahs fees reflect their additional duties as Chairmen of, respectively, the Audit and Risk Committee and the Remuneration Committee.
Bonus payments and benefits in kind are not pensionable.
Directors pensions audited Only Mr Tame currently participates in a Group pension scheme.
He receives a salary supplement for his earnings in excess of the scheme earnings cap see the table on page 48.
Mr Rogers receives a supplement in lieu of pension, which is not taken into account for the purpose of bonus or L-TIP awards.
It is separately identified in the table on page 48.
The Companys policy is to remain competitive in the market place to attract and retain the calibre of employee it needs.
Subject to that, it is not the Companys policy to compensate Directors for tax changes or changes to the taxation of pensions.
Babcock International Group Pension Scheme the Scheme Mr Tame is a member of the senior executive tier of the Babcock International Group Pension Scheme.
No other Directors are members of the Scheme or receive pension benefits from the Group.
The accrual rate for Mr Tame under the Scheme is one-thirtieth for each year of service, with pension being calculated on his base salary up to the Schemes earnings cap in the 12 months prior to attaining age 60.
Membership of the Scheme also entitles him to life assurance cover of four times base salary up to the earnings cap.
The earnings cap adopted by the Scheme is the same as the former statutory earnings cap, index-linked in the same way.
The Company takes out additional life assurance cover in respect of four times his salary in excess of the earnings cap.
Mr Tames pension entitlements under the Scheme defined benefit are set out in the following table: Increase in accrued benefits excluding Transfer value inflation Change in of increase in Accrued during the accrued Transfer accrued Increase in pension at year ended benefits after Transfer value value at benefits less transfer value 31 March 31 March allowing for at 1 April 31 March Directors less Directors 2008 2008 inflation 2007 2008 contributions contribution Director pa pa W Tame 23,652 4,511 3,764 312,238 405,486 43,676 87,608 1.
Inflation has been taken as 3.9% for the purposes of calculating increases in transfer values and pension earned.
The transfer value of the increase in pension accrued is calculated in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11, and is stated after deducting members contributions.
The figures in the above table make no allowance for the cost of death in service benefits under the Scheme.
The figures in the above table make no allowance for any benefits in respect of earnings in excess of the Inland Revenue earnings cap.
In calculating the above figures for Mr Tame no account has been taken of any retained benefits which he may have from previous employments.
No payments have been made to retired Directors in excess of the retirement benefit to which they were entitled on the date the benefits first became payable or, if later, 31 March 1997.
Other pension arrangements audited Before 1 April 2006, the Company provided a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme FURBS for Mr Tame in respect of his salary in excess of the earnings cap.
The Company contributed to the FURBS an amount equal to 20% of the excess including employers national insurance contributions, with Mr Tame making contributions into the Companys pension scheme on his full uncapped salary.
As from April 2006, this was replaced with a salary supplement of 15% of the excess including employers national insurance contributions, with Mr Tame contributing into the Companys pension scheme only on capped salary.
The cost of providing additional life assurance cover was: 2008 2007 Director 000 000 W Tame 2 Non-Executive Directors The Non-Executive Directors receive only fixed fees.
These fees are reviewed against market practice from time to time by the Chairman and the Executive Directors, to whom the task has been delegated by the Board.
Babcock International Group PLC 50 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Remuneration report continued Directors interests in shares The table below shows the holdings of fully paid ordinary shares of 60p each of the Directors including family interests in the issued share capital of the Company.
The interests were beneficial interests.
The Board encourages Executive Directors to build and maintain, over time, a personal holding of shares equivalent in value to around a years basic pay.

There were no changes in the Directors interests in shares between 31 March 2008 and 27 May 2008.
Directors share-based rewards and options audited Options Details of the Directors share options are set out in the table below and the notes beneath it.
All of the outstanding options are vested and exercisable.
He subsequently sold 250,000 shares on 16 July 2007 at a price per share of 536.73p.
a Share Option Agreement agreed as part of the terms of recruitment b Babcock 1999 Approved Executive Share Option Scheme c Babcock 1999 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme Babcock International Group PLC 51 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Options vested according to comparative TSR performance over three-year performance periods.
They were not subject to re-testing.
The comparator group was the companies in the FTSE Engineering and Machinery Sector when the options were granted which was the sector in which the Companys shares were then listed.
There was no vesting unless the Company ranked above median performance, in which case 25% of the options vested.
Full vesting was for top quartile ranking with proportionate vesting on a straight-line basis for a ranking between those points.
The exercise price was set at the average of the mid-market closing price of the Companys shares for the three business days preceding the date of the grant.
This price was not discounted.
Directors must exercise vested options before the tenth anniversaries of the grant dates, or earlier if there is a change of control, they leave or die, failing which they will lapse.
There were no changes in the Directors share options between 31 March 2008 and 27 May 2008.

The L-TIP awards shown in italics were fully vested and exercisable as at 31 March 2008.
Vesting date depends on the date of notification of the vesting, but will be after announcement of results for the final year of the applicable performance period.
The above table assumes that the announcement is made in May and notification of vesting given in the same month.
The Companys mid-market share price at close of business on 31 March 2008 was 571.50p.
The highest and lowest mid-market share prices in the year ended 31 March 2008 were 617.50p and 400.00p respectively.
The L-TIP awards that vested during the year to 31 March 2008 were those granted in July 2004.
The market value of those shares on award was 126.00p per share.
On the date of vesting, 16 May 2007, they had a market value of 549.00p per share, being the mid-market closing price on that day.
The performance conditions attached to the awards are described below.
All the L-TIP awards made to Directors to date have been made by the trustee of the Babcock Employee Share Trust as conditional rights to acquire shares effectively nil cost options.
The number of shares awarded had a value equal to the qualifying annual salary at the date of the award using the average of the mid-market closing price of the Companys shares for the three business days preceding that date.
Babcock International Group PLC 52 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Remuneration report continued Subject to satisfaction of the performance criteria see below attached to the awards, the Directors may call for the release of the award shares during the above exercise periods.
Subject to the rules of the plan, an earlier release of shares may be allowed by the Remuneration Committee for example, in the event of a cessation of employment or a change in control, but normally of not more than a time-apportioned proportion and then only having regard to the Companys performance, though the Committee has discretion to allow a greater proportion to be released.
Performance measures attached to L-TIP awards Performance is judged over the period of three financial years from the start of the financial year in which the award is made.
Performance is measured at the end of the period and is not re-tested.
For L-TIP awards made after 2003, half of each award vests according to comparative TSR performance measured against a specified list of companies with similar businesses see below, and half according to growth in earnings per share.
This approach will be taken with any awards made in financial year 2008 09.
For the half of the share awards where vesting depends on comparative TSR performance, a ranking immediately above the median level in the comparator table results in 25% of those shares vesting.
There is no vesting for ranking at or below median.
A ranking in the top quartile results in 100% vesting.
Rankings between these threshold levels result in proportionate vesting calculated on a straight-line basis between 25% and 100%.
The comparator group of listed companies for the 2004, 2005 and, apart from PHS Group 2006 comprised AEA Technology, W. S. Atkins, Aggreko, Amec, Bodycote, Capita, Carillion, Cobham, Interserve, Laing John, Mitie, Mouchel-Parkman, PHS Group, Rentokil Initial, Serco, VT Group, and WSP Group.
The comparator group for the awards made in 2007 was: 1.
MITIE Group The comparator group is chosen by the Remuneration Committee with a view to giving an appropriate range of support services providers against which to compare the Company having regard to the nature of its and their businesses.
The Group will be reviewed before the grant of awards in 2008.
The TSR calculation uses a 12-month average.
The Company feels that this is the most appropriate period because a 12-month average ensures both that the short-term market volatility is excluded and that for each company a 12-month period will capture the impact of the announcement of results and payment of dividends.
A shorter period would not capture all these events and would not necessarily put all companies on an equal footing.
For the half of the post-2003 L-TIP awards where vesting depends on earnings per share growth, 25% of the shares vest if that growth adjusted to exclude exceptional items and acquired intangible amortisation over the performance period is equivalent to a real i. e. in excess of the growth in the consumer prices index compound annual growth rate of 4%, with full vesting if this reaches 8%.
Vesting is on a straight-line basis for growth between those two points.
There is no vesting for compound annual earnings per share growth of below 4%.
For the L-TIP awards made in 2003 vesting depended on the Companys earnings per share pre-acquired intangible amortisation and exceptional items in the year to 31 March 2006 being at least 9.27% representing a 3% per annum compound growth rate greater than the basic earnings per share pre-acquired intangible amortisation and exceptional items for the financial year to 31 March 2003.
Once this hurdle was achieved, actual levels of vesting depended on the comparative TSR performance of the Company as at 31 March 2006 against the shares of the companies comprising the FTSE All-Share Index other than Investment Trusts on 1 April 2003.
The target provided for no vesting at or below median ranking, 25% vesting for immediately above median ranking and 100% vesting for top quartile ranking with proportionate straight-line vesting in between.
Babcock International Group PLC 53 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 Service contracts The following table summarises the key terms apart from as to remuneration of the Chairmans and Executive Directors service contracts or terms of appointment: Chairman and Executive Directors Name Date of service contract Notice period Contractual retirement age G A Campbell 31 July 2003 amended by 12 months from Company, 6 months from Director 65 Chairman letters dated 5 May 2004 and 3 April 2006 P L Rogers 31 July 2003 amended by 12 months from Company, 6 months from Director 65 Group Chief Executive letters dated 5 May 2004 and 3 April 2006 W Tame 20 September 2001 amended 12 months from Company, 6 months from Director 65 Group by letters dated 5 May 2004 Finance Director and 3 April 2006 The Companys policy is that Directors service contracts should be capable of being terminated by the Company on not more than 12 months notice.
If the Company terminates a Directors service contract other than following a change of control or by the exercise of the Companys option to pay salary in lieu of notice see below the Company will have regard to all the circumstances in determining the amount of compensation, if any, payable to him in connection with that termination.
The agreements for Mr Campbell, Mr Rogers and Mr Tame contain provisions relating to termination following a change of control, as described below.
These provisions do no more than reflect what would, in effect, be a likely outcome in practice for these positions following a change of control and may contain the liability in such case, as the payment is limited to base salary and for Mr Rogers and Mr Tame, 40% in lieu of bonus, which is significantly less than their actual bonus potential.
The contracts provide that within 90 days of the occurrence of the change of control the Director may terminate his employment forthwith.
If he exercises this right, he is only entitled to be paid his basic salary plus, in the case of Mr Rogers and Mr Tame, 40% in lieu of bonus and all other contractual entitlements on a monthly basis, but any amount that he receives by way of income from other sources within that 12-month period, if it exceeds 10% of salary, that he would not have been able to earn had he continued in employment with the Company, is deductible from the amounts otherwise payable by the Company.
If the Company terminates the Directors appointment within 12 months of a change of control, the Director is entitled to a termination payment equal to 100% of his annual salary plus, in the case of Mr Rogers and Mr Tame, an additional 40% in lieu of bonus and all other benefits.

The latest written terms of appointment are available for inspection at the Companys registered office and at the Companys Annual General Meeting.
The expected time commitment of Non-Executive Directors is set out in their current written terms of appointment.
Outside directorships Before taking up any new outside appointment, an Executive Director must first seek the approval of the Chairman.
Any fees for outside appointments are retained by the Director.
Mr Tame, Executive Director, is a Non-Executive Director of Carclo PLC.
During the period 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008 his fees for that role were 25,000.
