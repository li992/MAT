The maximum bonus has been capped at 75% of basic salary following consultation with major shareholders.
Bonus maximum opportunities range from 35% to 65% for other senior managers based on Company and on personal performance.
Long-term incentives Introduction During the year ended 31 March 2008, the Remuneration Committee, in consultation with shareholders, carried out a review of executive incentives generally and more specifically long-term incentives.
At the 2007 AGM, shareholders approved certain revisions to the Share Match Incentive Scheme SMIS and the implementation of the Performance Share Plan PSP and grants were made under these schemes to Executive Directors and members of the Executive Board in December 2007.
Grants under the PSP were made in place of grants under the Executive Share Option Schemes.
The performance conditions were made more stretching compared to those previously applied to executive share option grants.
Executive Share Options No executive share options were granted to members of the Executive Board, including Executive Directors, during the year ended 31 March 2008, having been replaced by awards under the terms of the PSP, details of which are given on page 43.
Executive share options were granted to other Wincanton Senior Managers in December 2007 based on the scale of their role in the Company up to a maximum grant of 100% of salary.
Executive share options are intended as an incentive to generate future long-term value rather than a reward for past performance: 248 senior managers received a grant of executive share options in 2007 2006: 232.
Executive share options for UK resident employees are initially granted under the terms of the HMRC Approved scheme, which permits a participant to hold options with a value at the date of grant of up to 30,000.
When a participant realises their HMRC limit, or for non-UK resident employees, further options are granted under the Unapproved Scheme.
Any gain made on exercise of those options which are granted under the Approved Scheme are free from income tax and National Insurance contributions whereas the gain made on the exercise of unapproved options is not.
All executive share options granted under the Wincanton plc Executive Share Option Scheme 2001 have been subject to two vesting conditions being: continued employment and Company performance where, the average annual growth in the Groups underlying EPS figure published in the audited accounts must, in a three-year period, equal or exceed the average annual growth in the Governments Retail Price Index plus 3.0% over the same period.
This performance condition is considered appropriate and in line with market practice.
It seeks to achieve commonality of goals between optionholders and shareholders.
Subject to passing these conditions and the options vesting, participants have seven years in which to exercise their options.
41 Wincanton plc Annual Report 2008 Directors remuneration report continued Grants made in 2001 and 2002 permitted retesting of the performance condition.
However, for grants made on or after the 1 January 2003, retesting was not permitted.
The relevant three-year periods for measuring the performance condition for each option grant is as follows: Date of grant Performance period Performance status 1 June and September 2001 Any three consecutive financial years within the period 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2006 Passed 1 July and December 2002 Any three consecutive financial years within the period 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2007 Passed 1 March 2004 The three consecutive financial years ended 31 March 2006 Passed 1 December 2004 The three consecutive financial years ended 31 March 2007 Passed 1 July and December 2005 The three consecutive financial years ended 31 March 2008 Passed December 2006 The three consecutive financial years ended 31 March 2009 Untested December 2007 The three consecutive financial years ended 31 March 2010 Untested 1 Options are exercisable subject to the continued employment condition.
Executive share options are not issued at a discount.
The option price is calculated with reference to the middle market closing price of a share on the immediately preceding day, or the average of the middle market closing price of a share on the 3 or 5 immediately preceding business days.
There have been no changes in the number of executive share options held by Executive Directors between 1 April 2008 and 4 June 2008.
Variation in share capital If there is a variation in the equity share capital of Wincanton, including a capitalisation or rights issue, sub-division, consolidation or reduction of share capital, the number and or nominal amount of Wincanton shares comprised in each option and the option price may be adjusted in any way including retrospective adjustments which the Directors or the Trustee consider appropriate but, insofar as the Approved Executive Scheme is concerned, subject to HMRCs prior approval.
Takeover In the case of a company taking control of the Company, options may be exercised within the 6 month period after the company making the offer has obtained control of the Company.
Company reconstruction If the court sanctions a scheme for the reconstruction of the Company or its amalgamation with any other companies, options may be exercised within the 6 month period after the date of the court sanction.
Demerger If the Directors become aware that the Company is, or is expected, to be affected by any demerger, dividend in specie, super dividend or other transaction, which affect the current or future value of any option, the Directors may allow some or all options to be exercised.
Winding-up If notice is given of a general meeting of the Company at which a resolution will be proposed for the voluntary winding-up of the Company, optionholders shall be entitled, at any time prior to the commencement of such winding-up, to exercise their options conditionally upon the commencement of the winding-up.
Administration If an administration order is made, optionholders may exercise their options within 6 weeks after the date of the administration order subject to authorisation by the administrator or the court.
Voluntary arrangement If a voluntary arrangement is proposed, optionholders may exercise their options within 14 days after the date of sending any notices of meeting in relation to such proposal.
42 Wincanton plc Annual Report 2008 Shares held by the Employee Share Trust are not directly held in relation to the executive share option schemes and therefore there are no restrictions on the transfer of shares and nor are there any voting right restrictions in relation to the Executive Share Option Schemes.
On exercise, shares will be held directly by the participant and will have full voting rights and can be transferred without any restriction.
Where an employee leaves other than for the reasons of injury or disability, redundancy, a transfer of employment which is subject to the Transfer of Undertaking Protection of Employment Regulations 2006, a change of control or other circumstances giving rise to the participants employing company ceasing to be an associated company of any participating company or retirement on or after reaching retirement age, they lose their entitlement to their options.
If however they leave for one of the above mentioned reasons, subject to the performance condition, a participant has 6 months in which to exercise their options.
In the case of death, the personal representatives have 12 months to exercise the options.
Performance shares As part of the review, by the Remuneration Committee, of executive incentives, the Wincanton plc Performance Share Plan 2007 PSP was developed and was approved by shareholders at the 2007 AGM.
The PSP replaces executive share options, under normal circumstances, for the Executive Board, including Executive Directors.
Annual grants of performance shares up to a maximum of 100% of annual salary are permitted: this was limited to 50% in 2007.
Dividends accrue over the three-year performance period and are paid on those shares that vest.
Performance shares were granted to the 14 members of the Executive Board to the value of 50% of annual salary as at the date of grant.
They are intended as an incentive to generate future long-term company value rather than a reward for past performance.
Performance shares awarded under the PSP are subject to the following two vesting conditions: continued employment and Company performance.
The performance conditions are significantly more stretching than those of executive share options, as follows: 50% of the award will vest subject to the Companys TSR performance over 3 years equalling or exceeding that of the FTSE 250 Index over the same period the TSR Award, and 50% of the matching award will vest subject to underlying EPS performance over 3 years the EPS Award equalling or exceeding the target.
10% of the TSR Award will vest if the TSR performance equals the TSR of the FTSE 250 index, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting of the TSR Award if the TSR performance is equal to or greater than 20% per annum in excess of the TSR of the FTSE 250 Index where the TSR of the FTSE 250 Index is measured using the change in the FTSE 250 Index multiplied by the Index dividend yield.
10% of the EPS Award will vest if the annual growth in underlying EPS equals 6% per annum, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting of the EPS Award if annual growth in underlying EPS equals or exceeds 15% per annum.
The Remuneration Committee believes that underlying EPS growth is a good measure of success for Wincanton, and provides good line-of-sight for executives, and that TSR performance against the FTSE 250 Index provides a good relative benchmark of Wincantons performance and provides good alignment with shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the sliding scale for each of the performance targets will provide a better relationship between pay and performance, and be more motivational to the participants.
Subject to passing the performance conditions and the options vesting, participants have 6 months in which to exercise.
The relevant three-year period for measuring the performance condition is as follows: Date of grant Performance period Performance status December 2007 The three consecutive financial years ended 31 March 2010 Untested Performance shares are classed as nil cost unconditional share awards for the purposes of the plan rules.

Variation in share capital If there is a variation in the equity share capital of Wincanton, including a capitalisation or rights issue, sub-division, consolidation or reduction of share capital, or a demerger, a special dividend or distribution, the Remuneration Committee may adjust the number or class of shares comprised in a conditional award.
Takeover In the case of a company taking control of the Company, an award vests but only to the extent that any performance condition has been satisfied.
An award will not vest to the extent that an offer to exchange the award is made.
Schemes of arrangement When a court sanctions a scheme, an award vests but only to the extent that any performance condition has been satisfied.
Demerger or other corporate event If the Directors become aware that the Company is, or is expected to be, affected by any demerger, dividend in specie, super dividend or other transaction which affect the current or future value of any option, an award vests but only to the extent that any performance condition has been satisfied.
43 Wincanton plc Annual Report 2008 Directors remuneration report continued Shares held by the Employee Share Trust are not directly held in relation to the PSP and therefore there are no restrictions on the transfer of shares and nor are there any voting right restrictions in relation to the PSP.
On exercise, exercised shares will be held directly by the participant and have full voting rights and can be transferred without any restriction.
If however they leave for one of the above mentioned reasons a participant must wait until the natural vesting date of the performance shares whereupon their entitlement will be time pro rated.
On exercise, income tax and National Insurance contributions are payable on the gain made by the participant.
Matching Shares Original Share Match Incentive Scheme The original Share Match Incentive Scheme 2003 SMIS continues to offer senior managers the opportunity to voluntarily purchase Wincanton shares and lodge them with the Trust, in its capacity as nominee, in return for the opportunity to earn matching shares after a further 3 years.
Lodged shares need to be held for at least 3 years to qualify for any matching shares.
Awards under the original SMIS were not made to the Executive Board, including Executive Directors, in 2007.
Instead, they received an award under the revised SMIS, details of which are given on page 45.
Senior managers can voluntarily invest 10%-50% of their bonus into the SMIS with a 1:1 match.
For Executive Directors the minimum mandatory investment was 25%, and the maximum voluntary investment a further 75%, of their net annual bonus.
For Executive Directors, those mandatory lodged shares, subject to performance conditions will be matched after 3 years on a 1:1 basis with voluntarily lodged shares matched on a 2:1 basis.
No shares have been lodged in excess of the mandatory amount by Executive Directors under the original SMIS.
Matching shares are intended as an incentive to generate future long-term Company value rather than a reward for past performance.
Matching shares were awarded to 41 senior managers excluding Executive Directors in July 2007 40 in July 2006.
Matching shares granted under the original SMIS are subject to two vesting conditions: continued employment and Company performance where, the average annual growth in the Groups underlying EPS figure published in the audited accounts must, in a three-year period, equal or exceed the average annual growth in the Governments Retail Price Index plus 3.0% over the same period This performance condition is considered appropriate and in line with market practice.
On vesting the options have a 6 month exercise period.
There have been 3 awards of matching shares and the relevant three-year periods are, for each of these awards, as follows: Date of grant Performance period Performance status 1 June 2005 The three consecutive financial years ended 31 March 2008 Passed July 2006 The three consecutive financial years ended 31 March 2009 Untested 2 July 2007 The three consecutive financial years ended 31 March 2010 Untested 1 Subject to the continued employment condition.

44 Wincanton plc Annual Report 2008 Winding-up If notice is given of a general meeting of the Company at which a resolution will be proposed for the voluntary winding-up of the Company, optionholders shall be entitled at any time prior to the commencement of such winding-up to exercise their options conditionally upon the commencement of the winding-up.
Except for those shares held by the Trust in its capacity as nominee, shares held by the Trust are not directly held in relation to the SMIS and therefore there are no restrictions on the transfer of shares and nor are there any voting right restrictions in relation to the SMIS.
Participants are entitled to vote on the shares lodged under the terms of the scheme and held by the Trust in its capacity as nominee.
Participants are free to transfer lodged shares out of the Trust at any time but in doing so they lose their entitlement to the proportional amount of matching shares.
Where an employee leaves other than for the reasons of injury or disability, redundancy, a transfer of employment which is subject to the Transfer of Undertaking Protection of Employment Regulations 2006, a change of control or other circumstances giving rise to the participants employing company ceasing to be an associated company of any participating company or retirement on or after reaching retirement age they lose their entitlement to their matching shares.
If however they leave for one of the above mentioned reasons subject to the performance condition, their entitlement will be time pro rated and a participant has 6 months in which to exercise.
On exercise, income tax and National Insurance contributions are payable on the gain made by the participant: the Company has elected to pay these charges on behalf of participants.
Revised Share Match Incentive Scheme As part of the review by the Remuneration Committee of executive incentives, shareholders at the 2007 AGM approved revised rules of the SMIS.
The scheme rules were revised to increase its motivational effectiveness and strengthen the alignment of the Executive Board with shareholders.
The principal changes were to the maximum individual limits, including the basis on which lodged shares are purchased and matching shares awarded.
The revisions were made in conjunction with the implementation of the PSP.
The revised scheme gives members of the Executive Board, including Executive Directors, the opportunity to purchase Wincanton shares with a value of up to 50% of their net annual basic salary 100% of their net annual basic salary in respect of the first award made in December 2007 and lodge those shares with the Trust, in its capacity as nominee, in return for the opportunity to earn matching shares after a further 3 years.
The minimum investment for Executive Directors is 25% of their net annual bonus.
Participants have the opportunity to earn matching shares, subject to performance conditions, with a total market value in any one financial year of up to 200% of gross annual salary, or up to 400% of gross annual salary in respect of the first award made in December 2007.
All matching shares would be forfeited if a participant resigns or withdraws their investment within 3 years from the start of the performance period.
Dividends will be accrued on matching shares over the performance period but paid at vesting and only on those matching shares that vest.
Matching shares are intended as an incentive to generate future long-term Company value rather than a reward for past performance and the first awards of such matching shares were made to 14 participants in December 2007.
Matching shares granted under the revised SMIS are subject to the following two vesting conditions: continued employment and Company performance.
The performance conditions are significantly more stretching than for previous awards, as follows: 50% of the matching award will vest subject to the Companys TSR performance over 3 years equalling or exceeding that of the FTSE250 Index over the same period the TSR Award, and 50% of the matching award will vest subject to underlying EPS performance over 3 years the EPS Award equalling or exceeding the target.
10% of the TSR award will vest if the TSR performance equals the TSR of the FTSE 250 index, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting of the TSR Award if the TSR performance is equal to or greater than 20% per annum in excess of the TSR of the FTSE250 Index where the TSR of the FTSE250 Index is measured using the change in the FTSE 250 Index multiplied by the Index dividend yield.
10% of the EPS Award will vest if the compound annual growth in underlying EPS equals 6% per annum, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting of the EPS Award if compound annual growth in underlying EPS equals or exceeds 15 per cent per annum.
The Remuneration Committee believes that underlying EPS growth is a good measure of success for Wincanton, and provides good line-of-sight for executives, and that TSR performance against the FTSE250 Index provides a good relative benchmark of Wincantons performance and provides good alignment with shareholders.
Subject to passing the performance conditions and the options vesting, participants have a six-month exercise period.
The relevant three-year period for the matching share award is as follows: Date of grant Performance period Performance status December 2007 The three consecutive financial years ended 31 March 2010 Untested Matching shares are classed as nil cost options for the purposes of the plan rules.

If there is a takeover, reconstruction, amalgamation or winding-up of Wincanton, the same rules apply in respect of the revised SMIS as to the original SMIS as noted above, as do the comments in respect of transfers, voting rights, exercise and entitlements on leaving employment.
Share Incentive Plan The Company operates a Share Incentive Plan approved by HMRC, which includes partnership, matching and dividend shares.
After 3 months continuous service, all UK resident employees are eligible to participate in the Wincanton plc Share Incentive Plan 2003 SIP.
The SIP is evergreen allowing people to, within certain limits, join the plan, leave the plan and vary their contribution at any time.
Employees are invited to buy partnership shares from pre-tax salary with a maximum investment in each tax year of 1,500 or 10% of annual salary, if less.
Partnership shares are purchased every month.
Employees can withdraw partnership shares from the SIP at any time although there are tax advantages if the shares are retained in the SIP for more than three years.
Where employees buy partnership shares, the Company awards matching shares on a basis of one matching share for every four partnership shares acquired.
There are tax advantages if matching shares are retained in the SIP for at least three years.
Where a participant other than for the reasons of injury or disability, redundancy, a transfer of employment which is subject to the Transfer of Undertaking Protection of Employment Regulations 2006, a change of control or other circumstances giving rise to the participants employing company ceasing to be an associated company of any participating company or retirement on or after reaching retirement age chooses to transfer partnership shares out of the SIP within three years of the date of purchase, entitlement to those matching shares which were awarded in respect of those partnership shares will be lost.
Cash dividends paid on the partnership shares are automatically reinvested to purchase dividend shares up to a value of 1,500 per year.
Employees can withdraw dividend shares from the SIP at any time although there are tax advantages if the shares are retained in the SIP for more than three years.
Executive Directors interests in the SIP As at 31 March 2008 Audited information At 1 April 2007 At 31 March 2008 Partnership shares Matching shares Dividend shares Partnership shares Matching shares Dividend shares G McFaull 976 244 46 1,366 341 101 N Sullivan 976 244 46 1,366 341 101 Between 1 April 2008 and 4 June 2008, 74 partnership shares were purchased by and 19 matching shares awarded to each of the Executive Directors included in the above table.
In the event of a company reconstruction, which results in a holding of new shares such as a take-over or reorganisation, the new shares may be treated as equivalent to the old shares held for the purposes of the SIP at the date of the reconstruction.
No specific restrictions apply to the transfer of shares held under the SIP however: the timing of a transfer may result, as mentioned above, in a tax charge being incurred and an entitlement to matching shares lost.
Participants are entitled to vote on the all shares held under the terms of the SIP.
46 Wincanton plc Annual Report 2008 Executive Directors shareholdings We believe it is important that the interests of Executive Directors should be closely aligned with those of shareholders.
The long-term incentives provide considerable alignment.
These shares were sold solely with the purpose of funding an exercise of executive share options which was itself done to lodge shares under the terms of the revised SMIS.
There were no changes in the Directors personal holdings between 1 April 2008 and 4 June 2008 except for those in relation to the SIP detailed on page 46.
None of the Directors held any shares non-beneficially nor had any interest in the shares of any subsidiary undertakings.
Dilution Newly issued shares are currently used to satisfy the exercise of executive share options granted on or before December 2004: all other longterm incentives are satisfied by shares delivered by the Trust, that buys the shares on the market using funding from the Company.
For those options granted in December 2004 and for leavers of other option grants, the Trust equity settles those options granted under the Unapproved executive share option scheme.
