GOVERNANCE 35 REMUNERATION REPORT Compliance This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
As required, this report is being put to shareholders at the forthcoming AGM for an advisory vote.
The sections within this report that have been audited by Deloitte LLP are indicated.
Throughout 2008 the company complied with Schedule A of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance the Code regarding best practice on the design of performance-related remuneration.
Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee normally meets at least four times a year and determines the remuneration of the executive directors and senior employees.
The Committee is composed entirely of non-executive directors and comprises Mr J R W Orange, who chairs the Committee and is the companys senior non-executive independent director, Messrs J Darby, D C Lindsell and Professor D G Roberts.
Messrs S J Dobbie and R V Emerson retired from the Committee on 6 June 2008.
The Board considers that the membership of the Committee is in compliance with the Code recommendation, on the basis that it considers Mr J R W Orange to be independent, notwithstanding his length of service.
Sir David John, the companys Chairman, is not a member of the Committee, but attends by invitation.
Mr S C Lockett is not a member of the Committee but usually attends meetings by invitation, except when his own remuneration is being discussed, as the company considers it important that the Chief Executive is fully aware of discussions concerning remuneration policy and the remuneration packages of its most senior employees.
No director of the company is involved in determining his own remuneration.
The determination of the remuneration of the nonexecutive directors is a matter reserved for Board decision.
The Committee acts within its agreed written terms of reference and complies with the relevant provisions of the Code in implementing its remuneration policy.
The terms of reference are published on the companys website www.
The role of the Committee includes: considering and determining the remuneration policy for executive directors: within this agreed policy, considering and determining the total compensation package of each executive director of the company: considering and advising on the general principles under which remuneration is applied to employees of the company: determining the awards to be made under the companys long-term incentive schemes: and determining the policy for pension arrangements, service agreements and termination payments to directors.
As in previous years, the principal focus of the Committee in 2008 has been to ensure that the remuneration packages of the senior executives are set at levels which are sufficient to retain and attract high-quality individuals in what remains a competitive market.
The Committee takes independent advice from Hewitt New Bridge Street, a leading firm of remuneration consultants, which is appointed as an advisor to the Committee.
Hewitt New Bridge Street do not provide any other services to the company.
No other person or company materially assisted the Committee during the year.
Remuneration policy The companys remuneration policy is to provide remuneration packages which ensure that directors and senior management are fairly and responsibly rewarded for their contributions.
The aim is to provide remuneration packages which are sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the quality required to achieve the groups objectives and thereby enhance shareholder value.
The Committee takes account of the level of remuneration paid to executive directors and senior managers of comparable public companies, as well as pay and conditions throughout the remainder of the group.
The main components of executive directors remuneration are basic salary, an annual performance-related cash and share bonus scheme with a deferred element, benefits, long-term incentives and pension provision.
Each element is discussed in detail below.
The remuneration therefore contains a suitable balance of direct performance-related remuneration, which links both the short-term financial performance of the group and the long-term shareholder return with the executives total remuneration.
The remuneration package is weighted so that the majority of reward may potentially come from the performance-related elements of the package.
The Committee endorses the principle of mitigation of damages on early termination of a service contract.
It is the Committees current intention to continue with the above remuneration approach for 2009 and subsequent years although the Committee will keep the matter under review.
The Committees current intention with regard to share options is that they will continue to be awarded only in special circumstances.
Shareholders approved the adoption of the Asset and Equity Plan AEP at the AGM in 2004 together with a matching shares element approved at the AGM in 2006 and awards have continued to be granted thereunder.
However, the AEP expires in May 2009 and so a new Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, based in part on the AEP, will be proposed at the forthcoming AGM and, subject to shareholder approval being received, future long-term incentive awards will be granted under that plan.
Summary details of the LTIP are set out in the Asset and Equity Plan Audited section of this report and full details of its principal terms are contained in the Notice of AGM, accompanying this document.
The companys Articles of Association provide that the remuneration paid to non-executive directors is to be determined by the Board within the limits set by the shareholders.
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements 36 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Performance chart The chart below shows the companys total shareholder return TSR, defined as the increase in the value of a share, including re-invested dividends, over the last five financial years compared with the equivalent information in respect of the FTSE All Share Oil & Gas Producers Index, which the Committee considers to be the most relevant equity market index.
Total shareholder return Value 300 Premier Oil plc FTSE All Share Oil & Gas Producers Index 250 216.48 200 164.47 150 100 50 0 31 Dec 03 31 Dec 04 31 Dec 05 31 Dec 06 31 Dec 07 31 Dec 08 This graph looks at the value, at 31 December 2008, of 100 invested in Premier Oil plc on 31 December 2003 compared with the value of 100 invested in the FTSE All Share Oil & Gas Producers Index.
Contracts of service Save for automatic termination when each executive director becomes 60 years of age, the executive directors have rolling service contracts and are subject to re-election by shareholders under the companys Articles of Association and the provisions of the Code.
The service contract of each executive director may be terminated on 12 months notice in writing by either side, in accordance with current market practice.
In such event, the compensation commitments in respect of their contracts could amount to one years remuneration based on base salary, annual bonus and long-term incentive scheme entitlement, benefits in kind and pension rights during the notice period.
There are provisions for earlier termination by the company in certain circumstances.
If such circumstances were to arise, the executive director concerned would have no claim against the company for damages or any other remedy in respect of the termination.
There are no other provisions, such as liquidated damages clauses, which expressly provide for compensation in the event of early termination.
The Committee would apply general principles of mitigation to any payment made to a departing executive director and would consider each case on an individual basis.
Messrs S C Lockett and R A Allan have service contracts dated 9 December 2003.
Mr A R C Durrant has a service contract dated 1 July 2005 and Mr N Hawkings service contract is dated 23 March 2006.
Non-executive directors have letters of appointment, which are all effective for a period of three years subject to reappointment by the members in General Meeting, all of which have a notice period of three months.
Sir David John and Mr J R W Orange have letters of appointment issued on 28 July 2006.
Professor D G Roberts has a letter of appointment dated 30 June 2006 and Mr J Darby has a letter of appointment dated 1 September 2007.
Messrs D C Lindsell and M Romieu have letters of appointment dated 17 January 2008 following their appointment to the Board on that date.
External appointments Executive directors are entitled to accept non-executive appointments outside the company providing that the Boards approval is sought.
Mr A R C Durrant currently holds one external non-executive directorship with Clipper Windpower plc and is entitled to retain the fees earned connected therewith 2008: US$76,300 and 2007: US$43,500.
Remuneration structure The remuneration package for the executive directors comprises base salary, bonus, benefits, entitlement to participate in the companys long-term incentive schemes and all-employee share schemes and pension.
Base salary Base salary is reviewed each year against other comparable companies in the oil and gas sector and general market data on the basis of companies in similar industries and those of a similar size.
The objective is to ensure that the base salary, when taken together with the rest of the package, provides a competitive but performance-driven remuneration package.
The policy of the Committee has been to position base salaries between the median and upper quartile.
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements GOVERNANCE 37 Base salary continued The salaries of the executive directors as at 1 January 2009 are as follows: Percentage increase Salary from 2008 % S C Lockett 435,000 10.1 R A Allan 300,000 5.3 A R C Durrant 320,000 10.3 N Hawkings 300,000 15.4 For all the executive directors, these increases, which in some cases are somewhat larger than normal, were determined after considering a range of factors such as company performance, the development of the executive and the positioning of his salary in relative terms.
In addition, account was taken of the recommendations of Hewitt New Bridge Street that these levels represent salaries between the median and upper quartile for executives in similar roles, in companies of similar size in the oil and gas sector and in general industry companies excluding financial services also of a similar size.
While salary is reviewed by reference to market conditions, the performance of the company and the performance of the individual, the Committee would not regard this element of remuneration as directly performance-related.
Annual bonus scheme The total annual bonus potential, which is non-pensionable, is 100 per cent of base salary.
Half of any bonus earned is payable immediately in cash and the remaining half is payable in shares and deferred for three years.
The deferred element of the bonus is contingent upon the relevant beneficiary remaining in employment for the three years from the date of the award, but is not dependent on any further performance-related measures.
Performance measures for 2008 are explained in the table below: Maximum bonus Performance measures potential Conditions Exploration, portfolio management 70% Various milestones identified for the year, to achieve the medium-term and strategic development production target in excess of 50,000 boepd, including the drilling and success of exploration wells and the development of strategic investment divestment opportunities.
Production 10% To achieve the production number contained in the 2008 budget approved by the Board.
Operating cost per barrel 10% To achieve the operating cost per barrel number contained in the 2008 budget approved by the Board.
Health, safety, environment and security 10% Combined frequencies of lost time injuries and restricted work day cases of or below 1.7 cases per million man-hours worked.
Following a review of the 2008 targets, the Committee agreed that the production and operating cost per barrel targets and the health, safety, environment and security target had been achieved.
The Committee agreed a 25 per cent award out of the maximum 70 per cent in relation to the exploration, portfolio management and strategic development targets.
This resulted in a total award of 55 per cent of salary 27.5 per cent paid as cash and 27.5 per cent deferred in shares as indicated above for performance against the above targets 2007: 65 per cent of salary, paid as 32.5 per cent cash and 32.5 per cent deferred shares.
The annual bonus scheme for the 2009 financial year has a similar structure and the same maximum award level.
The performance metrics have been changed to include, amongst other things, specific targets relating to funding and management of the exploration portfolio.
This reflects the current difficult market conditions and the priorities of the business.
Performance measures for 2009 are explained in the table below: Maximum bonus Performance measures potential Conditions Finance and organisation 30% To ensure funding is in place to facilitate the investment programme.
To manage hedging and commitments to meet funding covenants at conservative oil prices.
Production and development 20% Various targets including progressing the major new field development projects on time and on budget.
Exploration 20% Various targets including portfolio management and exploration success.
New business 20% The delivery of various strategic investment divestment opportunities.
Health, safety, environment and security 10% Combined frequencies of lost time injuries and restricted work day cases of or below 1.55 cases per million man-hours worked.
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements 38 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Benefits Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan, A R C Durrant and N Hawkings each received the benefit of a car allowance and medical insurance.
Mr R A Allan also received a gym membership subsidy.
Long-term incentive arrangements The company currently operates the AEP, two Executive Share Option Schemes and an all-employee Share Incentive Plan and Save As You Earn Scheme.
Details of the Executive Share Option Schemes and the all-employee share plans are set out in the Share option schemes Audited section of this report.
The AEP is currently the companys main long-term incentive arrangement, and details of the awards granted to executive directors under this plan are set out in the Asset and Equity Plan Audited section of this report.
The life of the AEP will expire in May 2009.
Accordingly, it is proposed that a replacement, the 2009 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP be introduced to replace it.
Subject to shareholder approval for the LTIP being received, going forward the LTIP will have two primary elements.
The first will be an equity bonus pool created by reference to the increase in the equity value per share of the company over a three-year period.
The second will involve the grant of performance shares with an anticipated value on grant of 150 per cent of salary in the case of the Chief Executive and 125 per cent of salary in the case of all other executive directors subject to a total shareholder return TSR performance condition, measured relative to other oil companies.
As to vesting criteria, an equity bonus pool will not be created where the compound growth per annum in share price is below 10 per cent.
At 10 per cent compound growth per annum, 1 per cent of the growth will become the pool.
At 20 per cent compound growth per annum, 2.5 per cent of the growth will become the pool.
The size of the pool will increase on a straight-line basis between these two points.
Individuals rights to the proceeds from the pool are based on a pre-determined allocation.
In the event that the value of an individual entitlement exceeds 100 per cent of salary, the Committee must be satisfied that there has been long-term improvement in the underlying financial performance of the company.
Performance shares will not vest if the companys TSR performance is below the median of a comparator group comprising approximately 35 companies.
At the median they will vest as to 25 per cent and at upper quartile or above as to 100 per cent with proportionate vesting on a straight-line basis between those two points.
Half of any executive directors vested award will be received in shares and the other half in the form of an award of deferred shares which will vest three years later i. e. six years after the initial grant.
Any such deferred shares shall also attract the grant of a Matching Award over further shares with such Matching Award being subject to a TSR performance condition on the same terms as currently apply to Matching Awards granted under the AEP as described in more detail in the Asset and Equity Plan Audited section of this report.
These two elements have been chosen to ensure that there will be continued alignment between the interests of shareholders and executives via share price performance as well as providing an important incentive to management to outperform the companys most relevant competitors via the TSR performance condition.
Pension Details of the executive directors pension arrangements are set out in the Pension schemes Audited section of this report.
A contribution of 50,040 was paid in 2008 to Mr S C Locketts personal money purchase pension scheme.
In 2007 35,672 was paid as a salary supplement and 15,684 was paid into his personal money purchase pension scheme, as part of his pension arrangements.
51,716 of Mr A R C Durrants remuneration relates to a salary supplement as part of his pension arrangements.
Mr N Hawkings sacrificed 50,000 of his 2008 bonus into his personal money purchase pension scheme.
The basic fee for each of the non-executive directors excluding the Chairman at the end of 2008 was 40,000 per annum.
An additional fee of 8,000 per annum was paid per committee Chairmanship.
Mr J R W Orange is provided with an additional set fee of 2,000 per annum in respect of his position as senior independent non-executive director.
Mr J Darbys total remuneration in 2007 is calculated from 1 September 2007, being the date of his appointment to the Board.
Messrs S J Dobbie and R V Emerson retired from the Board on 6 June 2008.
Messrs D C Lindsell and M Romieus total remuneration in 2008 is calculated from 17 January 2008, being the date of their appointments to the Board.
Benefits in kind represent gym membership, car allowance and medical insurance.
On 22 July 2006 the company entered into an Advisory Service Agreement with former non-executive director Mr M A K Alizai, under which he provided services as an advisor to the Board.
Mr Alizai was paid US$87,500 for the year to 21 July 2008, when the agreement terminated.

Mid-market closing price on date of award.
Pension schemes Audited Mr S C Lockett is a member of the Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan the Scheme, subject to the earnings cap.
The Scheme is a funded, registered final salary scheme, which provides a pension on broadly a fiftieths accrual basis of up to twothirds salary at the normal pension age of 60.
Benefits are actuarially reduced on early retirement before age 60 and pensions in payment increase in line with the lower of inflation or 5 per cent per annum.
The company has decided to continue to operate its own cap on pensionable earnings beyond April 2006, when the external cap was removed.
For the year to 31 December 2008 this was set at 112,800 increasing to 117,600 for the year to 31 December 2009.
The company has agreed to provide Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan, A R C Durrant and N Hawkings with a pension substantially as if they were contributing members of the Scheme and, in regard to service completed subsequent to their appointment as directors, not subject to the earnings cap.
The additional value of this target pension provision, relative to the standard terms applied to staff, is made available at the directors option in the form of either an enhanced scale of pension contributions or a non-pensionable salary supplement.
As at the year-end, Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan and N Hawkings had elected the former and Mr A R C Durrant had elected the latter.
Messrs R A Allan and N Hawkings are members of a money purchase pension arrangement to which, during 2008, the company contributed 57,917 and 52,912 respectively: these amounts include 34,637 and 29,632 respectively in regard to the enhanced pension contributions referred to above.
Mr S C Lockett is a member of a money purchase pension arrangement to which, during 2008, the company contributed 50,040 in regards to the enhanced pension contributions referred to above.
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements 40 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Pension schemes Audited continued The accrued pension entitlements of the directors who were members or deemed members of the Scheme during 2008 are as follows: b d f a Transfer value c Transfer value Increase from e Increase Accrued in respect Accrued in respect d to b less Transfer value in accrued pension as at of a as at pension as at of c as at contributions of increase pension 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December by director in accrued excluding 2008 2008 2007 2007 during 2008 benefit inflation '000 pa '000 '000 pa '000 '000 '000 000 S C Lockett 54.0 393.2 42.7 290.8 79.8 69.9 9.6 R A Allan 24.8 236.6 17.9 166.8 53.8 59.2 6.2 A R C Durrant 18.5 187.7 11.9 117.3 54.1 61.9 6.1 N Hawkings 13.4 120.1 8.0 68.9 36.7 45.7 5.1 Notes: The amounts of accrued pension under a and c represent the accrued pension entitlements of the director as at the stated dates.
The transfer value under d has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the guidance note GN11: Retirement Benefit Schemes Transfer Values issued by the Board for Actuarial Standards under the Financial Reporting Council.
This guidance note was replaced by the Occupational Pension Schemes Transfer Values Amendment Regulations 2008 SI 2008 1050 with effect from 1 October 2008.
The transfer values under b and e have been calculated in line with the Occupational Pension Schemes Transfer Values Amendment Regulations 2008 SI 2008 1050.
The amounts under e represent the increase in value of the directors benefits in terms of the value, on the transfer value basis in force at the end of the year, of the excess of the end-year accrued benefits over the start-year accrued benefits as revalued by price inflation less contributions by the directors.
The values stated above correspond with the target level of final salary pension provision: in practice, the pension benefits for these directors are principally established through individual money purchase arrangements and salary supplements.
Thus, in the case of Mr A R C Durrant, who has elected not to receive enhanced pension contributions, the companys pension obligation will be met entirely by the payment of salary supplements.
In addition to the current provision noted above, Mr R A Allan is entitled to a deferred pension under the Scheme in respect of a prior service period with the company between September 1986 and November 1999.
Members of the Scheme have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions: none of the directors have elected to do so.
The following payments were made to a former director of the company in respect of unfunded pension liabilities: Amount of unfunded Amount of unfunded pension paid during 2008 pension paid during 2007 J A Heath 32,526 31,275 Asset and Equity Plan Audited The AEP is designed to reward an improvement in the asset value of the business and the market value of the company over a three-year period.
The plan therefore has two bonus pools an asset bonus pool and an equity bonus pool.
The asset bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the net asset value per share of the company over a three-year period and the equity bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the equity value per share of the company over a three-year period.
In both cases, no bonus pool is created where the compound growth per annum in the relevant measure asset value or share price is below 10 per cent.
At 10 per cent compound growth per annum, 1 per cent of the growth becomes the pool.
At 20 per cent compound growth per annum, 2.5 per cent of the growth becomes the pool.
The size of the pool increases on a straight-line basis between these two points.
In addition, the vesting of awards is subject to the Committee being satisfied that there has been satisfactory improvement in the performance of the company.
Under this plan awards have been made annually and will mature on the third anniversary of grant.
The AEP is a broadly-based plan with participation points being awarded to eligible employees, including executive directors, throughout the group.
New employees who join the company part of the way through the duration of a three-year award are awarded participation points in that award on a time-apportioned basis.
In addition, employees who receive a significant promotion during an award period are eligible to receive an increased participation, also on a time-apportioned basis.
The maximum benefit that an individual may receive will normally be limited to twice his or her base salary per annum, except where the compound growth rate exceeds 20 per cent per annum in either the asset or equity bonus pool, in which case the Committee may increase the limit on such a proportionate basis as it determines to be fair and reasonable.
At the time of vesting, 50 per cent of an award is payable in cash and 50 per cent is payable in the form of an award of deferred shares.
Awards granted in 2007 and 2008 will, however, be payable entirely in shares, with 50 per cent payable in the form of deferred shares.
The Matching Award scheme is an amendment to the plan approved by shareholders at the 2006 AGM which gives participants the option to increase the six-month deferral of the share element of the scheme to three years.
This extended deferral is mandatory for the executive directors and senior management but voluntary for other staff.
The shares deferred for the extended period will participate in a Matching Award.
The release of this part of the award will therefore be six years following the initial grant of the award under the plan.
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements GOVERNANCE 41 Asset and Equity Plan Audited continued Matching Awards are subject to performance criteria related to comparative TSR over a three-year period.
The comparator group consists of about thirty five listed companies in the oil and gas sector.
TSR will be measured as the percentage increase in a return index of the comparator group between the beginning and end of the performance period, which begins on the first day of the financial year in which the Matching Award is granted.
The return index at the beginning of the performance period is the average of the return index on each weekday in the three-month period prior to the start of the performance period.
In order to ascertain the return index at the end of the performance period, the same averaging method will be used for the three months prior to the end of the performance period.
If the companys TSR is at the median against the comparator group, then Matching Awards vest on a 0.5:1 basis and where comparative performance is at or above the upper decile, Matching Awards vest on a 2.5:1 basis with proportionate vesting on a straight-line basis between these two points.
Independent external advice will be taken to assess whether the company has met the TSR performance condition and to confirm that the companies which made up the index and the measurement of the companys performance are both in accordance with the rules of the AEP.
Details of Deferred Shares and Matching Awards granted to directors under the Asset and Equity Plan are set out below: No.
There are no performance criteria for the Deferred Shares.
Matching Awards granted are the maximum award possible under the Matching Award scheme, subject to performance criteria.
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements 42 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Outstanding Asset and Equity Plan awards As at 31 December 2008, a total of 1,254.55 participation points have been allocated under the 2006 award.
1,171.25 participation points were awarded in 2006 on the date of grant and 204.80 have been awarded since then, as time-apportioned compensatory awards to employees other than executive directors who have joined the company during the three-year performance period.
121.50 participation points have been forfeited due to participants leaving the employment of the company.
The directors have been allocated the following points under the 2006 award: Number of participation points S C Lockett 62 R A Allan 45 A R C Durrant 45 N Hawkings 45 The equity bonus pool of the 2006 award was calculated by comparing the market value calculated by reference to the average share price for the three months prior to the date of award 1 January 2006, with the market value similarly calculated to 31 December 2008.
The minimum vesting threshold for the equity bonus pool was not achieved, resulting in this part of the award lapsing.
An independent external valuation of the asset bonus pool of the 2006 award will take place following the publication of the year-end results.
If it is determined that the minimum vesting threshold has been achieved, 50 per cent of the awards will be released in cash and 50 per cent will be in deferred shares.
1 As at 31 December 2008, a total of 6,015.70 participation points have been allocated under the 2007 award.
450.50 participation points have been awarded since the date of grant, as time-apportioned compensatory awards to employees other than executive directors who have joined the company during the three-year performance period and 343.0 participation points have been forfeited due to participants leaving the employment of the company.
The increase in aggregate participation points reflects the decision to extend the award to all global employees.
The directors have been allocated the following points under the 2007 award: Number of participation points S C Lockett 320 R A Allan 210 A R C Durrant 210 N Hawkings 210 Notes: 1.
The figure of 6,266.20 published in the 2007 Annual Report regarding the 2007 award included 509.60 participation points allocated for approved vacant positions.
Not all of these vacancies have been filled and therefore the points have not been awarded.
As at 31 December 2008, a total of 7,252.60 participation points have been allocated under the 2008 award.
The directors have been allocated the following points under the 2008 award: Number of participation points S C Lockett 310 R A Allan 205 A R C Durrant 205 N Hawkings 205 2009 awards The 2009 awards will be granted under the LTIP, subject to its approval at the 2009 AGM.
Premier Oil plc 2008 Annual Report and Financial Statements GOVERNANCE 43 Share option schemes Audited Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 Options granted under the 1995 scheme are normally exercisable, at the acquisition price, not less than three years after their date of grant and will lapse unless previously exercised on their tenth anniversary.
No payment is made for the grant of an option.
Options cannot be exercised until pre-determined performance conditions have been achieved.
For options granted prior to 2000 the performance requirement was that the share price plus the value of dividends paid must, as measured at the end of any consecutive three-year period, have grown at a rate equal to or greater than the FTSE All Share Oil & Gas Producers Index over the same period.
Options granted during and after 2000 are dependent upon growth in the companys earnings per share of at least 3 per cent per annum compound above the Retail Price Index over a three-year period.
Mr S C Lockett held options under this scheme during the financial year.
The options are listed in the table below: Options Mid-market Options Acquisition held at price on held at price per 1 January date of 31 December Date of grant Exercisable dates share 2008 Event exercise 2008 1 S C Lockett 16.04.98 16.04.03 16.04.08 3.725 7,680 Exercised 13.74 Notes: 1.
The mid-market closing price on the date of exercise 8 January 2008 was 13.74 resulting in a gain on exercise of 10.02 per share.
Executive Share Option Scheme 2003 This scheme replaced the 1995 scheme on completion of the companys Scheme of Arrangement in 2003.
Options granted under the scheme are normally exercisable not less than three years after their date of grant and will lapse unless previously exercised on their tenth anniversary.
Options cannot normally be exercised until pre-determined performance conditions have been achieved.
In the case of certain employees the performance condition is growth in earnings per share of at least 3 per cent per annum compound above the Retail Price Index over a three-year period.
In other cases, including grants made to Mr A R C Durrant under the scheme in 2005, the performance condition is based on the companys TSR in comparison with a group of eight companies as follows: Burren Energy, Cairn Energy, Dana Petroleum, Paladin Resources, Tullow Oil, Venture Production, Soco International and JKX Oil & Gas, measured between 1 June 2005 and 31 May 2008.
Options will vest as to 30 per cent in the event that median performance is achieved, with proportionate vesting on a straight-line basis up to 100 per cent if upper quartile performance is achieved.
TSR was selected as the performance measure for this plan as it aligns the interests of directors with shareholders by requiring superior TSR compared to competitor companies.

Share Incentive Plan Audited Under this plan, employees, including executive directors, may make contributions to acquire shares in the company Partnership Shares.
If an employee agrees to buy Partnership Shares, the company currently matches the number of Partnership Shares bought with an award of shares Matching Shares, on a one-for-one basis.
Should an employee leave the SIP scheme before the end of the three-year holding period they will lose the right to the Matching Shares, unless he she leaves due to injury, redundancy, TUPE transfer, retirement, death or the sale of the company.
In the case of the award of Matching Shares, the company has not required performance criteria to be fulfilled, as the purpose of the plan is to encourage all employees to become shareholders in the company.
The company invites all company employees to make contributions to acquire Partnership Shares on a monthly basis.
During 2008, Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan, A R C Durrant and N Hawkings contributed the maximum monthly amount of 125 to the plan.
