Hays plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 55 Remuneration Report Other conditional share awards The following table sets out the interests of the Directors in certain conditional share awards.
The nature of these awards is set out in the footnotes below.
A Restricted Share Award equivalent to the market value of 600,000 was awarded to Mr A R Cox on joining the Company.
This will vest over the first three years of Mr Coxs employment starting from 1 July 2007.
One sixth of the award will vest each year subject to continuing employment and one sixth will vest each year if the Group PBT growth exceeds RPI 3% measured from the 30 June 2007 base year.
This Restricted Share award was granted to Mr P Venables on terms equivalent to those of the Companys Deferred Equity Share Plan, modified to enable an award to be made to an executive Director.
Vesting is dependent on Mr Venables remaining in the Companys employment at the vesting date.
The award is linked to Mr Venables award under the Long Term Co-Investment Plan as described in the table on page 57.
The award granted to Mr D R Waxman is part of a special incentive arrangement following the Companys agreement with Mr Waxman to extend his service contract beyond his retirement date of 17 February 2007, pending the appointment of his successor.
Under the arrangement, Mr Waxman was granted a conditional award over 194,710 Ordinary shares the Annual Share Number in respect of the financial year ended 30 June 2007 determined by dividing 300,000 by the market value of a share averaged over the 20 business days before the execution of Mr Waxmans extended service agreement.
A second award of 179,732 Ordinary shares was made to Mr Waxman on 3 September 2007 in respect of the financial year ended 30 June 2008, which was calculated by taking the Annual Share Number and pro-rating it across the period 1 July 2007 to 6 June 2008.
The mid market price per share at the date of grant of Mr Waxmans second award was 158.97 pence.
Both awards vested following Mr Waxmans retirement and were contingent on the achievement of the following performance conditions: 20% of the Annual Share Number for both the financial years ended 30 June 2007 and 30 June 2008, were subject to non-financial targets relating to the strategic health of the business at either the end of the relevant financial year or at the time of handover to his successor, and maintaining the momentum of the business during the handover period.
80% of the Annual Share Number for both the financial years ended 30 June 2007 and 30 June 2008, was subject to financial targets the Financial Target based on Profit Before Tax PBT for the relevant financial year equalling or exceeding levels determined by the Remuneration Committee.
For the financial year ended 30 June 2007, if PBT equalled or exceeded 210m, then all of the shares under this element of the incentive would vest in full.
If PBT was 200m then 30% of the shares under this element of the incentive would vest.
Vesting of shares for PBT between 200m and 210m would be determined on a straight-line basis between 30% and 100%.
If PBT was less than 200m, then no shares under this element of the incentive would vest.
The PBT for the financial year ended 30 June 2007 was 211.7m and accordingly the full entitlement vested.
For the financial year ended 30 June 2008, the Financial Target applied in a similar way as in 2007.
The Committee determined the upper and lower elements of the Financial Target, as 222m and 238m.
The Financial Target was assessed by reference to the Companys actual PBT at the end of the four week period in which Mr Waxman retired from the Board, compared to the upper and lower elements of the Financial Target for the year the calculation was based on the assumption that the PBT accrued evenly over the financial year.
The Remuneration Committee determined that the criteria for both awards had been met in full and accordingly each award vested.
Half of the aggregate number of shares that vested 187,221 Ordinary shares was released to Mr Waxman on the 12 December 2007.
The mid market price per share at the date of release was 111.50p.
The balance will be released to him on 15 November 2008.
Directors interest in shares The beneficial interests of the Directors in office as at 30 June 2008 in the Ordinary shares of the Company at 30 June 2008 are set out below: Shares as at: 30 June 2008 30 June 2007 R A Lawson 175,287 175,287 A R Cox C W Eccleshare 3,000 3,000 P S Harrison 8,678 L M S Knox 8,000 8,000 1 R J Smelt 8,267 P H Stoneham 2 P Venables 159,244 48,140 1.

com Remuneration Report Long Term Co-Investment Plan From December 2003 to December 2005, the Company made invitations under the Long Term Co-Investment Plan.
The key features of the Plan were: participants had an annual opportunity to commit shares Committed Shares to the Plan, and can become entitled to receive matching shares if the Company outperforms its peers.
executive Directors could invest as Committed Shares an amount up to 30% of annual remuneration.
The number of matching shares available depends on the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR performance relative to a peer group of 15 recruitment companies including Hays based in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.
For all the grants, the comparator companies include: Adecco SA: Robert Half International Inc: Manpower Inc: Monster Worldwide Inc: Vedior NV: Kelly Services Inc: Michael Page International Plc: Spring Group Plc: Robert Walters Plc: Randstad Holdings NV: OPD Group Plc: Whitehead Mann Group Plc: Corporate Services Group Plc: and Harvey Nash Group Plc.
TSR is calculated in pounds sterling.
the maximum matching opportunity is five matching shares pre-tax for every Committed Share.
Matching at this level will only occur in the event of the Company ranking first in the peer group.
No matching shares will vest for sub-median performance.
matching shares vest three years after participants have been invited to participate, subject to achievement of the performance measure, retention of the Committed Shares throughout the relevant period and the individual participants continued employment with the Group.
The executive Directors have committed the following shares to the plan, representing in each case the maximum that they were invited to commit.
As a consequence they could become entitled to the maximum number of matching shares shown below without payment and prior to income tax on those shares : Matching shares Matching shares Matching shares Earliest Date of invitation Committed shares maximum lapsed during year vested during year Gain on award vesting date 1 D R Waxman 21 Dec 2004 118,000 590,000 552,341 37,659 42,837 21 Dec 2007 14 Dec 2005 183,501 917,505 14 Dec 2008 2 P Venables 2 May 2006 71,005 355,025 14 Dec 2008 Notes: 1.
The 2004 award made under the CIP vested in December 2007, and participants became entitled to a 33% match of their Committed Share based on the Companys TSR performance over the three year period to December 2007.
On 21 December 2007, Hays was ranked in 8th position out of the peer group of 15 companies.
The mid market price per share on date of vesting was 113.75p.
Mr P Venables Committed Shares and matching shares formed part of special arrangements implemented in connection with his recruitment as Group Finance Director.
Under these arrangements Mr Venables was granted a conditional right to receive 41,420 shares the Restricted Share Award, as set out in Other Conditional Share Awards on page 56.
In return for committing 71,005 shares on terms broadly equivalent to the Companys Long Term Co-Investment Plan, Mr Venables became potentially entitled without payment to the matching shares stated above subject to satisfaction of the same performance conditions as applied to the December 2005 invitations to other executives.
The shares under the Restricted Share Award to Mr P Venables count towards the maximum number of shares he has committed, even though he is not the beneficial owner of such shares prior to their vesting.
Any Restricted Shares or matching shares to which Mr Venables becomes entitled will be satisfied out of existing shares only.
