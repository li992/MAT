Performance graph The following graph shows the Companys performance, measured by total shareholder return delivered since the IPO in 2005, in comparison with the performance of the FTSE 350 Index excluding investment trusts also measured by total shareholder return.
The Remuneration Committee currently believes that this Index is the most suitable benchmark for comparison purposes as an appropriate industry specic index does not exist.
The Remuneration Committee will consider in the future whether a sufficient number of comparable companies exist to form an additional comparator group but as in previous years, do not believe that a suitable group exists at this time.
