The tables below contain the aggregate expected values of each option grant or performance share award.
The expected values of grants and awards made prior to November 2002 are the values previously disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Reports up to 2003 and were calculated by Mercer.
The expected values for the grants and awards made from 2003 to 2007 have been calculated by Mercer using: a binomial valuation model for the options that uses daily share price data and takes account of the option grant date, exercise price and risk-free rate of return, with assumptions as to dividend yield, future volatility and forfeiture: and a Monte Carlo simulation model for the performance share awards using the same inputs and assumptions as for the binomial model, but which projects, many thousands of times, the share price of the company along with the share prices of the comparator group stocks to determine correlations between the companies.
This produces a distribution of share prices and TSR rankings thus allowing complex market-based hurdles to be modelled.
The methods of calculation of expected values have not been audited by  LLP.

The characteristics for this scheme are such that gains on exercise of options were recognised in prior years in respect of all the share rights reflected in the table.
From 3 June 2000, the SAB Executive Share Purchase Scheme was closed for purposes of new awards, and replaced by the Mirror Scheme for the purposes of new awards to employees of South African employers in the group and certain categories of other employees of South African origin elsewhere in the group other than SABMiller plc directors, principally in Africa.
These are issued annually to employees on the basis of assessment of performance and potential.
The unconditional vesting period was reduced from a five-year period to a three-year period for the May 2006 and future grants, in line with local market practice.
