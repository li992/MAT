By order of the Board D P Turner Company secretary 4 March 2009 53 Directors remuneration report 1.
Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 and has been approved by both the Remuneration Committee and the Board.
The committee is responsible for all matters relating to the remuneration arrangements for executive directors, and selected senior management below Board level.
Membership of the committee is limited to the non-executive directors.
The membership in 2008 was as follows: N P Buckles chairman Sir Richard Broadbent S G Batey As announced on 11 December 2008, Angie Risley will be joining the Board as a non-executive director on 9 March 2009.
Subject to her election as a director at the Annual General Meeting she will also become a member of the Remuneration Committee on 22 April 2009.
The membership will thereafter comprise three independent non-executive directors and the chairman of the Board.
During the year, the committee met on five occasions: details of the attendance at meetings appear in the corporate governance report on page 65.
Remuneration policy The objective of the Boards remuneration policy is to recruit and retain high quality directors and managers by providing competitive rewards based on the achievement of targets which are aligned to the companys strategic goals and with returns to shareholders.
In reaching its decisions, the committee has regard to levels and structures of remuneration among a peer pay comparator group which it has established and continues to maintain with independent advice comprising a selection of FTSE 250 companies from the transport and other sectors of a similar size and complexity to that of the company.
The committee also has regard to remuneration levels and structures among a smaller group of companies representing its direct competitors in the transport sector and, on the basis of survey data, of a broad range of industrial companies.
Performance targets selected by the committee are subject to periodic review to ensure continued congruence with the groups strategic goals.
Remuneration review During 2008, the committee conducted a full review of the remuneration arrangements introduced after the last such review in 2005.
The committee appointed Towers Perrin as independent advisers to assist in the review.
The review concluded that the remuneration arrangements introduced in 2006 were working broadly as intended with regard to structure and opportunity.
In particular, the committee decided to recommend no change to the performance targets of the LTIP which remain top quartile TSR and annual growth in EPS of RPI plus 4 - 13 per cent over three years.
Regarding the annual bonus structure, the committee decided that no change was necessary in the quantum of opportunity 100 per cent of salary of which 30 per cent relates to personal objectives and 70 per cent to a defined financial target but that in respect of 2009 the financial target would be specified 50 per cent in relation to EBIT and 20 per cent in relation to EPS.
Independent analysis of published data during the review revealed that a material gap has opened up between executive directors salaries at Arriva and at companies in its peer groups whether narrowly or broadly defined.
This gap is currently in the range 10 - 15 per cent, reflecting the restraint shown in recent years during which executive salaries have increased by 3 - 4 per cent per annum.
On the basis of the extensive analysis conducted, the committee concluded that fair and competitive salaries for the individuals concerned would be, respectively, 535,000 for David Martin an increase of 11.4 per cent, 360,000 for Steve Lonsdale an increase of 15.4 per cent and 305,000 for Steve Clayton an increase of 8.9 per cent.
54 | Driving on Arriva plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 The Remuneration Committee has considered very carefully what to do in this situation.
It is aware that the external environment, and the reputation of the company, must be fully taken into account in its decisions.
It is also aware of its responsibilities to the individuals concerned, and to the interests of the company in ensuring that management at the most senior level are properly motivated and their services retained for the benefit of the company.
It has discussed the situation with the executive directors themselves and it has conducted extensive consultations with major shareholders.
The committee is clear that it is not in the interests of the company to continue indefinitely paying salaries to its senior executives that are well below the median of its competitors and its peer group.
It intends therefore as a matter of policy to seek to close the gap that has developed as quickly as possible.
The committee also recognises that in doing so it must take full account of the external environment it is operating in.
In reaching its decisions, it has also paid careful regard to the views expressed by shareholders and shareholder representative bodies that it has consulted.
In all the circumstances, the committee has concluded that basic salaries will be increased as follows: Salary at 1 January 2009 Increase 000 pa D R Martin 3% 494 S J Clayton 3% 288 S P Lonsdale 5% 328 These increases are materially less than those required to deal with the shortfall in executive salaries described above and the committee will continue to give close attention to executive salaries in the coming years.
Remuneration structure a Base salary Each of the executive directors is paid a basic annual salary which is reviewed in January each year.
The salaries of the executive directors were increased effective from 1 January 2009, as detailed in section 3 above.
b Performance related bonus Each of the executive directors has the opportunity to earn an annual bonus of up to 100 per cent of basic annual salary of which 70 per cent of the potential award is determined by group financial performance, with the balance being determined by the performance of each director against qualitative objectives agreed at the beginning of the year.
With regard to the group financial performance element, the target is group earnings per share before goodwill impairment and intangible asset amortisation calculated in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and adjusted for exceptional items.
The committee reviews annually the EPS target to ensure that it remains appropriate in the context of the groups strategy and the delivery of sustained shareholder value.
For 2008 the EPS element of the bonus arrangement was structured as follows: Bonus as a EPS target p per cent of basic salary Less than 55.9 Nil 59.7 25 61.4 50 64.4 70 55 Directors remuneration report continued The qualitative element of directors bonus arrangements focuses on delivery of specific elements of strategy, environmental issues, organisational and management goals and the development of a high calibre management team.
The Remuneration Committee will consider also the opportunities for incorporating social and governance targets within future performance related pay structures.
As a consequence of the EPS performance of the group for the year ended 31 December 2008 of 61.5 pence and the performance of each director against the qualitative targets agreed at the beginning of the year, bonus payments were made to each executive director in March 2009 as follows: Bonus for year ended 31 December 2008 2007 D R Martin 375,360 425,000 S J Clayton 209,200 243,900 S P Lonsdale 239,300 265,700 823,860 934,600 The non-executive directors do not participate in the performance related bonus scheme and no change to this policy is envisaged.
c Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP is a share-based plan and comprises a conditional award of shares of a value equivalent to 200 per cent of the executive directors basic salary as at the date of an award: awards are normally made each March following the announcement of the groups preliminary results for the preceding financial year.
Since 2006, awards have comprised a blend of two elements with each element providing the opportunity for each executive director to earn up to one half of the conditional share award.
Each element operates as follows: i Total Shareholder Return element TSR This element provides the opportunity to earn up to one half of the initial conditional award and is based on the groups TSR performance when ranked against the TSR performance of those companies comprising a peer comparator group.
For this purpose the peer comparator group consists of companies excluding the company and investment companies whose shares comprise the FTSE 250 at the beginning of each three-year measurement period.
Performance is measured over three consecutive financial years 1 January 31 December, the first year of the measurement period being the year in which the conditional share award is made.
In order for shares to vest under this element, the TSR performance of the group must achieve, as a minimum, the median TSR performance of the peer comparator group: achievement of the median position will generate the vesting of 25 per cent of this element of the award, and this will increase on a linear basis to 100 per cent of this element on the achievement of upper quartile performance.
The TSR performance is independently calculated and verified by Alithos Limited.
ii The EPS element This element also provides the opportunity to earn up to one half of the initial conditional award: vesting of the shares is on a linear scale with 10 per cent vesting if EPS increases to a level which is four per cent per annum in excess of the increase in the Retail Prices Index over the three-year measurement period: vesting will increase on a linear scale to a maximum of 100 per cent of this element on EPS performance achieving or exceeding 13 per cent per annum in excess of the growth in the Retail Prices Index.
The company operates share retention guidelines which require each executive director to retain 50 per cent of any vested shares until such time as a holding equivalent in value to basic annual salary has been achieved.
The non-executive directors do not participate in the LTIP, and no change to this policy is envisaged.
56 | Driving on Arriva plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 The vesting of the shares conditionally awarded in 2006 had as the performance measurement period the three years ended 31 December 2008.
The TSR over the period was in the upper quartile and therefore 100 per cent of this element of the award vests.
The EPS performance target required to achieve 100 per cent vesting of this element of the award was 70.4 pence.
The actual EPS performance was 61.5 pence and, as a consequence 49 per cent of this element of the award vests.
The Remuneration Committee confirmed the vesting position on 4 March 2009.
Changes in the interests of the executive directors in conditional share awards made under the LTIP in the year ended 31 December 2008 were as follows: Movement in conditionally awarded shares audited information Balance Not at Awards subsisting at vested 31 Dec 1 January 2008 Awarded during year Vested during year in year 2008 Share Share price at price at Value of date of date of shares at No.
The non-executive directors do not participate and have not participated in any of the companys share option schemes.
Benefits in kind for each director comprise a company car and or car allowance, fuel, medical insurance and telephone costs.
A pension of 5,000 2007: 5,000 was paid to a former director.
The fees paid to the non-executive directors are as follows and comprise a basic fee and an additional fee to recognise specific further responsibilities.

Under the terms of the Articles of Association the fees payable to the non-executive directors are limited to 400,000 per annum in the aggregate: this level was established following approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 23 April 2004, and the Articles permit the directors to increase this cap annually in line with the increase in the index of UK wage inflation.
58 | Driving on Arriva plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 As at 31 December 2008, in accordance with the indexation provisions, the cap on the aggregate level of non-executive directors fees was 470,504.
Each non-executive director has been appointed for a fixed-term not exceeding three years and, following the implementation of the Companies Act 2006, those appointments are normally renewable, with the agreement of both parties, for terms not exceeding two years.
