Mr Morris was subject to the Scheme specic earnings cap and therefore as an employee of the Company he received an additional non-pensionable payment during the year.
The market price of the ordinary shares at 30 April 2008 was 130.5p and the range during the year was 128.5p to 255.25p.
Aggregate gains made by Directors on exercise of share options in the year were nil 2006 07: nil.
All options will be exercisable from the dates stated above, subject to them satisfying the performance target.
For these share options to become exercisable the growth in the Companys normalised EPS must match or exceed the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index plus an average of 3% per annum.
Share options granted in 2002 and 2003 can be retested, from a xed base, until the sixth anniversary of grant.
Options granted from 2004 onwards have no retest facility.
During the transition to IFRS, the Committee ensures that a consistent basis is used to measure earnings per share performance.
Based on EPS performance to 30 April 2008 the options granted in 2002, 2003 and 2005 have become exercisable.
For this purpose, the EPS growth is based on adjusted EPS as disclosed in the Annual Report, except that the Committee may adjust this gure in exceptional circumstances where this is appropriate.
The verication of the calculation of EPS growth has been performed by Hewitt New Bridge Street, in their capacity as advisers to the Committee.
As noted above, the performance condition attached to Mr Morris share options granted in 2002, 2003 and 2005 was met over the performance period to 30 April 2008.
Accordingly these options will be exercisable in full for a period of six months from 26 June 2008 the day after which the auditors issue their report for the year ended 30 April 2008.
Performance in relation to the options granted in 2006 and 2007 was tested for the period to 30 April 2008, the date on which he ceased employment.
The performance condition attached to these options was met in full.
Therefore, subject to a time pro rata reduction to reect the unexpired portion of the performance period at cessation one-third reduction for 2006 and two-thirds reduction for 2007, these options will be exercisable for six months from 26 June 2008. o Directors interests under the Restricted Share Plan auditable The Restricted Share Plan ceased to be operated with effect from the financial year 2004 05.

If the Companys TSR is ranked at the upper quartile of the group or higher, the full award will vest reducing on a straight-line basis to 30% of the award vesting for median performance.
None of the award vests for below median performance.
TSR performance is measured over a single period of three financial years starting with the year in which the award is made.
In addition to the TSR condition, no awards will vest, irrespective of TSR performance, unless the Companys EPS growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index over the three-year period.
For this purpose, following the introduction of IFRS, the EPS growth will be based on adjusted EPS as disclosed in the Annual Report, except that the Committee may adjust this gure in exceptional circumstances where this is appropriate.
The calculation of TSR performance is performed by Hewitt New Bridge Street, in their capacity as advisers to the Committee.
The performance period attached to Mr Morris outstanding unvested LTIP awards ended on 30 April 2008.
The performance conditions in respect of the 2005 and 2007 awards were not met.
Accordingly these awards will lapse.
The TSR performance condition in respect of the 2006 awards was partially satisfied and the EPS test was met.
Therefore 42.7% of this award may vest, subject to a time pro-rata reduction to reect the unexpired portion of the performance period at the date of cessation.
Accordingly, 38,336 shares will be released after 26 June 2008 representing 67% of the shares vesting after applying the performance condition, with the remainder of the award lapsing.
