5 To fulfil promises made to Richard Pennycook at the time of his recruitment, as reported in last years Remuneration Report, the annual bonus award made to him for 2006 07 included, in addition to the cash element, a deferred share award as a result of no LTIP being adopted by shareholders in the 2006 07 financial year.
That award was in shares of the Group with a value equal to 950,400 two times the amount of the cash bonus earned for the 2006 07 financial year with the number of shares calculated by reference to the average share price over the five dealing days prior to the deemed date of the award 1 April 2007 which was 307.5p.
The deferred share award will normally vest on 1 April 2009, provided Richard Pennycook is then still an employee of the Group.
Upon vesting, a payment will also be made in cash or shares, as determined by the Remuneration Committee, equivalent to the dividends which would have been payable on the shares over the two year deferral period or such shorter period if awards vest earlier.
2 Options outstanding on ceasing to be a Director.
The 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme terminated at the end of its 10-year life on 25 May 2005 and no grants have been made under it since November 2004.
The ordinary share mid-market price ranged from 246.75p to 335.25p and averaged 300.33p during the period.
The price on 3 February 2008 was 299.00p compared to 300.75p on 4 February 2007.
The performance condition attached to options under the Executive Share Option Scheme which has been satisfied is as follows: The operating profit of the Group, as detailed in the audited report and financial statements, must increase by at least 20% between the base year and its third or succeeding anniversary.
Once an option is exercisable it will remain so until it lapses in accordance with the rules of the Scheme even if on a future anniversary the operating profit does not exceed the base year by 20%.
Additional information Company financial Consolidated financial Governance Financial review Operating review Chief Executives Chairmans statement statements statements and risks business review 46 Morrisons annual report and financial statements 2008 Directors remuneration report continued Dilution and share usage Awards under the Groups share option and SAYE schemes are satisfied by the issue of new shares within the limits agreed by shareholders when the plans were approved.
These limits comply with the Association of British Insurers guidelines restricting dilution from employee share plans.
The overall limits under the guidelines are that no more than 10% of a Groups issued share capital may be used in any 10-year period.
Up to 5% may be used for executive share plans.
As at 3 February 2008, the Groups share usage against these limits was 4.3% and 1.5% respectively.
It is currently intended that LTIP awards be satisfied by market purchased shares which are held in an Employee Benefit Trust.
