36 Report on directors remuneration Report on directors remuneration The report on directors remuneration contains the disclosures required by Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 and has been prepared in accordance with the Combined Code and to meet the relevant requirements of the listing rules of the Financial Services Authority.
The tables and accompanying notes on pages 3940 have been subject to audit.
Remuneration committee The remuneration committee the committee comprises three independent non-executive directors and the Chairman of the company.
No director plays a part in any discussion about his own remuneration.
The committee members during 2008 consisted of: Per Utnegaard Chairman, Christopher Kemball, Philip Rogerson and Ren Schuster.
The committees membership remains consistent with Combined Code provisions.
The Chief Executive is invited to attend meetings but may not take part in any discussion on matters concerning himself.
During the year, New Bridge Street Consultants LLP renamed Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS a trading name of Hewitt Associates Limited with effect from March 2008 was retained as adviser to the committee.
HNBS provided no other services to the company although Hewitt Associates Limited does provide advice to the trustees of the Davis Service Group Retirement Benefit Scheme.
The terms of reference of the committee are regularly reviewed and approved by the board.
The committees role includes determining the companys policy on senior executive remuneration, considering and approving the individual salaries and other terms of the remuneration packages for the executive directors and the Chairman, monitoring remuneration of other senior executives, and setting an overall framework for share schemes throughout the company.
The terms of reference are available on the companys website www.
co. uk or upon request from the Company Secretary.
Remuneration policy The committees policy is: to provide appropriate levels of remuneration to its senior executives, taking into account their experience, the size and complexity of their jobs, relevant market comparative data and any material special factors which may arise from time to time: to provide a competitive mix of base salary and short and long-term incentives with a significant proportion of the package at least half at a target level of performance related to the variable pay elements: and to ensure that variable pay is determined by relevant and stretching measures of performance that are consistent with the ongoing strategic objectives of the company so as to appropriately align directors interests with those of shareholders.
The existing remuneration arrangement for senior executives, including the executive directors, has been recently reviewed by the committee to ensure that it is in accordance with the remuneration policy.
As part of this review, HNBS provided to the company market data for a group of companies of broadly similar turnover, market capitalisation and international exposure.
Two key conclusions arising from this review were that: i the value of the existing remuneration package of senior management is below market levels, particularly in relation to variable pay potential.
The committee is keen to retain what it views as a highly marketable executive team which remains central to the future prospects of the company.
Accordingly, the committee seeks to ensure that packages are suitably competitive to retain these executives.
The committee intends to achieve this aim by enhancing the variable pay potential of senior executives with the enhanced potential linked to the achievement of challenging performance targets.
Specifically the annual bonus potential for executive directors will increase in 2009 from 75% of salary to 100% of salary and, subject to shareholder approval, a new Co-Investment Plan will be introduced to encourage senior executives to invest in company shares.
ii the existing performance measure for awards under the Davis Service Group Performance Share Plan 2006 PSP, based on relative Total Shareholder Return TSR, is felt by the committee to be providing an insufficient link between management performance, the achievement of key strategic objectives and the extent of awards that actually vest.
The committee, therefore, intends to use different performance measures for PSP awards granted in 2009, based on a mixture of adjusted Earnings per Share EPS and post-tax Return on Invested Capital ROIC targets.
Both of these financial measures are key performance indicators for the group.
Further details on these changes are outlined in the sections below.
The committee will continue to keep the appropriateness of this revised remuneration structure under periodic review.
Salaries Salaries for executive directors were reviewed and the following annual salaries, considered by the committee to be appropriate given market data and the experience and performance of the individuals, were made effective from 1st January 2009: Roger Dye 475,000 2008: 460,000 and Kevin Quinn 288,000 2008: 277,000.
Benefits Roger Dye has a personal pension arrangement to which the company makes payments equivalent to 30% of salary.
Kevin Quinn has a personal pension arrangement to which the company makes payments equivalent to 20% of salary.
Life assurance cover of four times salary and permanent health insurance of up to 75% of salary are also provided.
37 Short-term performance bonuses The maximum annual bonus for 2009 will be 100% of base salary for executive directors 2008: 75% of salary.
A quarter of any bonus earned must be invested in company shares via the Davis Service Group Deferred Bonus Share Plan 2006 for three years and will normally be forfeited if the executive leaves during that period.
The whole of the bonus for executive directors in 2009 will be determined by demanding targets relating to EPS, post-tax ROIC and the generation of free cash flow.
Long-term incentives Performance Share Plan PSP Senior executives, including the executive directors, receive annual awards of performance shares under the PSP.
The committee has the ability to grant performance share awards worth up to 100% of base salary each year with a 200% limit in exceptional circumstances such as in the case of recruitment or where there are acute retention needs.
The committee intends to limit individual awards to executive directors in 2009 to no more than 100% of salary.
As outlined above, awards granted under the PSP in 2009 will be subject to a mixture of EPS and post-tax ROIC performance targets with the following vesting schedules: EPS performance target 2011 Post-tax ROIC performance average over 2009-2011 Financial Years Less than 43p 0% of award vests Less than 7% 0% of award vests 43p 12.5% of award vests 7% 12.5% of award vests 47p 50% of award vests 10% 50% of award vests Straight-line vesting for intermediate performance Straight-line vesting for intermediate performance The committee regards these targets as challenging in the current economic environment and highly stretching at the top end of the target range.
For awards granted in 2010 to senior executives of certain business divisions excluding executive directors of the company, different or a combination of performance measures, such as operating profit of a business division, might be set in relation to the grant of those awards.
The committee will ensure that any different performance measures are deemed to be as relevant and challenging as the performance measures and targets outlined above.
To the extent that their awards vest, award holders will be entitled, at that time, to receive a payment in shares of an amount equivalent to the dividends that would have been paid on the shares subject to that award between the time when they were granted and when they vested.
The committee is keen for executive directors and other senior employees to hold shares in the group.
In support of this policy, all executives and senior employees who receive a grant of awards under the PSP are required to work towards holding shares with a value equivalent to 100% of their basic annual salary.
To achieve this they are not permitted to sell any vested shares under the PSP, Deferred Bonus Share Plan and, if approved by shareholders, the Co-Investment Plan other than to satisfy tax liabilities until these guidelines are satisfied.
Co-Investment Plan Shareholder approval will be sought at the Annual General Meeting on 28th April 2009 for the proposed new Co-Investment Plan.
Full details of the proposed Plan are outlined in the Notice of AGM.
In summary, the key terms of the Plan are as follows: Each year from March 2010, selected executives would be able to purchase Investment Shares worth up to 35% of their salary.
For relevant executives including executive directors Investment Shares would include any compulsorily deferred bonus shares that have been granted in respect of the previous years performance.
Executives would alternatively be allowed to commit shares again worth up to a total maximum of 35% of salary out of their existing shareholdings, unless such shares are unable to be sold by the executive as required by the shareholding guidelines outlined above.
Individuals would receive an award of Matching Shares at a ratio up to a maximum 2:1 relative to their Invested Shares on the following basis: a basic award of Matching Shares at a ratio of 1:2 to their Invested Shares.
Vesting of this basic award would not be subject to performance but would generally require the executive to remain in employment and to retain the related Investment Shares until the third anniversary of award.
The committee felt that this relatively modest basic award would be appropriate to encourage executives to invest in company shares and participate in the Plan.
a performance-linked award of Matching Shares at a ratio of up to 3:2.
Vesting of this performance-linked award would be subject to the same EPS and post-tax ROIC performance conditions that will apply to future PSP awards as outlined above and would also generally require the executive to remain in employment and to retain the related Investment Shares until the third anniversary of award.
To the extent that their Matching Shares vest, award holders will be entitled, at that time, to receive a payment in shares of an amount equivalent to the dividends that would have been paid on the shares subject to that award between the time when they were granted and when they vested.
38 Report on directors remuneration continued Other Share Plans Less senior executives are eligible to receive conditional share awards subject to relevant, stretching three-year performance targets under an Executive Incentive Plan.
The first grant was made on 6th March 2008 with a further grant to be made in April 2009.
All UK employees, including executive directors, are eligible to participate in the companys sharesave plan.
Share Usage During 2008, 1,155,437 shares, 0.67% of the issued share capital, were granted to employees under the Performance Share Plan 2006, the Deferred Bonus Share Plan 2006, the Davis Service Group Sharesave Plan 2006 and the Davis Service Group Executive Incentive Plan 2008.
The award under the Sharesave Plan will be met by the issue of new shares at the date of vesting: the other awards will be met by the re-issue of shares held in treasury or by the purchase of existing shares in the market by the Employee Benefit Trust.
At 31st December 2008 the Employee Benefit Trust held 441,873 shares that had been purchased in the market.
The number of shares issued under the share plans is within the relevant dilution guidelines established by the Association of British Insurers of 10% of share capital in a ten year period for all share plans and 5% in a ten year period for executive plans.
The companys year end position against these limits is 6.5% for all share plans and 2.7% for executive plans.
Awards which are required to be satisfied by market purchased shares are excluded from this calculation.
Directors service agreements Both executive directors have service agreements dated 21st April 2005 and 16th May 2005 for Roger Dye and Kevin Quinn respectively which are terminable on one years notice by either party.
Upon termination, the director receives salary, target bonus, benefits and pension contribution in respect of the outstanding notice period.
Other than following a change of control, this amount is subject to mitigation if the director obtains alternative employment, which there is an obligation to seek.
Under their service agreements, executive directors are allowed subject to board approval to hold one non-executive post and retain the fee received from any such post.
Roger Dye is a non-executive director of Nestor Healthcare plc and received an annual fee of 35,000 2007: 35,000 for that role.
Chairman and non-executive directors The Chairmans annual fee is set by the committee and is currently 115,000 2008: 110,000.
The non-executive directors receive annual fees at a level approved by the entire board, currently set at 40,000 2008: 40,000 and an additional 10,000 2008: 5,000 if they chair a committee.
They are able to claim reimbursement of actual expenditure incurred in carrying out their duties.
There is no entitlement to participate in the companys pension scheme, bonus scheme or share schemes and no compensation is payable for early termination of their contracts or terms of office.
The Chairman has been appointed for a fixed term of three years to April 2011, terminable at three months notice by either party.
The terms of office of non-executive directors are for periods not exceeding three years which can be terminated by either party giving one months notice.
These terms of office are subject to shareholders approval when non-executive directors seek re-election at annual general meetings.
Total shareholder return TSR The committee believes that, due to the size of the company, the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding Investment Trusts is the most suitable index against which to compare the historic TSR of the company.
The chart below shows the TSR of the company compared with the index over the five-year period to 31st December 2008.
