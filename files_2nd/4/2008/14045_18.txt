qxd:Serco AR08 - Design 19 03 2009 16:30 Page 68 Share ownership policy In light of the proposed changes to the Executive Directors remuneration, the share ownership requirement for the Chief Executive has been increased from one to two times base salary.
The requirement for the Finance Director remains one times base salary.
Executive Directors will be required to retain in shares 50% of the net value of any performance shares or options exercised until they have satisfied the shareholding requirement.
At the end of the year, by reference to the share price at that date 450.50p, Executive Directors share ownership levels were as follows: Ordinary shareholding at Ordinary shareholding 31 December 2008 as a % of salary Chief Executive 166,440 116% Finance Director 104,874 124% Pensions, life assurance and other benefits Serco operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The Executive Directors participate in the Serco Pension and Life Assurance Scheme SPLAS.
This is a funded, defined benefit scheme, which provides for a target pension of two-thirds of pensionable salary following a full career.
Members contribute to the scheme at rates varying according to the section of the scheme.
Christopher Hyman and Andrew Jenner contributed to the scheme at a rate of 9.5% of pensionable salary in 2008.
From 1 January 2007 Serco also introduced SMART whereby all members were given the option to have their pension contributions paid by salary sacrifice.
Under this arrangement the member makes no normal pension contributions, Serco makes additional contributions to SPLAS equal to those that the member would otherwise have made and the members contractual pay is reduced by the amount of these contributions.
Both Christopher Hyman and Andrew Jenner opted to have their contributions paid by SMART.
Kevin Beestons pension benefits accrued prior to 6 April 2006 exceeded the new Lifetime Allowance, which came into force at that date, and he opted to cease paying contributions and accruing benefits in the pension scheme after 6 April 2006.
Kevin Beeston remains entitled to lump sum and widows pension benefits should he die before retirement and while still employed by or an officer of Serco.
The Chairman and Executive Directors receive a range of other benefits which include a car, private medical insurance, permanent health insurance, life cover, an annual allowance for independent financial advice and voluntary health checks every two years.
The Executive Directors are also entitled to 25 days holiday per year.
qxd:Serco AR08 - Design 19 03 2009 16:30 Page 69 Service contracts and compensation Each Executive Director has a rolling service contract and these contracts will be available for inspection prior to the start of and after the Companys Annual General Meeting.
The service contracts have a notice period of 12 months.
Under the service contracts for the Executive Directors, the Company reserves the right to make a payment in lieu of notice.
In addition, where a Director leaves the Company following a change of control, whether or not he is dismissed or he elects to leave on notice, he will be entitled to receive a payment equivalent of up to one years remuneration.
The service contracts do not provide for termination payments to be made in any other circumstances.
Service contracts have been reviewed and are being amended with the agreement of the Executive Directors, to ensure they appropriately reflect best practice.
There have been no payments made during the year in relation to compensation for loss of office.
A summary of details relating to each Director who served during the year is provided below: Date of Unexpired term at Name of Date joined Appointment Date of 31 December Director Company to the Board Contract 2008 Christopher Hyman 30 August 1994 1 April 1999 21 July 2003 Rolling contract of 12 months notice period Andrew Jenner 4 November 1996 3 May 2002 21 July 2003 Rolling contract of 12 months notice period 1 Grant Rumbles 3 July 1982 3 July 2007 3 July 2007 N A 1 Grant Rumbles ceased being a Director with effect from 25 March 2008 and subsequently left Serco employment on 16 May 2008.
His termination payment was in accordance with his contractual entitlement and is reported on page 71.
External appointments The Board believes that the Group can benefit from its Executive Directors holding appropriate non-executive directorships of companies or independent bodies.
Such appointments are subject to the approval of the Board.
Fees are retained by the Executive Director concerned.
Christopher Hyman was a non-executive director in United Business Media plc until his resignation in May 2008.
Fees payable in the year were 20,308.
Andrew Jenner was appointed non-executive director of GallifordTry plc on 1 January 2009.
No other fee-paying external positions were held by any of the Executive Directors.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors The Groups policy is that the fees of the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors, which are determined by the Board, are set at a level which will attract individuals with the necessary experience and ability to make a substantial contribution to the Groups affairs.
Non-Executive Directors of the Group are initially appointed for a three-year term, and that appointment may be terminated on three months written notice.
The renewal of appointments is not automatic, and Non-Executive Directors are required to retire and stand for re-election in accordance with the Companys Articles of Association, and the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
As at 31 December 2008, the Non-Executive Directors of the Group had no personal financial interest in the matters determined by the Board, there are no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no involvement in the day-to-day running of the Group.
The Non-Executive Directors do not participate in the Groups incentive or pension schemes, or receive other benefits except as described.
qxd:Serco AR08 - Design 20 03 2009 16:54 Page 70 Current Fee Structure Non-Executive Directors remuneration consists of cash fees paid monthly with increments for positions of additional responsibility.
In addition, reasonable travel and related business expenses are paid.
No bonuses are paid to Non-Executive Directors.
The Board believe that payment of fees on a cash-only basis remains appropriate as opposed to the partial payment of fees in shares.
Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to hold shares in the Group but are not subject to a shareholding requirement.
Non-Executive Directors fees are not performance related.
The fees and terms of engagement of Non-Executive Directors are reviewed on an annual basis, taking into consideration market practice and approved by the Board.
The standard annual fees payable for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors during the financial year under review are shown in the table below.
The Chairmans fee was increased with effect from 1 September 2008 in light of his current responsibilities, the time commitment to Serco and competitive market practice.

The DBS has now been closed and no further awards will be made under its terms.
The awards shown in the table are the maximum number of shares that can vest under the performance conditions.
The performance condition for matching shares is TSR relative to the companies comprising the FTSE 350 and is measured over the three year deferral period.
On 31 December 2008 the performance conditions attached to the awards made on 22 March 2006 were satisfied though the awards may not be exercised until 22 March 2009.
TSR performance relative to the comparator group was in the upper quartile 93rd percentile.
Awards take the form of nominal cost options.
Awards made are calculated at 100% of salary at the time of grant.
The TSR performance condition is measured relative to the top 250 companies in the FTSE, as ranked by market capitalisation, excluding those in certain sectors which are not comparable with the Group.
No awards were granted, lapsed or exercised during the period.
All awards held by Grant Rumbles, with the exception of that made on 12 November 2007, were granted prior to him being appointed Executive Director.

The TSR level shown at 31 December each year is the average of the closing daily TSR levels for the 30-day period up to and including that date.
The Companys TSR is compared to that of the FTSE 350 Index, which is a broad equity market index of which it is a constituent.
As detailed earlier, TSR is defined as the return shareholders would receive if they held a notional number of shares, and received dividends on those shares over a period of time.
It measures the percentage growth in the Companys share price together with the value of any dividends paid, assuming that the dividends are reinvested into the Companys shares.

The Directors receive pension and life assurance benefits consistent with those provided by other leading companies.
The details of the defined benefit schemes operated by the Group are set out in the note on page 118.
In the event of death in service, the Serco Supplementary Death Benefit Scheme provides for a lump sum payment.
The accrued pension benefits of all Directors under the Serco Pension and Life Assurance Scheme, which is a defined benefit scheme, are as follows: Increase Gross Increase in Transfer value Transfer value in transfer increase accrued Value of of accrued of accrued Directors value in accrued pension increase in Total benefits at benefits at contributions during pension during the accrual accrued 31 December 31 December for the the year during year, net of over the pension at 2008 2007 year 4 the year inflation year year end 1 2 3 1 - 2 - 3 5 6 7 8 Kevin Beeston 3,591,340 2,921,990 - 669,350 6,580, 00-, 00- 278,686 Christopher Hyman 1,275,901 776,483 - 499,418 21,150 19,686 307,455 81,694 Andrew Jenner 628,494 363,309 - 265,185 12,773 11,989 166,652 45,213 Grant Rumbles 2,720,190 2,164,769 - 555,421 6,949 3,566 66,071 146,833 Notes: a The total accrued pension shown is that which would be paid annually on retirement, based on pensionable service to the end of this year, or for Kevin Beeston and Grant Rumbles, to 5 April 2006 when they opted out of the scheme.
The increase in accrued pension during the year is shown both as a gross increase and excluding any increase in respect of inflation.
b The pension which Kevin Beeston had accrued up to 5 April 2006 is increased in line with his pensionable remuneration averaged over three years since 5 April 2006.
The increase in his accrued pension over the year to 31 December 2008 is entirely due to inflation.
c Grant Rumbles ceased being a Director with effect from 25 March 2008 and subsequently left Serco employment on 16 May 2008.
The pensions note covers accrual over the period to leaving employment.
The pension which Grant Rumbles had accrued up to 5 April 2006 was increased in line with his pensionable remuneration averaged over three years from 5 April 2006 to 16 May 2008 when he left service.
d The increase in the accrued pensions of Christopher Hyman and Andrew Jenner allow for both the increase in their pensionable salaries over the year and for the accrual of a further years pensionable service as a result of a further years active membership of the Scheme.
e Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the amended transfer value regulations which apply after 1 October 2008.
The assumptions to be used for calculating transfer values after this date were agreed by the Trustees and the methodology for setting these assumptions has remained the same as for last years calculations.
The difference between the transfer values at the beginning and end of the year, shown in 4, includes not only the effect of the increase in accrual and salaries, but also the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and the Directors, such as stock market movements.
f The value of the net increase in accrual represents the incremental value to the Director of his service during the year, calculated on the assumption that his service terminated at the year end, or 5 April 2006 in the case of Kevin Beeston and Grant Rumbles.
It is based on the increase in the accrued pension net of inflation.
g Transfer values disclosed do not represent the sum paid or payable to the individual Director.
Instead, they represent a potential liability of the pension scheme.
h All Directors who are currently active members of the Scheme have opted to have their contributions paid by the Company under a salary sacrifice arrangement and hence no contributions were paid by the Directors during the year.
