The underpin is that If TSR exceeds the median of the comparator group, 33% of the LTIP units LTIP units will only vest if the Remuneration Committee is satisfied with the are released: underlying financial performance of the Group.

Firstly, no awards vest unless the total shareholder return of the Group over the three-year testing period re-testing is not permitted is positive.
