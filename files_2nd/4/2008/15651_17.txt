Funding of share plans It is the Companys current intention to satisfy the requirements of its share schemes by acquiring shares in the market.
The Committee has agreed that it is prudent and appropriate to hedge the shares awarded under the PSP.
As at 30 September 2008, 5,049,796 shares were held in the Thomas Cook Group plc 2007 Employee Benefit Trust, which represents 66% of share incentive awards held on that date.
The level of hedging will be kept under review.
Under the rules of the Plans, awards cannot be made if awards under any other discretionary employee share scheme operated by Thomas Cook Group plc in the preceding ten-year period would exceed 5% of the Companys issued share capital at that time.
The Trustee would not normally vote at general meetings on the Thomas Cook Group plc shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust.
com DIRECTORS REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Service contracts Each of the Executive Directors has a service contract with the Company.

The Committee believes that this is appropriate given the need to retain the specialist skills that the Executive Directors bring to the business and to achieve continuity in the Companys senior management.
Either the Executive Director or the Company may terminate employment by giving one years written notice and the Company may pay compensation in lieu of notice.
There is no clause in the Executive Directors contracts providing them with additional protection in the form of compensation for severance as a result of change of control.
External appointments The Company recognises the benefits to the individual, and to the Group, of Executive Directors taking on external appointments as non-executive directors.
Subject to the approval of the Committee and to such conditions as the Committee may, in its discretion, attach, an Executive Director may accept such appointments at other companies or similar advisory or consultative roles.
The Committee has set a limit of one external appointment for each Executive Director, to a FTSE 100 or FTSE 250 company, or an international company of a similar size, unless there is justification for a further appointment.
During the part of the Financial Period for which he was an Executive Director of the Company, Ludger Heuberg received a fee of 3,000 from Commerzbank AG in respect of his membership of their Regional Advisory Committee.
On 23 April 2008, Manny Fontenla-Novoa was appointed as a member of the Arcandor AG Management Board: he does not receive a fee for this appointment.
Non-Executive Directors The fees for the Chairman and Deputy Chairman are determined by a committee of independent Non-Executive Directors excluding the Deputy Chairman.
The fees for the other Non-Executive Directors are set by the Board excluding these Non-Executive Directors.
Non-Executive Directors fees are reviewed every two years.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any bonus plans, are not eligible to participate in any long-term incentive plans and no pension contributions are made on their behalf.
The annual rates of Non-Executive Director fees, which have not changed since the merger of MyTravel Group plc and Thomas Cook AG in June 2007, are shown in the table below.
