Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008 49 Remuneration Committee report Introduction This Remuneration report has been prepared on behalf of the Board by the Remuneration Committee.
In all its activities, the Remuneration Committee has adopted the principles of good governance as set out in the Combined Code and complies with the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, the relevant schedules of the Companies Act and the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations, 2002.
These Regulations require the Companys auditors to report on the Audited information in the report to state that this section has been properly prepared in accordance with the Regulations.
For this reason the report is divided into audited and unaudited information.
The Remuneration report is subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting on 28 April 2009.
Part 1 Unaudited information Remuneration Committee During the year, the Committee comprised Tim Barker as Chairman, Jamie Dundas, Mike Grasby and David Lindsell appointed 1 December 2008, all of whom are independent non-executive directors.
Charles Berry, Chairman of the Company is also a member of the Committee.
The biographical notes of the members of the Committee are set out on pages 36 and 37.
The Committee met on seven occasions during the year and its members attendance record is set out on page 44.
Advice to the Remuneration Committee The Company Secretary, Philip Hudson, has attended meetings as Secretary to the Committee and, having taken over responsibility for Human Resources during the year, provided assistance to the Committee.
Kepler Associates LLP Kepler, appointed by the Committee, have provided advice to the Committee on market practice, incentive plans and other remuneration-related topics.
Kepler also advised the Board on the remuneration of non-executive directors.
Kepler provided no other services to the Company during the year.
The Committee also received legal advice and other legal services from Norton Rose LLP who were appointed by the Board to act as principal legal advisers to the Group.
The Chief Executive is invited to attend meetings of the Remuneration Committee except when her own remuneration is being discussed.
Principal responsibilities The Committees principal responsibilities are: recommending to the Board the remuneration strategy and framework for the executive directors and senior managers: determining, within that framework, the individual remuneration packages for the executive directors and senior managers: approval of the design of annual and long-term incentive arrangements for executive directors and senior managers, including agreeing the annual targets and payments under such arrangements: determining and agreeing the general terms and conditions of service and the specific terms for any individual within the Committees remit, either on recruitment or on termination: determining the policy for, and scope of, executive pension arrangements: and to oversee any major changes in employee benefit structures throughout the Group and review remuneration trends across the Group.
The terms of reference for the Committee are reviewed annually by the Committee and then by the Board.
A copy of the terms of reference is available on the Groups website at www.
Drax Group plc 50 Annual report and accounts 2008 Remuneration Committee report Remuneration policy The remuneration policy applicable to executive directors and senior managers whose remuneration is determined by the Committee is to: link a significant proportion of remuneration to performance: manage salaries and benefits around market levels, taking into account both industry and cross-industry benchmarks: award annual cash bonuses which are linked to the delivery of the annual business plan targets and personal performance: and provide staff with long-term incentives linked to total shareholder returns.
When applying this policy to senior managers below director level, the Committee selects salary and benefit benchmarks appropriate to individual specialisms.
The objectives of the remuneration policy are to: motivate executive directors and staff to help ensure that Drax meets challenging performance goals: enable Drax to recruit and retain the expertise needed to manage and develop its business: strengthen teamwork at all levels: and ensure alignment of executive and shareholder interests.
During the year under review the remuneration package of executive directors and senior managers comprised five components, namely: base salary: annual performance bonus a mix of cash and deferred shares : conditional share awards under the Executive Share Incentive Plan ESIP : pension and benefits: and all-employee share plans.
Variable remuneration is targeted to account for approximately 50% of the fair value of executive director remuneration.
During 2008, the Remuneration Committee, in conjunction with its independent advisers, Kepler, reviewed the Companys incentive arrangements for its executives to ensure that they are motivational and support retention, are competitive in relevant talent markets, reward growth in shareholder value and that they should not be unduly influenced by the short-term volatility of the Dark Green Spread.
As a result of the review, the Committee decided to discontinue the exceptional maximum bonus opportunity of up to 150% of salary for executive directors and increase the normal target and maximum bonus opportunities available to executive directors and senior managers whose remuneration is determined by the Committee, but with a mandatory requirement to defer 25% of annual bonus into shares in the Company which will vest in three years time subject to forfeiture if the executive is a bad leaver prior to vesting.
The revised target and maximum bonus levels for the executive directors are set out below in the section entitled Annual performance bonus.
In addition, it is proposed to replace the ESIP the Companys current long-term incentive plan in 2009 with a share-based Bonus Matching Plan BMP.
A proposed resolution for the adoption of the BMP is to be considered at the Annual General Meeting AGM of the Company to be held on 28 April 2009.
The Notice of Meeting accompanies this report and includes a description of the BMP, and the Rules of the BMP will be available for inspection at the AGM.
Under the BMP a participant would receive an annual grant of conditional shares which shall not exceed in value to 1.5 times such executives annual bonus earned for the prior year.
BMP awards will vest based on Draxs three-year Total Shareholder Return TSR versus the FTSE50-150 over a three-year period.
The BMP allows for 100% vesting for upper quartile performance, 15% vesting at median, and no vesting for below median performance.
The Committee intends to allow partial vesting up to 33% based on continued employment only for BMP awards made to participants not on the Executive Committee, to support retention and in recognition that TSR is a less meaningful performance measure for that group of participants.
In addition to the performance-related awards, directors and members of the Executive Committee will be required to defer a fixed proportion of their annual bonus currently intended to be 25% into a conditional award of shares which will vest conditional on three years continuing service.
BMP awards will first be made during 2009 based on the annual bonus earned for 2008.
As such, BMP awards will be granted to participants conditional on shareholder approval for the BMP being obtained at the AGM.
The following paragraphs provide more detail in relation to each of the five components of remuneration for executive directors.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008 51 Base salary Executive directors base salaries and benefits are reviewed each year with any changes taking effect from 1 April.
The review takes into account individual performance and market competitiveness.
Pensionable salary is derived from base salary only.
The Committee benchmarks executive director salaries against comparator groups of utilities, power generators and selected other industrial and commercial companies with comparable turnover, market value or staff numbers.
Annual performance bonus The Group operates an annual bonus scheme.
Bonuses are based on Group performance and individual performance against objectives.
The Committee sets Group performance measures based on the Groups business priorities for which the Board sets challenging performance targets.
In 2008, Group measures included financial, trading, plant operations, safety, environmental and development objectives, and a discretionary element.
In exercising its discretion the Committee has regard to managements performance in handling unforeseen events which arise during the year.
As part of its review of incentive arrangements, the Committee adjusted the target and maximum annual performance bonus opportunity for the directors and members of the Executive Committee in 2008 and introduced a requirement to defer 25% of any bonus into a conditional award of shares which will vest in three years and be forfeited if the executive leaves the Company other than as a good leaver before the shares vest.
For annual performance bonus awards in 2008, the target bonus for the Chief Executive and other executive directors is 65% and 60% of base salary respectively.
The maximum bonus is 130% and 120% respectively.
75% of any bonus award is paid in cash.
Subject to shareholder approval of the BMP being obtained at the AGM, 25% of any bonus will be subject to a deferred share award.
In 2008, achievement of Group-based performance conditions provided for a bonus of up to 125% of target bonus, which was then adjusted according to individual performance by a multiplier in the range 0.67 to 1.33.
The Committee reviewed 2008 actual performance against bonus targets and the amounts awarded and payable in cash are shown in the Directors emoluments table in Part 2 of this report.
From 2008 onwards, 25% of any bonus earned will be deferred in the Companys shares for three years, and will be forfeited if the executive leaves Drax other than as a good leaver before the shares vest.
The target and maximum bonus for 2009 for the Chief Executive and the other executive directors are the same as in 2008, and bonus measures and targets have been set using a similar process to that used previously.
Benefits The Companys policy is to offer a car allowance to executive directors and to certain senior managers, according to their role.
The annual allowance is currently 17,500 per annum for the Chief Executive, 12,000 per annum for executive directors and 9,000 per annum for senior managers whose remuneration is determined by the Committee.
In addition, life assurance in a sum assured of four times base salary is provided for the directors and senior managers and private medical insurance is provided for them and their dependants.
Relocation expenses are paid where appropriate.
Pensions Executive directors and senior managers who joined the Group after 1 January 2002 are entitled to membership of the Groups defined contribution pension plan.
The employers contribution for executive directors is 20% of base salary and for senior managers who are not members of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme ESPS it is 11.5% of base salary.
For senior managers who are members of the ESPS the normal employers contribution is 21.6% of base salary.
In each case contributions were and are capped by the different statutory limits applicable before and after 6 April 2006, although there is no director or senior manager for whom contributions would mean they exceed either the lifetime or annual allowances.
Alternatively, at their option, executive directors may either have contributions of the same amounts made to their personal pension schemes or cash in lieu of pension at the stated rate and subject to normal statutory deductions.
Details of pension contributions for executive directors and of payments in lieu are included in the emoluments table in Part 2 of this report.
Drax Power Limited, a trading subsidiary, is the Principal Employer of the Drax Power Group Section of the ESPS, an occupational pension scheme providing defined benefits on death, ill-health, early retirement or normal retirement to eligible members and beneficiaries based on the members length of pensionable service, final salary and the applicable accrual rate.
The defined benefit pension scheme was closed to new entrants in 2002.
Although certain senior managers are members, none of the executive directors are eligible for membership.
Drax Group plc 52 Annual report and accounts 2008 Remuneration Committee report Current annualised rates of pay The following table shows the current annualised rates of base salary, benefits, bonus at target level and pension contributions for each of the directors: Annual Annual Annual Annual Annual cash 1 2 3 4 salary fees bonus benefits pension 000 000 000 000 000 Tim Barker 58 Charles Berry 200 Jamie Dundas 58 Peter Emery 255 153 12 50 Mike Grasby 60 David Lindsell 48 Tony Quinlan 300 180 12 60 Dorothy Thompson 450 293 18 90 Notes: 1 Includes Board Committee membership fees paid as separate amounts.
2 The annual bonus assumes an on target performance yielding a bonus of 65% of base salary for Dorothy Thompson and 60% of base salary for the other executive directors, of which 25% is required to be deferred into shares.
The cost of other benefits such as BUPA and additional life cover is not easily predicted because they are subject to price variation the amount of which depends on personal circumstances at the time during the year.
4 Annual contribution by the Company to the directors pension plans or cash in lieu.
The Committee has determined that the executive directors shall not receive any increase in their base salaries in the review year 2009 2010.
Executive Share Incentive Plan ESIP Under the ESIP, annual awards of performance shares were made to executive directors and other senior staff up to a normal maximum of 100% of salary 200% in exceptional circumstances.
Shares vest based on Draxs Total Shareholder Return TSR performance relative to an index over three years.
The Committee considers relative TSR to be an objective, external measure of the Companys success.
For the 2008 ESIP awards, index TSR is based 50% 60% for 2006 ESIP awards and 50% for 2007 ESIP awards on the median TSR of FTSE350 electricity sector peers, 25% 20% on the median TSR of selected UK-listed oil and gas companies and 25% 20% on the TSR of the FTSE100 index, as shown below: Electricity sector peers Oil and gas comparators FTSE100 Weighting 50% 25% 25% 1 2 3 Constituents British Energy BG Group FTSE100 index, as published International Power BP Scottish and Southern Energy Gazprom Royal Dutch Shell Notes: 1 Viridian Group Limited had previously been included in the electricity sector peers group, however, it was subject to takeover which took effect on 8 December 2006, and therefore it was considered appropriate to remove it as a constituent in the sector peers group for 2007.
2 ScottishPower had previously been included in the electricity sector peers group, however, it was subject to takeover which took effect on 23 April 2007, and therefore it was considered appropriate to remove it as a constituent in the sector peers group for 2007.
3 British Energy remained as an electricity sector peer until its takeover which took effect on 3 February 2009, following which it will be removed as a constituent.
No shares vest if the Companys TSR over the three-year period is less than the index TSR: 25% of shares vest if the Companys TSR equals that of the Index: shares vest in full if the Companys TSR outperforms that of the Index by 30% or more, and there is straight-line pro rata vesting in between.
For any award to vest, the Committee must be satisfied that there has been a demonstrable improvement in the performance of the Company in terms of but not limited to finance, production, trading, ancillary activities and progress in delivering the Companys strategy.
The Committee has chosen these broader criteria rather than the more straightforward criterion of financial performance because of the extent to which financial performance is susceptible to the influence of movements in relevant commodity markets.
Awards under the ESIP will normally be pro rated for time and performance in circumstances where they vest for good leavers and on a change of control.
At the 2007 Annual General Meeting a resolution proposing that dividends accrue on ESIP shares over the vesting period to ensure alignment with shareholders interests was approved.
The dividend accrual will only relate to ordinary dividends and will not be allowed in respect of any special dividends which are directly linked to share consolidations where each share consolidation has the effect of automatically maintaining the value of the award following payment of the special dividend.
The ESIP will be replaced by the proposed BMP in 2009, conditional upon shareholder approval at the 2009 AGM.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008 53 2008 ESIP award ESIP awards were made in April 2008, for nil consideration.
For executive directors, each award was calculated based on 100% of base salary.
Performance for the 2008 ESIP awards will be measured over the three years from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2010 with potential vesting in April 2011.
The awards made in September 2006 and April 2007 are the only long-term incentives having the potential to vest before that date.
All-employee share plans The Committee operates a Savings-Related Share Option Plan SAYE and a Share Incentive Plan SIP, both of which are approved by HM Revenue & Customs and must be operated on an all-employee basis.
The executive directors may participate in each plan upon the same terms as other employees.
The SAYE provides for the grant of options which, at the Committees discretion, may be offered at a discount of up to 20% to the market price of a share determined in accordance with the rules of the plan linked to a savings contract which pays interest at a statutory rate.
No invitations to participate in the SAYE plan were made in 2007 or 2008.
Details of the SAYE options held by the executive directors are shown in the table in Part 2 of this report.
In any one tax year, the Committee may operate the SIP for the benefit of participants using any combination of the following elements: award Free Shares up to 3,000 in value : allow the purchase of Partnership Shares up to 1,500 in value subject to an overriding maximum of 10% of salary : allocate free Matching Shares in a maximum ratio of two Free Shares for each Partnership Share : and allow the investment in shares of dividends received in respect of SIP shares.
In January 2007, the Committee reviewed the use of the SIP with the aim of establishing a clearer linkage between long-term incentive rewards for all employees and collective performance and encouraging wider share ownership amongst employees.
Wider employee share ownership aligns the interests of employees with those of shareholders by enabling employees to share in the benefits flowing from their contribution to the success of the Company.
As a result of the review the Committee decided to: award Free Shares to the value of 2,500 to each eligible employee: allow employees to purchase Partnership Shares up to the maximum permitted of 1,500 subject to an overriding maximum of 10% of salary: and make an allocation of one free Matching Share in respect of each Partnership Share purchased.
In accordance with the plan rules, shares taken up by an employee are allocated to a trustee which holds them on behalf of the employee.
Under normal circumstances, the employee will receive the shares from the trustee without incurring a tax liability once the shares have been held in trust for five years.
The employee is entitled to receive dividends paid in respect of the shares held in trust.
The SIP operated on the same basis in 2008 as it did in 2007.
The SIP Trustee was funded by the Group to purchase the required Free and Matching Shares in order to avoid any dilution.
Details of the shares allocated to executive directors are shown in the table in Part 2 of this report.
Provision of shares for share plans dilution The current estimated dilution from subsisting awards, including executive and all-employee share awards, is less than 0.5% of the shares in issue at the date of this report.
All equity-based plans are funded through the issuance of shares, or through the purchase of shares in the marketplace through a trust, subject to an overall dilution limit for all employee share plans of no more than 10% of share capital in any ten-year period and a limit of 5% of share capital in any ten-year period for the Companys discretionary share plans e. g. ESIP.
Share ownership guidelines The Company has share ownership guidelines for executives participating in the ESIP.
They are 100% and 50% of base salary for executive directors and other senior manager ESIP participants, respectively.
Those who receive shares by virtue of ESIP awards or who receive deferred bonus shares must retain 50% of the net that is, after income tax and national insurance contributions shares received until the applicable guideline is reached.
Drax Group plc 54 Annual report and accounts 2008 Remuneration Committee report Service contracts Executive directors service agreements are of indefinite duration, subject to a normal retirement age of 65, terminable at any time by either party giving 12 months prior notice except that Peter Emerys contract is terminable by him providing six months notice to the Company.
Under each of the executive directors service agreements other than the Chief Executives, Drax has the right to make a payment in lieu of notice of termination, the amount of that payment being the salary and benefits that would have accrued to the executive director during the contractual notice period.
The following table shows for each person who has served as a director of the Company at any time during the year ended 31 December 2008, the commencement date and term of the service agreement or contract for services, and details of the notice periods.
No service agreement now includes any operative provision for the payment of compensation upon early termination.
Any compensation payable in those circumstances would need to be negotiated at the time and in the light of the circumstances.
Notice period Notice period by the Company by the director Contract start date Contract term Months Months Tim Barker 15 December 2005 6 years 11 Charles Berry 17 April 2008 3 years 66 Jamie Dundas 15 December 2005 6 years 11 Peter Emery 14 June 2004 Indefinite duration 12 6 Mike Grasby 15 December 2005 6 years 11 David Lindsell 1 December 2008 3 years 11 Tony Quinlan 1 September 2008 Indefinite duration 12 12 Dorothy Thompson 26 September 2005 Indefinite duration 12 12 Directors service agreements and contracts for services are available for inspection at the Companys registered office during normal hours of business and will be available at the place of the AGM from 10.00am until the close of the meeting.
External appointments The Committee recognises that executive directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies and that such appointments can broaden their knowledge and experience to the benefit of the Company.
The policy is that an executive director who accepts an external appointment having had the prior approval of the Board should retain the fees payable in respect of the appointment.
Dorothy Thompson was appointed as a non-executive director of Johnson Matthey plc with effect from 1 September 2007, and received 45,000 in fees for that appointment during 2008.
Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2008 55 Non-executive directors Chairmans remuneration and service agreement Charles Berry, as a non-executive director and Chairman of the Board has a contract to provide services in substantially similar terms to the contract of each of the other non-executive directors, save as to the level of remuneration and the period of notice to terminate the contract.
The Committee reviewed the Chairmans remuneration prior to his appointment using a similar approach to that used in previous years, which followed a review of remuneration data for chairmen of other listed companies of a similar market value or turnover to Drax and having regard to his expected time commitment.
It decided that upon his appointment his remuneration should be at the annual rate of 200,000, which is reflected in the table of annualised rates of pay on page 52.
The Committee has determined that the Chairman shall not receive any increase in his remuneration in the review year 2009 2010.
His notice period is six months on either side.
Like the other non-executive directors, he does not receive a pension or other benefits, nor is he eligible for an annual cash bonus or any of the share-based reward plans.
Other non-executive directors The remuneration for the other non-executive directors is determined by the Chairman and the executive directors and is designed to: recognise prevailing market rates for non-executive directors fees: reflect the responsibilities and time commitment of non-executive directors: and attract and retain individuals with the necessary skills and experience to contribute to the future growth of the Company.
The fees for non-executive directors were last reviewed in April 2008.
The review looked at the structure of payments made in respect of Committee Chairmanship and membership and took into account the fees payable by the same comparator companies as those used for the purposes of the review of the Chairmans remuneration by the Committee and decided to increase the basic fee from 39,000 to 40,000 per annum with additional fees for each Board Committee membership being reduced from 5,040 to 2,500 per annum and the fee for being the Chairman of each of the Boards Committees being increased from 2,500 to 10,000 per annum, other than the Nominations Committee of which the Chairman of the Board is the Chairman.
Non-executive directors fees are neither performance-related nor pensionable.
The non-executive directors do not participate in any of the Companys bonus schemes or share-based reward plans.
The non-executive directors have contracts to provide services to the Company which may be terminated by either party at any time on giving one months notice.
Value of 100 invested The following graph shows how the value of 100 invested in the Company on the listing of its shares on the London Stock Exchange on 15 December 2005 has changed and compares that performance with the changing value of the same amount invested at the same time in the FTSE100 and FTSE250 indices.
Those indices have been chosen as suitable broad comparators against which the Companys shareholders may judge their relative returns given that, during the year under review, the Company has been a member of both the FTSE250 and FTSE100 indices.
The graph reflects the total shareholder return determined according to usual market practice for the Company and each of the indices referred to on a cumulative basis over the period from 15 December 2005 to 31 December 2008.
