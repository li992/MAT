2 REMUNERATION POLICY The Companys policy on remuneration is to set overall remuneration packages at a level sufficient to attract, retain and incentivise high calibre staff with a view to enhancing long-term shareholder value.
Executive Directors Consistent with this policy, emoluments awarded to Executive Directors are intended to be competitive and comprise a mix of both performance and non-performance related remuneration and include discretionary awards.
This is designed to incentivise Directors and to align their interests with those of shareholders, whilst adhering to the goals of Corporate Governance.
Non-discretionary awards are not made.
The Remuneration Committee carefully considers on a regular basis the market positioning of the remuneration and emoluments of the Directors against a group of appropriate quoted real estate companies.
CLS does not operate any long term incentive plans.
The criteria used for judging the Executive Directors fees are: Their own personal performance measured against specific targets The financial performance of the Group as measured against budget, and Total return to shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee believes in incentivising the Directors taking account of the overall emoluments paid, having carefully reviewed these to ensure that they are not paid excessively in comparison to peer group companies.
The Board does not anticipate any significant change to its remuneration policy in the year ending 31 December 2009 or subsequent years, subject to annual review by the Remuneration Committee.
Non-Executive Directors The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is reviewed and determined by the Board, having received the recommendations of the Executive Directors.
Their remuneration consists of fees for their services to the Board and any additional services such as chairing Board Committees and other services.
Thomas Lundqvist also received a fee as a Non-Executive Director of CLS Capital Partners Limited, the Companys investment division, until 3 March 2008.
Both Thomas Lundqvist and Tom Thomson receive daily fees for specific projects undertaken, subject to the agreement of the Chief Executive Officer.
During the year, the Board reviewed and subsequently considerably reduced the Non-Executive Directors fees to a level that better suited the Companys size and structure.
Basic salaries The basic salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed annually with any changes made effective as at 1 January.
The annual review takes account of similar positions in a range of comparable companies as indicated above.
36 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued for the year ended 31 December 2008 Performance-Related Remuneration The performance-related element, if any, of each Executive Directors remuneration is determined after taking into account the performance of the individual and the performance of the Company, together with the emoluments of the individual, compared to those in the comparator group mentioned above.

38 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued for the year ended 31 December 2008 5 SHARE PERFORMANCE GRAPH The following graph shows the Companys performance measured by total shareholder return TSR since the Company was listed on the London Stock Exchanged compared with the TSR performances of the FTSE All Share companies and the FTSE Real Estate index over the same period.
The FTSE Real Estate Index is considered to be the most appropriate as it reflects the performance of the sector in which the Company operates.
Historically the Company has consistently outperformed both the FTSE all share and FTSE real estate indices, however in June 2007 share prices fell in anticipation of the downturn in the commercial property market which occurred in the second half of 2007.
Since that time these indices have converged.
The graph below, independently sourced, includes conventional dividend payments but excludes the positive impact to CLS shareholders of substantial capital distributions through tender offer buy-backs.
