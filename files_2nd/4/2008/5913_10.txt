44 Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Incentive Plans A substantial proportion of Executive Directors remuneration is based on performance via the Short Term Incentive and Long Term Incentive Plans described below.
Short-Term Incentive Plan STIP aims to focus management efforts on delivery of annual business priorities, based on a scorecard of key performance indicators relating to both Company and individual performance.
Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP aims to motivate participants to deliver appropriate longer-term returns to shareholders.
The Board intends to continue to operate the STIP and LTIP for the Executive Directors and senior executives in 2009.
During the year the Remuneration Committee also worked on the design of an Added Value Incentive Plan AVIP, a one-off plan designed to incentivise selected senior executives.
Extensive consultations were held with shareholders on both the LTIP and AVIP, and changes were made to the design of both plans as a result.
However, due to the changes in business strategy and postponement of the Companys strategic initiative programme announced in the autumn, implementation of the AVIP was also postponed.
This position will be kept under review, and the Remuneration Committee will only implement such a plan with the approval of shareholders at a general meeting.
Long Term Incentive Plan The LTIP framework was approved by shareholders at the 2008 Annual General Meeting.
The LTIP provides for annual awards of performance shares and options up to an aggregate limit of 200% of salary in normal circumstances.
Initial awards were made in 2008 on the basis of the same number of shares to participants at the same level in the organisation.
None of the awards exceeded 100% of salary.
The awards are a conditional award of performance shares which vest according to the degree to which Ferrexpos three year TSR matches or outperforms a comparator index see below.
The Remuneration Committee has chosen relative TSR as the primary long-term incentive measure as it considers this to be the most objective external measure of the Companys success.
For 2008 awards, the comparator index was based 50% on the median TSR of global diversified mining companies, 30% on the median TSR of smaller focused iron ore miners and 20% on the median TSR of selected other single commodity emerging market miners, as illustrated below.
Aggregate Index component Constituents weighting Global diversified miners 10% each 50% CVRD Vale Rio Tinto BHP Billiton Xstrata Anglo American Focused iron ore miners 5% each 30% Aricom Kumba Iron Ore Cleveland-Cliffs Mount Gibson Iron Fortescue Metals Group Portman Single commodity emerging market miners 20% 1% each African Rainbow Minerals Katanga Mining Alcoa Kazakhmys Alumina KGHM Polska Miedz Aluminum Corp of China Lundin Mining Antofagasta Norilsk Boliden Oxiana Eramet Peabody Energy First Quantum Minerals Teck Cominco Freeport McMoRan Vedanta Resources Industrias Penoles Zinifex TSR is calculated on a common currency basis to ensure that comparisons with international comparators listed overseas are fair.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to review the comparator index if any of the constituent companies are affected by mergers and acquisitions.
During the year, the focused iron ore miners have been amended to take account of the acquisition of Portman by Cleveland-Cliffs and the single commodity emerging market miners have been amended to take account of the merger of Oxiana and Zinifex to form OZ Minerals.
The Remuneration Committee also reviews the constituents and their weightings prior to the start of each LTIP cycle to ensure they remain appropriate.
The comparator index will be similar for 2009 LTIP awards.
Aricom has been dropped as it is no longer deemed to be a relevant comparator.
ENRC has been added to the single commodity emerging markets miners.
45 Ferrexpo plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Corporate governance Remuneration Report continued No performance shares will vest if Ferrexpos TSR underperforms the comparator index.
20% will vest if Ferrexpos TSR is equal to Index TSR: full vesting will occur only if Ferrexpos TSR exceeds the Index by at least 8% p. a. : there will be straight-line pro rata vesting in between those points.
In addition, for any shares to vest, the Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that the recorded TSR is a fair reflection of Ferrexpos underlying business performance.
The vesting schedule is illustrated below: 2008 LTIP vesting schedule 100% 80% 60% 40% 20% 0% Ferrexpo 3-year TSR Index Index 8% p. a.
Dividends will accrue on performance shares over the vesting period, and be paid on shares that vest.
In the event of a change of control, awards will be pro-rated for time and performance.
The Remuneration Committee will retain discretion to vary this treatment if it deems it to be in shareholders interests to do so.
Transitional award of performance shares The 2008 LTIP awards will not vest before Spring 2011.
In recognition of this, and to enable a smooth transition to annual rolling three-year LTIP cycles, the Committee supplemented the 2008 LTIP awards of up to 100% of salary in performance shares with transitional awards of performance shares of up to 100% of salary for the CEO, up to 75% of salary for the Executive Director Business Development and up to 67% of salary for the Chief Financial Officer.
These awards will vest on two-year TSR performance and be based on the same calibration.
Proposed 2009 LTIP awards The Remuneration Committee is intending to continue to operate the LTIP framework in 2009 in the same manner as described above.
Short Term Incentive Plan A Short Term Incentive Plan is in place which applies to the members of the Executive Committee, including the Executive Directors.
For 2008 the maximum STIP opportunity for Executive Directors was 150% of salary.
The Key Performance Indicators KPIs for 2008 were agreed for each member of the Executive Committee and were weighted to reflect the contribution of each executive to the achievement of that KPI.
KPIs during the year included Financial KPIs and KPIs relating to corporate social responsibility, projects and governance.
Their respective weightings for the Executive Directors during the year were as follows: Mike Dennis 1 1 KPI Oppenheimer McShane Chris Mawe EBITDA 20% 20% 20% Net operating profit after tax NOPAT 25% 25% 25% Major capital projects 15% 15% 15% CSR 10% 10% 10% Personal, projects and governance 30% 30% 30% 1 Mike Oppenheimer and Dennis McShane resigned from the Board on 1 November 2008.
2 Kostyantin Zhevago did not become an Executive Director until 1 November 2008 and was not a member of the STIP during 2008.
In 2008 overall financial performance was rated between 50% and 100%.
CSR, projects and governance were rated as between 0% and 100%.
Taking into account these results the Remuneration Committee awarded the Finance Director a STIP award of 59% of salary.

2 As at date of resignation.
The Remuneration Committee sets notice periods for the Executive Directors at 12 months or less, which reduces the likelihood of having to pay excessive compensation in the event of poor performance.
The policy on termination payments is to pay no more than what may be stipulated in an individuals service agreement.
The Executive Directors service contracts contain a provision exercisable at the option of the employer to pay an amount on early termination of employment equal to the respective notice period.
If the Company elects to make a payment in lieu of notice, the Executive Director will also be entitled to receive all components of remuneration, allowances and expenses for the extent of the notice period.
The payment in lieu of notice clauses will be invoked when the speed and certainty afforded by such clauses are thought to be in the best interests of the shareholders.
Benefits-in-kind Under his service agreement, Kostyantin Zhevago is entitled to 25 working days paid holiday per year.
He is also entitled to furnished accommodation in Switzerland and elsewhere in Europe if necessary for the performance of his duties at no cost, and up to US$5,000 per annum for professional tax advice.
