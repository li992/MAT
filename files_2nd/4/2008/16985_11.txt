# Directors pension benefits Alan Mitchelson was a member of a defined benefit scheme provided by the Group during the year 2008.
Mark Selway and Keith Cochrane are responsible for their own pension provision.
Pension entitlement and the corresponding transfer values were as follows during the year: Disclosures under Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 Listing Rules Accrued pension Transfer value of accrued pension Change during the year net Increase Transfer value of directors in accrued of increase Increase At year ordinary Directors At year pension during net of At year during end At year contributions ordinary end the year net inflation Notes start the year note 1 start note 3 contributions note 2 of inflation note 2 Alan Mitchelson 4,5 26,163 4,380 30,543 531,724 148,560 9,120 689,404 3,281 65,320 # Audited 1.
The pension entitlement shown is that which would be paid annually on normal retirement, prior to any cash commutation, based on pensionable service to the end of the year.
With effect from 1 October 2008, Government legislation requires the trustees having taken actuarial advice to take responsibility for setting the assumptions underlying the calculation of voluntary transfer values to be paid from the plan.
Prior to this date the scheme actuary had this responsibility.
Consequently, the transfer value of the accrued pension at the year end has been calculated in accordance with this new requirement.
The change in the amount of the transfer value over the year is made up of the following elements: a. transfer value of the increase in accrued pension net of inflation : b. transfer value of the increase in accrued pension due to inflation : c. increase in the transfer value of accrued pension at year start due to ageing: d. impact of any change in the economic or mortality assumptions underlying the transfer value basis as referred to in 2. above: and e. less the directors ordinary contributions.
The change in the amount of the transfer value over the year includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Group and directors, such as stockmarket movements: which will be reflected within d. above.
The figures allow for the impact of the plan specific earnings cap.
Alan Mitchelson does not have an entitlement to an excepted formerly known as unapproved pension from the Group.
Payment of actual transfer values from the defined benefit scheme are not currently reduced below 100% of their full value.
