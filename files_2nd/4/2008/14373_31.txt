The Chairman, JohnBuchanan, attends  andoffers  perspective.

The terms of reference, which are available on the Companys website at www.
com, enable the Committee to obtain its own external advice on any matter, at the Companys expense.
During the year, the Committee received information from a number of independent consultants appointed by the Company: Deloitte LLP on a broad range of remuneration issues and on long-term incentive plan comparative performance and Towers Perrin, Watson Wyatt and Mercer on salary data when considering base salaries of executive directors and executive officers.
Deloitte LLP has provided taxation advice to the Group, Towers Perrin and Mercer have provided general salary data and Watson Wyatt has advised on various compensation matters belowBoardlevel.
Remuneration Policy The remuneration policy, as approved by the Remuneration Committee, is designed to ensure that remuneration is sufficiently competitive to attract, retain and motivate executive directors and executive officers of a calibre that meets the Groups needs to achieve its business objectives.
Remuneration includes base pay and benefits which are referenced to median competitive levels for acceptable performance, and incentive schemes which are designed to motivate and reward for outperformance.
Remuneration packages are benchmarked by reference to appropriate UK and US companies and where relevant other local markets.
Individual remuneration levels are based on measurable performance against fair and open objectives and there are no automatic pay adjustments .
The policies described in this report have been applied throughout 2008.
Whilst it is intended that these policies will continue to apply in 2009 and subsequent years, the Remuneration Committee has an ongoing process for monitoring its policies, including its arrangements for performance based pay, against evolving market practice and relevant guidance.
This is particularly relevant in the current climate as the depth of the economic downturn continues to evolve.
Where changes are proposed these would only be implemented following a consultation, review and approval process deemed to be appropriate for such change.
Major changes to the remuneration policyarediscussed .
63 Remuneration Report The Principal Components of Remuneration The remuneration package for the Companys senior executives for 2008 and 2009 comprises the following elements: Basicsalary:  element undertheDeferred BonusPlan: Long-termincentives,  andshareoptions:and Pensionentitlement andotherbenefits.
a Basic Salary and Benefits Basic salary reflects the responsibility of the position and individual performance.
Salaries are reviewed annually with effect from 1 April each year.
The Committee agreed the following base salaries with effect from 1 April 2008: DavidJ.
Following the annual review conducted in February 2009, it was decided that, with effect from 1 April 2009, AdrianHennahssalary wouldbe increasedby3% wouldremainunchanged.
The Group also provides certain benefits such as private healthcare coverage and a company car or allowance in line with competitive practice.
The Remuneration Committee considers any pension consequences and costs to    officers.
b Performance Related Bonus and Deferred Bonus Plan For executive directors, the Group operates an annual bonus scheme.
The scheme is designed to encourage outstanding performance without promoting excessive risk taking to achieve short term bonus opportunity.
In 2009, 50% of the annual bonus will be based on annual growth in EPSA, 25% will be based on earnings improvementstargets and25%onpersonalobjectives.
The Deferred Bonus Plan is designed to encourage executives to build-up and maintain a significant shareholding in the Company.
Under the plan, one third of any bonus earned at target level or above by an executive director will be compulsorily deferred into shares which vest, subject to continued employment, in equal annual tranches over three years i. e. one third each year.
No further performance conditions will apply to thedeferred shares.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for executive directors is 150% of annual salary, of which one third will be compulsorily deferred.
The maximum cash bonus opportunity therefore is 100% of salary.
For executive officers with corporate responsibilities, the 2009 annual bonus plan will be linked to EPSA growth, earnings improvement targets and personal objectives.
For those executive officers with specific business unit responsibilities, targets will be linked to EPSA growth, sales growth, trading profit, margin and earnings improvement targets of their respective business unit.
One quarter of the annual bonus earned at target level or above, will be compulsorily deferred into shares, which vest in equal annual tranches over three years, subject to continuedemployment.
In respect of 2008, the annual bonus targets for executive directors related 75% to annual growth in EPSA and 25% was based on personal objectives underpinned by asset velocity measurements.
On this basis, the actual bonus %ofthemaximumaward.
c Long-Term Incentives i Performance Share Plan PSP The performance measures of the Performance Share Plan are aligned with Smith & Nephews growth strategy, and balance a requirement for strong sustainable financial performance with the alignment of executives and shareholders interests .
64 The initial market value of awards made to executive directors is equivalent to 150% of their basic annual salary and the initial market value of the awards made to executive officers is equivalent to 75% of their basic annual salary.
Annual awards over shares made under the Performance Share Plan will only vest if pre-defined levels of EPSA growth are achieved.
The number of shares that are delivered may be increased if superior total shareholder returnsareachieved.
% is43% i. e. 13%compoundedannually, with50%% i. e. 18%compoundedannually.
 anyfinancial performance targets should be robust and appropriate in the context of market conditions at the time the award is granted.
It is intended that the targets for the 2009 award will take account of the economic climate in which the Company is operating and will continue to be stretching and subject to achievement of excellent EPSA and TSR performance.
In order to drive enhanced shareholder value and maintain close alignment of executives and shareholders interests, the number of shares delivered to executives for awards made in 2008 and to be made in 2009 may be increased, subject to the achievement of superior TSR measured against the major companies in the medical devices industry.
The TSR of the Groups shares as listed on the London Stock Exchange will be measured over the performance period and compared with the TSR of the medical devices comparator companies using a common currency.
If the Companys TSR is positioned above median, the number of vested shares made available to the individual  targets willbe  follows: TSR ranking within comparator group Multiplier Medianorbelow.......................................................... Nomultiplier i. e. 1.0 Upper quartile............................................................ 1.3x Upper decileorabove...................................................... 1.5x  linebasis between theabove points.
TSR will be measured relative to a tailored sector peer group of medical devices companies.
The companies in  are: Arthrocare KCI Bard Medtronic Baxter NobelBiocare BectonDickinson Nuvasive BostonScientific Orthofix Coloplast Group Stryker Conmed St Jude Medical Covidien Synthes-Stratec Edwards LifeSciencesCorp WrightMedical Johnson&Johnson Zimmer The Groups TSR performance and its performance relative to the comparator group is independently monitored andreported .
For awards made in 2006 when performance was measured against the FTSE 100 and the medical devices th group of companies which vested in 2008, 46% vested as the Company was ranked 39 in the FTSE 100 th comparatorgroupand8 inthemedicaldevices group.
65 Remuneration Report ii ExecutiveShare Options Share options are granted under the 2004 Executive Share Option Plan and 2001 UK Approved Plan to executive directors.
Under the 2004 Plan, the maximum market value of options which may be granted each year is equivalent to the basic annual salary of the participant.
Share options are exercisable up to ten years from the date of grant and are only exercisable if graduated target levels of growth in EPSA over the three-year performance period are achieved, beginning with that in which the share option is granted.
Options granted under the 2001 UK Approved Plan up to a value of 30,000 will form part of the overall grant.
Performance conditionsforthese awards willbe thesame as forthe2004Plan.
The performance targets for each grant are set by the Remuneration Committee and will be linked to the Groups longtermstrategy.
For awards made in 2008, 25% of the options will vest if growth in EPSA over the three-year period ending 31 December 2010 is 43% i. e. 13% compounded annually with 50% vesting if such growth is 64% i. e. 18% compounded annually.
Only if growthinEPSA over that period exceeds 82% i. e. 22% compoundedannually will all of the options vest.
Share options will vest pro rata on a straight-line basis if growth in EPSA is between these levels.
Share options are granted in the second half of the financial year, at the same time as PSP awards.
As noted above in respect of PSP awards, the performance targets for the 2009 share options will be considered at the time awards are granted.
However, the performance targets will continueto be stretching inthe context of market conditionsat that time.
For awards made in 2006, 59% of the options granted under the 2004 Executive Share Option Plan, will vest in 2009.
This is as a consequence of EPSA growth of 44% adjusted to exclude certain costs relating principally to the integration of Plus and to compliance activities, on which guidance was provided to the market during the year.
iii Co-investment Plan The 2004 Co-Investment Plan has now been replaced by the Deferred Bonus Plan.
Therefore no awards will be made .
The Plan enabled executive directors and senior executives to take part of their annual bonus in the form of shares.
Under the Plan, the participant elected the level of bonus to be used for this purpose up to a maximum of one half of annual gross bonus capped at 20% of basic annual salary.
The net amount of the gross amount elected was thenused topurchaseshares.
For the March 2008 award based on executives 2007 bonus, provided such shares are held for three years and the participant remains employed within Smith & Nephew, the participant will be entitled to matching shares if the Company achieves a target level of growth in EPSA over that three year period of 60% i. e. 17% compounded annually.
At this level, the participant is entitled to one matchingshare for every share acquired out of the gross equivalent amount of the net bonus used to acquire shares.
If growth in EPSA is 70% i. e. 19% compounded annually or more, the participant is entitled to two matching shares for each share acquired out of the gross equivalent amountof the net bonus used to acquireshares.
There is nosliding scale or pro rata vesting ofmatchingawards between these performancelevels, .
For awards made in 2006 which vested in 2008 the Committee has determined that one matching share will vest as theadjusted EPSA growthas outlinedabove,  44%.
iv Restricted stock awards RSA The issue of restricted stock to senior executives will be considered in exceptional circumstances, for example external recruitment, subject to the approval of the Remuneration Committee.
However no awards of restricted stockweremade toexecutive directorsin2008.
