Given the performance of the Group in the year ended 31 December 2008, no charge was made against profit for the year as vesting conditions were not met.

The mid-market price of the Companys shares at 31 December 2008 was 18p and the range during the year was 10.5p to 299p.
All outstanding options on the date of completion of the rights issue on 4 June 2008 were adjusted by multiplying the number of shares under option by 1.1681 and by multiplying the exercise price by 0.8560 to compensate option holders for the decrease in the value of their options due to the discounted rights issue price of 128p per share.
This explains why the numbers of options in the Lapsed during the year and 31 December 2008 columns are higher than in the 1 January 2008 column.
The options granted during 2008 were granted after completion of the rights issue and so were not adjusted.

The accrued pension entitlement shown in respect of M W G Collins is the amount that would be paid each year to the director in the form of a pension on retirement at age 65 in the event of him having left service at the end of the year.
The accrued pension entitlement includes, where relevant, entitlements earned as an employee prior to becoming a director, as well as those earned for qualifying services after becoming a director.
The increase in the accrued pension entitlement is the difference between the accrued benefit at the year end and that at the previous year end.
Transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
The transfer values of the additional accrued benets and of the accrued pension entitlement in respect of qualifying services represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liability in respect of the directors pension benets that he has earned in respect of qualifying services.
They do not represent sums payable to the director and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The transfer value of the additional accrued benets earned in the year less directors contribution is the transfer value of the additional accrued benets in respect of qualifying services earned in the year after deducting the directors personal contribution to the scheme during the year.
The increase in the transfer value less directors contribution is the increase in the transfer value of the accrued benets in respect of qualifying services during the year after deducting the directors personal contributions to the scheme.
