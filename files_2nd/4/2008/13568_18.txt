The committee considers that there should be a continuing emphasis on those elements of remuneration, such as annual and long-term incentives, which directly influence the performance of senior executives.
Base salaries In determining the relative importance of these elements of remuneration, the committee believes that base salaries should be set at levels required to recruit and retain high quality senior executives and with reference to the levels in the relevant marketplace for companies of similar size, internationality and complexity.
The committee has commissioned salary benchmarks from Deloitte LLP.
The benchmarks have been prepared using their company size and complexity methodology which is based on these factors.
All salary increases must be justified on the basis of performance and are not automatic.
Following the March 1 review, there will be no increases in the base salaries of executive directors for 2009.
Other benefits are generally at the median of market practice.
Annual incentives Executive directors and selected senior executives participate in the Annual Performance Related Award plan APRA.
For UK participants, APRA awards do not form part of pensionable earnings.

GN11 covers individual transfer calculations and the above figures have been calculated using assumptions certified by the Actuaries as being consistent with GN11.
The transfer values of the accrued pensions as at December 31, 2008 have been calculated on a basis adopted by the trustees on October 6, 2008 following receipt of actuarial advice for transfer values.

Sir John Rose is not accruing any further benefit or allowance in lieu of pension benefit from his ongoing employment with the Group.
The total accrued pension entitlement at December 31, 2008 is after allowance for reduction for early payment of pension and taking a part of his pension as lump sum.
The transfer value is the value of benefits in payment as at December 31, 2008 increased by cash taken on retirement.
7 The Group operates the Rolls-Royce Supplementary Retirement Scheme.
The purpose of the Scheme is to fund pension provision above the pensionable earnings cap which was imposed on approved pension schemes by the 1989 Finance Act.
Membership of the Scheme is restricted to executive directors and to a limited number of senior executives.
Andrew Shilston is a member of this Scheme.
He joined the Group after the introduction of the earnings cap and his terms and conditions on joining included a commitment to provide pension and life cover based on total salary.
Employer contributions to the Scheme during 2008 have been added to the increase in transfer value over 2008 for the registered defined benefit plans, and are therefore included in the figures shown in the right hand column of the first table.
8 Colin Smith and Mike Terrett receive a cash allowance in lieu of future pension accrual.
Had they elected to continue to accrue pension the estimated cost of that accrual would be higher than the cash allowance to be paid in lieu.
9 The lump sum entitlement shown is that which would be paid on immediate retirement based on service to the end of the year.
10 The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice.

12 James Guyette is a member of two defined benefit plans in the US, one qualified and one non-qualified.
He accrues a retirement lump sum benefit in both of these plans.
The aggregate value of the retirement lump sums accrued in these two plans, and the transfer values of these benefits, are shown in the second table.
In addition, James Guyette is a member of two 401 K Savings Plans in the US, one qualified and one non-qualified, to which both he and his employer, Rolls-Royce North America Inc. contribute.
James Guyette is also a member of an unfunded non-qualified deferred compensation plan in the US, to which his employer makes notional contributions.
Employer contributions to these three plans during 2008 have been added to the increase in transfer value over 2008 for the defined benefit plans, and are therefore included in the figures shown in the right hand column of the second table.
