DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT This report covers the remuneration policy for directors and includes specific disclosures relating to directors emoluments, their shares and other interests and is being put to shareholders at the forthcoming annual general meeting for an advisory vote.
It describes how the Board has applied the principles of good governance relating to directors remuneration as set out in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance referred to in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 40.
This report includes information which is required to be audited and this information is stated as such in the relevant table.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee currently comprises the following non-executive directors John Bywater Chairman, Bernard Cragg and Rupert Dickinson all of whom served on the Committee throughout the year.
The Chairman and the Chief Executive are other than in respect of their own positions invited to attend the meetings.
Principles of our executive remuneration policy Our remuneration policy aims to be: Competitive: Below-median basic salaries plus above-median incentives provide opportunity for competitive total reward for superior performance.
Performance linked: A significant part of the executive directors remuneration is variable and is determined by the Groups success.
Shareholder aligned: A considerable part of the reward is related to share price performance and is paid in shares that have to be retained until minimum shareholding requirements have been met.
The Group aims that all executive directors build up shareholdings equal to one times basic salary.
a Review of executive remuneration arrangements During the year the Committee undertook a comprehensive review of the Companys executive remuneration arrangements in conjunction with its independent advisor, Kepler Associates.
As part of this review, the Committee benchmarked executive committee remuneration against other property companies and companies of a similar size.
Notwithstanding the strong performance of the Group over recent years, the benchmarking showed that the fair value of executive total remuneration was around lower quartile and was uncompetitive.
This was due in part to low fixed pay and the use of performance targets for vesting of long-term incentives which were more challenging than those used by most of our competitors.
Following this review the Committee proposed structural changes to its long-term incentives which it believes will be more motivational.
As a consequence a new long-term equity incentive plan was designed.
This was approved by shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting of the Company held on 23 April 2008.
Further details of the new long-term equity incentive plan are provided on page 46 of this Report.
In addition the Committee reviewed the structure of annual bonuses.
Following this review it has increased the annual bonus opportunity for the executive directors and members of the Executive Committee from 100% to 120% of annual basic salary with effect from the financial year commencing 1 April 2008.
No significant changes to the fixed level of remuneration, including basic salary, car allowance and pension, were proposed following the review or are anticipated.
b Alignment of short-term and long-term incentive arrangements with the Groups business priorities During the Committees review of remuneration arrangements the Committee sought to align the performance conditions of both the Companys short-term and long-term incentive arrangements for the Executive Committee members with those of the Groups business priorities.
By focusing and achieving its short-and medium-term priorities the Group aims to continue to deliver enhanced shareholder return.
The following table illustrates how the Companys current short-term and medium-term priorities are aligned with the relevant performance targets: Annual Bonus Plan Target Long-Term Equity Incentive Short-and Medium-Term Priorities short-term goals Plan Performance Condition medium-term goals Maximising rental income Return against the Investment Absolute Total Shareholder Return Property Databank Index IPD share price growth plus reinvested dividends Maintain occupancy level at 90% Profit Before Tax 70-100m of properties acquired Relative Net Asset Value per annum medium-term objective Relative Absolute Total Shareholder Return High quality customer service Assessed on response received from customer satisfaction surveys Investment to improve the quality of Relative Net Asset Value space and maximise usage Total Shareholder Return Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 43 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued c Remuneration structure for the year and proposed structure for 2008 09 The elements of the Executive Directors remuneration for the previous two years and the arrangements for the year commencing 1 April 2008, following the review of executive remuneration arrangements referred to above, are summarised below: 2006 07 2007 08 2008 09 Base salary: 5% increase: increase Chief Executive 300,000 315,000 330,750 5% Property Director 195,000 205,000 215,250 5% Finance Director 195,000 205,000 217,300 6% Annual bonus Maximum of 100% of Maximum of 100% of Maximum of 120% of annual basic salary.

i Base salary The base salaries for the Executive Directors are reviewed and analysed annually taking into account advice from independent sources on the rates of salary for similar jobs in a selected group of comparable companies, and based on the performance of the individuals.
As stated above it is the policy of the Committee to pay below median salaries.
The base salary of the Chief Executive was 315,000 per annum during 2007-08 having increased from 300,000 in the previous year.
With effect from 1 April 2008 his salary is 330,750 5% increase.

Pension contributions are made on salary payments only and are in respect of 16.5% of basic annual salary.
iii Other fixed elements Other fixed elements of all executive directors remuneration comprise car allowance 15,000 per annum, private medical, personal accident and life insurance.
Details of Remuneration paid to the executive directors during the year is shown on page 48.
Workspace Group PLC 44 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 e Variable elements of pay During the year there were three variable elements of pay.
An annual bonus, a three-year co-investment plan and a long-term share option scheme.
Through the latter two schemes the Co-Investment Plan and Share Option Scheme the Group sought to encourage and reward good long-term performance by providing incentives to both invest in and retain equity in the Company.
The value of these schemes is linked to the performance of the Companys shares.
Following the adoption by shareholders of the new long-term equity incentive plan, referred to above and detailed below, no further awards will be made to participants under the Co-Investment Plan or the Share Option Scheme.
i Annual bonus The Group operates an annual bonus scheme which provides for a capped variable performance related cash bonus.
During the year the maximum bonus potential for the Executive Directors was set at 100% of basic annual salary.
The overall bonus comprised three distinct elements based on trading profit before tax, portfolio performance and personal targets.
The trading targets are linked to achievement of a defined budgeted trading profit before tax based on IFRS profits but excluding certain items, the major ones being valuation surpluses or deficits, interest capitalisation, new acquisitions net contribution, fair value adjustments to derivative financial instruments and IFRS 2 adjustments.
Bonus awards on trading profit before tax increase from 0% to 50% of salary in line with increases in profitability.
The maximum bonus was payable on this element in respect of the financial year ended 31 March 2008.
The portfolio performance bonus is based upon achievement of a capital return from the portfolio better than that for the defined comparator index compiled by IPD.
Where the combined relative performance of Workspace exceeds the index by 1% in each of the latest three years, then a bonus of 5% of salary is payable with increments to a maximum of 30% of salary where the outperformance is 2.5% over the reference period.
Full 30% bonus was payable on this element in the financial year ended 31 March 2008.
A bonus of up to 20% was payable on achievement of individual personal targets.
The bonus is awarded by the Committee after consideration of the Groups and individuals performance against these targets for the year.
The annual total bonus for the financial year ended 31 March 2008 for all Executive Directors was between 84% and 97% of base salary.
As stated above, the Committee has reviewed the structure of annual bonuses for members of the Executive Committee and has increased the annual bonus opportunity from 100% to 120% with effect from the financial year commencing 1 April 2008, with the incremental opportunity earned only for performance over and above that captured in the existing annual bonus.
For the financial year ending 31 March 2009, up to 90% of salary is based on corporate performance.
Corporate performance is based on trading profit before tax 40%, portfolio performance 40% and customer satisfaction 10%.
The corporate performance bonus may be adjusted 30% of salary based on individual performance by applying a multiplier between 0.67 and 1.33 dependent on the satisfaction of personal objectives.
For example if the Corporate bonus achieved was 80% of salary, an individual may, if he had not satisfied his personal objectives, only receive a bonus of 53.6% of salary.
However, if the performance of the individual was considered as excellent, a multiplier of 1.22 would be applied to the Corporate bonus of 80%, resulting in the individual receiving a bonus of 97.6% of salary.
Awards in excess of 110% of salary will only be awarded for exceptional corporate and individual performance.
In the event that the Company does not achieve any of its Corporate objectives, resulting in a nil payment for the Corporate bonus element, the Committee will retain discretion to award a bonus of up to 20% of annual basic salary to an Executive Committee member for exceptional individual performance.
Individual performance is based on achievement of personal objectives.
ii Co-Investment Plan This plan, approved in March 2004, was directed at increasing the directors direct share ownership in the Company, incentivising them on a medium-term basis in relation to total shareholder return TSR and aligning shareholder and directors interests.
Under the plan up to 100% of the net annual bonus awarded to directors may be invested in the Companys shares.
In June 2007, the Executive Directors were invited to invest up to 75% of their bonus payable for the year ended 31 March 2007 in shares the Invested Award.
The Company then purchased, in the market, shares equivalent to the value of the pre-tax amount of the invested bonus the Matching Award.
These shares are held over a subsequent three-year qualification period.
In order for the shares in the Invested Award to vest, the Company must satisfy the performance condition.
The performance condition is linked to the Companys TSR Performance against the FTSE Real Estate Index, its comparator group, during the three-year reference period.
For awards to vest the Company must achieve the following ranking: Rank % of award vesting Performance above that of the company at the bottom of the top quartile 100 Bottom of fourth decile 0 In between the above measures there is a scaled award.
Workspace Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008 45 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT continued In addition the participants must retain all of the shares in the Invested Award during the three year performance period.
Details of the awards made to the executive directors under the Co-Investment Plan are shown on page 50. iii Executive Share Options Following the adoption of the new long-term equity incentive plan, no further grants will be made under the Companys Executive Share Option Scheme.
Options granted in 2005 to 2007 are subject to performance targets based on the relative assessment of the Groups NAV growth against other companies in the real estate sector with a market capitalisation greater than 300m.
Full vesting of options will arise for top quartile performance, whilst no options will vest for below median performance.
Within the second quartile options will vest on a pro rata basis.
Options lapse on termination of employment unless termination arises due to exceptional circumstances, such as redundancy or death.
All grants of executive share options awarded since 2004 have been on the basis of a single performance test and where this test is not fulfilled or is only partly achieved, no retesting in future periods is allowed.
Further, for all grants of options from this time, in the event of a change in ownership of the Company, options only vest to the extent that exercise conditions have been fulfilled.
All options granted prior to 2005 have satisfied their performance targets and are exercisable.
iv Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan the Plan The Plan was approved by shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting held on 23 April 2008.
The Plan provides for the grant of two types of awards: i performance awards, these are conditional rights to receive shares at no cost to the participant subject to continued employment during the three year vesting period and the satisfaction of challenging performance conditions over a fixed three-year period: and ii matching awards, these are similar to performance awards.
To align the interests of participants with those of shareholders, the granting and vesting of the matching award is contingent on the participant acquiring and retaining linked invested shares.
Invested shares are shares that are purchased using funds provided by the participant which are held in Trust during the fixed three year vesting period.
The vesting of matching awards is also subject to the satisfaction of challenging performance conditions over a fixed three-year period.
It is the intention of the Committee that the first grant of awards will be: made to participants in June 2008 following the release of the Companys preliminary results for the year ended 31 March 2008. made to members of the Executive Committee Messrs Platt, Marples, Clemett, Boag and Pieroni in respect of 200% of annual gross salary excluding bonuses and benefits in kind.
The Committee believes this proposal is necessary to provide a motivational package, and to help reinforce the team dynamic following the recent changes in the senior executive team.
Awards will also be made to other members of the senior management team based on a sliding scale.
The vesting of both performance and matching awards will be subject to performance criteria set by the Committee.
It is intended that there will be three parts to each award, each part being assessed over the same three-year period: One-third will be dependent on the growth in net asset value of the Company relative to companies in the FTSE350 Real Estate Index over a three-year period Relative NAV : One-third will be dependent on the Companys total shareholder return share price growth plus re-invested dividends relative to companies in the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index over a three-year period Relative TSR : and One-third will be dependent on the Companys total shareholder return share price growth plus re-invested dividends over a three year period Absolute TSR.
Workspace Group PLC 46 Annual Report and Accounts 2008 The following table summarises the amount of an Award which would vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant for each level of performance: Relative NAV Relative TSR Absolute TSR one-third of an award one-third of an award one-third of an award Level of performance Companys rank Percentage of Companys Percentage of Companys Percentage of versus companies award released performance award released total return award released in the FTSE 350 relative to Real Estate Index companies in the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index Threshold 51st percentile 20% Median 20% 8% p. a.
There will be a pro-rata vesting of awards in between the threshold and maximum performance levels Furthermore, for any shares to vest on either Relative TSR or Absolute TSR, the Committee must satisfy itself that the recorded total shareholder return is a genuine reflection of the underlying business performance of the Company.
Full details of the terms of the Plan were provided in the circular to shareholders dated 28 March 2008, a copy of which is available on the Companys website at www.
Full details of awards to be made in 2008 will be included in the 2009 Directors Remuneration Report.

ESOT audited In implementing its remuneration strategy, the Board established in 1999 an Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT.
The trust is used to purchase shares in the Company to meet its obligations under share options.
Use of the ESOT reduces the dilutive effect of the grant of options over new shares.

The details of the service contracts of those who served as directors during the year are: Contract Date of last Reappointment Unexpired Notice Date at Annual General Meeting Term Period A J Hales 19.11.2005 2006 8 months 12 months H Platt 01.12.1993 2005 n a 12 months M Carragher 01.01.1996 2007 n a Resigned 12.10.2007 G Clemett 31.07.2007 n a n a 12 months B Cragg 01.06.2006 2006 12 months 6 months J P Marples 27.09.1996 2007 n a 12 months R M Taylor 22.09.1995 2004 n a Resigned 31.07.2007 J Bywater 09.06.2004 2007 27 months 6 months R Dickinson 02.08.2006 2007 16 months 6 months Service contracts do not provide for compensation on termination of contract other than in the form of written notice provisions.
In the event of termination of Mr Clemetts service contract, the Company reserves the right to make phased payments which are paid in monthly instalments and subject to mitigation.
There are no express mitigation provisions in the service contracts of Messrs Platt and Marples, however ordinary principles of contract law are implicit in these contracts obliging contract parties to mitigate losses.

Non-executive directors remuneration policy Fees for non-executive directors are reviewed annually and determined by the Board in the light of market practice and surveys e. g. by New Bridge Street Consultants and IRS, and with reference to the time commitment and responsibilities associated with the roles.
Generally, the time commitment of the Chairman is expected to be 50 days a year and for other non-executives approximately 15 to 20 days a year.
Non-executive Directors do not participate in decisions about their own remuneration.
Following review, and with effect from 1 April 2008, basic non-executive directors fees have been increased to 40,000 per annum from 33,000 previously with additional fees for Committee Chairs maintained at 5,000 per annum.
Non-executive directors receive no other pay or benefits other than the reimbursement of expenses incurred in respect of their duties as directors of the company.
Executive directors remuneration and wider group remuneration policy The Groups wider people policies are reported separately on page 24.
The ratio of the average base pay of Executive Directors to the average of all other full-time staff directly employed by the Group is 9.6.
