REPORT ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION AND RELATED MATTERS This report sets out the Groups policy and disclosure in relation to the remuneration and share interests of the directors of Burberry Group plc.
It has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 and the requirements of the applicable Listing Rules.
Unaudited information The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee comprises: David Tyler Chairman Philip Bowman Ian Carter appointed 18 May 2007 Stephanie George John Peace The Remuneration Committee is responsible for setting the remuneration of the executive directors and the Chairman and monitors the level and structure of senior management pay.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors is a matter for the Board as a whole.
No director is involved in any discussions as to their own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee meets at least twice a year and holds additional meetings as necessary.
During the year under review, the Committee met four times.
Details of the number of meetings and attendance at those meetings during the year are set out in the table on page 79.
The Remuneration Committee has been assisted in its considerations during the year by Kepler Associates who were appointed by the Committee following the IPO in June 2002.
Kepler Associates do not provide any other services to the Company.
In addition, data and benchmarking information have been provided during the year by Towers Perrin.
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are available on the Groups website www.
Remuneration policy The Remuneration Committee believes the Groups remuneration should be competitive and strongly linked to performance.
It therefore has a remuneration policy based on the following two principles.
First, in order to attract, motivate and retain exceptional talent to enable the Group to compete effectively with the worlds leading luxury brands, the Remuneration Committee bases the quantum of total remuneration on competitive practice.
For some roles the Group competes for talent in the same global marketplace as other luxury brands, many of which are based in the US.
Total remuneration for executive directors and other senior executives is benchmarked against Burberrys main global competitors and UK companies of comparable size.
The Remuneration Committee recognises that for each executive the relative importance of each of these benchmarks may be different.
Benefits are based on competitive market practice for each executive, depending on individual circumstances.
The second principle is to emphasise variable pay in order to establish a clear link between pay and performance, to align remuneration closely with shareholders interests and to incentivise and reward both very good performance and exceptional performance.
For this reason, the Groups current share incentive plans are subject to performance conditions.
To provide a balanced focus between short and long term business objectives, variable pay for executive directors includes an annual cash bonus based on growth in EBIT and individual performance, and long-term share-based incentives linked primarily to increases in shareholder value and to continued employment over three to five years.
Remuneration packages are established and regularly reviewed against the agreed policy to ensure that they meet the policy principles.
When seeking to attract new executives the Remuneration Committee endeavours to incorporate these policy objectives into the remuneration package.

The FTSE 100 Index has been selected because Burberrys market capitalisation is close to that of companies at the lower end of the FTSE 100 Index.
Value of 100 invested on 31 March 2003 Burberry FTSE100 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 March 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Elements of remuneration Remuneration is structured such that for executive directors and senior management, performance-related elements represent the majority of potential total remuneration.
The Group implements its remuneration policy through the provision of the following elements: Base salary The Group aims to provide salaries which are competitive with those of comparable roles at companies of a similar size and global reach within the luxury goods sector including those in the US and those which are privately-owned and UK companies of similar size.
These companies are representative of Burberrys competitors for executive talent.
When making salary determinations, the Remuneration Committee takes into account not only this competitive information but also each executive directors contribution to the business during the year.
On recruitment, the Remuneration Committee also considers the executives current remuneration and the overall package required to attract, incentivise and retain the relevant executive.
Annual bonus Each year the Remuneration Committee sets bonus targets by reference to internal and external expectations.
Bonuses are currently based on profit growth and individual performance.
The Remuneration Committee believes that linking incentives to profit growth helps to reinforce the Groups profitability and growth objectives.
Targets are calibrated by Kepler Associates using benchmarks that include broker earnings estimates for Burberry, earnings estimates for competitors, targets for profit growth consistent with median upper quartile shareholder returns, latest projections for the current year, budget, strategic plan, long-term financial goals, etc.
Actual bonus awards are subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Share schemes and long-term incentive arrangements The Group has a number of share schemes and long-term incentive arrangements in place: The Burberry Co-Investment Plan the Co-Investment Plan The Burberry Exceptional Performance Share Plan the EPP The Burberry Senior Executive Restricted Share Plan the RSP The Burberry Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme 2002 the Executive Share Option Scheme The Burberry Group plc Share Incentive Plan the SIP The Burberry Approved Savings Related Share Option Scheme the SAYE Further information regarding these schemes can be found on pages 89 to 91 and also in note 27.

85 BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 08 REPORT ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION AND RELATED MATTERS CONTINUED Service agreements Attracting the best talent in the global luxury goods business can require fixed contract terms which result in termination payments in excess of one years remuneration.
Burberry does not offer such terms unless the Remuneration Committee considers it absolutely necessary in the particular circumstances to attract a highly talented individual and even in these circumstances will ensure that, after an initial period, termination payments will not exceed one years remuneration.
Save for the service contract of Angela Ahrendts, there are no service contracts for any director which could result in termination payments of more than one years remuneration.

Following any payment on 31 December 2008 no further payments will be made in respect of this bonus.
If Burberry terminates the service agreement in circumstances where there is not poor performance as described below, she would be entitled to two times her annual salary and two times maximum bonus opportunity and the balance of her personal achievement bonus.

She would also receive her pension and overseas allowances for a further 12 months together with relocation expenses.

If Burberry terminates the agreement without cause but in circumstances where the Remuneration Committee determines that Angela Ahrendts performance or that of the Group does not meet the financial expectations of the Board or shareholders, her entitlements in respect of salary and bonus will be reduced so that she will receive 12 months salary and half of her maximum bonus opportunity.

88 BURBERRY GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 08 110 REPORT ON DIRECTORS REMUNERATION AND RELATED MATTERS CONTINUED Share schemes and long-term incentive arrangements The Burberry Co-Investment Plan the Co-Investment Plan The Group encourages executive directors and other senior management to hold shares in Burberry Group plc.
To facilitate this, executive directors may, at the invitation of the Remuneration Committee, defer receipt of all or part of their annual bonus and invest it in Burberry shares, with up to a 2:1 match based on individual and Group performance during the year.
The Matching Share awards do not vest for three years and are forfeited if the executive leaves due to resignation within that period.
To further link pay and performance and to align remuneration with shareholders interests, the vesting of Matching Share awards granted in respect of the current 2008 09 bonus year and future bonus years will be subject to the achievement of secondary performance conditions linked to growth in profit before tax.
For the year ended 31 March 2007 Angela Ahrendts and Stacey Cartwright chose to defer and invest the whole of their bonus after the deduction of tax into Burberry shares via the Co-Investment Plan.
The Invested Shares are included in the table below and in the table of directors interests appearing on page 92.
The related Matching Share awards under these arrangements are also shown in the table below.
The interests of the executive directors, who served during the financial year, in shares granted under this scheme as at 31 March 2008 were as follows.

The market value of these awards at the date of grant 20 June 2007 was 700.5p per share.
The Burberry Group plc Exceptional Performance Share Plan the EPP Following shareholder approval at the 2007 Annual General Meeting, Burberry introduced a one-off long-term incentive plan, delivered in Burberry shares, the purpose of which is to incentivise senior management to achieve stretching goals and to help provide exceptional reward for exceptional performance.
The EPP award is based 50% on relative Total Shareholder Return TSR performance and 50% on growth in profits over the three and four year performance periods to 2010 and 2011.
No awards would vest unless Burberrys TSR exceeds the median of the comparator group or growth in profit before tax and amortisation of goodwill per share PBT exceeds 50% over the four year performance period to 2010 or 75% over the five year performance period to 2011.
For the performance period to 2010, maximum vesting would require Burberrys TSR to out-perform the median of our peers by at least 8% p. a. and would require PBT growth of at least 75%.
For the performance period to 2011, maximum vesting would require Burberrys TSR to out-perform the median of our peers by at least 7% p. a. and would require PBT growth of at least 100%.
Of the shares which meet the performance criteria, 50% vest on the third anniversary of the award date and the remaining 50% vest on the fourth anniversary of the award date.
The TSR group for this award comprised Bulgari, Coach, Compagnie Financire Richemont, Este Lauder, Fossil, Geox, Herms International, Hugo Boss, Inditex, Liz Claiborne, Luxottica Group, LVMH Mot Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Nike, Nordstrom, Polo Ralph Lauren, PPR, Saks, Swatch, Tiffany & Co, and Tods.

The Burberry Senior Executive Restricted Share Plan the RSP Under this plan, executives may be awarded shares up to a maximum value of one times base salary up to two times base salary in exceptional circumstances.
The vesting of RSP awards is based 50% on Burberrys three-year Total Shareholder Return TSR relative to peers and 50% on three year growth in Profit Before Tax PBT.
Awards vest in full only if Burberry achieves at least upper quartile TSR relative to its global peers and at least 15% per annum PBT growth.
A proportion of an award 12.5% may vest if TSR performance exceeds the median of the peer group or if PBT growth exceeds 5% per annum over three years.
Of the shares which meet the performance criteria, 50% vest after three years.
The remaining 50% vest in two equal tranches on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the award date.
The Remuneration Committee chose TSR relative to a group of Burberrys global peers because it felt that this is an objective measure of the Groups success and aligns with shareholder interests.
Growth in PBT was chosen as it continues to be the primary measure used by management and the Remuneration Committee believes strong pre-tax profit growth is key to delivering superior shareholder returns.
The TSR group for the 2007 award comprised Bulgari, Coach, Compagnie Financire Richemont, Este Lauder, Fossil, Geox, Herms International, Hugo Boss, Inditex, Liz Claiborne, Luxottica Group, LVMH Mot Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Nike, Nordstrom, Polo Ralph Lauren, PPR, Saks, Swatch, Tiffany & Co, and Tods.
