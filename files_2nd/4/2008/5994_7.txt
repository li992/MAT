Board Report on Directors Remuneration Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with the directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations which introduced new statutory requirements for the disclosure of directors remuneration in respect of periods ending on or after 31 December 2002.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the board has applied the principles of good governance relating to directors remuneration.
As required by the Regulations, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the annual general meeting of the company.
The information set out in the following section of the report is not subject to audit.
Remuneration Committee Remuneration of the executive directors, including the chairman, is determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Members of the committee are the independent non-executive directors, who were Mr G P Craig and Mr M L Hawker throughout the year, Mr J M F Padovan until the time of his retirement on 2 July 2007 and Mr S S McKay from the time of his appointment on 3 July 2007.
The chairman was Mr Padovan until his retirement from the board on 2 July 2007 and Mr Hawker from 3 July 2007.
No member of the committee has any personal financial interest, other than as a shareholder, in the matters to be decided, nor any potential conict of interest arising from cross-directorships, nor has he any day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The chairman of the company normally attends meetings of the committee by invitation except when matters concerning his own remuneration are discussed.
The committee is assisted when required by Hewitt New Bridge Street, who are appointed by the committee and who provide no other services to the company.
The Remuneration Committee meets two or more times a year.
Individual attendance details can be found within the Corporate Governance Report.
The committees terms of reference are available on the companys website www.
co. uk : its responsibilities include: determining the specic remuneration of each of the directors and the terms of their service agreements in particular, the term and any notice period : advising on and monitoring all performance-related formulae: administering all aspects of the share based incentive schemes operated by the company from time to time, including noting award levels made outside of the executive director population: reviewing on a continuing basis the companys policy on executive remuneration: having regard, in the performance of the above duties, to the requirements of the Listing Rules and the recommendations set out in the Combined Code annexed to the Listing Rules and any other published guidelines or recommendations regarding the remuneration of directors of listed companies which the committee considers relevant or appropriate: considering and making recommendations to the board concerning disclosure of details of remuneration packages and structures in addition to those required by law or by the UK Listing Authority or the London Stock Exchange: and considering such other matters as may be requested by the board.
Policy on Remuneration of Executive Directors The remuneration policy for executive directors is to offer a remuneration package which will attract and retain the highest calibre of executive and to ensure that individual rewards and incentives are properly aligned with personal performance, the performance of the group, and the interests of shareholders.
A significant proportion of total remuneration is expected each year to be performance related.
This policy is expected to continue in future years.
The remuneration arrangements include basic salary and benets, performance related bonus, long term incentives and pension rights.
The main elements are: i Basic salary and benets The level of basic salary and benets is determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account the performance of the individual and advice and information from independent sources on the rates of salary for similar positions.
Individual salaries of executive directors are reviewed annually by the committee to maintain appropriate relativities within the executive director population and within a general policy that base salary levels are set with regard to market median level in relation to similar sized UK listed businesses and considering other elements of the package.
co. uk 19 In reviewing salaries for the year ended 31 March 2008 the Remuneration Committee took into consideration two distinct comparator groups comprising companies of comparable i turnover and ii market capitalisation.
This data was considered in light of the general policy described above and the revised salaries were set by the Remuneration Committee mindful of i turnover being a more appropriate proxy for the size and complexity of the company than market capitalisation: ii the increased plc board experience of individual directors: iii the need to retain high performing directors: iv the rebalancing of salaries in line with the responsibilities of the executive directors: and v the need to reward the executive directors in light of their unique working relationships.
Benets normally include the provision of a car, fuel, private medical insurance, permanent health insurance and home telephone costs.
ii Performance related bonus Executive Directors each receive an annual performance related bonus which in the past has been up to 60% of basic salary and these payments are largely dependent on achievement of profit targets.
The targets are set at levels which are challenging in relation to budgets which would produce significant growth.
The Committee reviewed the annual bonus arrangements during the year, both in terms of quantum and structure, in light of current market practice and the overall competitiveness of the package.
It was agreed to increase the maximum bonus to 100% of basic salary, in line with wider FTSE 250 market practice where 100% of salary maximum bonus potential has become standard practice.
In terms of the targets set, bonus awards are based on the achievement of budgeted profit up to 60% of basic salary and on the achievement of a number of appropriate key criteria.
In terms of the revised targets, a more challenging range of targets was set for the year ended 31 March 2008 in light of the increase in bonus potential and will again be applied in the year ending 31 March 2009 commensurate with the increased bonus potential.
In calibrating the revised targets the Remuneration Committee was mindful of recent performance delivered and the competitive pressures to retain and motivate the successful management team.
Indeed, with this in mind, it was felt appropriate to apply the revised performance targets to the year ended 31 March 2007 for the Chief Executive and Chief Operating officer together with the increased bonus potential of 100% of base salary.
This decision was taken by the Remuneration Committee due to i the performance delivered in year ended 31 March 2007 which signicantly exceeded the top end of the original range of performance targets set and ii the successful integration of a number of newly acquired businesses.
Details of bonus payouts for the year ended 31 March 2007 are set out on page 23.
The revised bonus maximum and performance conditions applied to all other Executive Directors for the first time in the year ended 31 March 2008. iii Share option Executive directors have a continuing interest in share options previously granted as detailed below, however no options have been granted during the year and it is not the Remuneration Committees intention to make further share option awards.
iv Performance Share Plan PSP The Remuneration Committee reviews the long term incentives offered to executive directors on an ongoing basis to ensure they remain appropriate given the current needs of the business and wider best practice investor guidelines.
As a result of a review in early 2006, the Committee recommended the introduction of a new Performance Share Plan PSP to operate as the sole type of long term incentive arrangements for executive directors in future years.
The PSP was approved by shareholders at the 2006 annual general meeting.
Details of the PSP are set out below: Maximum award limit Executive directors and senior managers are eligible to receive conditional awards of Performance Shares up to a value of 150% of salary in any year.
In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment, awards may be up to 200% of salary.
Performance conditions There are two distinct performance conditions that apply to awards made under the PSP.
Half of any award is subject to the growth in the companys normalised earnings per share EPS growth in excess of RPI.
The remaining half of an award will be subject to the relative total shareholder return TSR of the company compared against the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding Investment Trusts.
The performance conditions were reviewed by the committee during the year in line with best practice guidelines and with advice from Hewitt New Bridge Street to ensure they reect the companys prospects and circumstances.
Factors that were considered included managements earnings forecasts, growth potential for the sector and the economy as a whole, and external brokers forecasts.
20 For awards made in year ending 31 March 2008, awards will vest on the third anniversary of grant, dependent upon the achievement of the following performance criteria over the three financial years 2007 08, 2008 09 and 2009 10: EPS growth of the company over Vesting percentage of 50% of the shares the performance period subject to an award 11111111 Less than RPI 10% 0% RPI 10% 30% RPI 21% 100% Between RPI 10% and RPI 21% Between 30% and 100% pro rata on a straight-line basis TSR ranking of the company compared to the Vesting percentage of 50% of the shares comparator group over the performance period subject to an award 11111111 Below median ranking 0% Median ranking 30% Upper quartile ranking 100% Between median and upper quartile ranking Between 30% and 100% pro rata on a straight-line basis EPS and TSR remain the most appropriate measures of the groups long-term performance.
EPS is the key internal metric through which financial performance is measured and TSR is aligned with shareholders and the objective of generating long term sustainable returns to shareholders.
To determine whether the performance targets have actually been met at the end of the three year performance period, the EPS targets will be calculated by the company and veried by the Remuneration Committee.
TSR calculations will be performed by the Committees advisors and veried by the Remuneration Committee.
v Shareholding guidelines At the same time as introducing the PSP the Remuneration Committee introduced share ownership guidelines.
Executive directors are expected to retain no fewer than 50% of any shares delivered under the PSP net of taxes until such time as a shareholding equivalent to 100% of their base salary has been achieved.
vi Pension rights Generally, the policy for executive directors pension arrangements is to offer a contribution towards the executives pension arrangement.
During the year the company has contributed 20% of Mr P E Jollys basic salary into his SIPP.
From the date of his appointment as an executive director the company provides 12% of Mr C D Hintons basic salary for contribution into his SIPP.
The other executive directors have historically participated in the companys dened benefit pension arrangement the Findel Group Pension Fund the Fund which targeted a pension of up to two-thirds of final pensionable earnings at a normal retirement age of either 60 or 65.
Mr D B Dutton remained a contributory member of the Fund until his retirement on 30 September 2007.
Pensionable earnings for Mr Dutton were dened as one third of the aggregate of his basic salary paid in the three years prior to retirement.
From May 2007 Dr Bolton is no longer a member of the Fund having elected to take a transfer value out of the Scheme.
He accrued no pension benets during the year.
While Mr Maudsley remains a member of the Fund, he no longer accrues benets under the pension Scheme, instead electing to receive a cash equivalent contribution into a personal pension arrangement.
The value of contributions made during the year was 79,095.
Mr K Chapman is no longer a member of the Fund but receives a contribution to his personal arrangement in lieu of the value of pension benets.
The amount during the year was 64,833.
The contributions to personal pension arrangements are cost neutral or lower from the companys perspective when compared to the cost of providing benets under the dened benefit scheme.
co. uk 21 Performance Graph The following graph contrasts the total shareholder return of the company calculated in accordance with The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2003 with the FTSE 350 General Retailers Index.
This index was selected as being, in the opinion of the committee, the most appropriate for comparison because the group is a member of the FTSE 350.
Findel plc 5-year total return v total return of FTSE 350 General Retailers Index 3 month rolling average 180 Findel Total Return Indexed FTSE 350 General Retailers Total Return 160 Indexed 140 120 100 80 60 40 y e March 2004 y e March 2005 y e March 2006 y e March 2007 y e March 2008 Source: Datastream Service Agreements It continues to be the Remuneration Committees policy that service agreements for executive directors should be terminable on not more than 12 months notice, in line with current market practice.
In the event of early termination of a service agreement, the committee would consider appropriate use of mitigation and phased compensation payments.
Mr Chapmans service agreement is terminable subject to 1 years notice by either party.
It was entered into on 12 June 1989 and has been subsequently varied, most recently with effect from 1 April 2003.
On a change of control as dened in his contract, the company is deemed to have automatically given notice of termination of the service agreement.
Mr Chapman would, therefore, be entitled to a damages payment of 1 times current base salary together with an amount equal to the average of benets in kind and bonus payable over each of the three previous years.
The board would also use such discretions as it may have to allow Mr Chapman to exercise any outstanding share options.
Dr Boltons service agreement is terminable subject to 1 years notice by either party.
Dr Bolton would, therefore, be entitled to a damages payment of 1 times current base salary together with an amount equal to the average of benets in kind and bonus payable over each of the three previous years.
Mr Maudsleys service agreement is terminable subject to 1 years notice by either party.
It was entered into on 6 October 1997.
The contract contains no provision for compensation to be payable on early termination.
In determining any compensation payable on early termination, the Committee will take into account the directors duty to mitigate.
Mr Jollys service agreement was entered into on 11 May 2006.
It is terminable subject to 1 years notice by either party: it contains no provision for compensation to be payable on early termination.
Mr Hintons service agreement was entered into on 21 February 2007.
22 000s Mr Duttons service agreement was terminable subject to 1 years notice by either party.
It was entered into on 20 September 1991 and was subsequently varied on 31 August 2001.
