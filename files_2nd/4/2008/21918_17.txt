As the Board of Directors is comprised solely of non-executive Directors, it is exempt under the Listing Rules from appointing a Remuneration Committee.
The determination of Directors fees is a matter dealt with by the whole Board.
It is the Companys policy to determine the level of Directors fees having regard to the level of fees payable to nonexecutive Directors in the industry generally, the role that individual Directors fulfill in respect of Board and Committee responsibilities and the time committed to the Companys affairs.
The Directors attendance at meetings is given on page 21.
Following a review in March 2007, the basic annual fees paid to the Chairman and each Director were increased to 27,000 and 18,000 respectively from 1 October 2006, with the chairman of the Audit Committee receiving an additional 3,000 for the extra work involved.
The annual aggregate limit on fees payable to the Board of Directors under the Companys Articles of Association is currently 150,000 but will be increased to 200,000 if the proposed new Articles of Association are adopted at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
No element of the Directors remuneration is performance related, no Director past or present has any entitlement to pensions and the Company has not awarded any share options or long-term performance incentives to any of the Directors.
The Directors interests in contractual arrangements with the Company are as shown on page 23.
Subject to these exceptions, no other Directors were interested in contracts with the Company during the period or subsequently.
None of the Directors has a service contract with the Company and no Director is entitled to compensation on leaving office.
The Board requires that Directors shall not remain in office for longer than three years without submitting themselves for re-election.
A resolution to receive and adopt the Directors Remuneration Report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Directors and Officers liability insurance cover is maintained by the Company on behalf of the Directors.
