the directors shares and options can be found in the Dilution limits Companys register of directors interests.
The Groups existing share plans contain various limits which Unless indicated otherwise, the foreign exchange rates used in govern the amount of awards that may be granted and also the this directors remuneration report are based on the average amount of shares which may be issued to satisfy any subsequent rates throughout the relevant financial year.
The rates are exercise of awards.
These limits, which are monitored, are in 1:$1.8377 2008 and 1:$2.0054 2007. line with those stated in the Association of British Insurers corporate guidelines.
Under the terms of the Companys listing on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, there is an additional limit which provides that awards under any plan cannot be granted whether to be satisfied through the issue of new shares or market purchased shares which would cause the total number of shares under option all schemes to exceed ten per cent of issued share capital at that time.
Vesting provisions on a change of control The rules of the PSP do not provide for automatic vesting in the event of a change in control.
However, the rules do provide that the number of shares subject to the award be pro-rated, based on the length of the shortened performance period.
The committee may at its discretion, and acting fairly and reasonably, determine the extent to which awards vest having regard for the performance of the Group in the period since the date of grant.
Rights issue On 24 November 2008, the Group announced details of a rights issue in participating countries see further details on page 69.
As a result of the rights issue, the board agreed to make adjustments to all unexercised share options and share awards granted under the Groups Employee Share Schemes.
The basis of the adjustments was the theoretical ex-rights price methodology, which was considered the most appropriate to take into account the impact of the rights issue.
The adjustments under certain plans were approved by the relevant tax authorities, where necessary.
Mr Bertamini and Mr DeNoma carried out their duties overseas and had their remuneration adjusted to take local living costs into account.
This adjustment was to put them in a position, after taxation differentials, where they would be no worse off as a result of carrying out their duties overseas.
The benets column for these directors also includes additional benets, such as allowances for working overseas, the provision of accommodation or education of children.
For Mr Bertamini and Mr DeNoma, these allowances and benets amounted to $461,878 2007: n a and $2,883,919 2007: $1,233,100 respectively.
In line with the Groups international mobility policy Mr DeNoma was tax equalised for those cash benets which have been paid through payroll and for employee share scheme exercises made in 2008, which amounted to a total of $381,481.

c The amounts shown in the 2008 deferred shares column includes, rstly, the standard proportion of the annual performance award deferred into restricted shares, under the 2006 Restricted Share Scheme and, secondly, an additional portion that the directors indicated to the committee they wished to defer voluntarily into the Deferred Bonus Plan.
The amounts of the additional deferral into the Deferred Bonus Plan for each director are as follows: Mr Sands $697,000, Mr Bertamini $266,000, Mr Bullock $279,500 and Mr Meddings $355,000.
