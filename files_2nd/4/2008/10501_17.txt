Advisors During the year, the Remuneration Committee received advice from MM&K Limited, who are independent remuneration consultants, in connection with remuneration matters including market comparison salary benchmarking data and best practice, and the development of the Groups performance related remuneration policy.
MM&K Limited has no other connection or relationship with the Group.
MM&K Limited provided no other services to the Group during the financial year ended 31 December 2008.
Remuneration policy and objectives The remuneration policy with respect to the Executive Directors has been designed to provide market competitive remuneration relative to UK listed companies of similar size and scope.
The principal objective of the remuneration policy is to provide market competitive levels of remuneration in a form and amount necessary to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors of appropriate calibre and experience which is essential to the future success of the Group.
The importance of aligning the interests of the Executive Directors with the creation of shareholder value over both the short term and long term is key to this objective.
The Remuneration Committee believes that this requires: The provision of mid-market base salaries with appropriate leverage to reward sustained exceptional performance provided stretching and demanding performance conditions are met.
A reward structure that places an appropriate emphasis on short term and long term performance to support operating performance and to reward sustained longer term performance.
The Company believes that in order to meet its remuneration objectives, the remuneration of Executive Directors should comprise a balance between fixed and variable performance related pay elements with a significant proportion of potential total remuneration comprising performance related elements.
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the remuneration policy to ensure it is sufficiently flexible to take account of future changes in the Groups business operations and environment, and recognises key developments in remuneration practice and alignment to shareholders interests.
Consequently, the policy set out in this report has applied during 2008 and will apply in 2009.
In determining the remuneration arrangements of the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committee is sensitive to the pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group, especially when determining base salary increases.
com Group PLC Annual Report 2008 Components of remuneration The potential components of the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors consist of a number of separate elements, namely base salary, a performance related bonus, pension contributions, car allowance, Long Term Incentive Plan, Share Option Scheme and Share Incentive Plan.
In addition, Paul Doughty is to participate in the Simon Nixon Scheme which is described further on page 50.
Base salary The base salary positions the role and the individual fairly within a competitive market range derived from a peer group of UK listed companies.
Salaries for the Executive Directors are reviewed annually to take account of market movement, individual contribution and increases elsewhere in the Group.
Performance related bonus Targets were approved by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of 2008 and were aligned to internal targets, strategic business objectives for 2008 and to shareholders interests.
Target bonuses were payable for the achievement of performance measures based on adjusted EBITDA set at appropriately stretching levels combined with the achievement of certain objectives based on a balanced scorecard approach.
Up to 125% of base salary for Simon Nixon and 100% of base salary for Paul Doughty were payable for the achievement of target performance.
For the achievement of performance greater than target, the bonus amounts increased on a straight line basis according to a set formula.
In the financial year ended 31 December 2008, Simon Nixon earned a bonus of 40% of base salary and Paul Doughty earned a bonus of 33% of base salary.
Following a review of incentive arrangements, the Remuneration Committee has decided that the same overall structure as applied in 2008 should continue in 2009.
Target bonuses will be paid for the achievement of performance measures based on adjusted EBITDA set at appropriately stretching levels combined with the achievement of certain objectives based on a balanced scorecard approach.
Up to 125% of base salary for Peter Plumb and 100% of base salary for each of Paul Doughty, Graham Donoghue and David Osborne will be payable for the achievement of target performance.
For the achievement of performance greater than target, the bonus amounts will increase on a straight line basis according to a set formula.
Simon Nixon will not participate in the Groups performance related bonus scheme in 2009.
Pension contributions The Company operates a contributory money purchase pension scheme for the benefit of the Executive Directors.
In all cases, base salary only is pensionable.
During the financial year ended 31 December 2008, the Company matched pension contributions up to 1% of base salary for the benefit of the Executive Directors.
In 2009 the Company will match pension contributions up to 8% of base salary for the benefit of the Executive Directors.
Car allowance In 2008, the Company provided a car allowance of 7,200 per annum for each of the Executive Directors.
From 1 January 2009, the Company provides a car allowance of 14,000 per annum for each of the Executive Directors.
The amount of the car allowance is reviewed annually.
Long Term Incentive Plan Conditional free share awards are made by Appleby Trust Jersey Limited, as trustee of the Companys Employee Benefit Trust, following recommendations made by the Board.
The levels of award and the performance conditions are recommended and reviewed by the Remuneration Committee annually.
The awards normally vest at the end of a three year period, subject to the achievement of the performance conditions and continued employment.
Awards lapse to the extent that the performance conditions are not achieved.
The maximum award that can be made to an employee in any financial year is the equivalent of 200% of an employees annual base salary, calculated on the basis of the market price of the Companys shares at the date of grant.
In the financial year ended 31 December 2008, awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan were made to one employee of the Group and were made over shares worth 55% of that employees annual base salary.
No awards were made to the Executive Directors in the year.
For 100% of the award to vest, the Company must achieve at least 100% of its cumulative adjusted EBITDA target for the financial years 2008 to 2010 inclusive.
Vesting starts at 50% of the award for achievement of 90% of the cumulative adjusted EBITDA target and increases on a straight line basis up to achievement of 100% of the target.
No award will vest for performance below 90% of the target.
The Remuneration Committee chose a cumulative adjusted EBITDA target as the performance target for this award under the Long Term Incentive Plan as this measure is aligned to internal growth targets and shareholders interests.
The Remuneration Committee will meet once the results for the three year plan period are available to ascertain whether the performance conditions have been satisfied as determined by the audited financial results of the Company and its subsidiaries for the financial years 2008 to 2010 inclusive.
The Remuneration Committee has decided for 2009 to revise the performance targets of the Long Term Incentive Plan.
As a result, performance targets will be based on a combination of an adjusted EBITDA target and total shareholder return relative to a selected peer group of companies.
The Remuneration Committee has chosen this combination of targets to provide closer alignment of the Long Term Incentive Plan with underlying Group financial performance and shareholder interests.
