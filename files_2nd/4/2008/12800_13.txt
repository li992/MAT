Governance continued Report on Directors remuneration Opening statement from the Chairman of the Board Remuneration Committee The Committees role is to govern Executive Directors remuneration and to ensure that the Companys reward strategy helps to drive business performance and shareholder value.
All the Committee members are independent Non-executive Directors, or in the case of Peter Cawdron, is Chairman of the Board, and was considered independent on his appointment to that position.
The Committee is committed to clear disclosure of Directors remuneration to shareholders: this report details the individual remuneration of Board Directors and explains the principles and policies that the Committee has applied.
The following points provide important context for the Report on Directors remuneration: The remuneration policies are designed to ensure that a majority of the total reward package is dependent on business performance.
This is clearly reflected in the remuneration for Executive Directors in 2008.
Financial results for the current period are lower than the prior period.
The Companys share price has also ended the period substantially lower than the period ended 18 August 2007.
These financial results and the Companys share price performance have had a marked effect on remuneration: thus demonstrating the strong connection between performance and reward for the Companys Executive Directors: Executive Directors have received no annual bonuses for the current financial period.
The long term incentive awards scheduled to vest in November 2008 have not met their performance conditions and have therefore lapsed.
This demonstrates the strong connection between performance and reward for the Companys Executive Directors.
The Committee unanimously recommends that shareholders vote to approve the Remuneration Report.
Fritz Ternofsky Remuneration Committee Chairman 34 www.
com Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, the Regulations.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has complied with the provisions of the Combined Code the Code relating to remuneration matters.
The report is divided into two parts.
The first part contains the commentary of remuneration policy, which is not required to be audited.
The second part contains the remuneration tables that have been audited in accordance with the relevant statutory requirements.
Unaudited information The Remuneration Committee The Committee members are: Fritz Ternofsky Chairman Mike Foster Peter Cawdron They are all independent, Non-executive Directors, or in the case of Peter Cawdron, was independent on his appointment as Chairman of Punch Taverns plc.
The Committee members have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided, and there are no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee determines the remuneration packages of Executive Directors and any changes to their service contracts, as well as the remuneration of other senior executives.
The Committee also governs any annual bonus plans, long term incentives and employee share plans.
The Committees terms of reference are available on the Companys website.
Advisers to the Committee The Committee received independent remuneration advice from Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS, part of Hewitt Associates Ltd.
This independent adviser was appointed by the Committee and accountable to it.
Hewitt Associates also provides consulting advice to the Company in respect of its Spirit pension schemes and actuarial, investment and other advice to the trustee of the two Spirit pension schemes.
The Committee does not believe that the independence of its adviser is compromised by these other appointments.
Halliwell Consulting provides administration services connected to the Companys Executive and all-employee share plans.
The Committee also consults with the Chief Executive, the Company Secretary and Group Director of Human Resources.
However, no executive is permitted to participate in discussions about their personal remuneration.
The Committee met four times during the course of the year.
Remuneration policy The Committees reward policy is designed to drive business performance and maximise shareholder value.
It is based on the following principles: that remuneration should be viewed holistically Total Reward, taking account of all reward elements: that Total Reward should be set at a market competitive level to retain and recruit people of the required talent and experience: that the package should be structured to allow the majority of Total Reward to be dependent on performance: that Total Reward liabilities and costs should be monitored and controlled: and, that Total Reward should support the creation of shareholder value.

The maximum annual bonus is 150% of base salary.
The bonus opportunity is targeted at the upper quartile level, whilst base salary is targeted in a range of lower quartile to median and pension is limited to the lower quartile.
The maximum bonus of 150% of base salary is only payable if both individual and Company performance is outstanding.
The Committee may award a portion of the annual bonus in shares that must be retained for at least two years, and there will be no matching opportunity on these shares.
Long term incentives Policy: maximum long term incentive should be upper quartile, for upper quartile performance Punch Taverns plc Long Term Incentive Plan 2008 This new LTIP was approved by shareholders in January 2008.
Awards made during the 2007 2008 financial year under this LTIP have the following features: performance shares: performance conditions are 50% relative Total Shareholder Return TSR and 50% Earnings Per Share EPS growth: maximum award size of 200% of base salary face value : and performance and vesting periods are normally three years.
TSR is measured relative to a peer group of 39 other UK companies in the same band of market capitalisation as Punch Taverns.
These are 20 companies ranked in size immediately above the Company and the 19 companies ranked in size immediately below the Company.
The base TSR and end TSR are averaged over a three-month period to smooth the effect of unusual price movements.
The table below shows the vesting scale for the TSR-related element of the award: Punch Taverns plc ranking against comparator group Percentage vesting of the part of the award at the end of the performance period subject to the TSR performance condition 1 Upper quartile ranked 10th or higher 100% 1 Median ranked 20th 25% Below median ranked lower than 20th 0% 1 straight line vesting between points.
EPS is measured relative to the change in the Retail Prices Index RPI, on the vesting scale shown in the table below: Punch Taverns plc annualised EPS growth rate, compared to the Percentage vesting of the part of annualised percentage change in the Retail Prices Index RPI the award subject to the EPS condition 1 RPI 8% or more 100% 1 RPI 3% 25% Less than RPI 3% 0% 1 straight line vesting between points.
These two metrics relative TSR and EPS growth, were selected by the Committee as they are important measures of the value delivered to shareholders.
The Committee has the discretion not to allow vesting of either or both elements of any LTIP award, if, in its opinion, either the Companys underlying financial performance or TSR or both has been unsatisfactory during the performance period.
There is no re-testing of performance: if performance conditions are not met, awards lapse.

Spirit Value Growth Plan SVGP A specific long term incentive plan was approved by the Committee for Mike Tye, Managing Director Spirit, in June 2008.
This was implemented in accordance with Listing Rule 9.4.
2, to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment and retention of an individual Director.
These circumstances were the need to provide a renewed focus on the performance of the Spirit business.
The SVGP is intended to provide a direct alignment between the value growth of the Spirit business and the remuneration of Mike Tye, to assist in driving the performance of this business and its value to shareholders.
The SVGP has the following features: limited to one individual Executive Director: linked to the value growth of the Spirit business, as determined by an independent valuation, and valued as an OpCo, whereby all the Spirit pubs are deemed to be leased from a separate entity: the initial measurement period is the three financial years from August 2008: payment from the Plan is 7.5% of the amount of value growth above a hurdle: the hurdle is 6% compound annual growth per annum: payments from the Plan are in non-pensionable cash, and are phased: 60% after the August 2011 year-end, and the remaining 40% after the August 2012 year end: the participant is not eligible for payments if he resigns or is dismissed for misconduct: and in the event of leaving for good reason with the approval of the Board, or in the event of a change of control of Spirit or of Punch Taverns plc, the participant may be eligible for part of the award, pro-rata to the portion of the performance period that has expired and subject to the performance hurdle.
The table below provides an illustration of potential payment from the SVGP: Incremental value growth s Payment from over three years the plan Compound annual value growth is 6% per annum 65m None Compound annual value growth is 8% per annum 88m 1.7m Compound annual value growth is 10% per annum 112m 3.6m The Remuneration Committee may amend the Plan at any time provided that no alteration to the advantage of the participant shall be made to the provisions concerning the basis for determining the particpants entitlement to, and the terms of, cash provided under the Plan, without prior approval of shareholders.
The Committee may, without prior shareholder approval, amend the performance condition applying to the award if an event has occurred which causes the Committee, acting fairly and reasonably, to consider that it would be appropriate to amend the performance condition.
The Committee may also make minor amendments to benefit the administration of the Plan or take account of changes to tax, legal or regulatory treatment.
Punch Taverns plc Share Bonus Plan This Plan was approved by shareholders in January 2008, to replace the previous Deferred Share Bonus DSB plan.
The new Plan enables the Remuneration Committee to award part or all of any annual bonus in the form of Punch Taverns plc shares, which the recipient is not permitted to sell during a restricted period normally two years.
As no annual bonus awards have been made to Executive Directors in respect of the 2007 2008 year, Executive Directors have therefore not received any awards under this Plan.
com Dilution In accordance with shareholder guidelines, the Committee applies a limit on the amount of shares than can be issued to satisfy all its employee share plan awards of 10% of the Companys issued share capital in any rolling 10 year period.
Of this 10%, only 5% can be issued to satisfy awards under the discretionary plans that apply to executives and senior managers only.
The current position against these limits is shown below.
It should be noted that the figures below exclude 3.19% of dilution relating to options granted prior to the Companys flotation in May 2002 and therefore not subject to the ABI guidelines.
Additional dilution during the 2007 2008 financial year Limit Current dilution level included in the previous column 10% in ten years 2.17% 0.72% 5% in ten years 1.80% 0.64% Shareholding requirement The Committee requires that all individuals who participate in the Companys LTIP satisfy a minimum shareholding requirement.
The table below shows the shareholding requirement for Executive Directors, and their current personal shareholding: Shareholding Current actual requirement To be shareholding Name Position % of base salary achieved by % of base salary Giles Thorley Chief Executive 200% August 2009 159% Phil Dutton Finance Director 150% August 2012 24% Jonathan Paveley Group Commercial Director 150% August 2009 27% Roger Whiteside Managing Director Leased 150% August 2013 0% Mike Tye Managing Director Spirit 150% August 2013 0% The original target date set in 2004 for achieving shareholding targets was 2009, but for those Directors who have recently joined the Board a period of five years from joining has been set.
This target is set to encourage Directors to retain shares received from share related incentive schemes rather than to create a requirement to make market purchases for cash.
The situation will be reviewed following August 2009.
Pension Policy: lower quartile Executive Directors are entitled to receive a defined contribution to pension from the Company of between 12% and 12.5% of base salary.
None of the Executive Directors is accruing benefits under a defined benefit pension plan.
Benefits Policy: consistent with general market practice The Companys policy is to provide Executive Directors with a market competitive level of benefits, including company car or car allowance, private medical insurance, lump sum life insurance for death-in-service, and income protection insurance for long term disability.
Total compensation Policy: upper quartile but with at least two-thirds of total compensation subject to performance The Committees policy is that Executive Directors should have the opportunity to earn upper quartile total compensation for upper quartile performance.
The table below shows total compensation for the Companys current Executive Directors: Approximate 2007 2008 market upper total actual quartile total 1 2 Name Position compensation compensation Giles Thorley Chief Executive 632,000 1,630,000 Phil Dutton Finance Director 419,000 1,028,000 Jonathan Paveley Group Commercial Director 339,000 990,000 Mike Tye Managing Director Spirit 407,000 990,000 1 2007 2008 total actual compensation is the sum of: base salary, actual bonus, value of LTIP vested following year-end, Company pension contribution and other benefits.

intended to operate the Plan in the future.
Directors contracts The policy on termination is that the Group does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations.
In addition, Executive Directors will be expected to mitigate their loss.
The Remuneration Committee ensures that there have been no unjustified payments for failure.
None of the Executive Directors contracts provides for liquidated damages.
There are no special provisions contained in any of the Executive Directors contracts which provide for longer periods of notice on a change of control of the Company.
Further, there are no special provisions providing for additional compensation on an Executive Directors cessation of employment with the Group.

com Non-executive Directors fees Policy: median level fees All Non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board based upon recommendations from the Chairman and Chief Executive or, in the case of the Chairman, is determined by the Remuneration Committee based on recommendations from the Senior Independent Non-executive Director and the Chief Executive within the limits set by the Articles of Association and based on the median level of fees payable to peers in the same comparator group as that used for Executive Directors remuneration.
Non-executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Companys share incentive schemes or performance based plans and are not eligible to join any of the Groups pension schemes.
It is the Boards policy to take into account the following factors in determining the fees of the Non-executive Directors: the median level of fees for similar positions in the comparator group: and the time commitment each Non-executive Director makes to the Group through membership of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees.
The following table sets out the Non-executive fees for 2007 2008 and the fees for 2008 2009: 2007 2008 2008 2009 Basic fee 42,000 42,000 Senior Independent Non-executive Director 45,000 45,000 Additional fees for chairing the Audit or Remuneration Committee 10,000 10,000 Additional fees for chairing the Nominations Committee 5,000 5,000 The fee paid to Peter Cawdron, Chairman of the Company, for 2008 2009 will be 155,000 p. a.
2007 2008: 155,000 p. a.. Total shareholder return performance graph The graph shows the Companys performance, measured by total shareholder return TSR, compared with the FTSE 350 Travel and Leisure Index and FTSE 100 Index.
The Remuneration Committee considers these to be relevant indices for TSR comparison as the Travel and Leisure Index members represent a range of UK quoted leisure companies, and the FTSE 100 is the index of the 100 largest UK companies by market capitalisation.
500 400 300 200 100 Punch Taverns FTSE 350 Travel & Leisure Index FTSE 100 Index 0 The graph shows the value, at 23 August 2008, of 100 invested in Punch Taverns plc on 24 August 2003, compared with the value of 100 invested in the FTSE 350 Travel and Leisure Index and 100 invested in the FTSE 100 Index, for the same period.
The other points plotted are the values at intervening financial year ends.
The graph shows that at the end of the 2007 2008 financial year, a hypothetical 100 invested in Punch Taverns plc on 24 August 2003 would be worth 100.50, compared with a value of 159 if invested in the FTSE 350 Travel and Leisure Index, and 155 if invested in the FTSE 100 Index, for the same period.
