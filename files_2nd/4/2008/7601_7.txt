a n n u a l r e p o r t & a c c o u n t s 2008 The Remuneration Committees Report Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee of the Board the Committee, which met five times in 2008, comprises the nonexecutive Directors of the Company.
George Helland chairman, Iain Paterson and Hector McFadyen all served throughout the year.
The Committee is responsible for determining in particular the remuneration of the Chairman and executive Directors, including the setting of annual performance targets and participation in the executive share option plans.
During the year Hewitt New Bridge Street, who were appointed by the Committee, provided advice and assistance on Directors remuneration, executive incentive plans and share scheme matters.
The Company also received advice on various remuneration matters during the year from Buck Consultants Limited.
The Board determines fees payable to the non-executive Directors who do not participate in the Groups share plans or receive any other benefits.
The constitution and operation of the Committee during the year has complied with the Combined Codes guidance on Directors remuneration, except for the recommended period of notice for executive Directors.
Terry Gomke, who was a Director of the Company until he stepped down from the Board on 12 December 2008, had a service contract with a two year notice period.
From 12 December 2008, the Company is compliant with the Codes recommended period of notice for executive Directors.
Remuneration Policy The Companys policy on remuneration aims to ensure that the individual rewards and incentives are competitive and appropriate to attract, motivate and retain executives of high ability, experience and commitment.
The executive Directors remuneration packages consist of an annual salary, health cover, and where appropriate, car and fuel benefits, life and disability insurance, an annual performance linked cash bonus plan, pension contributions, participation in performance-linked share plans and a performance-linked long term incentive plan.
Performance targets are established to achieve consistency with the interests of shareholders with an appropriate balance between long and short-term goals.
Basic salaries are reviewed annually.
In considering appropriate salary levels, the Committee takes into account the remuneration paid by comparable companies in terms of asset size, revenues, profits, the number of employees, market capitalisation and the complexity and international spread of the Groups operations as well as applicable rates of inflation.
The Companys practice is to target basic salaries at the mid-market level in the appropriate market for the executive position.
In determining executive salaries consideration is given to their experience and general performance level.
The Company operates an executive share option scheme to provide longer term incentives for executives and executive Directors.
This reflects market practice, provides longer term focus and aligns the interests of executives and shareholders.
The award of options under the scheme are performance related and are principally aligned to the basic salary of the Director.
The right to exercise an option is subject to the growth performance of the Companys basic earnings per share BEPS over a three year period in comparison to that of comparator companies, who comprise UK, US and Canadian oil and gas services companies.
No shares are exercisable if the growth in BEPS does not exceed the rate of inflation by at least 3% per annum over the three year period.
The number of shares exercisable, expressed as a percentage, by a Director can range from nil if the Companys performance is below the median level, to 40% at the median level and up to 100% if the Companys performance is between the median and upper quartile levels of the comparator group.
24 a n n u a l r e p o r t & a c c o u n t s 2008 The Remuneration Committees Report continued The Remuneration Committee believes that the executive share option scheme no longer serves the best interests of the Company and is seeking approval for a replacement Performance Share Plan PSP at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 22 April 2009.
The Committee is of the view that the use of share options and their associated volatility is not appropriate for the Company going forward while a PSP will more closely align Executive Directors with shareholders as well as being consistent with FTSE 250 market practice.
Full details on the PSP are provided in the 2009 Notice of Annual General Meeting.
In brief, under the PSP, awards will be made to executives and Directors that vest subject to total shareholder return TSR performance over the three year period relative to the Dow Jones US Oil Equipment and Services sector index and the DJ STOXX TM Oil Equipment and Services sector index.
The maximum total market value of shares over which awards may be granted in 2009 for Dennis Proctor and Peter Rose, expressed as a percentage of their annual salary, is 40% and 30% respectively.
These limits represent an equivalent value to prior year Directors awards under the executive share option scheme.
Best practices will be followed in respect of the administration of the PSP, including leaver and change in control provisions.
In summary, the Committee believes that the new PSP is an appropriate plan to operate alongside the Long Term Incentive Plan and takes due account of market practice, best practice, and the particular circumstances of the Company.
The Companys Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP is intended to link key executives remuneration to the long-term success and performance of the Group.
The LTIP is a performance-linked plan with an incentive pool which for 2008 is calculated using the sum of the Groups after tax operating income after deducting a charge for the after tax cost of capital at a rate of 7% on average shareholders funds.
The incentive has two components, the first being 2% of the absolute value added, and the second being 5% of the incremental value added.
These performance conditions align the interests of the executives with those of the Group and its shareholders and will only produce value to the participants if value is created for the Group.
Awards are determined for each participant at the beginning of a three-year performance cycle and are settled at the end of each cycle either in shares or in cash.
The award for each participant is calculated as a percentage of the incentive pool resulting from the performance of the business over the performance cycle as determined by the Committee.
At 31 December 2008, the pool available for distribution has decreased from 6,219,577 to 6,183,231 following a decrease in the pool of 36,346.
Following vesting, the amount payable under any single award may not exceed a certain multiple of the basic annual salary of each participant as at the relevant award date.
The maximum award levels under the LTIP rules as a multiple of base salaries are 3.5 times annual salary for the Chief Executive and 1.75 times annual salary for other executive Directors.
As the pool was greater than these maximum levels, the awards were restricted to these multiples.
The aggregate amount of the pool awarded to participants was 5,446,239.
In 2008, an annual performance-linked cash bonus scheme was in place for the executive Directors.
The scheme, which is not pensionable, is designed to provide an incentive and reward for performance and reflects the competitive markets in which the Group conducts its business.
Dennis Proctor and Peter Rose are eligible for a bonus under the scheme when 80% of the Group budgeted pre tax profit is achieved.
Below this level no bonus is payable.
The amount payable under the scheme when performance achieves the budgeted profit before tax and return on capital targets, is 65% of base salary for Dennis Proctor and 50% of base salary for Peter Rose.
When actual results achieve 120% of these performance targets Dennis Proctor and Peter Rose are entitled to a maximum cash bonus of 130% and 100% of base salary respectively.
Richard Hunting has no bonus entitlement and his remuneration and that of the non-executive Directors is wholly non-performance related.
25 a n n u a l r e p o r t & a c c o u n t s 2008 The Remuneration Committees Report continued The current balance between fixed and variable remuneration is approximately 25% deriving from salary and benefits and 75% from variable incentives.
Bonus schemes are also in place for the majority of Group employees.

Directors Service Contracts The Companys policy on executive Directors contracts is to comply with the guidance in the Combined Code.
At 31 December 2008, all executive Directors contracts were in compliance with that guidance.
All the Directors Service Agreements contain standard provisions allowing the Company to terminate summarily for cause, such as gross misconduct.
Dennis Proctor entered into an Employment Agreement with Hunting Energy Services Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, on 7 February 2001.
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA.
Under the terms of the Agreement both Hunting Energy Services Inc and Dennis Proctor are required to give one years notice of termination.
The Agreement contains a pay in lieu of notice clause which provides for payment of base salary, performance bonus and vacation pay based on an annual entitlement of four weeks.
There are special provisions on a change of control.
These provide for payment of one years base salary together with an amount equal to the average performance bonus paid in the previous two years.
In addition, Dennis Proctor would be entitled to continue to participate in the Group insurance programmes for one year following the change of control and, unless otherwise provided in the relevant option agreement, all stock options and stock based awards granted to him will become exercisable at the date of the change of control and will remain exercisable for one year.
26 a n n u a l r e p o r t & a c c o u n t s 2008 The Remuneration Committees Report continued Richard Hunting entered into a Service Agreement with the Company on 15 December 1989.
This was amended effective 1 March 2004 whereby both the Company and the Director are required to give one years notice of termination.
Peter Rose entered into a Service Agreement with the Company on 23 April 2008.
Under the terms of the Service Agreements for Richard Hunting and Peter Rose, both the Company and the Directors are required to give one years notice of termination.
The Company reserves the right to pay them in lieu of notice whether given by the Company or by them.
The payment in lieu comprises salary only for Richard Hunting and salary and bonus only for Peter Rose.
The Company also has the option to put Richard Hunting and Peter Rose on paid leave of absence on payment of a sum equivalent to salary for Richard Hunting and salary and bonus for Peter Rose based on the previous 12 month period, subject to them complying with the terms of their Service Agreement.
These conditions also apply on termination following a change of control.
In addition, Peter Rose would be entitled to an acceleration of all share options and share-based awards, which would become immediately exercisable and remain exercisable for a period of one year following termination.
Non-executive Directors are initially appointed for a fixed term of three years and thereafter, subject to approval of the Board, for a further three year term.
In the event of early termination by the Company non-executive Directors are not entitled to receive compensation for loss of office.
Hector McFadyen was reappointed for a one year term from 4 September 2008.

The retirement age for executive Directors under the Scheme is 60 and provides, subject to HMRC limits, a pension of up to two thirds of final salary.
Pensionable salary is the annual salary less an amount equal to the State Lower Earnings Limit.
Richard Hunting contributed 8.5% of his pensionable salary up until his Scheme retirement date of 31 July 2006.
Peter Rose contributes a similar proportion of his salary to the Scheme.
The Scheme provides all members a lump sum death in service benefit of four times basic salary and a spouses pension of two thirds of the members pension on the members death.
