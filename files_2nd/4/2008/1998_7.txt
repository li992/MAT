The auditors are required to report on the auditable part of this report and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended by the regulations.
The report is therefore divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
The Board has reviewed the Groups compliance with the Combined Code 2006 the Code on remuneration related matters.
It is the opinion of the Board that the Group complied with all remuneration related aspects of the Code during the year.
Part 2 of the regulations Unaudited Information Remuneration Committee The following table sets out the members of the Remuneration Committee, their date of appointment, their role and the number of meetings the Committee had during the year and their respective attendance:- Number of Date of Role in Date of Retirement Meetings 4 %age Name Appointment Committee from Committee attendance Mr Alan Coppin 1 September 2006 Chairman 100% Mrs Victoria Mitchell 1 May 2002 Member 100% Mr John Armitt 1 October 2007 Member 100% 2 meetings since appointment Mr David Howell 25 February 2004 Member 1 October 2007 100% 2 meetings prior to retirement Mr Tony Palmer 1 January 1998 Member 5 September 2007 100% 2 meetings prior to retirement Mr Alan Coppin was appointed Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on 1 August 2007.
Mrs Victoria Mitchell stepped down as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee on becoming Chairman of the Company on 1 August 2007.
The Remuneration Committee of the Board, except the Non-executive Chairman of the Company Mrs Victoria Mitchell, are all Non-executive Directors and independent.
The Remuneration Committee members have no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in matters to be decided, no potential conflicts of interest arising from cross directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Remuneration Committee has formal written terms of reference with the full remit of the Committee role described.
A copy of the terms of reference can be downloaded from the Companys website.
The Remuneration Committee was advised during the year and continues to be advised by Halliwell Consulting, an independent executive compensation and share plan consultancy.
No other services were provided to the Company by Halliwell Consulting during the year.
In determining the Executive Directors remuneration for the year, the Remuneration Committee consulted with the Group Managing Director, Mr A W Pidgley and the Group Finance Director, Mr R C Perrins.
No Director played a part in any discussion about his or her remuneration.
Remuneration Policy Overview The objective of the remuneration policy is to encourage, reward and retain the current Executives.
The Remuneration Committee believes that shareholders interests are best served by remuneration packages having a large emphasis on performance-related pay.
Emphasis on performance should encourage Executives to focus on delivering the business strategy.
It is the opinion of the Remuneration Committee that the policy provides meaningful incentives to Executives and ensures that the appropriate balance between fixed and performance related compensation is maintained.
The Remuneration Committee reviews on an annual basis whether its remuneration policy remains appropriate for the relevant financial year.
Factors taken into account by the Remuneration Committee include: market conditions affecting the Company: the recruitment market in the Companys sector: changing market practice: and changing views of institutional shareholders and their representative bodies.
The Companys current long-term incentive for the Executive Directors is provided through The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004 b Long-Term Incentive Plan see later in the report for full details.
This Plan provided for one grant on its adoption with the release of awards subject to the return to shareholders of 12 per share by 31 January 2011.
Therefore the performance criteria and release schedules were fixed on the date of grant.
However, the Committee does formally review the operation of the Plan on a regular basis to ensure it remains appropriate to the Companys current circumstances and prospects.
At the beginning of the 2007 08 financial year the Committee reviewed the operation of The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004 b Long-Term Incentive Plan the 2004 b LTIP and determined to make the amendments set out on page 37 which were approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of the Company on 5 September 2007.
Governance Governance remuneration committee report 34 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED New Remuneration Policy The Board has recently reviewed the Companys strategy and has determined that it is appropriate to revise the strategy to take into account the strength of the Company and the current opportunities in the market.
Full details of the proposed revisions are set out in the Chairmans Statement on pages 2 to 4.
As a consequence the Remuneration Committee is proposing to adjust the Companys remuneration policy to ensure that it is aligned with the strategy and put these adjustments to shareholders for approval at the 2008 AGM.
Full details of the proposed changes to the Companys remuneration are set out in the Notice of Meeting for the AGM: therefore this report focuses on the policy operated in 2007 08.
Policy for 2007 08 The 2007 08 financial year started on 1 May 2007 and finished on 30 April 2008.
The policy is to set the main elements of the Executive Directors remuneration package against the following quartiles in the Companys comparator group: Base salary Annual bonus potential Pension Benefits in kind Share incentives Upper decile Upper decile Lower quartile to median Market practice Upper decile For the purposes of benchmarking remuneration, the Remuneration Committee used the following comparator group of companies in the year ended 30 April 2008: Company name Amec Plc Bellway Plc Marshalls Plc Taylor Wimpey Plc Balfour Beatty Plc Bovis Homes Group Plc Persimmon Plc Travis Perkins Plc Barratt Developments Plc Carillion Plc Redrow Plc It is the intention of the Remuneration Committee to use the same basis for the comparator group for the year ending 30 April 2009 with the following adjustments to its constituents resulting from corporate activity during the year:- George Wimpey Plc was merged with Taylor Woodrow Plc to form Taylor Wimpey Plc: McAlpine Alfred Plc was acquired by Carillion Plc and is therefore excluded on an ongoing basis.
Balance between Fixed and Variable Performance-based Pay The charts below demonstrate the balance between fixed and variable performance-based pay for each Executive Director for the year ended 30 April 2008:- Mr A W Pidgl Mr A W Pidgle ey y M Mr r R R C C P Pe er rr ri in ns s Gr Group Managing Dir oup Managing Director ector Gr Group Finan oup Financ ce e Dir Director ector Fix Fixed ed Fix Fixed ed c compensation ompensation c co ompensation mpensation 19% 19% 22% 22% Perf Performanc ormance e Perf Performanc ormance e c compensation ompensation c co ompensation mpensation 81% 81% 78% 78% Mr A Car Mr A Care ey y Mr G J Mr G J F Fr ry y Divisional Dir Divisional Director ector Divisional Dir Divisional Director ector Ke Key y Fix Fixed ed Fix Fixed ed Fix Fixed c ed compensation is cal ompensation is calculated as culated as: : c compensation ompensation c compensation ompensation Salary Salary 25% 25% 26% 26% Benefits including pension all Benefits including pension allo ow wa an nc ce e Perf Performanc ormance e P Pe er rf fo or rm ma an nc ce e Perf Performan ormanc ce e c compensation is cal ompensation is calculated as culated as: : c compensation ompensation c compensation ompensation Bonus paid Bonus paid 75% 75% 74% 74% F Fa aiir r v va al lu ue e o of f L LT TIP on gran IP on grant t The Executive Directors hold no external appointments.
The main elements of these packages and the performance conditions are described opposite.
35 Elements of Executive Directors Remuneration Basic Salary Policy: Upper decile Policy It is the policy of the Remuneration Committee that the salaries of the Executive Directors should be set at the upper decile in line with the Committees view that the Company has one of the most experienced Executive teams within the sector.
When determining the salaries of the Executive Directors the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration: the levels of base salary for similar positions with comparable status, responsibility and skills in organisations of broadly similar size and complexity, in particular those companies within the comparator group: the performance of the individual Executive Director: the individual Executive Directors experience and responsibilities: and the pay and conditions throughout the Company.
Year ended 30 April 2008 and year ending 30 April 2009 The Remuneration Committee reviewed the salaries of the Executive Directors in May 2007 and 2008.
The Committee felt that:- taking into account the above criteria: the exceptional absolute and comparative performance of the Company during this challenging period: and the fact that with the exception of the Finance Director, the Executive Directors of the Company have not had a rise in salaries since May 2003: salary rises were appropriate.
In May 2007, increases of between 5% and 7.5% were awarded in respect of the year ended 30 April 2008, however, at that time the Executive Directors believed that the current balance of the remuneration package was appropriate and the salary recommendations were therefore not implemented in the year.
In May 2008, further increases of between 6.25% and 9.75% were awarded in respect of the year ending 30 April 2009, however, in this case the Executive Directors decided, given the prevailing market conditions, not to take the increases in the current financial year.
Therefore, the Executive Directors have not taken cumulative increases of between 11.5% and 18% in respect of these two years.
Salary for the year ending % rise Executive Current Salary 30 April 2009 in salary A W Pidgley 750,000 750,000 0% R C Perrins 350,000 350,000 0% A Carey 405,000 405,000 0% G J Fry 290,000 290,000 0% Annual performance-related bonus Policy: Upper decile bonus potential The policy of the Remuneration Committee is to set the maximum annual bonus potential at the upper decile in relation to the comparator group.
Bonus payments are not pensionable.
General The theoretical maximum bonus available is 300% of salary.
However, the Remuneration Committee will only in very exceptional circumstances, outside the normal operation of the bonus plan for the year in question, consider a bonus payment greater than 200% of salary.
On the occurrence of very exceptional circumstances and prior to any commitment to make a bonus payment, the Remuneration Committee would consult shareholders to obtain their agreement that the circumstances gave rise to the level of bonus payment proposed.
Therefore the effective maximum annual bonus potential is 200% of salary.
Bonus targets are reviewed each year and agreed by the Remuneration Committee.
The performance measures for the Executive Directors bonus plan are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee to ensure that they are appropriate to the current market conditions and position of the Company, so that they continue to remain challenging.
The structure of bonus payments is as follows: Position Percentage cash Percentage Shares Executive Bonus will be paid in cash up to a Any bonus payment above 100% of salary maximum of 100% of salary.
will be invested, net of tax, in shares.
These shares will be retained by the Executives for eighteen months.
Governance Governance remuneration committee report 36 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED Year Ended 30 April 2008 The targets for the year ended 30 April 2008, their level of achievement and the corresponding bonus earned by the Executive Directors are set out in the following tables.
Bonus Potential and Targets for FY2007 08 The following table shows the maximum bonus potential for each of the Executive Directors for the year ended 30 April 2008.
In addition, the table shows the percentage of that maximum bonus potential subject to each performance target for the year ended 30 April 2008:- Bonus targets Executive Maximum annual Cash redemption Annual divisional bonus potential bonus criteria PBT targets % of salary see below for see below for full description full description A W Pidgley 200% 100% R C Perrins 200% 100% A Carey 200% 25% 75% G J Fry 200% 25% 75% The following table shows the maximum potential bonus for each Executive and the bonus earned for the year ended 30 April 2008: Name A W Pidgley R C Perrins A Carey G J Fry Effective maximum bonus potential % of salary 200% 200% 200% 200% 2007 08 Bonus paid 1,500,000 700,000 810,000 580,000 2007 08 Bonus paid as % of salary 200% 200% 200% 200% Bonus Performance Criteria Cash redemption condition This performance condition applies to 100% of the maximum bonus potential for the Group Executive Directors and 25% of the maximum bonus potential for the divisional Executive Directors.
For the financial year ending 30 April 2009, the cash redemption condition requires the return of capital of 2 per Unit.
1 For the year ended 30 April 2008, the cash redemption condition will be met if the dividend lock up tests are satisfied at the end of the relevant financial year six months earlier than required.
If these tests are satisfied it means that the Company is on target to be able to make the redemption payments on the due dates.
If the dividend lock up tests are not achieved at the end of the relevant financial year but the Board is of the view that they will be satisfied in time to make the next redemption payment on the relevant date, this element of the bonus will be accrued and not declared until the redemption payment has been made.
In the highly unlikely event that a bonus is paid but the due redemption payment is not made the share element of the bonus paid shall be forfeited and the cash element paid shall be offset against future bonus entitlements.
In fact the Company actually made the scheduled 30 April 2009 redemption on 4 January 2008, one year ahead of the schedule for B share redemptions.
Therefore as 2007 08 saw the early redemption of the 2009 B share, the Remuneration Committee has agreed the bonus payments set out above in respect of the year ended 30 April 2008.
Divisional PBT performance condition The divisional PBT targets are set at the beginning of the financial year at a level which is challenging taking into account the potential level of bonus payments, the market, development availability and other relevant issues.
The Remuneration Committee confirms that the annual bonus payments set out within this report for the divisional Executive Directors are appropriate taking into account the level of profit achieved and the targets set at the beginning of the year ended 30 April 2008.
Share Incentives Policy: Upper decile Executive Directors The only Executive share incentive plan operated by the Company is The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004 b Long-Term Incentive Plan approved by shareholders at the AGM on 17 September 2004.
The Executive Directors in accordance with the rules of the 2004 b LTIP were granted one award on the adoption of the Plan.
Therefore, no awards have been granted to the Executive Directors during the financial year ended 30 April 2008 under the 2004 b LTIP or any other share based arrangement.
1 The dividend lock up tests are the additional financial ratio tests set out in the Groups banking facilities that must be satisfied for the Company to make a redemption payment.
These tests are more stringent than the ongoing financial covenant tests applicable to the Companys bank facilities.
37 Other Senior Employees of the Company The Companys business is broken down into a number of operating divisions.
The Remuneration Committee in conjunction with the Board has, therefore, implemented both annual and longer term cash based compensation arrangements for other senior employees of the Company linked to the performance of the relevant division for which they work.
Some elements of the cash bonus plans are annual other elements are deferred to ensure long-term consistent delivery by each division.
The Remuneration Committee, in line with best practice, continually reviews with the Board the policy behind the compensation plans at this level in the Company to ensure they remain appropriate to the market and the Companys current circumstances.
It is the view of both the Committee and the Board as a whole that these arrangements are very effective at ensuring the delivery of divisional performance for which these senior employees are responsible.
Both the Remuneration Committee and the Board believe that having senior employees focused on the delivery of divisional results is an excellent way of driving shareholder value.
2004 b LTIP Main Features The Plan provides Executive Directors with rights to receive, at no cost, the shares set out in the table below.
The number of shares awarded under the Plan was determined on 26 October 2004, the date of the Scheme of Arrangement, as 15% of the fully diluted share capital of the Company on adoption of the 2004 b LTIP.
The shares will only be released to the Executive Directors if the Company has returned to shareholders 12 per share by 31 January 2011 i. e. the end of the holding period.
50% of the shares subject to awards will be retained by the Executive Directors for a period of at least 12 months after the date of release, with the balance retained for a period of at least 24 months following release.
The following table sets out the awards made under the 2004 b LTIP to the Executive Directors:- Name Ordinary Shares A W Pidgley 11,371,393 R C Perrins 4,264,272 A Carey 3,553,560 G J Fry 2,132,136 The Remuneration Committees policy is designed to incentivise the Executive Directors to maximise the total return to shareholders.
In the Remuneration Committees opinion this will be achieved by incentivising the Executive Directors to not only ensure that 12 per share is returned to shareholders but also by providing them with a direct share in the residual value of the Company.
As a result, the value of the awards is directly linked to the value of the residual Company following the return and as such there is a close alignment between the interests of the Executive Directors and shareholders, both of whom benefit from a maximum value for the residual part of the Company.
The Remuneration Committee will determine whether the performance condition has been satisfied by ensuring the redemption payments have been made in the allotted time frame.
Amendments to 2004 b LTIP Awards granted under the 2004 b LTIP are released on the expiry of a holding period subject to satisfaction of the performance requirements being the Company returning 12 per Ordinary Shares by 31 January 2011.
The holding period applicable to existing awards expires on 30 January 2011.
The Company amended the Articles of Association to facilitate the Company returning 12 per share earlier than 31 January 2011, therefore the terms of the 2004 b LTIP were amended to enable the release of awards to occur on the earlier of:- i the expiry of the holding period: and ii satisfaction of the performance requirements.
In light of the above, a consequential amendment was made to the retention period applicable to these awards, being the two year period during which a participant must not sell or otherwise dispose of 100% or 50% of the shares released to him other than to meet any tax liability.
The retention period will now run for two years following the release of shares, whether on the expiry of the holding period or earlier on satisfaction of the performance requirements.
In addition, to facilitate the Companys operation of the 2004 b LTIP the Plan was also amended to permit the Remuneration Committee, at its total discretion and if requested by a participant, to settle up to the amount required to meet such participants PAYE and NIC tax liability arising on the release of the awards in cash instead of shares.
The cash payment would be limited to the amount of the tax liability and, if a cash payment is made, the number of shares released would be reduced by the number which would otherwise have been required to be sold on the date of release to meet such tax liability.
In exercising its discretion in this matter which will be at the date the awards are released, the Remuneration Committee, in conjunction with the other members of the Board, will take into account all relevant matters including, inter alia, the financial position and share price of the Company and the prevailing market conditions.
Shareholding Requirement The Company has a shareholding requirement for both Executive and Non-executive Directors.
The following table sets out the shareholding requirement and the actual shareholdings of the Executive Directors as at 30 April 2008: Current shareholding as a % of salary Shareholder requirement as a % of salary Name based on 30 April 2008 share price by the year ending 30 April 2009 Group Managing Director A W Pidgley 2,726% 400% Group Finance Director R C Perrins 244% 200% Divisional Director A Carey 994% 200% Divisional Director G J Fry 630% 200% Governance Governance remuneration committee report 38 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED The following table sets out the shareholding requirement and the actual shareholdings of the Non-executive Directors as at 30 April 2008: Shareholding requirement to be built up Current shareholding as a % of net fees within 3 years of appointment Name based on 30 April 2008 share price as a % of net fees V M Mitchell 69% 100% D Howell 114% 100% J Armitt 98% 100% A Coppin 72% 100% Dilution The only share plan operated by the Company is the 2004 b LTIP.
It is not intended to operate any other Executive or all employee share incentive arrangements during 2008 09.
The Company has historically operated all its share schemes within the ABI dilution limits excluding the 2004 b LTIP which was a unique arrangement arising from the change in corporate strategy.
There has been no dilution for the purposes of the ABI dilution limits in the year ended 30 April 2008.
Pension Policy: Lower quartile to median Messrs Pidgley and Perrins receive payments in lieu of pension at 17% and 15% of base salary respectively all these payments are subject to income tax and national insurance.
These payments are not included in salary figures for the purposes of determining any other benefit entitlement.
The other Executive Directors, Messrs Carey and Fry continue to receive contributions into their respective defined contribution plans.
It should be noted, however, that the Company does not provide any compensation to Executives for loss of tax relief.
Full details of pension costs for Executive Directors are set out, in the audited section of the report on page 40.
Benefits in Kind Policy: Market practice In line with market practice, the Companys policy is to provide Executive Directors with the following additional benefits: a fully expensed company car: and medical insurance.
Other Remuneration Matters All Employee Share Plans During 2007 08 the Board of the Company consulted widely with the management and individuals in its operating divisions on whether it was appropriate to introduce all employee share plans.
The consensus view was that employees preferred the opportunity of receiving annual cash bonuses based on the performance of their respective divisions rather than participate in a Group based all employee share plan.
The Board, therefore, does not believe it is in shareholders interests to incur the Income Statement and dilutive cost of share arrangements which would not have the desired effect on employees.
Accordingly the Company will continue to operate appropriate annual bonus arrangements in all of its divisions.
Non-executive Directors Fees Policy: Upper decile fees All Non-executive Directors have specific terms of engagement and their remuneration is determined by the Board within the limits set by the Articles of Association.
The 2007 08 fee levels are based on a specific survey of the fees paid to Non-executive Directors in the comparator group by Halliwell Consulting.
The following table sets out the fee rates for current Non-executive Directors in the year ended 30 April 2008 and those rates which will apply in the year ending 30 April 2009: V M Mitchell D Howell A Coppin J Armitt NonSenior executive Independent Independent Independent Element Chairman Director Director Director Total Fee Rates 2008 09 190,000 60,000 60,000 50,000 Total Fee Rates 2007 08 190,000 56,000 55,000 50,000 % Increase 0% 7% 9% 0% Breakdown of 2008 09 Fee Basic Fee 190,000 50,000 50,000 50,000 Chair of Committee Fee 10,000 10,000 39 The Board has decided to review the fees of the Non-executive Directors annually taking into account the following factors: the workload and level of responsibility of the Non-executive Directors under the changing corporate governance expectations of shareholders and their representative bodies: and the current market rate for fees for Non-executive Directors.
Non-executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Companys share incentive schemes or performance based plans and are not eligible to join the Companys pension scheme.
Executive Directors Contracts The policy on termination is that the Company does not make payments beyond its contractual obligations.
The only event on the occurrence of which the Company is potentially liable to make a payment to any of the Executive Directors is on cessation of employment: with the maximum payment being 12 months salary.
No payment is due on either a Company takeover or in the event of liquidation.
In addition, Executive Directors will be expected to mitigate their loss.
Further, the Remuneration Committee ensures that there have been no unjustified payments for failure.
None of the Executive Directors contracts provides for liquidated damages.
There are no special provisions contained in any of the Executive Directors contracts which provide for longer periods of notice on a change of control of the Company.
Further, there are no special provisions providing for additional compensation on an Executive Directors cessation of employment with the Company.
Non-executive Directors Agreements All Non-executive appointments are subject to a notice period of one month and subject to successful re-election upon retirement by rotation as required by the Companys Articles of Association.
All letters of appointment for Non-executive Directors are renewable annually on 1 May.
Further details of all directors contracts are summarised below: Potential Notice Payment Potential Period by Potential upon Payment in Date of Unexpired Company or Termination Company event of Directors Contract Term Director Payment Takeover Liquidation Executive Directors A W Pidgley 24 June 1994 1 Year Rolling 12 months 12 months Nil Nil A Carey 20 September 1994 1 Year Rolling 12 months 12 months Nil Nil G J Fry 27 June 1996 1 Year Rolling 12 months 12 months Nil Nil R C Perrins 15 July 2002 1 Year Rolling 12 months 12 months Nil Nil Non-Executive Directors V M Mitchell 1 May 2002 n a 1 month 1 month Nil Nil D Howell 24 February 2004 n a 1 month 1 month Nil Nil A Coppin 1 September 2006 n a 1 month 1 month Nil Nil J Armitt 1 October 2007 n a 1 month 1 month Nil Nil M Tanner 1 September 2005 n a 1 month 1 month Nil Nil M Tanner retired from the Board with effect from 27 June 2008.
Performance graph 1 The graph shows the Companys performance, measured by total shareholder return TSR, compared with the performance of the FTSE 250, the FTSE All Share and the Companys remuneration comparator group as set out on page 34.
The Company considers these the most relevant indices for total shareholder return disclosure required under the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.

Governance Governance remuneration committee report 40 REMUNERATION COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED Part 3 of the regulations Audited information The following tables and accompanying notes, except where otherwise indicated, constitute the auditable part of the Remuneration Committee report, as defined in Part 3, Schedule 7a of the Companies Act 1985.
On retirement, Mr Lewis entered into a 12 month consultancy contract with the Company, the value of which is 240,000.
2 Mrs V M Mitchell became Chairman on 1 August 2007, having been a Non-executive Director since her appointment to the Board on 1 May 2002.
3 Appointed to the Board as a Non-executive Director on 1 October 2007.
4 Retired from the Board as a Non-executive Director on 5 September 2007.
5 Having regard to the Lifetime Allowance introduced under the pension simplification legislation which came into force from 6 April 2006, Executive Directors may, as an alternative to receiving a company contribution into a pension arrangement, receive a cash payment in lieu of such pension contributions.
Messrs Lewis, Pidgley and Perrins have chosen this alternative.
During the year Messrs Lewis and Pidgley received payments in lieu of pension at 17% of base salary and Mr Perrins at 15% of base salary.
6 Benefits in kind for all Executive Directors, with the exception of Mr R St J H Lewis, relate principally to the provision of a fully expensed motor vehicle and private healthcare.
Mr R St J H Lewis received only private healthcare benefits up to his retirement from the Board.
Where Directors were appointed, or resigned, during the year, the figures in the table relate only to the time when the relevant Director was a Main Board Director.
The release of awards under The Berkeley Group plc 2000 Long Term Incentive Plan are set out in the remaining sections of the Remuneration Committee Report.
Pensions Payments in Lieu of Pension Messrs Pidgley and Perrins and Mr Lewis up to the date of his retirement from the Board received payments in lieu of a pension contribution from the Company during the year and this is set out in the Directors remuneration table above.
During the previous financial year these Directors accepted the offer made to all members active and deferred of the Berkeley Group Staff Benefits Plan a defined benefit pension scheme, which is now closed to all members to receive an enhanced transfer value to transfer their accrued benefits from the Plan.
The transfer value of Mr Pidgleys accrued benefits and the additional cash sum received in the year ended 30 April 2007 were 4,178,415 and 1,720,638, respectively.
For Mr Perrins, the transfer value and additional cash sum were 147,075 and 125,705 and for Mr Lewis, 432,518 and 160,628.
For the avoidance of doubt, no amounts were paid into pension arrangements in respect of Messrs Lewis, Pidgley or Perrins during the year ended 30 April 2008.

The participants received the share element of the awards during the year, having received the cash element during the year ended 30 April 2007.
Following the Group reconstruction, share elements of the awards were converted into awards over Units in The Berkeley Group Holdings plc.
On the release of the share element of these awards, the participants received Units in respect of the share awards granted as well as the 7 B share payments attached to those Units, which had been held in trust until their release on 22 July 2007.
The mid-market share price of the Company on 22 July 2003 was 762.5p, and on 22 July 2007 was 1,787.0p.
