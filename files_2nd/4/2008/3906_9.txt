Part A Unaudited Information Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee comprises three Non-Executive Directors of the Company, Robert Alcock, Tim Ross and Caroline Price, who acts as Chairman of the Committee.
All of the Non-Executives are considered independent by the Company please refer to the Boards consideration of Mr Ross independence in the Corporate Governance section of this Annual Report.
The terms of reference for the Committee are available on the Companys website.
During the year the Committee consulted Mr MW Tincknell Chairman, Mr MD Davies Chief Executive and Mr SR Hill Group Finance Director about its proposals.
The Committee also took advice on executive remuneration from Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS who it has appointed as its independent remuneration advisers.
HNBS provided no other services to the Company during the year.
The Committee is responsible for: determining and agreeing with the Board the framework or broad policy for the remuneration of the Chairman, the Chief Executive, the Executive Directors, the Company Secretary and certain other members of the executive management: reviewing the ongoing appropriateness and relevance of the remuneration policy: approving the design of, and determining targets for, any performance related pay schemes operated by the Company and approving the total annual payments made under such schemes: and reviewing the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the Board and shareholders.
For any such plans, the Committee determines each year whether awards will be made and, if so, the overall amount of such awards, the individual awards to Executive Directors and other senior management and the performance targets to be used.
Non-Executive Directors fees are determined by the full Board with relevant individuals absenting themselves from discussions where appropriate and none of whom take part in discussions regarding their own remuneration.
Remuneration policy The Groups remuneration policy is: to ensure that individual rewards and incentives are aligned with the performance of the Group and the interests of shareholders: to maintain a competitive overall remuneration package in order to attract, retain and motivate high calibre executives capable of achieving the Groups objectives: to ensure that performance related elements form a significant proportion of total remuneration.
The Executive Directors total remuneration consists of salary, annual bonus, long-term incentives, pensions and other benefits.
The Committee believes that a significant proportion of the Executive Directors potential rewards should be performance related, and seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between annual and long-term performance objectives through the annual cash-based bonus plan and share-based longer-term incentives.
In line with the Association of British Insurers Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee will ensure that the incentive structure for Executive Directors and senior management will not raise environmental, social or governance ESG risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
More generally, with regard to the overall remuneration structure, there is no restriction on the Committee which prevents it from taking into account corporate governance on ESG matters.

indb 39 5 11 08 11:24:40 Remuneration Report continued Remuneration policy continued In developing and reviewing its remuneration policy the Remuneration Committee gives full consideration to the provisions of the 2006 Combined Code and has complied with the Codes provisions relating to Directors remuneration throughout the year.
The Remuneration Committee also takes account of pay and conditions in the Group as a whole.
Basic salary The Executive Directors salaries are determined by the Committee as near as is practicable to the beginning of each year.
In deciding appropriate levels, the Committee considers individual performance during the year and relies on objective research which gives up-to-date information on appropriate comparator companies in the Support Services sector and companies of a similar size in general industry.
The current salaries of the Executive Directors, as at 1 September 2008, are: Mark Tincknell 400,000, Mark Davies 400,000 and Stephen Hill 275,000.
The Committee considers that the increase in salary levels of the Executive Directors are entirely appropriate in light of base salary levels provided by other sector and size comparator companies and the continued outstanding performance of this management team in difficult general economic conditions.
Annual bonus Potential rewards under the Performance Related Bonus Scheme are based on the achievement of challenging targets determined by the Committee at the start of each year.
The maximum bonus payable to Executive Directors is 100% of salary.
In the year to 31 August 2008, bonuses were dependent on the achievement of demanding Group financial objectives, measured in terms of achieving and exceeding Earnings per Share growth targets.
The bonuses payable to the Executive Directors for the year under review reflect another year of continued growth in the business despite deteriorating general economic conditions and excellent Group and individual performance.
Long-term incentives In the year under review, the Company operated the 2007 Connaught LTIP Scheme as the sole long-term incentive for Executive Directors, an approach it intends to continue in the forthcoming year.
2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The 2007 LTIP provides for the grant of performance awards and matching awards.
For the most senior executives, broadly the Executive Directors and senior function and business unit heads, initial awards under the LTIP made in the year under review could be made in shares worth 150% of salary.
To ensure that the senior management was fully incentivised to effect a speedy integration of National Britannia, while continuing to deliver excellent value to shareholders, the first awards under the plan made in December 2007 were made over shares at this 150% of salary level.
For the forthcoming and following years, the normal award level is 100% of salary, although the Committee can grant awards over shares worth up to 200% if it considers it appropriate to do so in exceptional circumstances.
The Committee will take account of the continuing excellent performance of the Group and of the Executive Directors, whose retention and continued motivation is crucial to the continued delivery of returns to shareholders, when determining the level of the next awards to be made shortly after the AGM in December 2008.
In addition to awards of performance shares, executives are offered the opportunity to invest up to 50% of their net annual bonus in Connaught shares and in return receive an award of matching shares on a 2:1 gross basis for the most senior executives and on a 1:1 gross basis for other participants.
All awards to the most senior executives i. e. both performance share and matching share awards vest after a three year period if demanding and stretching performance conditions have been achieved.
For half of initial awards under the Plan, the performance condition was based on the Companys Total Shareholders Return TSR performance against a comparator group of FTSE 350 companies from the Support Services and Construction and Materials Sectors.

indb 40 5 11 08 11:24:40 Remuneration Report continued More particularly, this portion of these awards will vest as follows: Percentage of this portion of award Connaughts TSR ranking against the that vests Comparator Group Nil Below median 25% Median Between 25% and 100% Between median and upper quartile The remaining 50% of the awards made in the year under review are subject to an EPS-based performance condition based on real growth in Connaughts adjusted EPS.
More particularly, this portion of awards will vest as follows: Percentage of this portion of award Average annual compound growth in that vests Adjusted EPS Nil RPI 15% p. a.
Between 25% and 100% Between RPI 15% p. a. and RPI 25% p. a. Straight-line vesting will occur between the targets.
To the extent that the performance conditions are not met in full at the end of the three year performance period, awards lapse.
The Committee intends to adopt the same basic approach to performance conditions that will apply to awards made in the forthcoming year i. e. a split of challenging EPS and TSR targets on the basis that the approach provides a balanced incentive to generate above market returns and deliver significant financial growth.
Pension policy The Company makes contributions of 15% of the salaries of Mark Davies and Stephen Hill to a defined contribution money purchase Executive Pension Scheme and 15% of the salary of Mark Tincknell to a defined contribution money purchase private pension arrangement.
Pension benefits in respect of the Executive Directors are given in the table on page 43.
Non-Executive Directors remuneration The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board in accordance with the Articles of Association and taking account of time commitment, responsibility and fee levels paid in other comparable organisations.
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts with the Company, neither are they eligible for bonuses, pensions or participation in the Companys share incentive arrangements.
The table below shows the date of appointment and re-appointment for each of the Non-Executive Directors.

indb 41 5 11 08 11:24:40 Remuneration Report continued Directors service contracts In accordance with recommended practices under the 2006 Combined Code, it is the Companys policy to have service contracts for Executive Directors which contain a notice period of not more than twelve months.
The Executive Directors all have service contracts with the Company, details of which are as follows: Contractual termination Contract date Unexpired term and notice period payments Mark Tincknell 1 September 2005 Rolling contract 12 months None Mark Davies 1 December 2005 Rolling contract 12 months None Stephen Hill 1 September 2006 Rolling contract 12 months None None of the Executive Directors currently earn remuneration from external non-executive appointments.
Such appointments can be taken up, provided they do not prejudice the Directors ability to fulfil his duties at Connaught.
Whether any related fees are retained by the executive or remitted to the Company will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
With the exception of service contracts there are no contracts in which any Director has a material interest.

indb 44 5 11 08 11:24:40 Remuneration Report continued Executive Share Option Scheme The Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS was introduced in November 1998.
Under the ESOS the Remuneration Committee was able to grant options over shares in the Company to senior executives of the Company.
Options were granted on a discretionary basis relative to executives seniority within the Group.
Options were granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of grant.
The contractual life of an option is ten years.
Options granted under the ESOS will become exercisable on the third or fifth anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the growth in earnings per share over the period exceeding an average of inflation plus 5% to 15%.
Exercise of an option is subject to continued employment.
Options were valued using the Black Scholes option pricing model.
The Black Scholes model is considered to be appropriate for valuing options granted under this scheme as it most closely models managements best assessment of the likely behavioural patterns of the option holders.
The model uses the following assumptions: 2007 Grant date 2008 September 2006 October 2007 August 2007 Weighted average share price at grant date 362.4p 242p Weighted average exercise price 362.4p 242p Expected life 3 5 years 3-5 years Expected volatility 17.6 23.5% 17.6 23.5% Risk free rate 4.43 4.70% 4.43 4.70% Expected dividend yield 1.0% 1.0% Weighted average fair value per option 54.4p 34.9p as outlined on pages 58 and 90: Share-based payments policy.
The model assumes participatory employees remain in employment with the Group and that all performance conditions are met.
The options outstanding at 31 August 2008 had a weighted average exercise price of 148.5p 2007: 146.8p and weighted average remaining contractual life of 7.0 years 2007: 7.9 years.
The expected volatility of the share price is based on historical volatility over the last 3 years preceding the grant date.
1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan 1998 LTIP was introduced in November 1998.
The 1998 LTIP allowed for a bonus in shares or a mixture of shares and cash to be granted to Directors and senior managers on exceeding profit growth targets.
The scheme provided bonus shares equal to the value of an agreed percentage of the profits of the relevant business over the budgeted profit and after accounting for any other bonuses due to be paid.
In normal circumstances, the shares granted are held for 3 years before vesting absolutely and the employee must generally remain in the employment of the Group in order for the bonus shares to vest.

indb 45 5 11 08 11:24:41 Remuneration Report continued The fair value of options granted under the 1998 LTIP is measured as the market price of the ordinary shares on the date of grant, less the present value of dividends expected to be paid during the vesting period.
This method is considered to be the most appropriate for valuing options granted under the 1998 LTIP as it treats the options as share awards.
2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan 2007 LTIP was introduced in December 2007.
The Plan provides for the grant of two types of awards i performance awards, being conditional rights to receive shares subject to continued employment over the vesting period and the satisfaction of performance criteria and ii matching awards, akin to performance awards except the initial grant and subsequent vesting of which are also conditional on the retention of linked investment shares, acquired prior to the grant of the matching award from an executives annual bonus.
The fair value of options granted under the 2007 LTIP is measured as the market price of the ordinary shares on the date of grant, less the present value of dividends expected to be paid during the vesting period.
This method is considered to be the most appropriate for valuing options granted under the 2007 LTIP as it treats the options as share awards.
