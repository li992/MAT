Remuneration policy The Board as a whole establishes the remuneration policy.
The Remuneration Committee determines and recommends to the Board the framework for the remuneration of the Executive Directors.
The Chief Executives remuneration proposals for the members of the Executive Committee, and for other senior executives reporting directly to him, are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee and recommendations are made to the Board.
The Remuneration Committee also takes note of the remuneration policy as detailed by the Chief Executive in respect of other levels of management in the Company and makes such recommendations to the Chief Executive as the Remuneration Committee deems appropriate.
49 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2008 The remuneration of the Executive Directors and Chairman is the responsibility of the Remuneration Committee and the remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is the responsibility of the Board as a whole.
No Director is involved in determining or voting on their own remuneration.
In determining the policy for the Executive Directors, the Remuneration Committees objective is to ensure that those individuals are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance and are, in a fair and responsible manner having regard to the performance of the Company, rewarded for their individual contributions to the success of the Company.
The objective of the remuneration policy is to provide remuneration in a competitive form and amount to attract, retain and motivate high quality management.
The importance of aligning the interests of Executive Directors and senior executives with shareholders is carefully considered, particularly in the design of the performance-related elements of their remuneration packages.
Key developments The following amendments to the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP were approved at the AGM held in April 2008, effective from 1 January 2008 and were applied to the awards granted during the year: The introduction of an earnings per share performance target to determine the level of vesting of half of the performance shares granted under LTIP Part B, with the other half continuing to be subject to a total shareholder return TSR performance condition The rules were amended to bring the treatment of awards in the event of a change in control in line with best practice It was communicated to shareholders at the 2008 AGM that no further awards will be granted to Executive Directors under LTIP Part A.
Instead the value of share options which would ordinarily have been granted under Part A to the Executive Directors will be replaced with grants of performance shares under LTIP Part B, worth up to 50% of salary.
During 2008, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the remuneration policy with particular regard to the impact of environmental, social and governance issues on executive remuneration within Filtrona.
The conclusion of the review was that where personal objectives are set for the attainment of bonus awards these objectives, where appropriate having regard to the interests of internal and external shareholders, will contain an element of environmental, social and governance issues.
In consideration of the current economic climate and having regard to inflation levels the executive and senior management have been given a 3% pay increase with effect from 1 January 2009, which is in line with the average pay award being granted to the global workforce.
An exception is for Steve Crummett, the Group Finance Director appointed in March 2008.
At the time of Steves appointment his salary was deliberately set at the conservative end of market practices.
To reflect his time in the role and performance since March 2008, the Committee agreed that his salary level should be adjusted to competitive market levels and, accordingly, the Remuneration Committee approved a revised salary of 275,000 per annum effective from 1 January 2009.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed the structure of the annual bonus scheme during 2008 and agreed that in future the annual bonus of up to 100% of basic salary for Executive Directors would contain three elements: cash bonus related to: i an operating profit target to be set on the basis of constant exchange rates and with reference to the underlying earnings per share performance of the Company, accounting for up to 40% of any bonus: and ii personal objectives, accounting for up to 10% of any bonus Deferred Annual Share Bonus provided as a match for the aggregate of the cash and personal objectives elements and deferred for three years The Committee believe that this structure better allows them to incentivise and influence management actions.
The Remuneration Committee has recently further refined annual bonus arrangements for 2009 and adopted the following framework of principles: Where targets are set below prior years adjusted earnings per share EPS on a constant currency basis the quantum of bonus payable for: i Operating Profit and personal objectives elements will be reduced by the same percentage as the reduction in EPS: and ii Deferred annual share bonus will be reduced and will only be granted where Filtrona plc share price has outperformed the FTSE 250 Index by at least 5% Where performance is equal to or above prior year EPS on a constant currency basis cash bonus and deferred share bonus awards will continue to be made at the normal quantum The Committee believes that this framework provides a reasonable incentive structure for management in the current economic environment, whilst protecting shareholders interests.

1 The maximum annual bonus in any one year is capped at 100% of salary comprising of 50% annual cash bonus and 50% DASB 2 Not applicable The Remuneration Committee structures senior executive remuneration in two distinct parts: fixed remuneration of basic salary, pension and benefits: and variable performance-related remuneration in the form of cash and deferred share bonuses and long-term incentive arrangements.
Remuneration for Executive Directors is structured so that the variable performance-related pay element forms a significant portion of each Directors package and that the majority of Executive Directors total remuneration at the maximum performance level will derive from the Companys long-term incentive arrangements, which are strongly aligned to the Companys strategic objective to secure long-term shareholder value creation.
51 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2008 Components of Directors remuneration for 2008 The emoluments of the Directors for the year ended 31 December 2008 were as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 Dec 31 Dec 2008 2007 Fees Salary Bonus Benefits Total Fees Salary Bonus Benefits Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Executive Directors Mark Harper 490 122 23 635 455 217 22 694 1 2 Steve Crummett 173 43 40 256 Non-executive Directors Jeff Harris 156 156 156 156 Paul Drechsler 42 42 42 42 Adrian Auer 42 42 42 42 Lars Emilson 34 34 23 23 5 3 4 Steve Dryden 61 8 69 270 129 36 435 6 Warren Knowlton 11 11 1 Appointed 19 March 2008 2 Includes a supplementary payment of 29,910 to allow the securing of additional pension benefits 3 Includes a supplementary payment of 7,245 in respect of pension provision above the pension schemes specific earnings cap 4 Includes a supplementary payment of 32,000 in respect of pension provision above the pension schemes specific earnings cap 5 Resigned 19 March 2008 6 Resigned 30 April 2007 In addition, the Company paid pension contributions for Steve Crummett of 5,000 into a defined contribution pension plan.
Salary Basic salary for each Executive Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account the roles, responsibilities, performance and experience of the individual and pay awards and conditions elsewhere in the Company.
Salaries are reviewed annually with any increase being effective from 1 January unless responsibilities change.
Salary levels are determined taking into account market data on salary levels for similar positions at comparable companies.
A review of salary levels was undertaken in December 2008.
In line with average pay awards across the Group, Mark Harper was awarded an increase of 3%.
At the time of Steve Crummetts appointment his salary was deliberately set at the conservative end of market practices.
To reflect his time in the role and performance since March 2008 the Committee agreed that his salary level should be adjusted to competitive market levels and, accordingly, the Remuneration Committee approved a revised salary of 275,000 per annum effective from 1 January 2009.
Mark Harper Steve Crummett 1 Annual salary effective from 1 January 2009 505,000 275,000 2 1 Annual salary effective from 1 January 2008 490,000 220,000 1 Excluding supplementary pension payment 2 Effective from date of appointment if later Annual bonuses Under the terms of the annual bonus arrangements for 2008, Mark Harper and Steve Crummett were each potentially entitled to a maximum bonus of up to 100% of basic salary 50% in cash and 50% in shares in the Company, the entitlement to such shares being deferred for three years, in accordance with the rules of the DASB.
For the year ended 31 December 2008, the performance targets were approved by the Remuneration Committee and based upon Filtronas adjusted earnings per share.
Company performance was required to reach a minimum threshold adjusted EPS target for a bonus of 30% of basic salary to be payable 15% in cash and 15% in deferred shares under the DASB.
For the year ended 31 December 2008, having matched the target performance of adjusted EPS of 18.6p the Remuneration Committee approved a bonus of 50% of basic salary for each of the Executive Directors 25% in cash and 25% in shares under the DASB.
When assessing the approval of the bonus awards, the Remuneration Committee carefully considered the impact of certain exceptional items upon the Companys earnings per share performance and had regard to the interests of the shareholders.
52 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2008 Corporate Governance Report of the Remuneration Committee Deferred Annual Share Bonus Plan The DASB provides for Executive Directors and nominated senior executives to receive existing issued ordinary shares in the Company for nil payment.
The number of shares subject to an award is determined at the time the award is granted, based upon the performance in the Filtronas preceding financial year of the participant and or the Company and or the division in which the participant worked.
Under the rules of the DASB the aggregate value of shares made subject to awards granted to a participant in any one financial year may not exceed 100% of their basic salary as at the award date.
The Remuneration Committee has determined that, in accordance with the Companys bonus arrangements, awards under DASB will not normally exceed 50% of basic salary.
Shares awarded under the DASB are held in trust until 1 March in the third calendar year after the year in which the award was made, or such other date as the Company may determine is reasonably practicable, at which point they are transferred to the participant subject to the participants continued employment within the Group.
Details of the awards granted to the Executive Directors under the DASB in 2008 are shown in the table on page 53.
Executive LTIP share-based incentive plans The Remuneration Committee strongly believes that offering Executive Directors and nominated senior executives the opportunity to be awarded shares in the Company is an important part of motivating, rewarding and retaining key employees so that they may drive and participate in the future growth of the Company.
It is also of the view that the Executive Directors and nominated senior executives should be encouraged to invest directly in the Company through the purchase of shares.
The Companys DASB and LTIP are both intended to support these objectives.
On the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Company has adopted shareholding guidelines for both Executive Directors and nominated senior executives.
The guidelines are such that Executive Directors should hold shares to the value of 100% of their basic salary within 5 years of the recommendation being adopted or the date of their appointment whichever is the later.
Details of the shareholdings held by the Executive Directors are disclosed on page 56.
The award of shares or options under the executive share-based incentive plans is determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account, inter alia, the role of the individual, and other such criteria as they may determine from time to time.
The current policy is that participation in the DASB and LTIP Part B is restricted to Executive Directors and nominated senior executives.
Since 2008 Executive Directors and such nominated senior executives will receive no further awards under LTIP Part A.
Thereafter participation, in LTIP Part A, has been limited to other designated employees.
Awards under the Companys share-based incentive plans will be satisfied using market purchases, new issue shares and or shares held in treasury.
The Long-Term Incentive Plan Part B A performance share award under LTIP Part B consists of a conditional right to receive shares in the Company, subject to performance conditions, on the basis described below.
Participants make no payment for the grant and exercise of performance share awards.
Participants may receive performance share awards over shares worth up to two times their basic salary in any financial year.
In June 2005, following the demerger, the Executive Directors and nominated senior executives were granted a one-off matching share award linked to their investment in the Companys shares.
During the year the matching shares awarded in June 2005 lapsed, due to the performance targets not being met.
A performance share award, will not normally be exercisable before the third anniversary of its award and may only be exercised to the extent that the applicable performance conditions have been satisfied.
The awards are structured as nil cost options.
For employees based outside the US, the options remain capable of being exercised up to the sixth anniversary of grant.
For employees based in the US, once the performance conditions have been satisfied the options must be exercised within 30 days of vesting.
For awards granted prior to 2008, the extent to which performance share awards vest is subject to the Companys TSR performance over a fixed three year period relative to the TSR performance of the FTSE 250 companies excluding investment trusts at the start of the three year performance period.
Identical conditions were attached to the matching share awards.
Performance share awards will vest in full only if the Companys TSR performance is ranked at upper quartile or above within the peer group over the performance period.
For median performance one quarter of such awards vests, rising proportionally up to full vesting thereafter.
For below median performance, no such awards will vest.
The performance condition will be tested after three years and there is no provision for retesting.
To the extent the performance condition has not been met after three years, the relevant awards will lapse.
53 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2008 For awards granted in 2008, and beyond, 50% of the awards will be subject to a TSR performance condition as set out above and 50% of the awards will be subject to an adjusted EPS performance condition.
The adjusted EPS performance condition for these awards will require the Companys earnings per share growth adjusted to exclude items which did not reflect the Companys underlying financial performance and intangible amortisation relative to inflation over three financial years to exceed inflation by an average of at least 3% per annum for 12.5% of the awards to vest.
The proportion of the awards vesting will increase on a straight-line basis and for 50% of the awards to vest such adjusted EPS growth must exceed inflation by an average of at least 8% per annum.
The performance condition will be tested after three financial years and there will be no provision for retesting.
To the extent the performance condition has not been met after three financial years, the relevant awards will lapse.
The Remuneration Committee will review the performance conditions each time performance share awards are granted under LTIP Part B in order to ensure that they remain challenging and may impose different conditions on share awards granted in subsequent years.
The middle market price of an ordinary share in the Company on 31 December 2008 was 136.75p.
The middle market price of an ordinary share in the Company during the year ranged from 110.00p to 224.75p.
The remaining awards granted in 2006 and 2007 under LTIP Part B are subject to relative TSR performance targets.
At the end of 2008 the awards granted in 2006 were ranked below median and the performance targets had not been met.
If the performance targets are not met, the shares subject to those awards will not vest.
For the awards granted in 2007 Filtrona is ranked between the median and upper quartile of the comparator group, which would indicate a vesting of 48.88% of options awarded.
The position may change depending on the Companys performance as at the date of the relevant third anniversary.
During the year LTIP Part B Performance options awarded in June 2005 lapsed due to the performance targets not being met.
Long-Term Incentive Plan Part A The LTIP Part A provides for participants to receive share option awards over shares worth up to two times basic salary or 250,000 whichever is the greatest in any financial year, subject to performance conditions.
In accordance with the recommendations of the Remuneration Committee, Executive Directors and nominated senior executives are no longer receiving LTIP Part A share option awards the last awards having been granted in 2007.
Awards will continue to be made to other participants and the exercise price set equal to the share price at the date of the grant.
54 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2008 Corporate Governance Report of the Remuneration Committee During 2008 the Remuneration Committee reviewed the criteria being applied when quantifying the level of individual awards being granted.
As a result the Committee has recommended that further emphasis be placed on the participants contribution relative to the part of the Group in which they work in contrast to current performance of the Company as a whole.
A share option award will normally be exercisable between three and ten years following its grant, but only if the specified performance condition has been satisfied.
The performance conditions attached to previous LTIP Part A awards were based on the Companys earnings per share growth adjusted to exclude items which did not reflect the Companys underlying financial performance and intangible amortisation relative to inflation over three financial years, requiring such earnings per share growth to exceed inflation by an average of at least 3% per annum.
To the extent the performance condition has not been met after three financial years, the relevant share option awards will lapse.
Save As You Earn scheme In addition to the LTIP, the Company operates a Save As You Earn share option scheme SAYE.
During the year, the Company made its third award under the rules of the SAYE.
The Company has decided not to launch an SAYE award during 2009.
Mark Harper joined the SAYE in 2006 and Steve Crummett joined the SAYE in 2008 with both contributing the statutory maximum monthly amount of 250.
Consequently neither are currently eligible to participate in any further invitations.
Details of the awards granted and outstanding during the year, to Executive Directors under the LTIP Part A and the SAYE are as follows: Earliest At 1 Jan Awarded Lapsed At 31 Dec Exercise vesting 1 Executive Director 2008 in year in year 2008 price date Expiry date Mark Harper LTIP Part A 156,903 156,903 239.00p 23 June 2008 22 June 2015 LTIP Part A 148,380 148,380 254.75p 8 Sept 2009 7 Sept 2016 LTIP Part A 190,376 190,376 239.00p 31 August 2010 30 August 2017 SAYE 6,793 6,793 237.00p 1 May 2011 31 Oct 2011 Steve Crummett LTIP Part A 73,221 73,221 239.00p 31 August 2010 30 August 2017 SAYE 6,324 6,324 151.80p 1 May 2011 31 Oct 2011 Steve Dryden LTIP Part A 96,234 96,234 239.00p 23 June 2008 22 June 2015 LTIP Part A 88,321 88,321 254.75p 8 Sept 2009 7 Sept 2016 LTIP Part A 106,694 106,694 239.00p 31 August 2010 30 August 2017 SAYE 6,793 6,793 237.00p 1 May 2011 31 Oct 2011 1 Or date of leaving Performance graph The graph below represents the comparative TSR performance of the Company against the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts Index from the date of the listing of the Company until 31 December 2008 highlighting the intervening financial year-ends.

Mark Harper has a service contract dated 12 May 2005 and Steve Crummett has a service contract dated 19 March 2008, both with a notice period of 12 months from either party.
The service contracts for the Executive Directors are available for inspection by members at each AGM and during normal business hours at the Companys registered office.
The Remuneration Committees policy in relation to termination of service contracts is to apply an appropriate level of mitigation, having regard to all of the circumstances of the individual and the termination of employment, and to any legal advice received.
The Company has the right to make a payment in lieu of notice and any such payment may be made in monthly instalments at the Companys discretion and may be reduced to take into account any sums earned during the payment period by way of employment elsewhere.
Non-executive Directors The Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts and do not participate in any Company pension, share or incentive scheme.
In accordance with best practice, letters of appointment have been issued for all Non-executive Directors for an initial period of three years.
These letters are available for inspection by members at each AGM and during normal business hours at the Companys registered office.
Fees for the Chairman are determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Fees for Non-executive Directors, other than the Chairman, are approved by the Board in to accordance with the policy adopted by the Remuneration Committee, and are based on a standard fee, with additional fees payable to the Senior Independent Non-executive Director and for the chairing of the Audit and Remuneration Committees.
The fees are set taking into account current market practice and the responsibilities and time commitment involved in the role.
The fees were reviewed in December 2008 for the first time since December 2006.
The fees will be subject to a further review in December 2009 in accordance with the policy for the remuneration of Non-executive Directors adopted by the Board.
