Report on directors remuneration Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 and meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and the Combined Code.
A resolution will be put to shareholders at the Companys Annual General Meeting on 7 May 2009 inviting them to consider and approve this report.
The auditors are required to report to the Companys members on that part of this remuneration report which is subject to audit and to state whether, in their opinion, that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
This report is therefore presented in two sections: unaudited information and audited information.
Section 1: Unaudited information The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is made up solely of non-executive directors with no personal financial interest other than as shareholders in the matters to be decided.
Those non-executive directors serving on the Remuneration Committee during 2008 were Mr Colin Holmes as Chairman, Mr John Warren, Mrs Lesley MacDonagh and, since 1 October 2008, Mr Alastair Lyons.
Meetings of the Remuneration Committee are held as and when appropriate and at least annually.
During 2008, the Remuneration Committee met on six occasions and all members, then current, attended each meeting with the exception of Mrs Lesley MacDonagh who missed two meetings by prior arrangement.
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee, from time to time, calls upon Mr Malcolm Harris Chairman and Mr David Ritchie Chief Executive to assist in discussions and deliberations of the Remuneration Committee on remuneration matters not pertaining to the remuneration or terms and conditions of his own employment.
The Remuneration Committee has, on occasion, appointed the services of external advisers to advise on director remuneration.
The Hay Group has been appointed as adviser to the Remuneration Committee on an ongoing basis, has no other connection with the Company and provides reports and advice as required.
ExcellerateHRO Share Plan Services formerly Towers Perrin act as Trustee of the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan.
The Group Company Secretary, Mr Martin Palmer, acts as Secretary to the Remuneration Committee.

co. uk plc and on request to the Group Company Secretary.
Remuneration policy The Remuneration Committee determines the Company's policy for the remuneration of executive directors, having regard to the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 and the Combined Code and its provisions on directors' remuneration, including Schedule A.
30 Bovis Homes Group PLC www.
co. uk plc Report on directors remuneration continued The Remuneration Committee sets and implements remuneration policy for the Chairman, executive directors and designated senior management.
The Remuneration Committee determines the need for independent professional advice where appropriate and has regard to information on compensation and salary levels in companies in the housebuilding sector and in other companies of comparable size, for executives with similar skills, qualifications and experience.
The objectives of the remuneration policy are to: ensure that the individual rewards and incentives fairly relate to the performance of the individual, the Company and the interests of shareholders: maintain a remuneration package which enables the Company to attract, retain, and motivate executives of the appropriate calibre and experience to further the success of the Company and maximise long term shareholder value: and take into account pay and employment conditions throughout the Group.
The remuneration policy was reviewed by the Remuneration Committee during 2008.
Remuneration package The remuneration package of the executive directors consists of basic salary, performance bonus, health insurance, membership of the Bovis Homes Regulated Independent Car Scheme for Employees BRICS, pension, death in service assurance, and participation in employee share schemes and the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan.
In prior years, participation in the Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme and Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan has also formed part of the executive directors remuneration package.
The Group suspended use of the Executive Share Option Scheme during 2004 and this scheme expired in 2007, although options previously granted to executive directors are still current.
During 2004, the Group also suspended use of the share incentive plan in respect of the awarding of free shares in the Company.
The Remuneration Committee aims to balance appropriately those elements of an executive directors remuneration which are subject to explicit performance conditions, accepting that all remuneration is linked with ongoing appraisal of individual performance.
By virtue of the various elements of directors remuneration subject to performance conditions, a significant part is variable and is not guaranteed.
The potential remuneration package, dependent on performance, reflects one-third fixed and two-thirds variable elements.
Whilst the Remuneration Committee aims to achieve this balance, it recognises that the payout in any year will vary from this.
The chart below to the left shows this graphically.
Potential fixed and variable elements % Potential and earned remuneration during 2008 000 400 400 400 Earned Salary fixed 350 350 350 Performance Potential unearned 300 300 300 bonus variable 1 1 33 3 33 3 250 250 250 A 2008 salary fixed LTIP variable 200 200 200 B 2008 performance 150 150 150 bonus variable 1 33 3 100 100 100 C Gains on 2005 LTIP 50 50 50 variable 0 0 0 AB C A B C A B M R Harris D J Ritchie N Cooper Retired 2 July 2008 For remuneration earned during 2008 the fixed element, being salary, and variable elements, which include bonus in respect of the 2008 financial year and gains on the exercise of LTIP awards granted in 2005, are shown, by director, in the three charts immediately above and to the right.
No bonus awards were made to the executive directors in respect of the 2008 financial year.
As Mr Neil Cooper commenced with the Company on 2 January 2007 he had no entitlement to exercise awards under the LTIP during 2008.
Mr Coopers remuneration therefore comprised solely salary.
Salary Executive director salaries are reviewed annually on 1 January with effect from 1 January 2009 taking into account the total remuneration package at the time of the review.
No rises were awarded to the executive directors in the 2009 review.
Salaries were previously reviewed in July each year.
External directorships Executive directors may, if so authorised by the Board, accept appointments as non-executive directors of suitable companies and organisations outside the Group.
Earnings arising from such external directorships are payable directly to the Company.
Neither of the executive directors currently has any such appointments.
Performance bonus 2008 During 2008, executive directors were able to earn a performance cash bonus up to a maximum of 100% of basic annual salary prevailing at the date of the Remuneration Committee meeting to determine bonuses.
It is considered that such maximum performance bonus levels create an appropriate level of short term incentive, and align suitably with the performance bonus entitlements of other companies in the housebuilding sector as well as other publicly listed companies of a similar size to the Company.
Bonuses for executive directors have been determined by the Remuneration Committee by reference to challenging performance criteria including exceeding the previous years profit before taxation by a specified percentage and the achievement of other strategic targets.
To the end of 2008, the bonuses of the executive directors have been assessed and paid from a bonus pool which is generated from increases in profits over the previous year.
All office based employees share in any bonus pool.
The rules governing the generation of the bonus pool remained consistent with prior years.
Site employees are incentivised through direct site bonus schemes based on measurable site performance.
The bonus pool has been designed to remain at zero until profits before taxation and bonus charge increase over the prior year by 2% above the increase in the Retail Price Index RPI.
Thereafter, for every 1% increase in profits before taxation and bonus charge over the prior year, a value equal to 0.5% of the Groups profit before taxation and bonus charge is allocated to the bonus pool.
This applies until the increase in profits before taxation and bonus charge reaches 12% over the increase in RPI at which point the total value allocated to the bonus pool is capped.
At this maximum value the bonus pool will equal 5% of the Groups profit before taxation and bonus charge.
Bonus payments in aggregate are restricted to a maximum equal to the value allocated to the bonus pool.
Bovis Homes Group PLC 31 Report on directors remuneration continued Any bonus pool is applied in settling individual employee bonuses subject to individual performance, corporate performance and set bonus caps.
Any surplus bonus pool remaining after settling employee bonuses reverts to the Group and is included in the profits for that financial year.
Executive directors have a bonus cap equal to 100% of basic salary.
In addition to the requirement for the bonus pool to have sufficient value to pay employee bonuses, the Remuneration Committee established challenging performance criteria for executive directors to determine bonus levels.
For bonuses equal to 100% of basic salary to be considered for payment, specific financial criteria had to be met, including: achievement of an increase in Group profits before taxation and bonus of 10%: and achievement of return on capital employed in excess of 20% for the year: and achievement of the Groups budgeted profit before taxation for the year.
No bonuses were paid to executive directors in 2008 in respect of the 2007 financial year after considering the achievement or otherwise of the performance criteria set for the financial year 2007.
Following the consideration of performance criteria set for the financial year 2008 the Remuneration Committee has resolved not to award bonuses to the executive directors serving during 2008.
Performance bonus 2009 Given the current trading conditions within the UK housing market and the Groups current focus on cash flow generation, the Remuneration Committee considers it inappropriate to operate the cash bonus scheme during 2009.
The Remuneration Committee is proposing that entitlement to be considered for cash bonus in 2009 is forfeited by the executive directors and other senior executives, to be replaced by awards in a Bonus Replacement Share Plan aimed at providing incentives for outperformance by senior management against defined performance measures which the Remuneration Committee considers will be clearly aligned with the creation of shareholder value.
The Remuneration Committee has consulted widely with shareholders on the proposal to form the Bonus Replacement Share Plan and has met with shareholders holding in excess of 50% of the Companys share capital.
Comments from shareholders have been considered and the plan has been adapted following the consultation.
The Remuneration Committee intends only using this share plan for 2009.
Challenging performance conditions focused on improvements to the Company's share price over three years will be used to assess the levels of any vesting of such awards.
The Plan rules will include an over-riding discretion for the Remuneration Committee to determine the level of awards which vest if it considers that vesting has been significantly influenced by external improvements in market conditions rather than through strong performance from management, thus ensuring the rewards of vesting are justified by performance.
Vesting awards will be satisfied through the issue of new shares.
Accordingly, shareholder approval to the share bonus performance plan will be sought at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Pension Two of the executive directors who served during 2008 were senior executive members of the Bovis Homes Pension Scheme.
This is a contributory funded, defined benefit scheme approved by HMRC.
Pensionable earnings were equal to basic pay prior to 6 April 2006.
From 6 April 2006, increases in pensionable earnings are restricted each year to the lesser of the percentage increase in basic pay and 2.5%.
Prior to retirement on 2 July 2008, Mr Malcolm Harris was not subject to the earnings cap.
Mr David Ritchie is subject to the statutory earnings cap for service until 5 April 2006 and, following the introduction of the lifetime allowance pension rules on 6 April 2006, is not subject to an earnings cap for service from 6 April 2006.
Normal retirement age for senior executive members under the scheme is 60, and the accrual rate is 1 45th of final pensionable earnings for each year of service as a senior executive.
Mr Neil Cooper was a member of the Bovis Homes Group Personal Pension Plan during 2008, a contracted-in defined contribution arrangement, to which the Company contributes 7% of basic annual salary per annum.
Normal retirement age for joiners after 1 October 2006 is age 65.
Share schemes The Company employs a standard set of performance conditions for all executive directors in respect of outstanding options under the Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme and awards under the Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan.
These performance conditions are described under specific headings in this report.
The granting of awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The performance conditions are designed to challenge and motivate executive directors to improve profitability and enhance shareholder return.
The conditions are also designed to require strong collective and individual performance from the executive directors before options and awards vest, whilst at the same time offering a credible opportunity for success.
For share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan to vest an independent report is provided by the Companys auditors, as independent experts, to the Company confirming achievement of the relevant performance conditions.
The performance conditions attaching to share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan are selected intentionally to be derived from readily available information which is straightforward and transparent.
This ensures that the auditors can make objective assessments of achievement against the performance conditions.
Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme The Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme was established in 1997.
The Remuneration Committee suspended the issuing of new share options on 5 May 2004.
It is an HMRC approved scheme which expired in 2007 and historically granted share options on an approved basis within HMRC limits and on an unapproved basis outside HMRC limits.
The rules of the scheme relating to vesting and exercising outstanding share options remained unaltered at the schemes expiry.
For outstanding share options, the performance criteria require that any share option held under the Bovis Homes Group PLC Executive Share Option Scheme can only normally be exercised if the auditors have certified that the cumulative increase in annualised earnings per share exceeds the percentage increase in RPI by at least 4% per annum over three consecutive years.
The exercise price of a share option has been determined by the Board at the date of grant and has not been less than the higher of the market value and nominal value of an ordinary share in the Company at the date of grant.
Assuming the performance criteria are satisfied, share options may, under normal circumstances, be exercised between the third and tenth anniversary from the date of grant.
32 Bovis Homes Group PLC www.
co. uk plc Report on directors remuneration continued Bovis Homes Group Long Term Incentive Plan A Long Term Incentive Plan for executive directors and senior executives was approved by shareholders at the 2000 Annual General Meeting.
An amendment to the rules of the Long Term Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders at the 2004 Annual General Meeting and under the amended rules of the plan at the date of this report a participant may receive in respect of any financial year a maximum award of shares with a market value, when the award is made, not exceeding 100% of basic salary.
Each award is made subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria and awards may only be exercised at the end of three years.
There is no cost to the participants in the plan to exercise the awards.
The extent to which the awards may be exercised is determined by two measures of performance: total shareholder return TSR and earnings per share EPS growth, each measured over a three year performance period and each relating to half of the shares awarded.
The TSR measure requires the comparison of the growth in the Companys TSR over a three year period to that of a group of comparator companies in the housebuilding industry specified by the Remuneration Committee at the start of the performance period.
TSR is the aggregate of share price growth and dividends paid during the three year period assuming that such dividends are reinvested in ordinary shares.
For awards granted in 2006 the Companys ranking amongst the comparator companies will be used to determine the percentage of the shares under the award which will vest, as follows: TSR ranking % of total award which can be realised 1st position 50% of the shares in the award 2nd position 45% of the shares in the award 3rd position 37.5% of the shares in the award 4th position 30% of the shares in the award 5th position 20% of the shares in the award 6th position 15% of the shares in the award Recognising the reduction in comparator companies and the lack of suitable replacements, the Remuneration Committee has determined that the performance of companies acquired during the three year performance period applicable to the 2006 awards will from the date of acquisition be notionally reinvested in the company which has the median TSR performance from the date of acquisition to the end of the performance period excluding other acquired companies, maintaining the number of comparator companies and the vesting schedule based on ranking for these awards.
The group of comparator companies to be used for the 2006 awards is as follows: Comparator companies Barratt Developments PLC The Berkeley Group plc George Wimpey PLC Redrow Group plc Westbury plc Bellway p. l. c. Crest Nicholson PLC Persimmon plc Taylor Woodrow plc Wilson Bowden plc During 2007 the Remuneration Committee carried out a review of the TSR measure and for awards granted from 2007 onwards it was revised from one based on ranking to one operating on the basis of performance relative to the median over the three year performance period, as derived from the TSR performance of the comparator companies.
Measuring performance against the median was adopted in the context of a reducing comparator group, to ensure a robust approach and one less prone to distortions and as being viable for smaller comparator groups.
Vesting was revised as follows: TSR performance % of total award which can be realised Maximum TSR performance 50% of the shares in the award Threshold TSR performance 15% of the shares in the award Threshold TSR performance is set at the median compound growth in TSR of the comparator group and maximum TSR performance is set at median plus 15% per annum compound growth in TSR.
Where TSR performance falls between the threshold and the maximum TSR performance, the percentage of shares which can be realised will be calculated on a straight line sliding scale.
Where TSR falls below median, none of the shares in the award judged by reference to TSR can be realised.
The group of comparator companies for 2007 awards onwards is comprised as follows: Comparator companies Barratt Developments PLC The Berkeley Group plc Taylor Woodrow plc Bellway p. l. c. Persimmon plc Redrow Group plc The EPS growth measure was unaltered for awards granted in 2008, and is based on the extent to which the Companys average annual EPS growth over the three year performance period falls between minimum and maximum EPS growth targets set by the Remuneration Committee as follows: EPS growth % of total award which can be realised Maximum EPS growth 50% of the shares in the award Threshold EPS growth 20% of the shares in the award For 2008 and prior awards, the minimum and maximum EPS growth targets are 4% and 10% per annum above RPI respectively.
Where EPS growth falls between the minimum and maximum EPS growth targets, the number of shares which can be realised will be determined on a straight line sliding scale.
Where EPS growth falls below 4% above RPI, none of the shares in the award judged by reference to EPS growth can be realised.
Bovis Homes Group PLC 33 Report on directors remuneration continued Following a wide consultation with major shareholders, the Remuneration Committee has considered what performance measure is appropriate in regards to EPS growth for awards granted in 2009, and has set absolute levels of EPS to be achieved during the performance period.
The minimum and maximum EPS growth targets are 20p and 50p per share respectively, measured in the third year of the performance period.
Again following consultation, awards granted to executive directors in 2009 did not exceed 80% of basic salary.
The shares required to satisfy the awards have been purchased by the Bovis Homes Group Employee Trust.
The grant price of the awards is set as the market value of the shares at the date of grant.
The market value of the shares attributable to each director will be included in remuneration in the year in which the awards are exercised.
An award may only be exercised within six months of the realisation date, the realisation date being the date of notification from the Trustee of the Bovis Homes Group Employee Trust that the award is realisable in whole or in part.

There were no changes in the holdings of ordinary shares of any of the directors between 31 December 2008 and 6 March 2009, other than the normal monthly investment in partnership shares through the Bovis Homes Group Share Incentive Plan.
The directors interests in share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan are detailed on pages 37 to 38.
There were no changes in the holdings of share options and awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan between 31 December 2008 and 6 March 2009.
LTIP awards granted to Mr Malcolm Harris whilst an executive director continue in force until the third anniversary of the award date and, should either of the two measures of performance be met, the number of shares which can be realised will be reduced according to the proportion of the three year performance period following cessation of employment, measured in complete months, relative to the three year performance period.
Options outstanding for Mr Malcolm Harris as at his date of retirement remain in place for a period of 12 months, during which time they are capable of exercise if performance criteria are met, or otherwise lapse.
Share ownership guidelines There exist guidelines for executive directors in respect of share ownership of Bovis Homes shares.
The Board expects executive directors benefiting from the exercise of Long Term Incentive Plan awards or exercise of share options to retain at least 50% of the net value derived from the exercise, after settling all costs and income tax due, as shares.
This guideline is expected to be applied until such time as the executive director holds shares with a market value equal to current basic annual salary.

Appropriate external independent advice was received as part of this review and changes were approved as follows: Effective Salary on Promotional Experience Inflationary Salary on Change Percentage date 30 June 2008 review review review 1 July 2008 change 000 000 000 000 000 000 % Executive directors D J Ritchie 1 July 2008 315 85 - - 400 85 27.0 N Cooper 1 July 2008 200 - 75 - 275 75 37.5 The salary of Mr Malcolm Harris was not reviewed as a result of his retirement and appointment as non-executive Chairman with effect from 3 July 2008.
Mr David Ritchie became Chief Executive on 3 July 2008, having previously been Group Managing Director.
As a result of this promotion, the Remuneration Committee considered the level of salary appropriate to the position, which was determined by assessment of equivalent salaries of Chief Executives working for other housebuilders and publicly listed companies, taking into account the relative level of experience and the Companys interest in supporting retention.
Aside from the promotional salary increase, no inflationary increase was awarded during 2008.
Mr Neil Cooper commenced as Group Finance Director on 2 January 2007 on a salary reflective of his relative experience in comparison to benchmark salaries at other housebuilders and at other listed companies of a comparable size.
At 1 July 2008 it was considered that Mr Coopers experience had grown and his capabilities in the role had developed and in the view of the Remuneration Committee, his performance had been strong.
Against this background, the Remuneration Committee formed the view that his salary stood a substantial way below a full market rate, which was not in the Companys interests in regard to supporting retention.
Accordingly, Mr Coopers salary was reviewed and increased following analysis of equivalent positions in the UK listed housebuilding sector, as well as by reference to similarly sized companies in the FTSE-250.
His relative experience continued to be taken into account when assessing his new salary level.
The Remuneration Committee continues to view Mr Coopers performance as strong.
Versus FTSE-250 constituents, Mr Coopers new base salary is in line with the average for the lower quartile and 15% below the median salary for FTSE-250 constituents.
Aside from this review, reflecting developments in the role, no inflationary increase was awarded during 2008.
Subsequent to the 1 July 2008 review, the Companys annual salary review date was changed to 1 January each year.
Salaries were reviewed on 1 January 2009 and a standard no rise principle was adopted, with the result that there was no proposal requiring consideration by the Remuneration Committee in respect of the executive directors.
The next review will take place on 1 January 2010.
During 2008, the Company reviewed the level of fees paid to its non-executive directors, supported both by appropriate external independent advice and a benchmarking exercise assessing the fees payable to non-executive directors in similar companies, comparable both in terms of sector and in terms of size.
As a result, fees payable to Mr Colin Holmes have been increased from 40,000 to 45,000, fees payable to Mrs Lesley MacDonagh have been increased from 35,000 to 40,000 and fees payable to Mr John Warren were increased from 45,000 to 52,000 before reverting to 47,000 with the appointment of Mr Alastair Lyons as the Senior Independent Director.
The gains for directors on the exercise of Long Term Incentive Plan awards are shown on page 38.
