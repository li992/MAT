MEMBERSHIP OF THE REMUNERATION COMMIT TEE DURING 2008 Tom Wixley chairman Fred Phaswana Richard Dunne Russell King All members of the committee are non-executive directors, of whom two are independent, including the chairman.
The committee met five times during 2008.
The chief executive officer attends the committee meetings by invitation and assists the committee in its deliberations, except when issues relating to his own compensation are discussed.
No director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.
In 2008, the committee was advised by the Groups finance and human resources functions, the holding companys human resource department, as well as , who assisted with the implementation and verification of calculations pertinent to the executive incentive schemes.
The Companys auditors, Deloitte & Touche, have not provided advice to the committee.
However, in their capacity as Group auditors, they undertake agreed-upon procedures on the remuneration of directors.
REMUNERATION POLICY AND EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION Principles of executive remuneration Anglo Platinums remuneration policy aims to attract and retain high-calibre executives and to motivate them to develop and implement the Companys business strategy in order to optimise long-term shareholder value creation.
The policy conforms to best practice standards and is based on the following principles: Total rewards are set at levels that are competitive within the relevant market.
Incentive-based rewards are earned through the achievement of demanding performance conditions consistent with shareholder interests over the short, medium and long term.
Incentive plans, performance measures and targets are structured to operate effectively throughout the business cycle.
The design of long-term incentives is prudent and does not expose shareholders to unreasonable financial risk.
ANGLO PLATINUM LIMITED 2 0 0 8 152 Elements of executive remuneration Base salary Benefits Annual bonus Long-term incentives The committee seeks to ensure an appropriate balance between the fixed and performance-related elements of executive remuneration, and between those aspects of the package linked to short-term financial performance and those linked to longer-term shareholder value creation.
A further consideration has been the need to retain critical skills in the Group.
The committee considers each element of remuneration relative to the market and takes into account the performance of the Company and the individual executive in determining both quantum and design.
The policy relating to each component of remuneration is summarised below: Base salary The base salary of the executives is subject to annual review.
It is set to be competitive at the median level, with reference to market practice in companies comparable in terms of size, market sector, business complexity and international scope.
Company performance, individual performance and changes in responsibilities are also taken into consideration when determining annual base salaries.
Benefits Benefits for executives include membership of a retirement fund and medical aid, to which contributions are made by the executives and the Company.
Annual bonus All executives are eligible to participate in an annual bonus plan, with payment levels based on corporate and individual performance.
Bonus potentials are set on an individual basis each year.
The bonus plan is non-contractual and not pensionable.
The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to make adjustments to bonuses earned at the end of the year on an exceptional basis, taking into account both Company performance and the overall and specific contribution of individual executives to meeting the Companys objectives.
The performance measures for the annual bonus plan include corporate performance targets as well as specific individual objectives.
The corporate element in 2008 was based upon stringent production, cost and profitability targets.
A reduction is made in cases where safety targets have not been achieved.
The committee reviews measures annually to ensure that these, and the targets set, are appropriate given the economic context and the performance expectations for the Company.
It is the committees policy to base 75% of each annual bonus award on the corporate measures and the remaining 25% on the personal key performance indicators.
Long-term incentives Since 2004, the current set of share incentive schemes, essential details of which are summarised below, has been in operation.
The vesting of awards under the Executive Share Appreciation Scheme and Long-term Incentive Plan is subject to a number of performance conditions, which are designed to align the interests of senior executives with those of the Companys shareholders.
The shareholding requirements for executives outlined below further strengthen the alignment.
These schemes apply to senior executives.
The Kotula Trust was registered during the course of the year and provides for the allocation of shares to employees who were not previously eligible to participate in the long-term incentive schemes.
A new share scheme will be ANGLO PLATINUM LIMITED 2 0 0 8 153 A N N U A L F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S for the year ended 31 December REMUNERATION REPORT presented for approval by shareholders at the Companys annual general meeting to be held on 30 March 2009.
It is proposed that the Bonus Share Plan BSP will largely replace the current Deferred Bonus Plan DBP, Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS and Long-term Incentive Plan LTIP share schemes.
Senior executives will continue to receive allocations on the LTIP scheme and will also participate in the BSP with effect from April 2009.
However, all previous allocations on the ESOS and LTIP will continue to vest over a three-year period and may be exercised in the normal course from date of vesting until a period of 10 years has elapsed or prior to termination of employment, whereupon they lapse.
Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The Remuneration Committee makes allocations of share options to executives on an annual basis.
On 1 March 2008, the Remuneration Committee made an allocation of share options in terms of this scheme to all senior executives.
The option is conditional on performance and is subject to a threeyear vesting period.
The option price is set at the market price on the date immediately prior to allocation.
Shares equal to the value of the growth of the option from the allocation date to the exercise date will be transferred to the participants upon exercising, provided that the performance condition has been met.
The performance condition is an increase in headline earnings per share measured in US dollars of at least 6% over the three-year period.
Options are normally exercisable, subject to satisfaction of the performance condition, between three and ten years from the date of grant.
Long-term Incentive Plan LTIP Annual conditional allocations of LTIP shares are made to senior executives.
The shares vest over a three-year period subject to the achievement of two stringent performance measures over this period: total shareholder return measured against a group of comparable companies, and return on capital employed.
These performance conditions have been selected on the basis that they clearly foster the creation of shareholder value.
The LTIP closely aligns the interests of shareholders and executives by rewarding superior shareholder and financial performance, and by encouraging executives to build up a shareholding in Anglo Platinum.
Deferred Bonus Plan Under the DBP, senior executives are required to defer between 50% and 100% of their bonus on a year-by-year basis net of tax to acquire shares in Anglo Platinum.
If these shares are held for three years, they are matched by the Company on a one-for-one basis or in such specified ratio as determined by the Remuneration Committee, conditional upon the executives continued employment.
Use of this share match will allow Anglo Platinum to maintain competitiveness in annual bonus plan levels and encourage executives to invest in the shares of the Company, thus increasing the proportion of executive rewards linked to both short-term performance and longer-term total shareholder returns.
The deferred bonus and share match will also act as a retention tool, and ensure that senior executives share a significant level of personal risk with the Companys shareholders.
Executive shareholding targets Within five years of their appointment, members of the Executive are expected to accumulate a holding of shares and conditional awards in the Company with a value of 150% of annual base salary for the CEO and 100% of annual base salary in the case of other executives.
In accumulating holdings, executives are not required to use their own funds to purchase shares in the market as it is anticipated thatthe retention of all or a portion of the share incentive awards which they receive will satisfy this goal.
In measuring the extent to which the guidelines have been satisfied, holdings are valued at closing prices at the end of each financial year and base salary is taken at the amount earned in respect of the year just ended.
The current executive shareholding awards as at 31 December 2008 for each of the seven share schemes indicated that the shareholding in Anglo Platinum was more than adequate to fulfil the requirements of the policy.
ANGLO PLATINUM LIMITED 2 0 0 8 154 Former share option plans Certain executives still hold share options granted under the previous Anglo Platinum share option scheme.
The options were allocated at the middle market price ruling on the trading day prior to the date of allocation, vest after stipulated periods and are exercisable up to a maximum of 10 years from the date of allocation.
No allocations of these options to senior executives or executive directors were made after 2004.
Non-conditional LTIPS With effect from 1 March 2008 managers at more junior levels, instead of receiving LTIPS, received non-conditional share awards which have no performance conditions.
The reason for amending the performance conditions attached to these allocations is that managers at these levels are not directly in a position to personally contribute to the attainment of all of the Companys performance criteria.
To qualify for vesting of non-conditional LTIP shares, the only requirements are remaining in the employ of the Group company for three years from date of allocation as well as satisfactorry personal performance assessment ratings.
The rules of the scheme provide for performance criteria which do not have to be company related and therefore the Remuneration Committee was afforded discretion to replace the Company performance conditions with personal performance conditions within the scope confines and intention of the Scheme Rules.
Kotula Trust Employee Share Ownership Plan Anglo Platinum decided to implement the Employee Share Participation Scheme, the Anglo Platinum Kotula ESOP the Scheme to incentivise its employees, and recognised that the Scheme will contribute to the alignment of shareholders and employees interests in respect of the value growth of the Company.
Anglo Platinum is fully supportive of BEE as a strategic transformation objective and recognised the importance of the participation of its employees in its transformation initiatives.
Anglo Platinum reached consensus with its recognised unions on the key terms and structure of the Scheme and the Scheme was approved at a combined general meeting of shareholders on 31 March 2008.
The Scheme has empowered those Anglo Platinum employees who were not participating in any other Anglo Platinum share scheme to acquire approximately 1% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company, subject to the provisions of the Trust.
The Scheme has a seven year term and to faciliate the Scheme, Anglo Platinum established the Kotula Trust.
The Trust subscribed for 1,008,519 ordinary Shares and 1,512,780 A ordinary shares to the Kotula Trust on 16 May 2008.
The A ordinary shares were created specifically to facilitate the implementation of the Scheme.
The Trust will allocate 10,000,000 Kotula shares to participants annually, based on an employees employment status on 31 March every year.
On each vesting date, the beneficiaries will become entitled to receive their distribution shares and will correspondingly realise that portion of their Kotula shares that corresponds to the distribution shares distributed by the Trust.
Vesting will occur on the fifth, sixth and seventh anniversaries of the subscription date.
The Trust will pay dividends after making provision for Trust expenses and liabilities to the beneficiaries in proportion to the number of Kotula shares accumulated by each benficiary, in November of each year.
Bonus Share Plan BSP It was considered that the proposed substitution of the BSP for the previous incentive schemes will provide better alignment between the interests of executives and shareholders and will also facilitate the transfer of skilled employees within the greater Anglo American Group.
In terms of the new plan annual cash bonuses will continue to be awarded based on individual and Company performance.
In addition a forfeitable award of Anglo Platinum shares based on the amount of cash bonus will be made.
The award will vest after three years, provided that the manager is still in the Groups employ.
Cash bonus award to members of staff aged 58 to 60 The Companys long-term incentive share scheme rules do not permit allocations to individuals within two years of retirement.
However, in order to continue to recognise individual performance, value-add and meaningful contributions to the Companys performance by managers from age 58, a cash bonus award has been implemented on 1 March 2008.
The award is based on the estimated fair value of the annual award for executives at a similar level who are not within two years of retirement.
Participants are required to remain in the employ of the Company until the normal retirement age of 60.
