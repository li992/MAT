7598 US GAAP 2008. qxd 19 3 09 15:25 Page 52 52 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 Directors remuneration report Introduction This report meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to Directors remuneration in the Combined Code.
Unaudited information Dear Shareholder The year 2008 was an active one for Shires Remuneration Committee due to the change in leadership in the Group.
The retirement of James Cavanaugh as Chairman and the succession of Matthew Emmens to that role resulted in a series of changes.
These included the promotion of Angus Russell to CEO, and the appointment of Graham Hetherington as CFO.
Shareholders overwhelmingly supported the appointment of each executive to his new position and the Remuneration Committee was responsible for ensuring each individual was paid competitively in his new role.
The Remuneration Committee reviewed competitive remuneration levels for the aforementioned executive directors, as well as below-board executive vice presidents, and confirmed that Shires approach to the remuneration package is well-positioned relative to its competitive market.
In addition, the Committee is satisfied that awards are commensurate with corporate and individual performance.
Upon assuming the leadership of the Group, Angus Russell began a review of Group strategy and vision.
When the strategy was approved by the Board, the Remuneration Committee ensured that the goals set forth in the strategy were closely aligned with the metrics of the short-term incentive plan and the competitive peer group used in assessing long-term performance.
The Committee will continue this work in 2009, as a comprehensive review of total rewards strategy and remuneration programs will be undertaken.
The Remuneration Committee remains committed to a continuing dialogue with shareholders and we take account of your views.
We hope that this report provides helpful context and explanation of the policies and practical considerations that influence our decisions.
Sincerely, Kate Nealon Chair of the Remuneration Committee 7598 US GAAP 2008. qxd 19 3 09 15:25 Page 53 53 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 Directors remuneration report Pound sterling denominated amounts are converted to US dollar amounts at the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 of 1: $1.8542 2007: 1: $2.0010 unless otherwise stated.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee is responsible for developing, reviewing and overseeing the implementation of the Groups compensation and benefits policy.
The Committee is responsible for all elements of the Executive Directors remuneration, and reviews and approves broad policy for the remuneration of senior management and the employee population.
The constitution of the Committee complies with the Combined Code.
During 2008 the Committee reviewed and updated its Terms of Reference to ensure that these effectively reflect its responsibilities.
The Group considers all members of the Committee to be independent.
The members during 2008 were: Kate Nealon, an Independent Non-Executive Director and Chair of the Committee: Patrick Langlois, an Independent Non-Executive Director: Dr Jeffrey Leiden, an Independent Non-Executive Director: and Robin Buchanan, an Independent Non-Executive Director, who served on the Committee through July 28, 2008.
His tenure on the Committee ended concurrent with the end of his Board membership.
The Committee extends its gratitude to Mr Buchanan for his contribution during his years of service.
The Chairman and the CEO attend meetings of the Committee at its invitation, but neither is involved in any decisions relating to his own remuneration.
The Committee was materially assisted in 2008 by Anita Graham, EVP, Chief Administrative Officer.
The following external advisors were appointed by and materially assisted the Committee:  LLP served as the independent advisor to the Committee beginning in March 2008.
In addition,  LLP also provided a broad range of consultancy services to Shire in accounting and related areas in 2008: Deloitte LLP who also provided audit and some tax services to the Group, served as the independent advisors to the Committee through February 2008 and provided data and advice on general issues around the operation of the Groups incentive schemes: and Slaughter and May who also provided general legal advice to the Group provided legal advice on Directors service contracts and the Groups incentive plans.
Key Committee activities for 2008 The Committee met seven times in 2008 and completed the following key activities: approved remuneration arrangements for Matthew Emmens in his new role as Chairman and Angus Russell in his new role as CEO, both effective June 18, 2008.
The Committee also approved remuneration for Graham Hetherington, who joined the Group as CFO effective July 1, 2008: conducted benchmarking studies for below-board executive vice president positions and approved a blended US UK pay approach for benchmarking for their base salaries and total compensation: and conducted a review of reward program effectiveness.
Outcomes from this study will be used in a comprehensive review of reward strategy in 2009.
In addition, the Committee discussed, among other items, the following standing agenda items: review of Executive Directors performance and all components of remuneration: review of Group performance for 2007 against the previously agreed corporate objectives for 2007 and determination of the corporate component of the Groups annual incentive plan: remuneration for members of senior management: performance measures for the 2008 Annual Incentive Plans: long-term incentive grants for current employees and new hires throughout 2008: and employee Stock Purchase Plan and Sharesave scheme offerings.
Executive remuneration policy The Committee considers that an effective remuneration policy, aligned to the Groups business needs, is important to the Groups success.
It directly impacts the Groups ability to recruit, retain and motivate executives of the highest calibre who will be able to deliver sustained value to shareholders, even in the most challenging times.
The Committee also recognizes shareholders focus on the delivery of results and the creation of long-term value and as such, the remuneration policy reflects a pay-for-performance philosophy and alignment to shareholder interests.
The Groups compensation and benefits policy for Executive Directors achieves the above goals through a balanced remuneration program based on the following principles: base pay is market and performance driven, with reference to a blended US UK market comparison group.
It is targeted at or around the median relative to the comparison group, and varies based on individual performance: the Executive Annual Incentive Plan is performance-based and is linked to the achievement of an appropriate mix of corporate and individual performance targets.
The Executive Annual Incentive Plan allows the Group to measure and reward progress against its strategic goals and is closely tied to delivery of sustained shareholder value: share-based compensation is a key element of the Groups remuneration policy as it aligns the interests of the Groups executives with the interests of its shareholders.
This element of compensation also utilises a blended US UK market comparison to determine the face value of awards to Executive Directors: benefits programs are locally competitive and provide for the welfare and well-being of the Groups employees and their families: the Committee currently aims for variable compensation to represent over two-thirds of total remuneration: and the Committee believes that Executive Directors should be encouraged to own shares in the Company in order to ensure the alignment of their interests with those of the Companys shareholders.
Share ownership guidelines have been in effect since 2006.
7598 US GAAP 2008. qxd 19 3 09 15:25 Page 54 54 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 Directors remuneration report In its assessment of corporate and Executive Director performance, the Committee utilizes a Balanced Scorecard Scorecard set of objectives which consider both financial and non-financial measures.
Financial measures include revenue growth, net sales and contribution, as well as management of expense ratios.
Among the non-financial measures are customer care and satisfaction, operational excellence, and the development of people and organizational capabilities.
The Committee regularly monitors the effectiveness of the remuneration policy and reviews this policy based on independent analysis and advice, an understanding of the business drivers and competitive environment in which the Group operates, and ongoing dialogue with shareholders.
In 2008, the Committee maintained the above principles for Executive Directors and, in addition, agreed to adopt the blended US UK benchmarking approach for base pay, total cash and total compensation for the below-board executive vice presidents of the Group.
This approach will be used for benchmarking remuneration with effect from 2009.
The remuneration package The main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors and senior management are: 1 Salary 2 Executive Annual Incentive Plan a Cash Component b Share Component 3 Long-term incentives a Portfolio Share Plan 4 Pension and other benefits While each element of remuneration is reviewed and determined separately, the Committee also considers a total compensation approach when establishing each executives remuneration package.
An appropriate balance is maintained between fixed and performance-related remuneration and between elements linked to short-term financial performance and long-term shareholder value creation.
The Executive Annual Incentive Plan and long-term incentive plans are considered performance-related elements, while base salary is essentially fixed, although performance is considered when determining annual increases.
Assuming on-target performance, the CEOs remuneration is 25% fixed and 75% variable, and the CFOs remuneration is 34% fixed and 66% variable.
The aforementioned fixed percentages exclude pension and other benefits.
CEO CFO 25% Fixed 34% Fixed 21% Performance-related annual bonus 24% Performance-related annual bonus 54% Performance-related long-term incentives 42% Performance-related long-term incentives 1 Salary The Committee reviews salaries annually and utilizes a comparator group that is a blend of US and UK companies with sector, size, complexity, and international characteristics similar to those of the Group.
The Committees policy is for salary to be targeted at or around the median of the blend of US UK comparators.
This approach positions pay comparably to those companies with whom the Group competes for business and talent.
As part of its normal annual salary review process, the Committee reviews competitive market data provided by independent external consultants and US and UK market conditions.
Base salary levels and salary increase decisions for senior management take into account the competitive market data, the Groups budget for performance-related pay increases, and the skills, performance and results achieved by each individual.
Salaries may be positioned below median for employees who are new to their role or under-performing, while salaries for consistently strong performers may be positioned at median or higher.
Based on a review of competitive market data, and on corporate and individual performance results, the following salaries for the CEO and CFO were determined in 2008: Angus Russell received a salary increase to 602,000 $1,116,228 concurrent with his promotion to CEO effective June 18, 2008.
This pay level is below median for comparable roles within the peer group.
Effective January 1, 2009, Mr Russell received a salary increase to 682,000 $1,264,564, which will place him in the bottom quartile for his position.
This increase is a step toward moving his salary to the median over the course of two years, dependent upon continued satisfactory performance.
Graham Hetheringtons salary was set at 400,000 $741,680 when he joined the Group on July 1, 2008.
Effective January 1, 2009 he received a salary increase to 416,000 $771,347, which reflects overall solid performance and an excellent transition into his role.
7598 US GAAP 2008. qxd 19 3 09 15:25 Page 55 55 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 Directors remuneration report 2 Executive Annual Incentive Plan Executive Directors and senior management participate in an Executive Annual Incentive Plan EAIP or Plan, which rewards Group performance based on achievement of pre-defined, Committee-approved corporate objectives.
The EAIP is delivered in a combination of cash, which is delivered shortly after the close of the fiscal year, and restricted shares, which are payable in three years.
The Plan design is meant to provide a strong performance shareholder value orientation and reward executives for the creation of shareholder value.
Both the cash and share-based components of the award are determined based on the achievement of corporate, business and individual objectives.
Corporate objectives are organized in a Scorecard format, which focuses on all areas that drive the success of the business: financial, customer, people and capabilities, and operational excellence.
These objectives include a description of the objective and key performance indicators KPIs, including targets and deadlines.
The extent of the awards under the Plan is determined by the Committee only when exacting levels of performance specified by the KPI have been achieved.
Objectives measured by the Groups financial performance are assessed on the Groups results, as reported in the Groups Annual Report on Form 10-K under US GAAP.
2008 individual objectives for Executive Directors were approved by the Committee.
The detailed objectives and performance standards contain commercially sensitive information and therefore are not detailed here.
However, some of the objectives are summarised below according to the four Scorecard areas for 2008.
Weightings for each of the four Scorecard areas are also provided: 1 Financial targets 40% of Weighting on year revenue growth net sales and contribution of each Business management of expense ratios 2 Customers 15% of Weighting improve customer care and customer service levels across the entire business 3 People and capabilities 15% of Weighting employee retention programs to support leadership and career development for high-potential talent 4 Operational effectiveness 30% of Weighting successful product filings, approvals and launches determination of strategies for therapeutic areas strategies for investment in Group infrastructure The Committee assesses performance against annual objectives in the first quarter of the following year.
The target incentive is paid where Executive Directors have fully achieved their individual objectives and the corporate objectives have been met.
The maximum incentive is paid when the Committee determines that individual and or corporate performance has been exceptional.
Maximum incentive payments for 2008 were capped at 115% of salary in cash and 65% of salary in restricted shares for the CEO and 100% of salary in cash and 55% of salary in restricted shares for the CFO.
For 2008, the Committee made award determinations for Matthew Emmens, pro-rated for his tenure as CEO through June 17, 2008, for Angus Russell, taking into account his performance as CFO until June 17, 2008 and his subsequent transition to CEO and for Graham Hetherington who joined the Group as CFO on July 1, 2008.
In alignment with the rules of the Executive Annual Incentive Plan, Mr Russell received the CEO incentive target for the full year.
The table below outlines the incentive opportunities for each: Weighting of target incentive objectives Target incentive Maximum incentive as a % of salary as a % of salary Corporate Individual Mr Matthew Emmens 65% cash 115% cash 100% Will be taken into account CEO 20% restricted shares 65% restricted shares in determining final award January 1June 17, 2008 Mr Angus Russell 65% cash 115% cash 100% Will be taken into account CFO 20% restricted shares 65% restricted shares in determining final award January 1June 17, 2008 CEO June 18December 31, 2008 Mr Graham Hetherington 55% cash 100% cash 70% 30% CFO 15% restricted shares 55% restricted shares July 1December 31, 2008 7598 US GAAP 2008. qxd 19 3 09 15:25 Page 56 56 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 Directors remuneration report In 2008, Shires performance was very strong in a very challenging market.
The incentive payments awarded to each Executive Director for 2008 reflect that strong corporate performance and individual achievements: Mr Emmens was granted a cash award of 90% of base salary and a share award of 51% of base salary to recognize his performance in 2008.
This award was, in accordance with his employment contract, pro-rated to June 17, 2008 and was based on year-to-date Group performance at the time of Mr Emmens stepping down as CEO.
Mr Russell was awarded a cash award of 95% of base salary and a share award of 54% of base salary based on his performance as CFO and CEO.
Mr Hetherington was awarded a cash award of 69% of base salary and a share award of 39% of base salary based on his performance as CFO from July 1 to December 31 2008.
His incentive award is pro-rated based on his tenure with the Group.
These incentive awards are consistent with the overall performance of the Group in 2008, which included: total revenue growth of 24%: net sales and contribution of each business exceeding its targets: approval and launch of VYVANSE for Adult ADHD: successful M&A activities designed to expand both the marketed and pipeline product set including the acquisition of Jerini : geographical expansion for marketed products into Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Australia, and Russia: and the highly-successful implementation of other Scorecard objectives focused on the continuing growth of the Group.
Employees below senior management participate in a cash-based annual incentive plan that applies the same Scorecard format used for senior management.
Personal objectives were developed for each employee based on 2008 corporate objectives and individual awards are determined based on achievement of individual and corporate objectives.
3 Long-term incentives Long-term incentives in 2008 were granted under the Portfolio Share Plan.
Details are also provided below on legacy incentive plans.
No awards were granted to Executive Directors or any other employee under these legacy plans in 2008: however, awards from grants in previous years continue to vest.
a The Portfolio Share Plan The purpose of the Portfolio Share Plan the Plan is to enable the Group to motivate and reward selected employees by reference to share price performance, and to align the interests of these employees with long-term value creation for shareholders.
Participation in the Plan is discretionary.
Under the Plan, awards granted to Executive Directors will be subject to a performance target, which must, in normal circumstances, be met before the award vests.
Performance targets will normally be measured over a period of not less than three years.
Special rules apply if the participants employment terminates early or on a change in control of the Group.
The Plan is comprised of two parts, which can be operated separately: Part A A Stock Appreciation Right SAR Award is the right to receive shares or American Depositary Shares ADSs in Shire plc linked to the increase in value of a specified number of shares over a period between three and five years from the date of grant and, in the case of Executive Directors, subject to the satisfaction of performance targets.
SAR Awards will normally vest three years after the date of grant, subject to the satisfaction of performance targets in the case of Executive Directors, and can be exercised up to the fifth anniversary of the date of grant.
Part B A Performance Share PSA Award is the right to receive a specified number of shares or ADSs three years from the date of grant.
In the case of Executive Directors, performance targets must be satisfied before a PSA Award vests.
Upon vesting of the PSA Award, shares will be released to the participant automatically without any action on the part of the participant.
The Plan contains individual grant limits set at a face value of six times base salary for SAR awards in any one year and four times base salary for PSA awards in any one year.
It is the Groups intention for awards granted under the Plan to Executive Directors to comprise either or both a SAR Award and a PSA Award.
Ordinarily, it is the Groups intention to provide annual grants to the CEO and CFO with face values calculated by reference to the average share price over the prior twelve month calendar period as follows: for the CEO, equivalent to approximately four times base salary in SARs and three times base salary in PSAs: and for the CFO, equivalent to approximately 2.2 times base salary in SARs and 1.65 times base salary in PSAs.
7598 US GAAP 2008. qxd 19 3 09 15:25 Page 57 57 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 Directors remuneration report Performance criteria Awards under the Plan normally vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant.
In the case of Executive Directors, awards will only vest if the Committee determines that the performance conditions have been satisfied and that, in the opinion of the Committee, the underlying performance of the Group is sufficient to justify the vesting of the award.
Performance criteria are based on relative Total Shareholder Return TSR measured against two comparator groups.
Vesting of one-third of an Award will depend upon the Groups performance relative to the TSR performance of FTSE 100 constituents, excluding financial institutions.
The vesting of the remaining two-thirds of an Award will depend upon the Groups performance relative to the TSR performance of a group of international companies from the pharmaceutical sector see below.
Vesting will be as follows: Percent vesting Performance level achieved 0% Vesting Performance below the median versus the comparator companies and the FTSE 100 33% Vesting Performance at median versus the comparator companies and the FTSE 100 100% Vesting Performance at or above upper quartile performance versus the comparator companies and the FTSE 100 Performance between median and upper quartile versus the comparator companies and the FTSE 100 is calculated from 33% to 100% on a straight-line basis.
For 2008, the comparator group of international companies from the pharmaceutical sector comprised the following companies: Allergan, Inc. Allergan, Altana Aktiengesellschaft Altana, Biovail Corporation Biovail, Cephalon Inc. Cephalon, Forest Laboratories Inc. Forest Labs, King Pharmaceuticals Inc. King, Kos Pharmaceuticals Inc. Kos, H. Lundbeck A S Lundbeck, Medicis Pharmaceutical Corporation Medicis, Novo Nordisk A S Novo Nordisk, Schering AG, Sepracor Inc. Sepracor, Merck Serono S. A. Merck Serono, UCB S. A. UCB, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Valeant, and Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. Watson.
The Committee has the discretion to amend this group of companies to ensure that the group stays both relevant and representative: however, the change must not have the effect of making the performance criteria either materially easier or materially more difficult to achieve, in the opinion of the Committee, than they were immediately before the circumstance in question.
For the 2009 award, the Committee has decided that the comparator group will comprise the following international companies from the pharmaceutical sector.
These companies are aligned with competitors identified in the Groups definition of the strategy in 2008 referred to in the Financial review section of this Annual Report: Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Amgen Inc. Biogen Idec Inc. BioMarin, Biovail, Celgene Corporation, Cephalon, Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc. Forest Labs, Genzyme, Gilead, Ipsen Ltd, King, Lundbeck, Novo Nordisk, UCB.
TSR performance will be measured using an averaging period of three months.
In addition, the Committee will have regard to the same calculation using an averaging period of six months as part of a fairness review to ensure that vesting properly reflects underlying performance.
If the performance conditions are not met, awards will lapse.
Awards made to Executive Directors under the Plan in 2008 are set out in the audited information below.
b Legacy long-term incentive plans The three legacy long-term incentive plans in which some members of senior management participate include the Shire Pharmaceuticals Executive Share Option Scheme, Shire 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme and the Long Term Incentive Plan.
No awards have been granted under these plans in 2008: however, awards from grants in previous years continue to vest.
Shire Pharmaceuticals Executive Share Option Scheme Executive Scheme The last options were granted under the Executive Scheme in 2000.
The Executive Scheme was replaced by the Shire 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme.
Shire 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme 2000 Executive Scheme The last options were granted under the 2000 Executive Scheme in 2005.
All options granted under the 2000 Executive Scheme have vested, with the exception of those granted in 2000.
The 2000 Executive Scheme was replaced by the Portfolio Share Plan in 2005.
Details of the performance conditions attached to options granted under the above schemes are set out in Note 33 to the consolidated financial statements.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP was adopted in 1998 and amended in 2000.
The last awards were granted under this plan in 2005.
Performance tied to the vesting of the 2005 LTIP grants resulted in a vesting percentage of 88.54%.
Awards will be satisfied by the transfer of shares in May 2009.
The awards for each of the Executive Directors are as follows: Matthew Emmens will receive 86,298 shares.
Angus Russell will receive 55,972 shares.
Details of the performance condition attached to awards made under the LTIP are set out in Note 33 to the consolidated financial statements.
7598 US GAAP 2008. qxd 19 3 09 15:25 Page 58 58 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 Directors remuneration report 4 Share ownership guidelines The Committee believes that Executive Directors and certain other members of senior management should be encouraged to own shares in Shire plc in order to ensure the alignment of their interests with those of Shire plcs shareholders.
The Executive Share Ownership Guidelines are administered by the Committee and are based on the following principles: the Committee believes that share ownership is an important element of an executives role in leading the Group and represents both a commitment by the executive as well as an alignment of the executives interests with those of shareholders: the Committee believes that share ownership by executives should be strongly encouraged, but not mandated: the Committee understands that, depending on personal and other circumstances, an executive may not be able to achieve the desired level of share ownership: the Committee believes that executives should understand the importance of share ownership in the stewardship of the Group, and both appropriate time and latitude will be provided to executives to achieve desired share ownership levels, where possible: and share ownership levels will be reviewed annually for each executive.
Executives are encouraged, within a five-year period following the later of either the initiation of these guidelines, or their appointment or election, to attain and hold an investment position no less than the multiples of base salary set forth below.
The following are the guideline share ownership levels for the Executive Directors: CEO: 2 x base salary.
All shares beneficially owned by an executive excluding unexercised vested Stock Options or SARs count towards achieving these guidelines.
The Committee reviews share ownership levels for each executive on an annual basis.
The Committee will discuss with each Executive Director their plans for share ownership on a regular basis: the CEO will discuss with each of the remaining executives their plans for share ownership on a regular basis.
5 Pension and other benefits The Groups policy is to ensure that pension benefits are competitive in the markets in which Shire operates.
For Mr Emmens, who was based in the US, Shire contributed 30% of his annual salary to a Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan SERP and 401 k Plan in the US.
The SERP is an unfunded defined contribution scheme: the benefits are payable to certain senior US employees as lump sums on leaving the Groups employment or earlier due to death, disability or termination.
The amount of benefit is based on the value of notional contributions adjusted for earned investment returns as if they were invested in investments of the employees choice.
In the UK, Shire operates a defined contribution scheme.
The Group contributed 25% of salary towards pension benefits for Mr Russell during his time as CFO and 30% during his time as CEO.
The Group contributed 25% of salary towards pension benefits for Mr Hetherington for his time as CFO.
In addition to pension benefits, the Executive Directors receive certain benefits in kind, principally a car or car allowance, life insurance, private medical insurance and dental cover.
These benefits are not pensionable.
Service contracts The Committee believes that Executive Directors service contracts should be for a rolling term and, for UK contracts, incorporate notice periods of twelve months.
The Committee also believes that the Group should retain the right to make a payment in lieu of notice to a Director.
The contracts contain obligations on the Executive Directors in respect of intellectual property, together with post-termination restrictions.
The Committees view is that, in the event of early termination, Executive Directors should be treated fairly but paid no more than is necessary.
Moreover, there should be no element of reward for failure.
Mr Emmens was Chief Executive Officer of Shire until June 18, 2008 and then became Non-Executive Chairman.
His terms of appointment are set out in a letter dated June 11, 2008.
Mr Emmens was entitled to receive his base salary and annual bonus for the period up to the date on which he became Non-Executive Chairman but not other payments.
As Chairman he is not entitled to bonus or to be granted further awards under Shire share schemes.
He continues to participate in the Group medical plan.
Mr Russells contract is dated July 2, 2008.
His previous contract was revised to reflect his new role as CEO and incorporated contract provisions reflecting current best practice for Executive Directors contracts.
Mr Hetheringtons contract is dated July 2, 2008.
Mr Russells and Mr Hetheringtons contracts require them to give Shire twelve months notice.
Shire is required to give Mr Russell and Mr Hetherington twelve months notice of termination, other than if termination is for cause.
7598 US GAAP 2008. qxd 19 3 09 15:25 Page 59 59 Shire plc Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended December 31, 2008 Directors remuneration report The contracts contain phased payment provisions which would entitle Shire to terminate an Executive Directors employment and make a severance payment not as a lump sum but in monthly instalments over the length of the notice period.
These provisions allow the payments to be reduced, or eliminated entirely, by income obtained by the director from a new post.
In the event of termination of employment within twelve months of a change in control, the amount payable to Mr Russell and Mr Hetherington is one years salary and the cash equivalent of one years pension, car and other contractual benefits.
Any annual bonus payable is at the discretion of the Committee and is capped at the contractual maximum level.
The amount of annual bonus payable upon termination of employment in any other circumstances, other than for cause, is at the discretion of the Committee and is capped at the contractual target level.
Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman Each Non-Executive Director is paid a fee for serving as a Director and additional fees are paid for membership or chairmanship of the Audit, Risk & Compliance, Remuneration, Nomination and Science & Technology Committees.
The Chairman of the Group receives an inclusive fee.
Fees are determined by the Executive Directors and the Chairman, with the exception of the Chairmans fee which is determined by the Committee and confirmed by the Board.
Fees are benchmarked against Chairman and Non-Executive Director fees of comparable companies.
The fees paid to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are not performance-related.
Details of fees paid to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors in 2008 are set out in the table below.
The Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to join the Groups pension scheme.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the Group share schemes or other employee benefit schemes and no options have been granted to Non-Executive Directors in their capacity as Non-Executive Directors of Shire plc.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed ordinarily for a term of two years, subject to shareholder approval.
Non-Executive Directors who have served on the Board for nine years or more are appointed for one-year terms and, in accordance with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, are subject to annual re-election by shareholders.
Re-appointment of Non-Executive Directors following the expiry of their term of appointment is subject to Board approval.
Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to compensation for loss of office.
Details of the unexpired terms of the letters of appointment and notice periods are as follows: Date of Date of Notice Director appointment term expiry period Matthew Emmens 06.18.08 06.17.10 3 months Dr Barry Price 01.25.09 01.24.10 3 months David Kappler 04.05.08 04.04.10 3 months Patrick Langlois 11.11.07 11.10.09 3 months Kate Nealon 07.27.08 07.26.10 3 months Dr Jeffrey Leiden 01.01.09 12.31.10 3 months David Mott 10.31.07 10.30.09 3 months Dr Michael Rosenblatt 04.24.08 04.23.10 3 months The fee policy structure for Non-Executive Directors NED, effective January 1, 2008 and January 1, 2009 is presented in the table below: 2008 2009 Annual fees $ $ Board membership Chairman of the Board inclusive of all Committees 546,989 630,428 Deputy Chairman and Senior Independent Non-Executive Director inclusive of NED fee 120,523 152,972 Non-Executive Director 97,346 129,794 Committee membership Audit, Compliance & Risk Committee Chair 37,084 37,084 Remuneration Committee Chair 23,178 23,178 Nomination Committee Chair 23,178 23,178 Science & Technology Committee Chair 23,178 23,178 Audit, Compliance & Risk Committee member 18,542 18,542 Remuneration Committee member 13,907 13,907 Nomination Committee member 9,271 9,271 Science & Technology Committee member 13,907 13,907 The fee policy structure was updated for 2009 to reflect a blended US UK approach to benchmarking, consistent with that applied to the Executive Directors.

This comparator group is a blend of US and UK companies with sector, size, complexity and international characteristics similar to those of the Group.
The Group is a member of the FTSE 100 Index and consequently, for the purpose of the graphs which are set out below, we have selected the FTSE 100 Index excluding financial institutions as the appropriate index.
These comparisons will also be used to determine achievement of performance conditions relating to the Portfolio Share Plan.

Directors share options Aggregate emoluments disclosed above do not include any amounts for the value of options to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company granted to or held by the Directors.
Directors have been granted options over Ordinary Shares under the Shire Pharmaceuticals Executive Share Option Scheme Parts A and B Executive Scheme, the Shire 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme Parts A and B 2000 Executive Scheme, the Shire Sharesave Scheme Sharesave Scheme and the Shire Employee Stock Purchase Plan Stock Purchase Plan.
Details of options over Ordinary Shares exercised during the year are as follows: Exercise Market price Gains on Number of price at exercise exercise Director Scheme options date 2008 Matthew Emmens 2000 Executive Scheme B 17,279 3.683 9.01 171 10,432 5.26 9.01 73 9,511 5.585 9.01 60 Details of the options of Directors who served during the year are as follows: Number of ADSs Exercise dates At At Exercise January December price Director Scheme 1, 2008 Granted Exercised Lapsed 31, 2008 $ Earliest Latest iv Matthew Emmens Stock Purchase Plan 166 166 62.58 11.01.08 11.01.08 One ADS is equal to three Ordinary Shares.
If Shires share price increases at a compound rate of 14.5% per annum over a minimum three-year measurement period, 60% of the options may be exercised.
If these conditions are not met after the initial three years, they are thereafter tested quarterly by reference to share price growth over the extended period.
If the share price does not meet these conditions at any time, none of the options granted become exercisable.
ii Options granted under the Sharesave Scheme are granted with an exercise price equal to 80% of the mid-market price on the day before invitations are issued to employees.
Employees may enter into three or five-year savings contracts.
iii Options granted under the 2000 Executive Scheme are exercisable subject to certain performance criteria.
In respect of any option granted prior to August 2002, if Shires Ordinary Share price increases at a compound rate of at least 20.5% per annum over a minimum three-year measurement period, the option becomes exercisable in full.
If it increases by at least 14.5% per annum over the same three-year period, 60% of the options granted become exercisable.
If these conditions are not met after the initial three-year measurement period, they will thereafter be tested quarterly by reference to compound annual share price growth over an extended period.
The performance criteria were reviewed in 2002 to ensure the criteria reflected the market in which Shire operates.
Given Shires development, it was considered appropriate that an earnings per share-based measure should be adopted in place of share price growth targets.
The performance criteria are based on real growth in the diluted earnings per share reported in the Groups Form 10-K under US GAAP, adjusted to ensure a consistent basis of measurement, as approved by the Remuneration Committee, including the add-back of significant one-time items option EPS.
Therefore, the performance criteria were amended so that an option would become exercisable in full if Shire plcs option EPS growth over a three-year period from the date of award exceed the UK Retail Prices Index RPI for the following tranches of grants: Options with a grant value of up to 100% of salary RPI plus 9% Directors, RPI plus 15% Between 101% and 200% of salary RPI plus 15% Between 201% and 300% of salary RPI plus 21% Over 301% of salary RPI plus 27% The RPI-based earnings per share performance criteria applied to options granted under the 2000 Executive Scheme from August 2002.
After consultation with certain institutional shareholders, the Group decided that, for options granted under the scheme from 2004 onwards, the performance condition will be retested once only, at five years after the grant, if Shires option EPS growth falls short of the minimum annual average percentage increase over the three-year period from grant.
Hence the level of option EPS growth in the next two years needs to be consequentially higher to meet the test.
In December 2006 the Committee exercised its powers to amend the performance conditions for options granted under the 2000 Executive Scheme which had not vested.
The RPI-based growth rate was replaced with an equivalent fixed growth rate based on historical and forecast inflation.
Under Part B of the scheme, six weeks prior to the expiration date, any options that have not become exercisable at an earlier date, automatically vest without reference to the performance criteria.
iv Under the Stock Purchase Plan, options are granted with an exercise price equal to 85% of the fair market value of a share on the enrolment date the first day of the offering period or the exercise date the last day of the offering period, whichever is the lower.
Following approval by shareholders at the AGM held on June 20, 2007 the 2007 Shire Employee Stock Purchase Plan was adopted on similar terms to the predecessor plan save that participants agree to save for a period up to 27 months, rather than a fixed 27 months, as set by the Committee.
The offering period set for plan grants in 2008 was twelve months.
