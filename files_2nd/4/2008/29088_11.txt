This report sets out the role and remit of the Remuneration Committee and its membership.
It describes Remuneration the Groups overall remuneration policy and gives details of the compensation arrangements for report Directors for the year ended 31 December 2008.
The report has been prepared on behalf of the Board in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as amended and the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
38 39 Role of the Committee The Committees role is to review and approve the remuneration strategy and policies for the Group including a responsible approach to the Groups annual compensation review.
It also determines the remuneration of the executive Directors, and monitors the level and structure of remuneration for senior management.
The Committee reviewed its terms of reference in December 2008 having regard to regulatory guidance during the year from the FSA and proposed minor amendments which were approved by the Board on 10 February 2009.
The full terms of reference of the Committee are available at www.
com or from the Company Secretary.
Composition of the Committee The current members of the Committee are: Sir Peter Job Chairman Andrew Beeson Lord Howard joined the Committee on 17 December 2008 Kevin Parry stood down from the Committee on 17 December 2008 when it was announced that he would become Chief Financial Officer with effect from 1 January 2009.
The Committee met six times in 2008 and there was full attendance at all meetings.
Other non-executive Directors, as well as the Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and senior Human Resources executives, attend by invitation but play no part in the determination of their own remuneration arrangements.
The Committee took advice from , McLagan and Hewitt Associates Limited in the past year.
Hewitt New Bridge Street a trading arm of Hewitt Associates Limited and  provided advice to the Committee and to management on equity incentive plans.
McLagan provided the Committee with an interpretation of external market compensation levels and practices.
Hewitt Associates Limited provided advice to the Committee and management on domestic and international pensions issues, as well as acting as the actuarial advisers to, and administrators of, the UK pension scheme.
 are the Groups external auditors and also provide other non-audit services to the Group.
Remuneration policy The Groups remuneration policy is designed to attract, motivate and retain the talent the Group needs to achieve its strategic objectives, whilst ensuring that the ratio of total compensation costs to a measure of net operating revenues for the Group is within a target determined by the Board ahead of the financial year as part of the annual budget process.
At the end of each financial year the Committee is advised of the level of fixed compensation expense and approves the amount distributable as variable compensation across the Group.
The ratio of total compensation costs to operating revenues in 2008 was 45 per cent.
The Committee believes that total compensation should reflect the global competition for talent in an industry in which successful people are well rewarded and mobile.
The Group compensates all of its employees, including executive Directors, through both fixed and variable compensation.
Fixed compensation, in the form of base salary, pension and other benefits, continues to be relatively low for the executive Directors compared with other companies in the FTSE 100 Index.
Variable compensation in the form of cash bonuses and deferred bonuses may be high, particularly in years of strong performance.
Governance The remuneration of executive Directors is structured in a manner which reflects performance, at both an individual and Group level.
A significant portion of an executive Directors bonus is deferred which results in the accumulation of rights to shares in the Company and investments in Schroders managed funds.
Group policy is to avoid guaranteed compensation where possible but recognises that there will be times when this forms part of the initial package necessary to recruit senior employees.
No executive Director has any guarantee.
It remains the Committees practice and intention to grant share options sparingly, principally to assist in recruitment where necessary.
Key developments During the year the Committee considered papers presented on a variety of topics including: 2007 and 2008 annual compensation reviews: The shareholding requirements for members of the Group Management Committee: The forthcoming triennial valuation of the UK pension scheme: and Options for orientating the Companys reward structure more towards the longer term.
The Committee reviewed the existing remuneration policy and, among other factors, considered the ABI guidance on policies and practices in executive remuneration together with the initial guidance produced by the FSA in relation to compensation practices.
The Committee concluded that the Groups remuneration policy was appropriately aligned to our business strategy, was likely to remain broadly in line with regulatory guidance, having particular regard to the management of risk within incentive arrangements, and that the policy within the Group was therefore fit for purpose.
Developments since the last report: The Equity Compensation Plan was amended at the 2008 annual general meeting to allow dividends to accrue in respect of share awards held for more than five years from their date of grant: The Committee further determined to amend the Equity Compensation Plan to encourage participants to maintain investments within Schroders funds.
The Committee amended the rules to allow fund awards to be held until the fifth anniversary of their date of grant.
Previously fund awards were subject to a deemed exercise on the third anniversary of their date of grant: and The Committee introduced the Equity Incentive Plan, a new equity based, long term plan to operate within the compensation cost to operating revenue ratio.
Elements of the compensation package Base salary The Committee reviews the base salaries of executive Directors annually having regard to base salary levels for comparable roles in other companies in the FTSE 100 Index and in asset management competitors.
Having taken into account all relevant factors, the Committee decided not to increase executive Directors salaries for 2009.
Base salary is the only element of remuneration that is pensionable, with the level of contribution into the UK pension scheme being subject to a notional earnings cap see notes to the accounts Retirement benefit obligations.
Benefits Remuneration Executive Directors can participate in the Groups flexible benefits plan on the same basis as other report UK employees.
In response to the changes in pension legislation that came into effect in April 2006 in the UK, 40 41 employees who choose not to accrue benefits in the pension scheme, apart from life assurance cover, receive a taxable cash allowance in lieu.
This allowance is set at a level to ensure that the cost impact, including employer National Insurance, is neutral to the Group.
Two executive Directors received such an allowance in 2008.
Variable compensation The policy is to recognise corporate performance and individual achievement of objectives through bonus.
The bonus pool overall is established by reference to the compensation to net operating revenues ratio established by the Committee for each financial year.
Discretionary bonus awards are delivered in two forms: a cash bonus and a deferred bonus.
The deferral is mandatory and delivered via the Equity Compensation Plan.
The level of mandatory deferral is determined by the Committee in accordance with a matrix that is agreed in advance of the annual compensation review.
of executive Directors bonuses were deferred.
Management assesses individual performance through clearly defined objectives and a structured process of review and feedback.
Bonus awards are determined with regard to the performance of the individual, performance of the area or function of the business in which the individual works or for which the individual is responsible, the profitability of the Group and levels of reward for comparable roles in the external market.
Given that our remuneration structure places a high emphasis on variable compensation and that the overall bonus pool is set in relation to operating revenues, the Committee does not consider it appropriate to set a cap on discretionary bonus awards at the individual level.
Of the total variable compensation awarded to all employees in the Group in 2008, the proportion that was deferred through the granting of awards amounted to 25.9 per cent.
was granted as share awards.
The balance between the fixed and variable elements of the total compensation package for each of the executive Directors is shown in figure 1.

Governance Equity Compensation Plan 2000 Key employees receive part of their earned bonus in the form of deferred awards under the Equity Compensation Plan on terms designed to align their interests with those of shareholders and to retain their services.
These awards do not give rise to any immediate entitlement but may be exercised in full from the third anniversary of the grant date provided that the participant continues to be employed by the Group.
If a participant resigns before the three years have elapsed then the following forfeiture provisions apply as at the date of resignation: Completed years of service from date of award: Less than 1 1 and 2 2 and 3 Percentage of award forfeited: 100% 66.7% 33.3% This Plan allows deferred awards to be granted in either share awards, fund awards or a combination of both.
In general the first 50,000 of the deferred bonus award is delivered in share awards and any balance, subject to a minimum fund award of 10,000, is delivered equally in share awards and fund awards.
The level of fund awards may vary in certain locations where local practice or legal restrictions restrict or preclude the use of fund awards.
Equity Compensation Plan awards are not subject to further performance conditions as they are considered as already having been earned by reference to performance.
Share awards Share awards can be granted over either ordinary or non-voting ordinary shares in the Company and are normally structured as rights to acquire shares at nil cost.
Historically, awards under this Plan were made over non-voting ordinary shares.
As a result of a resolution approved at the 2006 Annual General Meeting share awards are made, wherever possible, in respect of ordinary shares.
At the third anniversary of the date of grant the award is increased by 20 per cent.
To the extent that the employee chooses to leave the award within the Equity Compensation Plan until the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, the award is increased by a further 11.1 per cent.
No dividend is paid in respect of share awards prior to the fifth anniversary of their date of grant.
At the 2008 Annual General Meeting a resolution was passed to enable awards to be adjusted to reflect the dividends paid on shares starting with the fifth anniversary of grant and ending with the date on which awards are exercised.
If not previously exercised, share awards will be deemed to have been exercised on the tenth anniversary of their date of grant.
Fund awards Fund awards are notional investments in a range of Schroders investment funds and can be granted by the Committee as an alternative to share awards.
They give each holder a personal interest in the performance of one or more of the funds which they select.
These fund awards will be re-valued in line with the performance of the selected products and will be paid out in cash upon exercise.
If not previously exercised, fund awards will be deemed to have been exercised on the fifth anniversary of their date of grant.
Equity Incentive Plan 2008 The Equity Incentive Plan was introduced in 2008 to increase the alignment of participants and shareholders through the grant of awards in respect of shares in the Company.
Executive Directors are not eligible for participation in the Equity Incentive Plan.
Awards may be exercised in full after five years from their date of grant.
If a participant resigns before the five years have elapsed then the following forfeiture provisions apply as at the date of resignation: Completed years of service from date of award: Less than 3 3 and 4 4 and 5 Percentage of share award forfeited: 100% 66.7% 33.3% Awards are adjusted to reflect dividends paid on shares during the period from the grant of the award to the date on which the award is exercised.
If not previously exercised, awards will be deemed to have been exercised on the tenth anniversary of their date of grant.
Share Option Plan 2000 Remuneration Under the Share Option Plan 2000, the Company has granted market value share options over nonreport voting ordinary shares.
Options usually become exercisable if the option holder remains with the Group for at least three years and, for executive Directors, if the performance target has been met at the third anniversary.
Share options granted to other employees have no performance conditions.
42 43 In line with market practice, the performance target is that the Companys earnings per share growth defined as the earnings per ordinary share before any items considered exceptional, as derived from the Companys Annual Report and Accounts must be at least four per cent.
per annum above the increase in the Retail Price Index over a three-year period.
There is no re-test if the target is not met after three years.
This performance target is a general condition and standard for each executive Director.
Hewitt New Bridge Street assesses the performance criteria calculations for the Committee.
Employee shares The Share Incentive Plan that was introduced in 2006 for all UK-based employees is also helping to broaden the number of employee shareholders.
Each of the executive Directors as at 31 December 2008 and 713 other employees are now members of the Plan representing 60 per cent.
Total employees rights to ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares under employee share plans were 8.3 per cent.
of the total ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares in issue as at 31 December 2008.
Personal shareholding policy In order to align the interests of the most senior employees with those of shareholders, the executive Directors and the other members of the Group Management Committee are required, over time, to acquire and retain a target holding of Schroders shares and or rights to shares, equivalent to 300 per cent.
Rights to shares include the after tax value of share awards granted subject to the rules of the Equity Compensation Plan including rights granted on 23 February 2009.
For each executive Director as at 31 December 2008, based upon the share prices at close of business on 31 December 2008, this target has been achieved.
Performance graph The following performance graph shows the Companys total shareholder return performance, comprising share price movements plus the value of dividends reinvested, compared to the FTSE 100 Index.
This index was chosen by the Committee because it is the principal index in which the Companys shares were quoted throughout the performance period.
The graph below shows the annual percentage change in the value over each financial year of an initial amount invested in Schroders plc on 31 December 2003 to 31 December 2008 compared with the same initial amount invested in each of the companies making up the FTSE 100 Index.

When recruiting executive Directors, the Committees policy is that contracts should not contain any provision for compensation upon early termination and that the parties should rely on employment rights conferred by law.
In the event that compensation for early termination is payable, the Committees policy is to seek to keep such compensation to an appropriate level.
