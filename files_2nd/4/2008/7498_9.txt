Remuneration report This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 the 'Act' and has been approved by the Board and the Remuneration Committee.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the Principles of Good Governance relating to directors remuneration.
A resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
The Act requires the external auditors to report on certain parts of the report and to state whether, in their opinion, those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with it.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information Remuneration Committee Role The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining and agreeing with the Board the pay, benefits and contractual arrangements for the executive directors of the Company including the Executive Chairman and other members of the Executive Board.
It aims to develop and recommend remuneration strategies that drive performance and reward it appropriately.
In determining its policy, the Committee has paid regard to the principles and provisions of good governance contained in the Combined Code published in July 2003 by the UK Financial Reporting Council as updated in June 2006 the Code.
The Committee operates under the delegated authority of the Board and its terms of reference are available on the Companys website.
Membership During the year, the Committee was chaired by JM Barry Gibson.
John Maxwell and Ian Chippendale also served on the Committee.
All of its members are independent non-executive directors.
Meetings Attendance at Committee meetings held during the year and the number of meetings held is set out on page 40.
Advisers During the year Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS, a firm of independent remuneration consultants, served as advisers to the Committee.
The Company also instructed HNBS to advise it on a limited number of remuneration matters during the year.
Other than in relation to advice on remuneration, HNBS has no other connections with the Company.
The terms of engagement for HNBS are available on the Companys website.
The Committee has also received assistance from Brian Whitty, the Groups Executive Chairman, Richard Harpin, the Chief Executive, Emma Thomas, the Group Company Secretary and from his appointment in January 2008 Martin Sawkins, the Group HR Director, all of whom attended meetings of the Committee as required.
None took part in discussions in respect of matters relating directly to their own remuneration.

indd 42 5 6 08 14:54:16 Remuneration policy The Committees remuneration policy for the remuneration of executive directors and other senior executives is based on the following principles: to provide a remuneration package that is sufficient, but no more than necessary, to attract, retain and motivate high calibre executives: to align rewards with the Groups performance: to reward good performance with remuneration that is in line with that payable by broadly comparable businesses i. e. high-growth companies of similar size and those with similar operating characteristics: to reward exceptional performance in such a way as to align the executives interests with those of the Companys shareholders, delivering upper quartile rewards for upper quartile performance.
To that end, the Committee structures executive remuneration in two distinct parts: fixed remuneration of basic salary, pension and benefits and variable performance-related remuneration in the form of a cash bonus and long-term incentive arrangements.
Remuneration for executive directors is structured so that the variable pay element forms a significant portion of each directors package.
The charts below demonstrate the balance between fixed and variable pay at on-target and maximum performance levels, in the case of the long-term incentive arrangements assuming certain levels of share price growth.
Maximum performance assumes the achievement of maximum bonus and full vesting of shares under the Companys long-term incentive arrangements.
They demonstrate the significant weighting of the package towards variable performance-related pay.
In particular, the majority of executive directors total remuneration at the maximum performance level will derive from the Companys long-term incentive arrangements, which are strongly aligned to shareholder value creation.
On-target remuneration Maximum remuneration Fixed pay 46% Fixed pay 21% Short term variable pay 22% Short term variable pay 16% Long term variable pay 32% Long term variable pay 63% Homeserve Annual Report & Accounts 2008 43 78658 Middle.

indd 44 5 6 08 14:54:16 Remuneration for executive directors The main components of the remuneration package for executive directors are: Basic salary Basic salary for each executive director is determined by the Remuneration Committee taking into account the roles, responsibilities, performance and experience of the individual.
This is normally reviewed annually with any increase usually being effective from 1 April unless responsibilities change.
Salary levels are determined taking into account market data on salary levels for similar positions at comparable companies.
Following a review undertaken by HNBS in March 2008, the Committee has determined that the most appropriate comparator group against which to benchmark executive directors basic salaries is the top-half of the FTSE-250 Index reflecting the increased size and profile of the Company, taking into account the roles, responsibilities and experience of each director.
Basic salaries were increased by an average of 8% on 1 April 2008, reflecting the results of HNBSs review and the fact that in 2007, increases in basic salaries were limited to 3%, in line with the average of increases awarded to senior managers across the Group.
In March 2007, Jon Florsheim joined the Group as Chief Executive of Homeserve Membership, from British Sky Broadcasting plc BSkyB.
The Committee recognised that, in order to attract a senior executive of his calibre and background, it would be necessary to offer a remuneration package comparable with that previously payable to him at BSkyB.
Accordingly, the Committee, agreed to depart from its existing remuneration policy.
His basic annual salary of 450,000 on appointment increased by inflation to 463,500 on 1 April 2008, exceeds the upper quartile of those payable to directors with similar roles and responsibilities in the Committees chosen comparator group but was comparable with that paid to him at BSkyB.
Annual bonus The annual bonus is designed to drive and reward excellent short term operating performance of the Company and encourage real year-on-year growth in profitability.
No annual bonus is paid unless a very high level of profit performance is achieved.
The maximum annual bonus for 2008 9 will be maintained at 100% of basic salary with the exception of Jon Florsheim whose maximum bonus potential is unchanged at 150% of salary.
During the year, executive directors were able to earn up to 80% of bonus potential for Group financial performance, measured by profit before tax, amortisation and exceptional items.
No bonus was payable unless the Companys profits achieved growth of at least 20% in comparison with the previous year.
The remaining 20% of bonus potential was based on measurable personal targets, relating to the part of the business or the function for which the director is responsible.
The weighting between business and personal objectives will remain 80% financial: 20% personal for 2008 9.
Provided their personal objectives are met in full, the normal on-target bonus payable to executive directors in any year is expected to be in the region of 60% of their basic salary 90% for Jon Florsheim.
In the current year, and in future years, executive directors bonuses will be payable entirely in cash.
This differs from bonus arrangements in recent years, where any bonus earned in excess of 75% of the maximum amount was compulsorily invested in the Deferred Bonus Plan DBP.
The change to the Committees policy on the compulsory deferral of an element of the bonus reflects its intention to adopt revised long-term incentive arrangements and not to make future awards under the DBP as outlined below.

indd 45 5 6 08 14:54:16 Remuneration report Long-term incentives For the 2008 9 financial year, the Committees policy for the provision of long-term incentives to executive directors will be to grant awards of performance shares performance awards and to provide them with the opportunity to voluntarily invest up to 75% of any bonus received into a matching share arrangement matching awards under a new scheme the new LTIP to be proposed to the Companys shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Further details of the new LTIP and the Committees rationale for wishing to introduce such a scheme are contained in the Shareholder Circular, but the key elements of the new LTIP are as follows: The new LTIP is a single, simple and flexible scheme designed to replace the Companys existing long-term incentive arrangements, comprising the Executive Share Option Plan ESOP, Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP and Deferred Bonus Plan DBP and to reflect current best practice: It is designed to align the executive directors rewards with the interests of the Companys shareholders: The Committee may set different targets for each new award but it is initially intended that awards made under the new LTIP performance and matching awards will be linked to the achievement of stretching Total Shareholder Return TSR targets, with 25% of the awards vesting for TSR equal to the FTSE-250 Index, increasing in a straight line to 100% vesting where TSR performance exceeds the Index by 15 percentage points per annum.
In determining the number of awards that will vest in any year, the Committee will also take into account the underlying financial performance of the business and: Maximum awards under the new LTIP to executive directors will be 200% of basic salary for performance awards and matching awards of up to 2 shares for 1 share invested by the executive director, based on a maximum investment of the net of tax equivalent of 75% of the maximum bonus potential.
Awards in 2008 will be limited to 150% of salary for performance awards and at the maximum level for matching awards.
The proposed awards are comparable to the potential available under the Companys existing policy for long-term incentive schemes.
The new LTIP will also permit the grant of restricted share awards which may or may not be subject to performance conditions.
However, these will only be granted in exceptional circumstances, for example in recruitment situations to buy-out an incoming directors existing awards.
The Committee considers that the new LTIP supports its overall policy to reward good performance in line with that payable by broadly comparable businesses and to reward exceptional performance in such a way as to align executives interests with those of its shareholders.
It provides a simple and consistent framework for executive reward, in a structure that is fully aligned to the Companys strategic objectives, and the total level of remuneration delivered thereby is no higher than under the schemes which it replaces.
Awards under the new LTIP may be satisfied through a mixture of either market purchase or new issue shares.
To the extent new issue shares are used, the new LTIP will adhere to a 5% in 10 year dilution limit.
Executive directors may also participate in the Groups Save As You Earn Scheme where share options are exercisable after three or five years at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares at the time of grant and in the Share Incentive Plan on the same basis as all other employees.
No performance criteria are attached to these schemes.
Benefits Non-pension benefits comprise company car and fuel allowance and medical insurance.
The range of benefits and their value are considered to be broadly in line with those provided to executive directors in similar companies in the FTSE-250.

indd 46 5 6 08 14:54:17 Shareholding guidelines It is the Boards policy that executive directors and certain members of the Companys senior management build up and retain a minimum shareholding in the Company.
Each executive director is encouraged to hold shares of at least equal value to his annual basic salary.
Accordingly, if the holding guideline has not been fulfilled at the point of exercise of any option or the vesting of any other long-term incentive award, the director must retain 50% of the net proceeds in the Companys shares until the holding requirement is achieved.
Service contracts The Committees policy is to offer service contracts with notice periods of one year or less other than, in exceptional circumstances, where longer initial notice periods may be offered on appointment, and then reduced to one year over time.
All executive directors contracts of service are terminable on twelve months notice by either party.
Further details of the executive directors contracts are summarised in the table below: Name of director Date of contract B H Whitty 28 March 1996 R D Harpin 18 January 2002 J Florsheim 5 March 2007 I Carlisle 1 April 2005 J Simpson-Dent 18 May 2007 Liquidated damages are limited to the payment of one years remuneration, including benefits.
Notice periods and payments are not extendable in takeover situations.
Pensions Executive directors currently participate in one of two pension schemes, the Water Companies Pension Scheme WCPS or the Homeserve Money Plan HMP.
The normal date of retirement for executive directors is at age 60.
Both arrangements are non-contributory for executive directors.
The WCPS is a funded, Inland Revenue approved occupational defined benefit scheme.
Brian Whitty, Richard Harpin and Ian Carlisle are members of the WCPS.
In respect of these directors, its main features are: pension at normal retirement age of one-half of final pensionable salary and a tax free lump sum of one and a half times final pensionable salary on completion of 40 years service at an accrual rate of 80ths plus 3 80ths cash: life assurance of five times pensionable salary for Brian Whitty or five times basic salary for Richard Harpin and Ian Carlisle: pension payable in the event of ill health: and spouses pension on death.
A notional earnings cap restricts the benefits provided to members of the WCPS.
In respect of Richard Harpin and Ian Carlisle, an unapproved pension payment, equal to 20% of the amount by which his basic salary exceeds the notional cap is paid annually.
The notional cap is indexed in line with earnings inflation.
With effect from 6 April 2006, all of Brian Whittys retirement benefits are provided through the WCPS, on the basis of a pension accrual rate of 45ths of his basic salary for future service.

indd 47 5 6 08 14:54:17 Remuneration report The HMP is a funded, Inland Revenue approved occupational defined contribution pension scheme.
Jon Florsheim and Jonathan Simpson-Dent are members of the HMP.
In respect of Jonathan Simpson-Dent, its main features are: employer contributions of 20%: life assurance of five times basic salary: permanent health insurance: and spouses pension on death.
In respect of Jon Florsheim, its main features are: employer contributions of 8%: life assurance of five times basic salary: permanent health insurance: and spouses pension on death.
Where the benefits provided to executive directors under the scheme are restricted as a result of the notional earnings cap described above, further provision is made by making a payment of 20% in cash of the amount by which his basic salary exceeds the cap in respect of Jonathan Simpson-Dent, and 8% into the HMP in respect of Jon Florsheim.
Non-executive directors Non-executive directors serve under letters of appointment for periods of three years which include provisions in respect of liquidated damages limited to the payment of one years fee.
Their fees are determined by the Board within the limits set by the Articles of Association and based on information on fees paid in similar companies.
Non-executive directors are not entitled to bonus payments or pension arrangements, nor do they participate in the Companys long-term incentive plans.

For options granted after 2004 retesting is not permitted but for options granted before that date retesting of the performance criteria is permitted in years four and five with performance measured from a fixed date.
From 2005, the normal maximum annual grant under the ESOP was 150% of salary, save in exceptional cases, for example on the appointment of a new executive director from outside of the Group.
Awards granted under the ESOP will lapse on the date that an executive leaves the Companys employment, except in the case of retirement, illness, redundancy or death, where the Committee has a discretion to allow options to be retained by the executive subject to such performance conditions as it wishes to impose.
There were no changes in the options held under the ESOP between 31 March and 19 May 2008.
EPS growth is calculated by the Company and independently verified by HNBS.
As at March 2008, the Companys year on year EPS growth during the period since the date options were granted in each year from 2003 to 2007 respectively is in each case in excess of 10%.
If this level of performance were to continue until the date on which each grant becomes exercisable, all options would be exercisable in full subject, in respect of the options granted in 2006 and 2007, to the share price target having been met at the date of exercise.

TSR is independently calculated by HNBS and verified by the Committee.
At March 2008, HNBS has estimated that the Companys absolute TSR growth in the period since the date of the 2004 award is 216%.

The Committee retains the discretion to decline to permit matching shares to vest if it is not satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company at the time of vesting.
Shares invested in the DBP by executive directors may be withdrawn at any time during their appointment but any entitlement to matching shares will be forfeit in such circumstances.
The price of an ordinary share on 6 September 2007, when the 2007 awards were made, was 17.07.
At March 2008, the Companys TSR performance in the period from the date of grant of awards is below the upper decile in comparison with the comparator Group.
If this performance were unchanged at the end of the performance period, the number of matching shares available to each participant would be 2.78 for the 2005 awards, 2.19 for the 2006 awards and 2.44 for the 2007 awards.
