Report on Directors remuneration Introduction This report sets out the Companys policy on Directors remuneration for the forthcoming year, and, so far as practicable, for subsequent years, as well as information on remuneration paid to Directors in the financial year to 28 December 2008.
The report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 and in line with the recommendations of the Combined Code and the UKLA Listing Rules.
Role of the Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee the Committee has delegated authority from the Board to determine the annual salaries, incentive arrangements short and long-term, service agreements and other employment conditions for the Executive Directors.
The Committee also oversees remuneration arrangements for our senior executives to ensure they are also aligned with shareholder interests.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available for inspection on our website.
Remuneration arrangements following Admission to the Of cial List Prior to Admission, a new long-term incentive plan New LTIP was introduced under which it is intended the Executive Directors will receive future long-term incentive awards.
This plan was introduced following a review of our existing arrangements against best practice investor guidelines.
Full details of the New LTIP, along with details of the former arrangements under which awards were granted prior to Admission, are set out below along with other changes to our remuneration structure that have been made in relation to our move to the Of cial List.
Remuneration Committee members and advisors Following Admission, the Committee consists solely of the Companys independent Non-Executive Directors, John Hodson Chairman, Michael Shallow, Dianne Thompson and Peter Klauber from 19 November 2008.
Prior to Admission, the Committee consisted of John Hodson Chairman, Dianne Thompson, Michael Shallow and Colin Halpern.
No other person was a member of the Committee at a time when any matter relating to the Executive Directors remuneration for 2008 was considered.
The Committee met three times during the year under review to consider and approve, amongst other things: the conclusions of a review of Executive Directors and senior management remuneration: proposed salary increases and changes to other compensation elements of the Executive Directors remuneration: liasing with trustees of the EBT regarding LTIP awards to the Executive Directors and senior management: setting performance measures and targets for new annual bonuses and share based remuneration and evaluating whether performance conditions have been met for existing remuneration arrangements: and the launch of a new SAYE offering upon maturity of the existing scheme.
No Committee member has any personal financial interest, con ict of interest arising from cross-directorships, or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
Other Directors and employees who attend some or all of the meetings and who provided material advice or services to the Committee at the invitation of the Chairman during the year were: Stephen Hemsley Executive Chairman Chris Moore C hief Executive Of cer Lee Ginsberg Chief Financial Of cer Nigel Wray N on-Executive Director Colin Halpern N on-Executive Vice Chairman Adam Batty Company Secretary from 18 February 2008 and Secretary to the Committee No Executive Director attended the part of the meeting dealing with matters relating to his own remuneration.
The Committee also received advice from Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS, an external consultancy with wide experience of executive remuneration on UK listed companies, whom it appointed whilst the Company was listed on AIM.
This advice related to developing its remuneration policy, particularly in relation to long-term incentive plans, setting the performance conditions and in benchmarking the remuneration of Executive Directors and senior management.
HNBS has no other connection with the Group.
Mayer Brown International LLP and Norton Rose LLP have advised the Committee on legal and regulatory issues during 2008.
BDO Stoy Hayward LLP also provided a broad range of tax, share scheme and advisory services to the Group during 2008.
38 Dominos Pizza UK & IRL plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Remuneration policy principles Our remuneration policy for senior management, including Executive Directors, is based on the following core principles: total remuneration should be set at a level suf cient to attract, retain and motivate Executive Directors and senior employees of the highest calibre: remuneration should be weighted towards variable pay with a below median base salary vis--vis comparable benchmarks and above market incentive opportunity linked to the delivery of superior performance: short and long-term performance targets should be speci c, measurable and fully aligned with the Companys business objectives: signi cant opportunities to acquire Company shares should be provided as part of encouraging a wider share ownership culture: and the interests of management should be fully aligned with those of shareholders.

2 Adjusted EPS means diluted earnings per share before operating and non-operating exceptional items.
Whether particular performance conditions are met is assessed by the Committee following sign off of the audited Annual Report and Accounts.
This process ensures that incentive payments are made following independently audited results being known.
Remuneration received in respect of each of these elements by the Executive Directors is shown on pages 44 to 46.
Remuneration policy is reviewed on a regular basis against the principles set out above and with any developments in investors best practice taken into account as appropriate.
For example, while not directly relevant to the Company, the Committee has considered the Companys current remuneration policy in light of the recent FSAs recent letter to Chief Executives of UK financial institutions.
The conclusion of the Committee was that the current remuneration structure at the Company remains appropriate in light of the good practice suggestions of the FSA.
Balance between xed and variable pay Based on the remuneration structure that will operate for 2009, for achievement of target levels of performance, more than 50% of total remuneration will be delivered from performance related elements of our remuneration structure.
For performance above target levels, a higher proportion of total remuneration will be delivered via performance related pay.
The performance conditions for each variable element are the same for each Executive Director.
Dominos Pizza UK & IRL plc 39 Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Report on Directors remuneration continued Service agreements It is the Companys policy for the notice periods of Executive Directors to normally be of 12 months or less.
The Executive Directors current contracts, which are all dated 13 May 2008, provide for rolling 12 month periods, terminable by the Company giving one years notice, or by the Executive Director giving six months notice.
The contracts include provisions on non-competition and non-solicitation.
If an Executive Directors employment is terminated other than pursuant to the notice provisions in the service agreement or by reason of resignation or unacceptable performance or conduct, for any unexpired notice period the Company will pay a sum calculated on the basis of basic salary and any accrued annual bonus entitlement taking into account bonus payments in the previous three financial years, together with bene ts.
There would be no special payments made after a change in control.
Salaries and bene ts in kind for Executive Directors In setting the base salary of each Executive Director, the Committee takes into account market competitiveness and the performance of each individual Executive Director, any changes in position or responsibility and pay and conditions throughout the Group.
This structure takes account of the reward structure in place for executives below Board level, and that used by comparable companies, which, following Admission, for 2009 purposes included FTSE 250 companies and restaurant leisure companies with broadly similar market capitalisation or turnover or both.
In addition to base salary, the Executive Directors also receive bene ts in kind which principally comprise pension contributions, life assurance, a healthcare scheme and use of a company car.
In 2008, the rate of base salary increases for the Executive Directors over 2007 gures was between -21% and 15% the decrease is attributable to the Chief Executive Of cer moving to the role of part-time Executive Chairman at the beginning of 2008.
Salaries received by the Executive Directors in the 2008 financial year are set out below and shown on page 44.
The current base salary levels, set for the financial year ending 28 December 2009, are as follows: Executive Chairman: 190,000 2008: 190,000 Chief Executive Of cer: 262,000 2008: 230,000 Chief Financial Of cer: 215,000 2008: 200,000.
The increase to the Chief Executive Of cers salary is re ective of his performance in post and the results of a recent benchmarking exercise.
It was the Committees intention at the time of the promotion of the current Chief Executive Of cer from Deputy Chief Executive Of cer that there would be phased increases to bring him into line with the Committees policy of achieving a threshold rate of pay for a Chief Executive Of cer of the size of the Company and that his 2008 and 2009 increases fully re ect this based on continued excellent performance.
The increase awarded to the Chief Financial Of cer similarly took into consideration the results of a benchmarking exercise which highlighted that he had fallen below market for a FTSE 250 Finance Director and the enhanced responsibilities following Admission.
The revised salary levels continue to re ect the Committees policy paying a below median base salary with an above market incentive opportunity.
Annual performance bonus APB Annual incentive targets are set each year by the Committee to take account of current business plans and conditions, and there is a threshold performance below which no award is paid.
The purpose of the APB is to reward participants performance over 1 the previous financial year.
In 2008, bonus awards were based solely on achieving and exceeding challenging adjusted PBT growth targets.
1 In 2008, the maximum bonus opportunity available for Executive Directors, based on adjusted PBT performance, was 100% of base salary.
1 APB awards made to Executive Directors for 2008 are shown on page 44 and, at 100% of salary, re ected adjusted PBT growth performance which exceeded the targets required for a maximum payout.
In line with the Association of British Insurers ABI Guidelines on Responsible Investment Disclosure, the Committee ensures that the incentive structure for Executive Directors and senior management will not raise environmental, social or governance ESG risks by inadvertently motivating irresponsible behaviour.
More generally, with regard to the overall remuneration structure, there is no restriction on the Committee which prevents it from taking into account corporate governance on ESG matters and takes due account of issues of general operational risk when structuring incentives.
1 Adjusted PBT means pro t before tax and before operating and non-operating exceptional items.
40 Dominos Pizza UK & IRL plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 1 For 2009, adjusted PBT will be retained as the sole performance measure.
However, following the detailed remuneration review, the maximum bonus opportunity available will be increased to 150% of salary for the Chief Executive Of cer and 125% of salary for the Chief Financial Of cer, to ensure that overall remuneration package in terms of both quantum and structure remains appropriate following the Companys move to the Of cial List and inclusion in the FTSE 250 Index.
The maximum bonus opportunity of the Executive Chairman will remain unchanged at 100% of salary.
The revised maximum bonus opportunities 1 require a signi cantly higher level of adjusted PBT to be earned than the maximum payout achieved in 2008 based on a challenging sliding scale of targets.
With regard to the 2009 bonus structure, to achieve their respective maximum potential 1 APB in 2009, the Executive Directors will have to achieve or surpass 110% of the stretching adjusted PBT budget gure for 2009, which is considered extremely challenging by the Committee.
LTIP The Executive Directors and senior management have historically been eligible, at the discretion of the trustees of the EBT, to be awarded an interest in the growth in value of a speci c sub-fund of the EBT, represented by the increase in value of Dominos shares.
Awards prior to Admission Awards made prior to Admission have normally operated with a five year performance period with vesting determined by performance against challenging adjusted EPS and adjusted PBT targets.
With regard to the awards made during the year under 1 2 review prior to Admission, for vesting to take place, the Companys adjusted PBT and adjusted EPS are required to double by the end of the five year performance period.
However, vesting may be accelerated if at any time during the performance period the EPS and PBT targets set are achieved following the publication of the relevant set of Annual Report and Accounts.
The status as at 28 December 2008 of each LTIP cycle in respect of which awards could have vested at the date of this report is shown in the table on page 45, on the basis of our performance against the measures explained above.
The table also shows awards which are yet to vest.
New LTIP Immediately prior to Admission, a review of the Companys long-term incentive arrangements vis--vis institutional investors best practice guidelines speci cally those of the ABI and the recommendations set out in the Combined Code was conducted and a new LTIP arrangement was introduced.
Awards under the New LTIP which will replace the LTIP detailed above for Executive Directors and senior management in future years will continue to be structured as an interest in the growth in value of the Companys shares.
However, the New LTIP will operate with the following key features: Maximum award limit Awards will be limited to 300% of salary in any financial year 600% of salary in exceptional circumstances such as recruitment and retention.
The Committees intention, as set out at the time of Admission, had been to restrict future awards to 100% of base salary and 100% of the bonus paid in the prior financial year.
However, in light of the continued strong performance of the Company, the new share ownership guidelines introduced and to ensure that the overall remuneration package remains appropriate as referred to above in relation to the APB, the Committee considers that awards are likely to be required of up to 300% of base salary in future financial years if the Company is to be able to continue to recruit, retain and motivate senior executives of the necessary calibre.
This is considered particularly important given the Companys approach to setting base salary at below median of appropriate benchmarks.
Dominos Pizza UK & IRL plc 41 Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Report on Directors remuneration continued Performance conditions 2 Performance will be tested over three years subject to the following challenging adjusted EPS growth condition: Level of vesting Average annual compound EPS growth Less than RPI 9% 0% RPI 9% 25% RPI 12% or better 100% Between RPI 9% and RPI 12% Straight line vesting between 25% and 100% For the avoidance of doubt, this condition can only be tested at the end of three years with the award lapsing if the condition is not met at that time.
EPS is a key internal long-term measure of financial performance used by the Board.
As a result, the Committee considers it to be the most appropriate measure to use to incentivise and reward Executive Directors and senior management.
Other share option plans Each Executive Director also has the opportunity to participate in the HMRC approved savings-related share option scheme.
Further details on this share plan are provided in note 30 to the financial statements.
Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any other Company share option plans.
Share-based awards and dilution We ensure that the aggregate of all share-based awards does not exceed the guidelines laid down by the ABI.
These guidelines provide that outstanding awards granted to employees over new issue shares under the Companys employee share schemes when aggregated to new shares issued in relation to exercised historic share awards should not exceed 10% of the Companys issued share capital in any 10 year rolling period.
Shares issued or to be issued under awards or options granted before the Company was admitted to trading on AIM in 1999 are excluded from this limit.
Share ownership guidelines The Committee has decided that all Executive Directors shall be required to attain a shareholding of at least one times their annual salary and therefore Lee Ginsberg will be required to attain such a shareholding during 2009.
All other Executive Directors currently satisfy this requirement.
In addition, the Committee has determined that from 2010, the Executive Directors will be required to hold, on vesting, one third of the total value of future awards under the New LTIP in Dominos shares for a minimum period of two years following vesting.
Full participation in the New LTIP from 2010 onwards will be conditional on this.
Retirement bene ts The Committee reviews the pensions arrangements for the Executive Directors to ensure the bene ts provided are consistent with those provided by other similar companies and take account of changes in relevant legislation.
The Company does not offer a fide ned bene t pension scheme.
Instead, it makes contributions to an approved pension scheme of the Executive Directors choice.
In 2008, the Company contribution to each Executive Director was 10% of basic salary to the pension plan of their choice.
The Companys policy in relation to contributions to Executive Directors pension arrangements is that contributions are made up to 15% of salary.
Save as set out above, there are no other pension arrangements for the Executive Directors.
Executive Directors outside appointments We recognise the potential bene ts to the individual and to the Company of involvement by Executive Directors as Non-Executive Directors in companies outside the Group.
Subject to pre-agreed conditions, and with prior approval of the Board, each Executive Director is permitted to accept one appointment as a Non-Executive Director in another company.
The Executive Director is permitted to retain any fees paid for such service.
Currently, none of the Executive Directors hold any other directorships of listed companies.
42 Dominos Pizza UK & IRL plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Non-Executive Directors Unless otherwise determined by the Board, Non-Executive Directors are appointed for terms of three years with a maximum term of nine years.
The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts with the Company but their terms are set out in letters of appointment.
There is no provision for termination payments and the appointments are terminable on one months notice.
Non-Executive Directors are paid a basic fee with additional fees for chairing of the Remuneration Committee and the Audit Committee.
No additional fee is paid for chairing the Nominations Committee.
The fees are approved by the Board on the recommendation of the Executive Directors, based on a review of the fees paid in companies of a similar size and the anticipated time commitment of the Non-Executives.
A review of the fees was last carried out in 2008 and a further review will be carried out in 2010.
None of the Non-Executives participate in the Companys bonus arrangements, share schemes or pension arrangements.
Colin Halpern, appointed Non-Executive Vice Chairman in January 2008, is seconded to the Company from HS Real LLC under the terms of a management agreement originally entered into in 1999.
Colin Halpern has played an integral part for 16 years in building our business and continues to provide regular advice and assistance to the Executive Directors, with a speci c focus on acting as an international ambassador for the Company.
The management fees re ect the transition from Executive Director to Non-Executive Director and are reviewed annually.
The gure for 2008 was agreed before Admission and equated to 260,000, including expenses.
Colin Halperns appointment as a Non-Executive Director was renewed at the 2008 AGM of the Company and it is the Boards intention that both Colin Halpern and Nigel Wray will put themselves forward for re-election at the AGM on 23 April 2009 and at each subsequent AGM for as long as they remain members of the Board, taking into account the Combined Code provisions A.

TSR is the product of the share price plus reinvested dividends.
19.05.08: Admission The AIM index has been selected for this comparison because up until Admission, this was the index in which the Companys 300 shares were quoted and it provides a broad based comparator group of retail and non-retail companies.
The FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts has been the index in which the 200 Companys shares have been quoted since Admission.
TSR provides a useful, widely used benchmark to illustrate the Companys performance over the last five years.
