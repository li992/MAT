REMUNERATION REPORT The Directors submit their report on remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2008.
This report has been approved and adopted by the Board and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements s234B of the Companies Act 1985 as amended by The Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations and the Listing, Prospectus and Disclosure Rules.
The information, the headings of which have been noted with an asterisk, is subject to audit in accordance with the Regulations.
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The Remuneration Committee's responsibilities are set out in its terms of reference which are available on request to shareholders and on the Company's website.
These responsibilities include determination of company policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors and approval of the composition and level of remuneration of Executive Directors and certain senior executives.
This includes an annual review of all incentive plans to ensure that they remain appropriate to the Company's current circumstances and prospects.
The Board has accepted, without amendment, the Committee's recommendations relating to remuneration policy.
COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP The Committee comprises John Clare Chairman, John Nelson and Tony Watson.
John Nelson was considered independent on his appointment as Chairman in 2005 and the Board considers each of the other members of the Committee to be independent.
The Committee met on four occasions during 2008.
REMUNERATION POLICY In determining an appropriate remuneration policy for recommendation to the Board, the Committee's objective is to ensure that the Company continues to attract, retain and motivate experienced individuals, capable of making a major contribution to Hammerson's success.
It is the Committee's objective, having regard to the views of investors, that the Company's remuneration policy should provide for median, or below median, basic salary but with the opportunity to increase total potential remuneration for superior performance through variable remuneration in the form of bonus and long-term incentives.
Remuneration for Executive Directors and senior executives takes account of performance through an annual performance-related bonus scheme and, for long-term performance, by the award of shares under a long-term incentive plan.
The Board's intention is that Executive Directors and senior executives should build a shareholding in the Company with a value equivalent to at least their annual basic salary.
Shares to satisfy awards under the various schemes are acquired by market purchases either directly or on transfer from treasury.
In implementing the policy, following its approval by the Board, the Committee takes into account remuneration packages available within other comparable companies, the Company's overall performance, achievement of corporate objectives, individual performance and published views of institutional investors and their representative bodies.
ADVISERS Hewitt Associates have provided general advice to the Committee during the year.
They have provided no other services to the Company during 2008.
John Richards attends all meetings of the Committee by invitation, except when his own remuneration is being discussed, to provide information and advice.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE - REVIEW OF THE YEAR There were no significant changes to the remuneration policy as set out in the Remuneration Report for 2007.
Having regard to the changing economic conditions the Committee deferred the independent review of executive pay arrangements planned to have been carried out in 2008.
It is intended that the Committee will consider the benefit of commissioning such a review later in 2009 to assist in determining the remuneration policies which should apply from the year commencing 1 January 2010 and thereafter.
ANNUAL REPORT 2008 45 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED REMUNERATION OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND SENIOR EXECUTIVES The remuneration packages for senior staff, including Executive Directors, consist of the following elements and are structured to reward corporate and individual performance.
Details of all payments to Executive Directors, which are disclosed in the table on page 50, show the relative values of basic and performance-related elements of remuneration.
BASIC SALARY AND BENEFITS Basic salaries for Executive Directors and other senior executives are reviewed by the Committee, normally annually or otherwise on promotion, having regard to responsibility, competitive market practice, company and individual performance and independently compiled salary survey information.
This exercise is undertaken at the same time and on the same basis as the review of salaries of all employees within the Company.
Benefits include the use of a company car or the provision of a car allowance, medical insurance and life assurance cover.
ANNUAL PERFORMANCE-RELATED BONUS SCHEME Staff throughout the Company, including Executive Directors, participate in a performance-related bonus scheme.
Payments under the scheme, which are not pensionable, are currently based on the achievement of earnings per share, net asset value, operational targets and personal objectives.
The targets are reviewed and set annually by the Committee and are designed so that payment of the maximum would only be achieved for exceptional performance.
The maximum amount payable to Executive Directors in 2008 was up to 200% of their basic salary, with 60% of the payment receivable in shares in the Company of which half vest immediately and half vest two years after the date of grant, subject to remaining with the Company.
As reported in the 2007 Remuneration Report, the Committee adopted more challenging targets for 2008.
The earnings per share for 2008 did not meet this minimum target and therefore no bonus was awarded under this part of the bonus scheme.
The net asset value target, which is calculated with reference to the UK IPD All Property Index after taking account of gearing, was however achieved to the level of 83.6%.
This, together with individual achievement against operational targets and personal objectives, resulted in an average payment to Executive Directors representing 32.3% of the maximum potentially payable.
This compares with a payment of 56.3% of the maximum potential in respect of 2007.
Under the terms of the scheme, 40% of the bonus payment is paid in cash Part A and the balance of 60% is paid in shares in two equal parts Part B and C. Shares under Part B of the scheme are awarded on the date the bonus is paid and the value thereof is included in the table of remuneration on page 50.
Shares under Part C of the scheme are receivable in the form of options, the shares in respect of which vest two years after the date of grant.
The entitlement to Part C shares is shown on page 51.
DEFERRED SHARE PLAN Following the introduction of the Hammerson plc 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which is described below, no further options have been granted under the Deferred Share Plan.
Under the terms of the Plan, the actual number of shares received by participants is based on the comparative total shareholder return performance of the Company against a peer group of the eight largest quoted UK property companies, including Hammerson, over a three year period.
There will be no vesting of shares unless the Company's performance is in the top half of the comparator group and there will be a progressive vesting schedule according to the Company's ranking within the top half of the comparator group as follows: Ranking % of shares vesting st 1 100.00 nd 2 83.34 rd 3 66.67 th 4 50.00 The Plan is administered by a Trustee which has acquired shares, financed partly by drawing down interest-free loan facilities from the Company and partly by transfer from treasury, to satisfy the issue of shares to participants under the Plan and other share incentive schemes.
At 31 December 2008 the Trustees held 391,102 shares, 351,971 shares having been used during the year for payments under the Plan and other share incentive schemes.
Under the terms of the Trust, the Trustee is obliged to waive dividends on this holding of shares, except for a nominal amount.
ANNUAL REPORT 2008 46 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED At 31 December 2008 the maximum number of shares that could be awarded to Executive Directors under all grants made under the Deferred Share Plan was as follows: Maximum number of shares Date of grant 1 March 2006 John Richards 38,700 David Atkins 10,934 Peter Cole 27,701 Simon Melliss 27,701 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN The Long-Term Incentive Plan, which was introduced in 2007 and which replaces the Deferred Share Plan, provides for conditional awards of Performance Shares worth up to 200% of salary with a 300% limit in exceptional circumstances although the Committee has no current intention to make awards worth more than 150% of salary.
The performance measures applicable to the Plan are a combination of Total Shareholder Return 'TSR' performance thus aligning the interests of Directors with shareholders and Total Property Return 'TPR' to focus on the underlying property returns.
For Executive Directors, one half of the award is based on each of these performance measures over a single three year performance period.
TPR performance is measured over the three financial years commencing with the year of grant and in comparison with a composite index comprising Investment Property Databank's 'IPD' Annual UK Index and Annual France All Property Index, the relative composition of which may vary with each grant to ensure that it reflects the Company's portfolio.
Vesting under the TPR performance condition is as follows: Less than index 0% Equal to index 25% Index 0.5% average p. a.
100% Vesting for intermediate performance is pro-rata on a straight-line basis.
Prior to each grant, the Committee considers this range of targets to ensure they remain appropriate in the light of experience and anticipated future performance.
TSR performance is measured over a single three year period from the date of grant, in comparison with a comparator group currently comprising 16 entities, including some European real estate companies.
Vesting under the TSR performance condition is as follows: Less than TSR of median-ranked entity 0% Equal to TSR of median-ranked entity 25% Equal to TSR of upper quartile-ranked entity 100% Awards between median and upper quartile entities are on a sliding scale between 25% and 100%.
The level of threshold vesting will apply only for awards with a face value of up to 150% of salary i. e. with a maximum threshold vesting of 37.5% of salary and for larger awards other than when used on recruitment the vesting at threshold will not exceed 37.5% of salary.
At 31 December 2008 the following conditional share awards made to Executive Directors under the Long-Term Incentive Plan remained outstanding: Maximum number of shares Date of grant 11 June 2007 1 April 2008 John Richards 47,798 70,524 David Atkins 22,667 40,687 Peter Cole 34,494 50,858 Simon Melliss 34,494 50,858 ANNUAL REPORT 2008 47 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED SAVINGS RELATED SHARE OPTION SCHEME The Directors' interests in options over ordinary shares of the Company under the Company's savings related share option scheme are as follows: 1 January 31 December Exercise 2008 Granted Exercised Lapsed 2008 price Expiry year John Richards 995 - - - 995 939.20p 2009 David Atkins 1,351 - 1,351 - - 701.20p 2008 } - 1,085 - - 1,085 884.00p 2011 Peter Cole 2,356 - - - 2,356 701.20p 2010 Simon Melliss 995 - - - 995 939.20p 2009 SHARE INCENTIVE PLAN All UK employees are eligible to receive Free Shares up to a value of 3,000 each year, subject to achievement of a performance target under the Share Incentive Plan 'SIP'.
In addition, such employees can purchase Partnership Shares, up to a value of 1,500 each fiscal year, which the Company will match through the award of Matching Shares on the basis of two Matching Shares for every Partnership Share purchased, Dividends on shares held under the Share Incentive Plan are used to purchase additional shares.
The Directors' interests in shares of the Company under the Share Incentive Plan at 31 December 2008 are as follows: Cost to Total SIP Partnership Matching Divided Total SIP Company of shares shares share Free shares shares shares held shares 1 January purchased in awarded in awarded in purchased in 31 December awarded in 2008 2008 2008 2008 2008 2008 2008 John Richards 1,489 0 0 267 45 1,801 3,417 David Atkins 1,489 149 298 267 49 2,252 7,948 Peter Cole 1,489 0 0 267 45 1.801 3,417 Simon Melliss 1,477 149 298 267 49 2,240 7,948 The middle market price of the Company's ordinary shares, as derived from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List, was 5.35 on 31 December 2008 and the range during the year was 4.62 to 11.45.
RESTRICTED SHARE PLAN Certain UK employees, except Directors, receive awards under a Restricted Share Plan which provides an opportunity for these employees to build up a shareholding in the Company.
Under the Restricted Share Plan, grants of conditional share awards are made which vest on the third anniversary of grant subject to continued employment.
FRENCH SHARE PLAN For French employees, who are not able to participate in the Share Incentive Plan or the Restricted Share Plan referred to above, there is a share plan under which conditional awards of shares are made.
The number of shares which will vest after a two-year period is dependent on a combination of the performance of the Company's investment portfolio in France and the Group's performance.
SHARE OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES All Directors are encouraged to own shares in the Company.
Certain elements of total remuneration are designed to encourage Executive Directors and senior executives, over a period of time, to acquire a shareholding of a value equivalent to at least their annual basic salary.
ANNUAL REPORT 2008 48 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED SERVICE AGREEMENTS John Richards, David Atkins, Peter Cole and Simon Melliss have service agreements which may be terminated by the Company on 12 months' notice.
With the exception of David Atkins, who was appointed a Director on 1 January 2007, if a contract is terminated at short notice, any resulting compensation would not be subject to mitigation.
The basic annual salaries payable to Executive Directors are reviewed annually on 1 April.
Since 1 April 2008 the salaries payable have been: John Richards 520,000 David Atkins 300,000 Peter Cole 375,000 Simon Melliss 375,000 The Remuneration Committee has undertaken its regular review of salaries for the year commencing 1 April 2009 and has determined that, given current market conditions, these salaries will remain unchanged.
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts with the Company.
Their appointments are governed by letters of appointment, which are available for inspection on request.
The Chairman's appointment, which is subject to 12 months' notice, was initially for a period of three years to 30 September 2008, but, following review by the Board excluding the Chairman, has been renewed for a further period of three years ending 30 September 2011.
The appointments of the Non-Executive Directors are reviewed by the Chairman and the Executive Directors every three years and, accordingly, will next be reviewed as follows: David Edmonds 7 May 2009 John Hirst 28 February 2010 Jacques Espinasse 30 April 2010 John Clare 30 April 2010 Tony Watson 31 January 2012 Notwithstanding the intention that the appointments of Non-Executive Directors are for a term of three years, such appointments are at all times subject to the right of either party to terminate the appointment on not less than three months' notice.
John Clare, who retires in accordance with section A7.2 of the Combined Code, and John Nelson, Peter Cole and Tony Watson, who retire in accordance with the Articles of Association, offer themselves for reelection at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION The Chairman of the Board, John Nelson, is a Non-Executive Director and his fee, and those of the other Non-Executive Directors, are determined by the Board, having regard to the contribution required from, and the responsibility taken by, Non-Executive Directors and current market practice, including the level of fees paid to Non-Executive Directors of comparable companies.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible for performance-related bonuses or participation in the Company's share plans and their fees are not pensionable.
The Chairman receives a fee which is currently at the rate of 225,000 per annum.
The Non-Executive Directors currently receive a basic annual fee of 40,000 and the Senior Independent Director is paid an additional fee of 10,000 per annum.
The level of fees is set to reflect the responsibilities of the role and, in order to recognise the additional responsibility of membership and chairmanship of the Audit and Remuneration Committees, further fees are payable in respect of these positions as listed below: Audit Committee chairmanship 6,000 Audit Committee membership 4,000 Remuneration Committee chairmanship 6,000 Remuneration Committee membership 4,000 ANNUAL REPORT 2008 49 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED The Chairmans fee is reviewed annually on 1 September and, on review at 1 September 2008, was increased to 240,000.
The fees of the Non-Executive Directors are reviewed every two years in October.
On 1 October 2008 the basic annual fee payable to Non-Executive Directors was increased to 45,000 per annum and the fee payable for acting as Chairman of the Audit and Remuneration Committees was increased to 10,000 per annum and 5,000 per annum for other members of these Committees.
The implementation of these increases in respect of the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors has been deferred for the time being in view of current market conditions.
Although no decision has been taken as to the date on which these increases in fees will be implemented, the revised fee levels, whether paid or not, will be taken as the basis for any further increase when they are next due for review.
REMUNERATION OF DIRECTORS The following table shows a breakdown of the remuneration of the Directors for the year ended 31 December 2008: Total emoluments Deferred Share excluding pension Plan gain contributions on shares Performance Salary and related Benefits in fees bonus kind 2008 2007 2008 2007 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Executive Directors John Richards 511 133 33 677 789 340 681 David Atkins 283 93 16 392 375 96 174 Peter Cole 369 87 16 472 561 195 768 Gerard Devaux retired 8 September 2008 244 - 1 245 474 184 817 Simon Melliss 369 93 26 488 571 232 511 Non-Executive Directors John Nelson 225 - - 225 206 - - John Clare 64 64 - - 59 - - David Edmonds 52 - - 52 52 - - Jacques Espinasse 44 - - 44 29 - - John Hirst 50 - - 50 50 - - Tony Watson 44 - - 44 44 - - 2,255 406 92 2,753 3,210 1,047 2,951 The value of benefits in kind includes the use of a company car or provision of a car allowance, medical insurance and life assurance cover.
During the year ended 31 December 2008 no payments were made to Directors for expenses other than those incurred wholly and directly in the course of their employment or appointment.
The performance related bonus included in the table above is payable in cash Part A.
A further element of the bonus is payable in shares Parts B and C. Normally the payment in shares is made in two parts, one of which Part B is made at the time the cash bonus is paid and the other of which Part C is deferred for two years and is subject to the participant remaining with the Company.
However, in respect of the bonus for 2008, in view of current market conditions, the Executive Directors have agreed to defer the vesting of Part B shares such that they will be treated in the same way as Part C shares.
Accordingly, for 2008 only, the table below includes the potential entitlement to Part B shares in addition to the entitlement to Part C shares.

Pension entitlements are based on basic salary.
In previous years, members who joined the Scheme on or after 1 June 1989 were subject to restrictions imposed by the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
Following the introduction of the Finance Act 2004, these restrictions no longer apply for service accrued on or after 6 April 2006.
In the case of Simon Melliss, provision in respect of pensionable salary above the restriction was paid to a money purchase arrangement prior to 6 April 2006.
No pension arrangements are made by the Company for Non-Executive Directors.
Since 6 April 2006 an individual's benefits under the Company's pension scheme would be subject to additional tax should those benefits exceed certain defined limits.
The Remuneration Committee has agreed that, in these circumstances, a Director may elect to receive a Pension Compensation Payment rather than further contributions being made to the Scheme.
Such compensation payments will be subject to income tax and national insurance contributions and will not qualify for annual bonus purposes or entitlements under long-term incentive plans.
The following tables set out information on Directors' defined benefit pension entitlements, including funded and unfunded arrangements: Increase in accrued Increase in benefit Total accrued accrued during the Years benefit at benefit year Age at service at 31 December during the excluding 31 December 31 December 2008 year inflation 2008 2008 000 000 000 John Richards 52 27 277 28 16 David Atkins 42 10 30 8 7 Peter Cole 49 19 165 19 12 Simon Melliss 56 17 88 16 12 For each Director, the total accrued benefit at 31 December 2008 represents the annual pension that is expected to be payable on eventual retirement, given the length of service and salary of each Director at 31 December 2008.
The increase in accrued benefit earned during the year represents the increase in this expected pension, including the effect of inflation, when compared with the position at 31 December 2007.
