Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration Introduction The remuneration of the executive directors is determined by the Board Committee on Executive Directors Remuneration the Committee within a framework set by the Board.
As at the date of this Report, the Committees members are three non-executive directors, Mr Finn Chairman, Mr Perry and Mr Johnson.
Mr Finn is to retire at the AGM on 16 January 2009, and he will be replaced on this Committee from 1 February 2009 by Mr Mike Toms, with Mr Toms taking the role of Committee Chairman.
None of the Committee members has a personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided.
There are no conflicts of interest arising from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running the business.
During the year, the Group Company Secretary attended a number of Committee meetings at the invitation of the Committee and provided advice on issues other than those relating to his own remuneration.
The Committee also received independent external advice from Hewitt New Bridge Street.
Hewitt New Bridge Street was appointed by the Committee and does not provide any other service to the Company other than to the Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors Remuneration.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors apart from the Chairman is determined by the Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors Remuneration, which comprises the executive directors.
The Board Committee on Non-Executive Directors Remuneration also receives advice from the Group Company Secretary and Hewitt New Bridge Street.
The Chairmans remuneration is determined by the other non-executive directors.
Objectives The aim of the Committee is to ensure that the Company has competitive remuneration packages in place in order to recruit, retain and motivate executive directors in the overall interests of shareholders, the Company, its employees and its customers.
The Committee has set, as an objective, a policy of paying remuneration around the median of a peer group of similar UK housebuilding businesses and it is satisfied that the structure of the executives packages will broadly achieve this objective.
The Committee has used this comparative approach to benchmarking with caution, recognising the risk of upward only reviews of remuneration.
The structure of the package has been designed to ensure that the performance related elements of remuneration annual bonus and long-term incentives constitute a significant proportion of an executives potential total remuneration package, but are only receivable if demanding and stretching performance targets are achieved.
The Committee considers that the remuneration level and structure are fully competitive with the market, with a significant element of the package payable in the form of share-based incentives, subject to long-term Total Shareholder Return TSR and Return on Capital Employed ROCE performance conditions, thereby creating alignment with the interests of shareholders.
In framing the Companys remuneration policy for executive directors, the Committee has given full consideration to the best practice provisions in the Combined Code and the Association of British Insurers ABI guidance.
Service contracts and letters of appointment The executive directors have fixed-term service contracts which specify that retirement is at age 60, with a 12 month notice period on either side.
For executive directors, on termination, an amount equivalent to one years salary, benefits and the average amount of the last two years annual bonus payments, would be payable.
The inclusion of average annual bonus in the calculation of compensation payable for early termination will ensure that there is variability in the potential level of compensation.
In particular, after a period of poor performance, it could be expected that little or no bonus would be payable, reducing potential payout in these circumstances.
The notice period of all executive directors service contracts is kept under review by the Committee.
It is the Committees view that the notice period for the executive directors is appropriate and consistent with current market practice.
The details of the executive directors service contracts are as follows: Executive Director First appointed Current contract as a director commencement date J K Watson 1 August 1995 16 March 2001 P J Stoker 1 August 1995 19 January 1996 and amended with effect from 1 November 2003 A M Leitch 1 August 2002 1 September 2002 All non-executive directors have letters of appointment with the Company of no more than three years with a three month notice period by either side.
Non-Executive Director First appointed Current letter of appointment Current letter of appointment as a director commencement date expiry date H C Dawe 9 August 1977 1 November 2007 31 October 2010 L P Finn 1 August 1995 12 January 2008 16 January 2009 D G Perry 1 November 1999 1 November 2006 16 January 2009 P M Johnson 1 November 2003 1 November 2006 31 October 2009 On the expiry of his existing letter of appointment, it is the intention of the Company to issue a new letter of appointment to Mr Perry which will expire at the conclusion of the AGM in 2010.
Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2008 34 Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration continued Salaries and fees Salaries are reviewed on 1 August each year, taking into account the general settlement across the Company.
Any changes are implemented from that date.
For the year under consideration, the executive directors were awarded rises varying from 4.84% to 11.11%.
These increases were considered appropriate by the Committee after an assessment of base salary levels in peer group companies and also taking into consideration the performance of the executive directors and of the Company as a whole.
Fee levels for non-executive directors reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of the role and are reviewed annually, taking into account the level of fees for similar positions in comparable companies.
They are not entitled to any benefits with the exception of the Chairman or pension.
They do not participate in any bonus or long-term incentive plan and they are not entitled to compensation on termination of their agreements, other than normal notice provisions of three months notice given by either party.
Benefits in kind Benefits in kind provided to the executive directors relate to car allowance and private medical insurance.
Annual bonus scheme The annual bonus scheme has a potential which is currently capped at 120% of basic salary, other than in exceptional circumstances where outstanding performance may, in the view of the Committee, merit a higher bonus, subject to an overall cap of 150% of basic salary.
Recognising the genuinely exceptional operating environment for the UK housing market and the consequent short-term lack of visibility in the outlook for financial performance, the Committee intends to operate a less formulaic bonus structure for the forthcoming year within the maximum cap set out above.
The basis for the payment of any bonus will be disclosed in next years Remuneration Report.
The bonus will be payable in cash, with executives having the opportunity to invest up to 25% of their net cash bonus in Bellway shares under the terms of the Bellway p. l. c. 2008 Share Matching Plan.
Annual bonuses are not pensionable.
Long-term incentive schemes 1 The Bellway p. l. c. Savings Related Share Option Scheme, which was established in 2003, is available to all employees, including the executive directors.
2 The Bellway p. l. c. 2004 Performance Share Plan the PSP was introduced for the Companys executive directors and the Group Company Secretary.
Under the PSP, executives have been granted awards over shares worth 100% of base salary each year.
For awards made on 16 January 2008, two performance conditions applied to separate parts of the award: a 50% of the award is based on a TSR condition against other housebuilders but, instead of a ranking approach comparing Bellways TSR to that of each other company, an Index is created out of the TSR of the other housebuilders in the group.
Bellways TSR is compared to that of the Index.
If Bellways TSR matches that of the Index, 25% of the TSR part of the award vests reduced from the previous vesting profile whereby 33% of the award vested at median.
Full vesting is achieved for 7.5% per annum outperformance of the Index.
The Committee has carried out significant modelling, the results of which support the premise that 7.5% per annum outperformance is equivalent to average upper quartile TSR performance of the housebuilders.
Further, regardless of TSR performance, no part of the TSR element of an award will vest unless the Committee considers that the Companys TSR over the performance period reflects underlying financial performance.
The companies comprising the Index for the awards in the financial year commencing on 1 August 2008 are as follows: Barratt Developments PLC Bovis Homes Group PLC Redrow plc The Berkeley Group plc Persimmon plc Taylor Wimpey plc TSR is recognised as enabling alignment with the interests of institutional shareholders through providing a reward mechanism for delivering superior stock market performance b The remaining 50% of the award is based on a range of ROCE based targets requiring average annual ROCE of 15% per annum at which point, 25% of the ROCE part of the award would vest to 22% per annum for all of this part of the award to vest.
Awards vest on a straight line basis in between these two points.
35 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2008 Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration continued For awards to be made in the financial year commencing 1 August 2008, in view of the difficulty in setting financial performance conditions in the current economic climate, it is proposed that the TSR part of the award will apply as the sole performance condition.
It is currently anticipated that the performance conditions will revert to a combination of TSR and ROCE when the housing market returns to more normal conditions and clearer visibility of the Companys prospects is possible.
The directors outstanding awards under the PSP are set out in the table on page 38.
3 Shareholder approval was given at the AGM in January 2008 for the introduction of a new long-term incentive plan, the Bellway p. l. c. 2008 Share Matching Plan the SMP to operate in conjunction with the annual bonus plan.
Under the SMP senior executives may invest up to 25% of their net cash bonus, on a voluntary basis, in Bellway shares, which must be held for a minimum of three years.
Invested shares will not be subject to a risk of forfeiture and executives will enjoy full beneficial ownership including voting rights and dividends.
In return for investing in shares, under the SMP, an award of matching shares is granted.
The level of matching is on a gross basis to the net of tax bonus invested in shares.
Matching shares will vest subject to the executive remaining employed, retention of the invested shares and also subject to a performance condition.
For the 2008 SMP awards, the performance condition will be the same TSR-based condition as will apply to the 2008 award of performance shares.
It is anticipated that the performance condition will revert to ROCE when the housing market returns to more normal conditions and clearer visibility of the Companys prospects is possible.
Shareholding Guidelines There is a minimum shareholding requirement for the executive directors, equivalent to 100% of basic salary.
As at 31 July 2008, and at the date of this report, all executive directors hold shares with an equivalent value in excess of 100% of their basic salary.
Any executive directors appointed in the future will be given an appropriate period of time to acquire the requisite shareholding.
Directors interests The directors interests including family interests and holdings in which directors are interested only as trustees in the ordinary share capital of the Company are set out below: Fully paid ordinary 12.5 pence shares 31 July 2008 1 August 2007 Beneficial interests H C Dawe 143,634 123,634 J K Watson 400,527 364,733 P J Stoker 536,531 506,238 A M Leitch 132,473 100,000 L P Finn 34,000 34,000 D G Perry 5,000 5,000 P M Johnson 4,300 4,300 There has been no change in the above interests between 31 July 2008 and the date of this report.
Mr Dawe had a beneficial interest in 554,164 Bellway p. l. c. 9.5% cumulative redeemable preference shares 2014 of 1 each which are held in his Self Invested Personal Pension SIPP at 31 July 2008 and at the date of this report 1 August 2007 - 554,164.
During the year Mr Leitch acquired a beneficial interest in 50,000 Bellway p. l. c. 9.5% cumulative redeemable preference shares 2014 of 1 each, which he held at 31 July 2008 and at the date of this report 1 August 2007 - nil.
Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2008 36 Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration continued Pensions In an effort to control its long-term pension costs the Company, during the year, offered the executive directors an enhanced transfer value from the final salary section of the Bellway plc 1972 Pension & Life Assurance Scheme.
The offer was made on equal terms for each individual with the additional amount available to be taken either as an enhancement to the standard pension transfer value, as a separate taxable cash amount, or a combination of both.
The three executive directors elected to take a combination of both.
The transfer values from the pension scheme to the individual directors private pension arrangements and the additional cash amounts received by them are set out in the table below.
In addition, the three executive directors ceased to accrue future benefits in the scheme with effect from 31 May 2008.
This action is considered to be beneficial as it removes an ongoing open-ended liability of the Company.
The Committee received appropriate advice in arriving at the enhancement levels and the quantum is considered to be fair given the benefit promises surrendered.
In a further effort to control the cost of ongoing pension provision the Company, in consultation with the rest of the active membership of the final salary section of the scheme, is carrying out a similar exercise in relation to the balance of the membership of the final salary section of the scheme.
As part of the consultation exercise it is proposed that final salary accrual would terminate, to be replaced by Defined Contribution arrangements.
Further details in relation to executive directors pensions can be found under Directors pension information on page 41.
Performance graph In line with legislation introduced by the Government, this Report contains a graph below showing the performance of the Company and a broad equity market index over the past 5 financial years.
As the Company has been a constituent of the FTSE Mid 250 Index over this period, the Committee considers that index to be the most appropriate for this purpose.

For further information concerning the directors bonus arrangements, see page 35.
The number of shares held in the Trust in respect of each director is as follows: Fully paid ordinary 12.5 pence shares Held in Trust as Awarded Vested during Held in Trust 2 at 1 August during the year the year as at 31 July 2007 2008 1 H C Dawe 33,283 - 33,283 - J K Watson 70,180 - 28,336 41,844 P J Stoker 54,549 - 23,928 30,621 A M Leitch 46,095 - 18,891 27,204 Notes: 1.
These shares relate to deferred bonus shares awarded to Mr Dawe while he was executive Chairman.

There has been no change in the above holdings between 31 July 2008 and the date of this Report.
Directors interests in Performance Share Plan In addition, the executive directors have a potential future beneficial interest in certain shares held in the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992 pursuant to the allocation of shares under the PSP.
Further information on the PSP is set out on pages 35 and 36.
Market value on award 703.5p, performance period 1 August 2004 - 31 July 2007.
Market value on award 950.5p, performance period 1 August 2005 - 31 July 2008.
Market value on award 1344.0p, performance period 1 August 2006 - 31 July 2009.
Market value on award 744.5p, performance period 1 August 2007 - 31 July 2010.
Market value on 7 December 2007, which was the day the shares vested was 914.0p.
Aggregate gross gains made by these directors on vesting of awards under the performance share plan in the year were 620,886.34 2007 - 1,192,896.05 adjusted to exclude gains made by H C Dawe in 2006 07.
Details of the performance conditions are shown on pages 35 and 36 and below.
The award which was granted on 30.11.04 vested at 53.1% of the full entitlement.
The market price of the ordinary shares at 31 July 2008 was 477.5p and the range during the year was 377.75p to 1,320.0p.
Vesting of all but the last of these awards is conditional on the achievement of a TSR performance condition requiring Bellways TSR to be at least at the median of a comparator group of other housebuilders at which point 33% of the award vests.
Full vesting requires Bellways TSR to be at the upper quartile.
The Comparator group comprises Barratt Developments PLC, The Berkeley Group plc, Bovis Homes Group PLC, Persimmon plc, Redrow plc and Taylor Wimpey plc plus Countryside Properties PLC, Crest Nicholson plc, McCarthy & Stone plc, Taylor Woodrow plc, Westbury plc and Wilson Bowden plc, all of whom have now delisted.
The vesting conditions of the award granted on 16 January 2008 are set out on page 35.
There has been no change in the above potential future beneficial interests between 31 July 2008 and the date of this Report.
The executive directors had no further potential future beneficial interest in ordinary shares at 31 July 2008 and at the date of this report 1 August 2007 - Nil which are held by the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992.
For this Trust, a linking agreement is in place between the Group and the Trustees of the Trust, Capita IRG Trustees Limited.
This agreement ensures that sufficient shares cash are available in the Trust to meet obligations as they arise.
The directors had a joint non-beneficial interest in 18,000 ordinary shares at 31 July 2008 and as at the date of this report 1 August 2007 - 18,000 which are held by the Bellway p. l. c. 1988 Employee Benefit Trust.
Taxable benefits relate to the provision of motor vehicles, car allowance and private medical insurance.
The annual bonus is payable in November 2008 for performance during the year ended 31 July 2008.
The Board Committee on Executive Directors Remuneration the Committee has considered carefully the basis for bonus payments to executive directors for the 2007 08 year.
The rapidly deteriorating housing market necessitated a review of the budget process for the Company and associated bonus targets set by reference to budget.
Due to the genuinely exceptional circumstances, the Committee agreed that the financial performance should be assessed at the end of the year, and the basis for the bonus should be determined at that time.
Accordingly, at the Committee meeting in June, it was confirmed that the bonus level should be equivalent to 55% of an executive directors salary.
In coming to this conclusion, the Committee took into account the Companys financial performance in its own right and also compared to other housebuilders, and considered that managements own performance had been very good in extremely challenging conditions.
The three executive directors ceased to accrue pension benefits under the terms of the Bellway plc 1972 Pension & Life Assurance Scheme with effect from 31 May 2008.
As a consequence the Committee agreed that the executive directors may receive a cash payment in lieu of pension contributions amounting to 30% of base salary commencing with effect from 1 June 2008.
The value of the cash payment has been calculated on a basis which is considered to be cost beneficial to the Company compared to the cost of continued accrual under the terms of the executive directors previous final salary arrangements.
All of the above options were granted for nil consideration.
Aggregate gains made by directors on exercise of share options in the year were 13,289.01 2007 - 1,399,802.50 adjusted to exclude gains made by H C Dawe in 2006 07.
