Directors pensions The executive Directors participate in the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund the Fund.
The Fund provides for a pension at a normal retirement age, for pension purposes, of 62 and each Director pays an annual contribution equal to 5% of pensionable salary.
The pension for a Director who can complete 20 or more years pensionable service at normal retirement age is targeted at two-thirds of final pensionable salary, subject to HMRC limits.
With effect from 6 April 2006, HMRC limits were changed, with one of the changes being to no longer use the earnings cap, when determining the maximum permissible benefits.
However, the Fund has retained a Fund specific earnings cap for pension purposes.
The salaries of Ian Tyler, Anthony Rabin and Duncan Magrath are subject to the Fund-specific earnings cap for pension purposes and details of the Companys contributions to additional arrangements for them are shown in the Directors remuneration table on page 21.
The table below sets out the accrued deferred pension which would be paid annually from the Fund at normal retirement age based on each executive Directors service to 31 December 2008 as well as the additional pension benefit secured in respect of service during the year.
