Executive directors salaries will next be subject to review on 1 December 2008.
Directors pensions The Remuneration committee aims to ensure that retirement benefits are in line with best practice standards adopted by major companies in Continental Europe and the United Kingdom.
In accordance with this policy, executive directors are covered by final salary, defined benefit arrangements and can retire at their normal retirement age with retirement benefits broadly equivalent to two thirds of final pensionable salary.
The Company pension schemes are HMRC approved but the executive directors also have entitlements under employer-financed arrangements which are unregistered.

Pension accruals A and C are the amounts which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of year or earlier retirement.
The pension values E, F and G are transfer values calculated in accordance with version 9.3 of guidance note GN11 issued by the Board of Actuarial Standards.
The value of net increase in pension E represents the incremental value to the director of his pension benefits during the year, resulting from additional service and increases in salary.
It is based on the increase in accrued pension net of inflation B after deducting the directors contribution during the year D. 4.
The change in the transfer value H includes the effect of fluctuations in the transfer value due to factors beyond the control of the Company and directors, such as stock market movements.
The directors contributions during the year D are excluded from this value.
Both directors opted out of the ABF scheme on 5 April 2006 and since then have earned benefits in the Employer Financed Retirement Benefit Scheme EFRBS.
The figures shown represent the aggregate of benefits in the ABF scheme and the EFRBS.
Voluntary contributions paid by directors and resulting benefits are not shown.
P ension benefits include a 50% spouses pension.
Pensions are guaranteed to increase in payment in line with RPI, limited each year to 5% for service accrued to 31 December 2007.
The service accrued from that date will only attract pension increases in payment of RPI capped at 2.5%.
Additional discretionary increases to pensions in payment have been granted in the past.
Directors share options There are two schemes under which both HMRC approved and unapproved options may be granted: The Associated British Foods plc 1994 Share Option Scheme the 1994 Scheme requires options granted to be held for five years before they become exercisable, at which point they are not subject to any performance criteria: and The Associated British Foods 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme the 2000 Scheme, under which options granted become exercisable by participants after an initial three-year performance period, to the extent that performance criteria have been satisfied.
Performance criteria are based on robust levels of business performance over the period.
It has been agreed that share option awards will not form part of the normal ongoing remuneration package for executives, although the Remuneration committee reserves the right to grant share options on a very selective basis.
The gain made on exercise of share options was 47,550.
At close of business on 12 September 2008, the last trading day before the end of the financial year, the market value of the Companys ordinary shares was 789p.
During the previous 12 months the price ranged from 716.5p to 925p.
