Prior to 2007, the PSP was used to provide a long term incentive for the senior management population with a maximum award per individual of 150% of salary in respect of any financial year.
Following the introduction of the Turnaround Plan in 2007, it was agreed that no PSP awards would be made to any Turnaround Plan or Turnaround Incentive Opportunity participants for two years following the adoption of the Plan.
As a result no awards have been made under the PSP since 2006.
John Cresswell is the only executive director to hold awards under the PSP.
Vesting of outstanding awards is dependent on the TSR performance of the Company against a customised FTSE 100 comparator group detailed above, excluding those sectors which do not provide a benchmark of performance that would be relevant to the Company over a three year period.
There is no vesting for performance below median.
35% of the award vests at median and 100% at upper quartile.
Vesting will occur on a straight line basis between these points.
If a change of control occurs the awards will become exercisable based upon the Companys performance against the TSR condition to the relevant date, as if this condition applied to the whole award.
The ITV plc shares that vest will then be capable of exercise for one month from the date of change of control.
The 2005 PSP awards reached the end of their performance period in 2008 and lapsed as the TSR performance condition was not met.
The 2006 PSP awards remain outstanding, and will be tested in 2009.
On the basis of TSR tests carried out on 31 December 2008 the achievement of the performance conditions attaching to these awards remains challenging.

6 ITV plc shares and adjusted following the merger of Granada with Carlton in 2004.
No awards under the ITV Commitment Scheme the Scheme have been made since 2006, and there are currently no plans to use the Scheme going forward.
John Cresswell is the only executive director with outstanding awards under the Scheme.
Under the Scheme, participants can commit and retain shares of up to 100% of salary at the date of commitment.
A matching award is granted, composed of an award of a nil-cost option and a market value option to acquire an equal number of shares.
The maximum matching award can be no more than three times the number of committed shares for each component part of the matching award.
Vesting of the matching award is dependent on TSR performance of the Company, against the customised FTSE 100 comparator group detailed above, excluding those sectors which do not provide a benchmark of performance that would be relevant to the Company.
25% of the award vests at median and 100% at upper quartile.
Up to 50% of the matching awards will vest at the third anniversary of the date of grant subject to performance and the remainder at the fourth anniversary.
Any portion of the award that has not vested at the end of the relevant three or four year performance period will lapse.
In the event of a change of control, awards may vest based on the extent to which the performance condition has been met in the period since the awards were made, unless it is determined that exceptional financial circumstances have occurred.
The level of payout in the event of a change of control is capped at a multiple of the original financial amount a participant invests twice the investment if a change of control occurs in the first year, three times if it occurs during the second year and four times if change of control occurs in the third or fourth year.
The awards made under the Scheme in 2005 reached the end of the initial three year performance period in April 2008 and 50% of the awards lapsed as the TSR performance condition was not met.
The outstanding balance will be tested in April 2009.
