The normal retirement age of all the Executive Directors is 65.
The Executive Directors entered into new service agreements with Charter Central Services Limited CCSL on 27 August 2008 which became effective on the effective date of the Scheme, being 22 October 2008 the Service Agreements and each a Service Agreement.
The Service Agreements are terminable in writing by CCSL upon 12 months prior written notice: by Messrs Careless and Deeley on six months prior written notice, and by Mr Foster on nine months prior written notice.
If the Service Agreement of either Michael Foster or Robert Careless is terminated by CCSL except with notice, on retirement or for cause, then CCSL shall pay as liquidated damages an amount equal to the value of each Executive Directors annual salary, including both pension allowance and the value of the Executive Directors lost pension benefits.
CCSL has agreed tax equalisation arrangements with each Executive Director under which, if the amount of any remuneration paid by CCSL or any Associated Company to that Director is taxed in a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom, CCSL or the Director will make a balancing payment so that the amount received by the Director after tax in respect of that remuneration is the same as it would have been had he only been subject to United Kingdom tax in respect of it.
Similar tax equalisation arrangements have been agreed between the Company and all of the Non-Executive Directors including the Chairman.
The Executive Directors entered into letters of appointment in respect of their duties as Directors of the Company which took effect on 22 October 2008, being the effective date of the Scheme.
Each such appointment will be subject to termination by either party giving the other party not less than one months notice in writing and will automatically cease if that Executive Director ceases to be an employee of CCSL.

CHARTER INTERNATIONAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 52 REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED b Non-Executive Directors The Board has delegated authority to the Standing Committee to determine the fees payable to the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors.
Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Companys bonus, pension or share incentive schemes.
They have standard letters of appointment that comply with the recommendations of the Combined Code.
Non-Executive appointment letters are available for inspection at the Companys registered office and will be made available at the AGM.

The increases in the fees payable to the chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees reflect their additional duties as chairmen of those committees.
This represents the first change to the fees payable to the Non-Executive Directors for three years and takes account of the disruption caused to the Directors as a result of attending all Board and committee meetings in Ireland.
The policy is to review Non-Executive Directors fees on an annual basis.
c External appointments No Executive Directors currently hold any external directorships of listed companies.
4 Transition arrangements following the Scheme Prior to the Scheme becoming effective on 22 October 2008, the Executive Directors held a number of awards under share incentive arrangements operated by Charter plc.
These included awards under the 2005 LTIP, the DBP and a one-off option awarded to Michael Foster.
Details of these can be found in the table on page 55.
Upon the Scheme becoming effective, in accordance with the rules of the 2005 LTIP and the DBP, all outstanding awards under these plans were automatically exchanged for equivalent awards over ordinary shares in the Company.
As the options under the MF Plan would have lapsed if not exercised by the effective date of the Scheme, at that time Mr Foster exchanged his option for an equivalent option over ordinary shares in the Company.
None of these awards vested as a result of the Scheme.
The replacement awards have the same vesting periods, number of shares and other terms as the original awards, and any existing performance targets and or conditions will continue to apply as described above.

At the same time the salaries received by them from Charter Central Services Limited in respect of their executive duties on behalf of the rest of the Charter Group were reduced by an equivalent amount so that in aggregate they received the same remuneration before and after the Scheme Effective Date.
2 With effect from 1 November 2008, the fees payable to all Directors in respect of their duties as Directors of Charter International plc were increased by 5 per cent from 55,000 to 57,750 per annum and the fees payable to the Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees were increased by a further 6,000 and 4,000 per annum respectively.
The increases in the fees payable to the Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees reflect their additional duties as Chairmen of those committees.
These represent the first increases in the fees payable to Non-Executive Directors for three years and take into account the disruption caused to the Directors as a result of attending all Board and Committee meetings in Ireland.
This increase had no impact on the aggregate remuneration of the Executive Directors since the salaries received by them from Charter Central Services Limited were reduced by an amount equal to the increase.
3 With effect from the annual review on 1 January 2009, the remuneration of the Executive Directors was increased by 3 per cent such that the current base salary and fees of the Executive Directors are as follows: Salary Fees Total Directors 000 000 000 Michael Foster 457 58 515 Robert Careless 236 58 294 James Deeley 200 58 258 4 Two Executive Directors 2007:2 have waived their fees from a subsidiary undertaking.

2 The pension entitlement shown in the first row is the aggregate amount which would be paid annually on normal retirement based on service to the end of 2008 under the approved Scheme.
3 The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
4 The transfer value of the accrued entitlement represents the value of assets that the pension schemes would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the schemes liabilities in respect of the Directors pension benefits.
It does not represent sums payable to the individual Directors and, therefore, cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
5 The transfer value of the increases in accrued benefits, required by the Listing Rules, discloses the current value of the increase in accrued benefits that the Director has earned in the period, whereas the change in its transfer value, required by the Companies Act, discloses the absolute increase or decrease in its transfer value and includes the change in value of the accrued benefits that results from market volatility affecting the transfer value at the beginning of the period, as well as additional value earned in the year.

CHARTER INTERNATIONAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008 DIRECTORS AND OTHER REPORTS 55 ii Share options and incentives Awards under Charter International plc Incentive Plans From the Scheme Effective Date, all awards over shares in Charter plc under the Deferred Bonus Plan and the 2005 Long-Term Executive Plan were exchanged for identical awards over shares in Charter International plc and are listed in the table below.
The value of the awards under the LTIP shows the number of the awards held multiplied by the market price of the Companys shares at 31 December 2008.
The assumption is that the maximum number of options awards vested in accordance with the performance conditions described on page 50.
It should be noted that the actual value may be less than the maximum, including zero if performance conditions are not met.
2 The number of shares granted on 25 March 2008 is the share equivalent of 100 per cent of the base salary based on the average of the mid-market closing values of the Companys shares for the five dealing days ending on 20 March 2008 of 771.6 pence.
3 These awards under the DBP represent 25 per cent of the bonus payable to the Executive Directors, in respect of the year ended 31 December 2007.
The awards were calculated by reference to the average share price of the Company over the five dealing days ending on 20 March 2008, being 771.6p.
4 Awards represent the reinvestment of the final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2007 using a share price of 899p to calculate the number of shares subject to the award.
5 On 9 October 2008 this award vested in full following satisfaction of the performance conditions.
21,544 shares were sold to meet tax and NI liabilities at a price of 546p.
The remaining 30,895 shares were retained by Robert Careless.
6 The price of an ordinary share on 25 March 2008 was 801 pence.
During the year, the range of share prices was 227.5 pence to 1053 pence, with the price on 31 December 2008 being 330 pence.
7 The performance conditions applying to any of the above awards are as described on page 50.
8 The accrued cost of Directors LTIP awards outstanding at 31 December 2008, calculated in accordance with IFRS2 share-based payment was 1.3m 2007: 0.7m.
