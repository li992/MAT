Change of control As described on page 59, the Executive Directors service contracts contain change of control provisions.
For the purposes of these provisions, a change of control is deemed to occur if the Company becomes a subsidiary of another company: or if 50% or more of the voting rights of the Company or the right to appoint or remove the majority of the Board of the Company become vested in any individual or body or group of individuals or bodies acting in concert: or if all or substantially all of the business, assets and undertakings of the Company become owned by any person, firm or company other than a subsidiary or associated company.
A change of control is also deemed to occur if the whole of the issued capital of BG Energy Holdings Limited or a substantial part of the undertaking of that Company including its subsidiaries is transferred to another company, unless that transferee company is a subsidiary of the Company, or a company ultimately owned by substantially the same shareholders as are the ultimate owners of the Company.
com DIRECTORS REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT SHAREHOLDER BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INFORMATION 61 However, a change of control does not occur if and only if through a process of reconstruction the Company becomes a subsidiary of another company owned by substantially the same shareholders as are the shareholders of the Company.
The Executive Directors service contracts provide that any payments made pursuant to these provisions will be made, less any deductions the employer is required to make.
Any such payments shall be in full and final settlement of any claims the Executive Director may have against the employer or any associated company arising out of the termination of employment, except for any personal injury claim, any claim in respect of accrued pension rights, or statutory employment protection claims.

com DIRECTORS REPORT DIRECTORS REPORT SHAREHOLDER BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INFORMATION 63 PENSIONS The basis on which retirement benefits are calculated for Ashley Almanza and Frank Chapman has not changed during the year.
They receive an accrual of benefits designed to target a pension of two-thirds of their final 12 months salary on retirement from BG Group at age 60, inclusive of retained benefits.
As is the case for all other UK employees who became pension scheme members before 6 April 2006, they cannot be paid an immediate pension before age 60 on a non-actuarially reduced basis unless they have attained age 55 and completed ten years service with the Group including pensionable service transferred from previous employment and the Company expressly agrees to payment on an unreduced basis, or they are over the age of 50 and have been made redundant, or in the event of incapacity.
UK employees who became pension scheme members on or after 6 April 2006 cannot be paid a non-actuarially reduced pension until age 60, other than in the event of incapacity.
Pensions in payment are increased in line with retail price inflation.
An adult dependants pension is payable on death in service, equal to two-thirds of that payable to the pension scheme member based on potential service to age 65.
On death in retirement, an adult dependants pension is payable equal to two-thirds of the members pension prior to exchanging any of it for a cash lump sum.
Ashley Almanza and Frank Chapman were members of the BG Pension Scheme BGPS and the BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme BGSBS throughout the year.
The BGPS is a funded, registered pension scheme and the BGSBS is an unfunded, unregistered pension scheme.
The allocation of their benefits between the registered and unregistered schemes changed after 6 April 2006, when a new pensions taxation regime came into force.
Their BGPS benefits are limited to the lifetime allowance and the balance of their benefits is provided by the BGSBS.
Frank Chapman elected enhanced protection under the new regime and therefore has a personal lifetime allowance that is based on the value of his accrued BGPS benefits at 6 April 2006.
A provision has been made in the Companys accounts in respect of the obligations for unfunded post-retirement benefits.
Directors pension provisions were as follows: Directors Increase in accrued Total accrued contributions in annual pension in year annual year to to 31 Dec 2008 pension at 31 Dec 2008 Age at 000 pa 31 Dec 2008 Retirement 000 31 Dec 2008 a b 000 pa age Ashley Almanza 17 45 29 22 184 60 Frank Chapman 17 55 72 52 583 60 Transfer value of Transfer value of Increase in transfer value accrued pension as at accrued pension as at over the year less Directors 31 Dec 2007 c 31 Dec 2008 c own contributions 000 000 000 Ashley Almanza 1 637 1 768 114 Frank Chapman 8 755 9 433 661 a Actual increase.
b Increase net of price inflation.
c The transfer values shown at the end of 2007 and 2008 represent the value of each Executive Directors accrued pension based on total service completed to the relevant date.
The accrued pensions are the amounts that would have been paid if the Executive Director had left service at the relevant date.
The transfer values are calculated in accordance with the requirements of the transfer value regulations or the guidance note GN11 issued by the Board for Actuarial Standards as applicable at the date of the calculation.
