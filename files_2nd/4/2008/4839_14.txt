Business and Corporate Directors and Consolidated Financial Parent Company Shareholder Group Overview Financial Review Responsibility Review Management Governance Statements Financial Statements Information DSG international plc 51 Annual report and accounts 2007 08 Remuneration Report This report, approved by the Board, has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 the Act, as amended by the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Apart from the information relating to individual remuneration, share options, share awards, share interests and pensions information on pages 57 and 60 to 64, this report is not subject to audit.
The purposes of this report are to inform shareholders of the Companys policies on directors remuneration applicable to the two financial periods up to 3 May 2008 and, so far as practicable, for subsequent years as well as to provide details of the remuneration of individual directors as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Shareholders will be asked to approve the report at the annual general meeting on 3 September 2008.
Remuneration Committee The Board has delegated to the Remuneration Committee responsibility for determining policy in relation to, and approval of, remuneration packages for senior executives.
This includes the terms and conditions of employment of each of the executive directors of the Company and for other senior executives of the Group: and policy in relation to the operation of the Groups share-based employee incentive schemes.
In setting its policies, the Committee has regard to the compensation and benefits arrangements which apply below senior management level.
The current membership of the Committee, whose biographies and qualifications are set out on pages 26 and 27, is set out in the table below and comprises three independent non-executive directors and the Chairman of the Company.
All the Committee members served throughout the current and prior periods, except for the Company Chairman who joined the Committee in January 2008.
The Committees terms of reference are shown on the corporate responsibility section of the corporate website.
The Committee met six times during the period including two ad hoc meetings which were convened to deal with procedural matters.
Andrew Lynch and John Whybrow were unable to attend one of the meetings.
Following the changes in the Combined Code in July 2006 which allowed the Chairman of the Company to join the Remuneration Committee, Sir John Collins became a member of the Committee with effect from 15 January 2008 and he has attended each meeting of the Committee since that date.
Members Meetings attended during period John Whybrow Chairman 5 Sir John Collins 3 Rita Clifton 6 Andrew Lynch 5 The Chief Executive and the Group Director of HR attended meetings of the Committee by invitation in an advisory capacity.
Meetings are attended by the Company Secretary who acts as secretary to the Committee and occasionally by the Group Reward Director and representatives from the Groups external remuneration advisors, Hewitt New Bridge Street HNBS.
Nobody attends any part of a meeting at which their own remuneration is discussed.
During the period under review the Committee obtained advice from HNBS for which they received fees of 157,000.
HNBS provided no other services to the Company and has no other connections with the Company or its officers.
52 DSG international plc Annual report and accounts 2007 08 Remuneration Report continued Remuneration policy Executive directors The objectives of the remuneration policy are to: ensure that the remuneration structure incentivises and rewards directors and senior executives for their contribution to the attainment of the Groups short and longer term results and, where appropriate, the performance of individual trading divisions and business units: maintain, particularly through reward schemes based on performance, a competitive package of pay and benefits which provides the motivation for future achievement: facilitate, in an increasingly competitive international environment, the building and retention of a high calibre and focused team which will work effectively to achieve the Groups longer term strategic objectives: align the directors interests with those of shareholders by offering participation in schemes which provide opportunities to build shareholdings in the Company: and facilitate effective succession planning.
In implementing this policy, the Remuneration Committee takes account of information and surveys from internal and independent sources and the remuneration paid for comparable positions in other companies, especially those operating internationally.
It reviews data and surveys provided by remuneration consultants and market research companies with particular reference to the scale and composition of the total remuneration packages payable to people with like responsibilities, qualifications, skills and experience in businesses of similar size and structure.
The remuneration policy, which was in place for the period under review and the previous financial period approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting held in 2007 is set out below.
During the period under review, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the remuneration policy.
The Committee decided that the fundamental structure of the incentive design for executive directors should remain unchanged: changes were needed, however, mainly in the area of the Groups short and long term incentive arrangements particularly with regard to ensuring appropriate performance conditions were in place and changes to reflect good corporate governance.
These changes are discussed further on pages 53 to 56.
Shareholder approval will be sought at the forthcoming annual general meeting to adopt the developed long term incentive arrangements mentioned above along with a new Save As You Earn Sharesave plan.
The Committee plans to award shares in 2008 under the current share plans but to make changes which are consistent with the proposals being put to the annual general meeting in terms of performance conditions, good leaver situations and change of control.
Good leaver circumstances relate to a participant leaving the Group under compassionate circumstances including those leaving due to retirement, ill-health, injury, disability or redundancy Good Leaver.
The Remuneration Committee is also putting in place for 2008 09 only arrangements intended to retain and incentivise key senior executives and management below Board level, on a selective basis, to achieve the aims set out in the Renewal and Transformation plan announced on 15 May 2008.
Details are referred to in the relevant sections of this report.
The main components of the remuneration of the executive directors are as follows: a Basic salaries Basic salaries reflect the Remuneration Committees assessment of the mid market rate for relevant positions and levels of responsibility and the individual directors experience, performance and value to the business.
The basic salaries of the two executive directors were reviewed prior to the start of the 2008 09 financial year Business and Corporate Directors and Consolidated Financial Parent Company Shareholder Group Overview Financial Review Responsibility Review Management Governance Statements Financial Statements Information DSG international plc 53 Annual report and accounts 2007 08 to coincide with the Group-wide pay reviews and are currently 670,000 and 495,000 for John Browett and Kevin OByrne, respectively, representing increases of approximately 3% from their previous levels.
The Committee assessed pay and employment conditions of employees of the Company and of other undertakings within the Group when determining the executive directors remuneration.
The increases are in line with the annual review of senior executive salaries for which the average was just under 3% across the population and are in line with the average increase of salary across the employee base of the Group.
b Performance related remuneration The performance based elements of remuneration are designed to drive performance and to strengthen the alignment between the interests of the Companys shareholders and its senior management, whilst encouraging management retention.
The components of performance related remuneration are as follows: i Annual cash bonus During 2006 07 and 2007 08 performance based remuneration for the executive directors comprised an annual cash bonus plan based on the achievement of the Groups targets.
In the case of other participating executives below Board level, divisional and business unit targets were applied.
For 2006 07, the bonus performance measures were underlying diluted earnings per share EPS growth and Free Cash Flow.
EPS and Free Cash Flow are defined in the consolidated financial statements in note 8 and the consolidated cash flow statement, respectively.
The maximum bonus payable to John Clare was 100% of basic salary.
The maximum payable to the Group Finance Director was also 100% of basic salary which included an element based on the attainment of the Controllable Earnings targets of the Computing Division for which he had responsibility in 2006 07 in addition to his duties as Group Finance Director.
Controllable Earnings are defined as operating profit less a charge based on the average amount of invested capital across the year.
For 2006 07 the performance targets were not met and accordingly neither John Clare nor the Group Finance Director were paid a bonus.
For 2007 08, the maximum bonus payable to the Group Finance Director and John Clare was 100% of basic salary.
In the case of both of the executive directors, the bonus performance measures were based on Controllable Earnings and the achievement of Free Cash Flow targets whereby Controllable Earnings represented 80% of the bonus opportunity and Free Cash Flow comprised 20% of the bonus opportunity.
The maximum potential bonus for members of the Executive Committee was 85% of basic salary and for other participating senior executives was 80% of basic salary.
For 2007 08 the performance targets were not met and accordingly neither John Clare nor the Group Finance Director were paid a performance-related bonus.
John Browetts bonus arrangements upon joining are discussed below in section g. In the autumn of 2007, Kevin OByrne received a one-off payment of 75,000 and was also granted an award under the LTIP, details of which can be found in the table on page 62.
These arrangements were in recognition of his performance and additional responsibility assumed during the period between John Clares departure and John Browett joining the Group and the value placed on his future contribution.
For 2008 09 the maximum potential bonus for the Chief Executive is 100% of basic salary.
However, for 2008 09 only, the Group Finance Director will be eligible for a bonus of up to 130% of salary to reflect his key role in the Renewal and Transformation plan.
Payment will be dependent on underlying Group operating profit 60% of bonus, Group Free Cash Flow 20% of bonus and achievement of personal objectives 20% of bonus, which will include an element related to non-financial KPIs.
For 2008 09 the maximum potential bonus for members of the Executive Committee will be 85% of basic salary and for other participating senior executives will be 80% of basic salary.
Targets are set using benchmarks that reflect both internal business objectives and external expectations.
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the targets are challenging.
Before approving bonus payments, the Remuneration Committee will confirm that awards reflect genuine improvement in the Groups underlying financial performance.
Further information on employee costs, including those relating to senior management is given in notes 6 and 33, respectively, to the financial statements.
54 DSG international plc Annual report and accounts 2007 08 Remuneration Report continued ii Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP For awards to date under the LTIP, performance has been measured in terms of the Total Shareholder Return TSR achieved by the Company over a three year period relative to the companies comprising the FTSE 100 Index at the start of the performance period.
Vesting of shares is subject to the achievement of the following performance targets: no shares vest if TSR performance is below the median for the comparator group: and for performance in the upper quartile, 100% would vest, for median performance 40% would vest and for performance between the median and upper quartile the number of shares is calculated using a sliding scale.
Any shares which vest cannot be released within close periods.
TSR data is collated by HNBS to calculate the extent to which the performance condition has been met.
The number of shares awarded is calculated by reference to basic salary at the date of grant.
The maximum award of shares is equivalent to 50% of basic salary in the case of the executive directors, 45% for the members of the Executive Committee and 40% for other participating executives.
Prior to vesting, the Remuneration Committee will satisfy itself that the TSR performance achieved reasonably reflects the financial performance of the Group and reserves the right to vary awards accordingly.
Details of awards made in 2007 08 to Kevin OByrne and those made to John Browett on joining the Group are detailed on page 62.
At the annual general meeting on 3 September 2008 shareholder approval will be sought for the establishment of a new LTIP which will be called the Performance Share Plan PSP, to replace the current LTIP.
The Remuneration Committee continues to believe that TSR is the most appropriate performance condition as it aligns management interests with those of the shareholders.
However, the Remuneration Committee no longer considers the constituents of the FTSE 100 Index to be the most appropriate benchmark of performance.
Accordingly, for the annual awards to be made in 2008 09, it is intended that TSR performance will be compared to that of a bespoke weighted index comprising UK and European retailers Debenhams, Inchcape, Signet Group, Halfords Group, Kesa Electricals, Marks & Spencer, Sports Direct International, Home Retail Group, Kingfisher, Next, Tesco, PPR, Metro AG, Jelmoli and Praktiker.
All companies would have equal weighting within the group other than Kesa and Metro AG, who have greater relevance and will, therefore, have double weighting.
25% of an award will vest for performance equivalent to median with full vesting occurring for performance equivalent to the upper quartile over the three year performance period.
None of the award will vest for performance below the median.
The terms of the PSP will be set out in the notice of annual general meeting.
It is intended that the annual awards to be made in the summer of 2008 will contain provisions consistent with the new PSP in terms of the performance condition referred to above and how the awards are dealt with in the event of an individual leaving as a Good Leaver and on a change of control as follows: in the event of a participant leaving the Group as a Good Leaver the current position is that the extent to which an award vests is entirely at the discretion of the Committee.
It is intended that in the event of cessation of employment in Good Leaver circumstances awards will be capable of vesting, at the normal vesting date except in the event of death, subject to satisfaction of the TSR performance condition.
Awards will be pro-rated to reflect the shortened service during the performance period: and Business and Corporate Directors and Consolidated Financial Parent Company Shareholder Group Overview Financial Review Responsibility Review Management Governance Statements Financial Statements Information DSG international plc 55 Annual report and accounts 2007 08 in the event of a change of control, it is intended that future awards will only vest to the extent that the Remuneration Committee determines that performance warrants it and awards will be pro-rated unless the Committee determines that it is inappropriate to do so.
Currently awards vest in their entirety.
iii Share option and reward share plans The Remuneration Committee approves the basis on which options are granted to executive directors and other employees under the Companys discretionary share option schemes and other performance plans.
Options are normally granted annually to executive directors and other senior executives over shares having a market value on the date of grant equal to twice their basic salary.
However, in exceptional circumstances for instance to facilitate recruitment or to retain key executives this limit can be exceeded.
Executive directors and senior executives are also entitled to participate in the Sharesave plan on the same conditions as other employees.
In 2007 08 the Company launched a Sharesave plan which attracted a take up rate of 21%, a 50% improvement on the 2006 07 plan.
For 2007 08 the Group Finance Director received a grant of share options with a value of 200% of salary and, on joining, the Chief Executive received a grant of share options with a value of 200% of salary.
Both awards were subject to the EPS performance conditions which have previously applied for option grants and which are detailed on page 57, and are measured over three financial years.
The performance period for the award made to the Group Finance Director commenced on 29 April 2007: and the performance period for the award made to the Chief Executive commenced on 4 May 2008.
The next three years are an important period for the Group.
Under the new Chief Executive the Company will be putting in place a strategy to lead the recovery of the business as detailed in the Renewal and Transformation plan.
To deliver this strategy it is imperative that the senior executives who are vital in delivering it are retained within the business over this period.
Therefore, for 2008 09 only, a very small number of executives, including the Group Finance Director, will receive an exceptional grant of share options worth 300% of salary.
For 2008 09, the Chief Executive will receive an award of 200% of salary as originally agreed upon joining.
In order to incentivise junior management to develop a stronger ownership culture in the Group, it is also intended that a grant of share options will be made to this population in 2008.
A limited number of senior executives below Board level will also receive awards under a retention plan Reward Shares whereby no performance condition will apply but, other than in the event of death, or on change of control, shares will only be released in the event that the relevant individuals remain with the Group for a three year period.
The awards under the retention plan will range between 30% and 50% of salary.
Both the exceptional share option grant and Reward Shares are considered necessary to ensure that those executives key to delivering the recovery are appropriately incentivised and locked in to the Company for the next three years.
In the event of a change of control, it is intended that future awards under the share option plan will only vest to the extent that the Committee determines that performance warrants it and awards will be pro-rated unless the Committee determines that it is inappropriate to do so.
The increase in share option awards for 2008 09 has been considered in conjunction with a review of the EPS targets applying to the share options.
During the period under review, option grants have been subject to a requirement to deliver real growth in EPS of RPI plus 3% per annum where 50% of the share option vests to RPI plus 5% per annum 100% of the share option vests.
The options to be granted in 2008 09 to the Groups most senior executives those in the top three management grades will be subject to performance conditions which are strengthened as follows: Grant level EPS hurdles 100% of salary RPI plus 4% per annum 100%200% of salary RPI plus 4%7% per annum 200%300% of salary RPI plus 7%10% per annum Awards will vest on a straight-line basis.
56 DSG international plc Annual report and accounts 2007 08 Remuneration Report continued Beyond 2008 09 the Committee will consider appropriate hurdles in light of business circumstances prevailing at the time of grant and accordingly will have the flexibility to amend performance conditions for future options.
To maximise the perceived value of the options, no performance conditions will apply to awards made to employees below the top three management grades.
Such awards will be granted for this year at a level of up to 150% of salary.
The average award made to employees participating is approximately 30% of salary.
In future years performance conditions will apply but it is intended that these will be based upon internal financial operational targets.
All share options are exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant and, for those options subject to a performance target, if the Committee determines that the performance conditions have been met.
Such determination is made following presentation of the calculation which is performed once EPS figures are known for the relevant financial year and targets are tested only once.
All share options lapse on the earlier of ten years from the date of grant or, where performance conditions apply, on the date on which the Remuneration Committee determines that the performance conditions have not been met.
At the annual general meeting on 3 September 2008 shareholder approval will be sought for the establishment of a new executive share option scheme.
The terms of the share option scheme will be set out in the notice of annual general meeting.
The grants to be made in 2008 prior to the annual general meeting will be made under the existing share option scheme.
However, the Remuneration Committee intends that in addition to the change in performance conditions referred to above it will make these grants consistent with the proposed new share option scheme in respect of Good Leaver situations and change of control as follows: Option exercises on cessation of employment in Good Leaver circumstances will continue to be delayed until the normal vesting date except in the case of death subject to the EPS performance condition where this applies and time pro-rating of options will be applied as follows: Time of leaving Pro-rata rate of options Good Leaver first anniversary of date of grant Lapse in full 1 2 Good Leaver between first and second anniversary exercisable, lapse 3 3 2 1 Good Leaver between second and third anniversary exercisable, lapse 3 3 All other circumstances Lapse in full The plan currently allows options to be exercised in full on a change of control irrespective of whether the performance conditions have been satisfied.
It is intended that this is altered so that the vesting of future options is subject to the Committees assessment of the extent to which performance warrants it.
The exercise of share options will be time pro-rated unless the Committee determines that it is inappropriate to do so.
Business and Corporate Directors and Consolidated Financial Parent Company Shareholder Group Overview Financial Review Responsibility Review Management Governance Statements Financial Statements Information DSG international plc 57 Annual report and accounts 2007 08 The performance conditions applying to previous share option grants are shown below.
Share option terms audited information Performance conditions Re-testing Grants made The market price on the date of exercise is at During the life of the option before 1 July 2003 least 20% higher than the option price, assuming exercise takes place between three and four years after the date of grant.
For later exercises, the rate of share growth is adjusted in line with RPI.
Exercise is also conditional upon EPS having increased by not less than 3% above the annual RPI over any consecutive period of three years during the life of the option.
Grant made On the third anniversary of the date of grant, EPS Re-testing on the fourth on 28 July 2003 growth over the period since the date of grant and fifth anniversaries must exceed the annual RPI by at least 3% per annum compound.
Grant made On the third anniversary of the date of grant, EPS No re-testing on 4 August 2004 growth over the period since the date of grant must exceed the annual RPI by at least 3% per annum compound.
Grants made Over the three year performance period EPS No re-testing after 11 October 2004 growth is equal to or greater than annual RPI plus 5%.
Where EPS growth is between annual RPI plus 3% and RPI plus 5%, options will vest on a straight-line basis between 50% and 100% of the award.
Prior to 2005 06, share options were granted to other employees in the UK and overseas on the basis of management grade and to employees with more than three years service.
Since 2005 06 and until 2007 08 employees below executive level have either participated in a cash settled performance share plan or in a few selected cases have been granted share options, both of which were linked in most cases to the attainment of three year EPS targets.
iv Dilution The Remuneration Committee is aware of, and supports, the ABI guidelines regarding dilution and regularly monitors compliance with these requirements.
The Remuneration Committees policy is to include provisions in scheme rules which limit the number of newly issued shares which can be granted.
Shares bought in the market are to be used to satisfy awards under the Groups LTIP and the Reward Shares to be granted in 2008.
A combination of both newly issued and existing shares are to be used to satisfy options under the Groups executive share option schemes.
The Group has an established employee trust which it uses to hold existing shares and the Committees intention is to make purchases of shares taking into account the portion of awards and options to be satisfied by new issue, the likelihood of any performance targets being met and also potential lapsing of awards when employees leave the Group.
Of the shares currently under option, 13.13% relate to the executive directors and members of senior management and, if exercised, the proportion of shares currently under option for all schemes which are to be satisfied by the issue of new shares would represent 6.62% of the issued share capital of the Company for the 10 years ended 3 May 2008.
Further information on share-based payments is set out in note 25 to the financial statements.
58 DSG international plc Annual report and accounts 2007 08 Remuneration Report continued c Taxable benefits Each of the executive directors is entitled to the use of a company car with related benefits or cash payments in lieu and is a member of the non-contributory DSGi medical expenses plan which provides benefits similar to those applicable in similar companies.
d Pensions and related benefit Kevin OByrne accrues, and John Clare accrued, benefits under the senior executive defined benefit section of DSG Retirement & Employee Security Scheme DRESS.
This is a funded, HM Revenue & Customs registered contributory pension scheme which provides a pension at normal retirement age 60 of two thirds of pensionable salary subject to a minimum period of 20 years membership.
Part of this pension may be exchanged for cash at the date of retirement.
Membership of the scheme also confers dependants pensions, insured lump sums on death in service and benefits in the event of prolonged disability.
Details of pension benefits earned by directors during the financial period are shown on page 61.
Notwithstanding the abolition of the statutory earnings cap for pension purposes on 6 April 2006, an equivalent cap, adjusted annually for inflation, has been introduced for the purposes of DRESS.
Kevin OByrne will continue to receive a salary supplement equivalent to the contributions which would otherwise have been paid by the Company to DRESS on that part of his pensionable salary which exceeds the earnings cap.
A similar salary supplement arrangement for pension purposes applies to three other senior executives.
New externally recruited executive directors will be offered membership of the money purchase section of DRESS and the Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion regarding the level of award of any salary supplement or enhanced contributions.
John Browett has chosen not to become a member of this section of DRESS, however, he receives a contribution of 32.1% of salary to fund his own retirement arrangements.
e Service agreements Kevin OByrne has a service agreement with DSG Retail Limited which may be terminated at any time by 12 months notice.
John Browett has a service agreement with DSG international plc which can be terminated on 24 months notice where such notice is served prior to the expiry of 12 months from his commencement of employment and on 12 months notice thereafter.
Service agreements contain neither a liquidated damages nor a change of control clause.
It is the Companys policy to ensure that any payments made to a director in the event of the early termination of a service agreement reflect the circumstances giving rise to termination and, where considered appropriate, the obligation of the outgoing director to mitigate his loss.
Accordingly, consideration is given to making compensation payments in instalments and is conditional on the leavers employment and earnings status.
The service agreements of the executive directors who served during the financial period were entered into on the following dates: Date John Browett 6 Jun 2007 Kevin OByrne 16 Jul 2004 John Clare 3 Feb 1989 The service agreements of the continuing directors are available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during normal business hours on each business day.
Business and Corporate Directors and Consolidated Financial Parent Company Shareholder Group Overview Financial Review Responsibility Review Management Governance Statements Financial Statements Information DSG international plc 59 Annual report and accounts 2007 08 f External directorships Executive directors are permitted to accept non-executive directorships in external companies and to retain the fees which they receive in such roles.

Kevin OByrne was appointed as a non-executive director of Land Securities Group plc on 1 April 2008 and is paid a total fee at the rate of 55,000 per annum.
g Recruitment of John Browett On 31 May 2007 John Clare announced his intention to retire from the Board at the 2007 annual general meeting.
The Nominations Committee undertook a search for a new Chief Executive which culminated in the recruitment of John Browett.
In order to facilitate his recruitment, and in compensation of the significant value of share awards and bonus entitlement John Browett was forfeiting upon joining the Company, the Remuneration Committee agreed the following incentive arrangements: on joining, an award of shares with a value of 200% of salary under the LTIP, which will vest after the third anniversary of appointment in December 2010 subject to the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR performance relative to the constituents of the FTSE 100 index over the three year period starting on 5 December 2007.
Vesting is in line with current LTIP grants which are referred to in section b ii above : a grant of options under the share option scheme with a value of 200% of salary, which will be exercisable subject to achieving EPS growth over the three financial years commencing 4 May 2008.
These options cannot be exercised until after the preliminary announcement of results for the 2010 11 financial year.
Where EPS growth is 3% per annum, half of the options will become exercisable increasing on a straight-line basis to full vesting for EPS growth of 5% per annum: on joining, a one-off award of 200% of salary under the LTIP, which will vest on 6 December 2010 subject, in most circumstances, to John Browett remaining in employment with the Group at that time: and a one-off guaranteed bonus for 2007 08 of 600,000 payable in August 2008.
Non-executive directors Non-executive directors are normally appointed for three year terms, although appointments vary depending on length of service and succession planning considerations.

The change in fees will be implemented in September 2008.
The other non-executive directors receive a fee currently 45,000 per annum or euro equivalent.
The fee is normally reviewed bi-annually and this review in 2008 has resulted in an increase to 48,000 for implementation in September 2008.
In July 2007 the Board reviewed the fees paid for services as Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and agreed to increase the fee paid from 7,500 per annum to 10,000 per annum.

The difference between the transfer values at the beginning and end of the period includes the effect of factors beyond the control of the Company and the directors, such as stock market movements.
In 2003 the Remuneration Committee decided that bonuses should no longer be pensionable and addressed this by removing bonuses from the definition of pensionable pay in respect of pensionable service accruing after the end of 2004 05.
As John Clare had already accrued the minimum period of 20 years membership required to secure the maximum pension of two thirds of pensionable salary as at the date of this change, his pensionable pay includes cash bonuses and pension contributions have been paid on this basis.
