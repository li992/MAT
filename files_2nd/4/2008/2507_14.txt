Job: 10795 British Energy R&A 08 Mid AW Proof: 03 Proof Read by: Operator: rich Date: 03.06.2008 Server: studio 3 Set-up: Dave First Read Revisions Remuneration Committee Report for the year ended 31 March 2008 Introduction In preparing this Report, the Remuneration Committee the Committee has given due consideration to legal and best practice disclosure requirements, and has sought to present the Groups remuneration policy in an easy to read style.
During the year there have been no material amendments to British Energys remuneration policy but there have been some practical dif culties in implementing the policy this year.
Terms of Reference and Committee Membership The Committee is responsible to the Board for determining the fees of the Chairman and the pay, bene ts and employment conditions, including pensions of the Executive Directors and the most senior staff in the Group those reporting directly to the Chief Executive.
It also reviews the pay and bene ts of other senior staff to ensure that fair and robust remuneration policies exist.
During the year the Committee reviewed and subsequently revised its Terms of Reference which were endorsed by the Board.
The revised Terms of Reference continue to comply with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, June 2006 and can be reviewed on our website.
Copies may also be obtained from the Company Secretary.
The Committee is made up of the Non-Executive Directors identi ed on page 39.
The other Non-Executive Directors have attended, by invitation, some of the meetings during the year.
Details of attendance by members of the Committee are set out on page 39.
The Committee continues to be chaired by Bob Davies.
During the year the Committee met nine times.
Advisers to the Committee Bill Coley continued to attend throughout the year to give advice as required by the Committee.
In accordance with good practice he was not present when matters affecting his own terms and conditions were being discussed.
It is the intention of the Committee that he will continue to attend at its invitation.
The Groups Human Resources Director is Secretary to the Committee.
The Committee has appointed Hewitt New Bridge Street to give advice on general remuneration matters including market data comparisons.
They have also been involved in giving advice concerning the issues relating to the implementation of the Performance Share Plan see below and the management of the other equity incentive plans including the all-employee Share Incentive Plan.
They have no other connections with the Group other than providing advice on executive pay.
Mercers Human Resources Consulting LLP has provided advice on pensions issues to the Group.
Clifford Chance LLP has provided legal advice to the Committee during the year.
Remuneration Policy The Groups remuneration policy aims to attract, retain and incentivise management with the appropriate professional, managerial and operational expertise necessary to achieve the Groups objectives and deliver shareholder value.
The Committees aim is that the total package including bene ts and incentives is broadly competitive both in terms of the UK market and in terms of the international market for executives with nuclear experience.
The Committees policy is that base salaries are positioned broadly around the market median with incentive opportunities that re ect the Groups overall strategy and the challenges it faces.
The Committee believes that overall packages should be aligned to shareholder interests to create sustainable long-term shareholder value.
In particular it is the Committees policy that: a signi cant proportion of the remuneration of the Chief Executive and the senior management team should be variable and linked to the performance of the Group.
Under normal circumstances, the variable element would include a share-based incentive: however current restrictions do not permit this see section 3 below : the movement in base pay of the Executive Directors and the senior staff should be broadly in line with the increases awarded to other staff recognising the need from time to time to adjust salaries to the external market: in determining the link between base and variable pay the Group should be mindful of its safety and environmental priorities: and there should be a strong and clear link between reward and performance against agreed stretch targets both in the short and long-term.

The benchmarking process draws comparisons across a wide range of organisations, predominately major UK listed public companies, including utility companies.
Benchmarking also involves consultation with the Committees external advisers and commercial providers of remuneration surveys.
Base Pay Base pay and bene ts are reviewed annually.
The Committee aims to maintain individual salaries at or about the market median, taking into account experience, level of responsibility and individual performance.
The base pay of Executive Directors and senior staff was last reviewed as at 1 July 2007.
The current annual base salary levels for the Executive Directors are as follows: Bill Coley 725,000 and Stephen Billingham 465,000.
Annual Bonus Plan As discussed in last years report, on 1 April 2007 a new annual bonus plan was introduced for Executive Directors and other senior staff.
Under this plan the maximum potential bonus opportunity was set at 150% for each Executive Director.
The targets for 2007 08 covered the key performance indicators of the business including Adjusted EBITDA, cash, unplanned losses, unit operating margin, revenue, cost control, plant life extension, project delivery and outage performance.
All bonus targets were underpinned by safety and environmental conditions.
Following an assessment of performance against targets, the Committee awarded 75% of salary to both Bill Coley and Stephen Billingham.
It is the Committees intention that broadly the same structure will apply in 2008 09.
Share Options and Incentive Schemes Performance Share Plan Shareholders approved a new long-term incentive arrangement in the form of a Performance Share Plan at the AGM in 2007.
The Committee was to adopt a policy that would initially restrict awards to the following levels: Chief Executive: 150% of salary.
Other senior team members: 100% of salary.
Awards were to be subject to a Total Shareholder Return TSR performance condition measuring the Groups performance over a three year period relative to a comparator group of 23 companies involved in mining, oil extraction and electricity production, i. e. energy in its widest sense.
It had been the intention of the Committee to make awards under the plan to the Executive Directors and those reporting directly to the Chief Executive shortly after approval by shareholders.
However, in the light of the wide-ranging con dential strategic discussions that have been continuing for most of the past year, the Group took legal advice regarding the implementation of this scheme.
It concluded that it would be inappropriate to implement any share-based incentive scheme for the senior team members and Executive Directors whilst these strategic discussions were continuing.
In view of this, an alternative cash-based long-term incentive plan, with reward being determined by the Groups financial performance over a three year period, was introduced for senior team members.
The Model Code on Directors Dealings in Securities Model Code rules have not allowed for an alternative incentive arrangement to be put in place for the Executive Directors Bill Coley and Stephen Billingham.
Chief Executives Previous Incentive Arrangements As Bill Coley had historically not participated in the former Long-Term Deferred Bonus Plan he was subject to separate arrangements which included grants of share options.
Two grants of options have been made to him in December 2005 and November 2006.
Both grants of options were subject to a performance condition related to nuclear output during the 2007 08 financial year.
Subject to the achievement of the performance condition these options would vest in December 2008 and November 2009 respectively.
The targets set were: A minimum nuclear output of 53.6TWh at which 75% of options would vest.
A maximum nuclear output of 59TWh at which 100% of options would vest.
Nuclear output for 2007 08 was 50.3TWh and as a result neither grant of options will vest and accordingly they have lapsed.

It has therefore approved the use of two all-employee share plans: the Share Incentive Plan and the Sharesave Scheme.
Previously the Executive Directors declined their invitation to participate in the Groups all-employee Share Incentive Plan SIP.
As disclosed last year, the Committee would not expect this to be the case for any award to be made under the SIP for 2007 08.
The value of this award has been determined as 1,710 for each Executive Director.
Sharesave Scheme Executive Directors are entitled to participate in the all-employee Sharesave Scheme, which is offered to all employees on the same terms in line with HMRC regulations, for which there are no performance conditions.
Retirement Bene ts Stephen Billingham is a member of the British Energy Generation Group BEGG of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme, which will provide part of his pension entitlement.
He is also the recipient of other bene ts under an Unfunded Unapproved Retirement Bene t Scheme.
Bill Coley is not a member of any Group pension scheme nor was any payment made to him in lieu of any pension arrangement.
The details of Stephen Billinghams accrued entitlement under the fide ned bene ts schemes are as follows: Increase in Increase Transfer Transfer Transfer transfer Accrued in accrued value Accrued value of value of value less Age at pension at pension Increase of increase pension at pension at pension at contributions 31 March 31 March excluding in accrued in accrued 31 March 31 March 31 March made by Name 2008 2007 inflation pension benefit 2008 2007 2008 Directors S Billingham 49 30,236 15,703 16,881 195,867 47,117 290,866 549,714 258,848 The information in the table above has been subject to audit as required by the Companies Act 1985.
The accrued entitlements shown are those which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year.
The transfer value does not represent a sum due or paid to the individual and cannot meaningfully be added to annual remuneration.
The accrual rate for Stephen Billingham is 1 30 per annum subject to total pension from all sources not exceeding two-thirds of final salary.
He is required to make contributions of 5% of base salary.
This is achieved by sacri cing salary equivalent to the contribution.
The salary shown in the Directors Emoluments table on page 46 is net of the salary sacri ce on earnings above the Permitted Maximum fide ned in the rules of the scheme.
As indicated last year, Executive Directors and senior staff hired in the future will not be offered membership of BEGG nor any Unfunded Unapproved Retirement Bene t Scheme.
Instead new appointments will be offered a supplement to salary to allow them to make their own pension arrangements with suitable cover for life insurance and permanent disability.
Other Bene ts Other bene ts are available to Executive Directors.
These differ by individual but will comprise some or all of the following: A company car or allowance in lieu and fuel.
Medical and additional life insurance.
Reimbursement of telephone rental, mobile phone and business call costs.
Eligibility to participate in the all-employee Sharesave Scheme and Share Incentive Plan.
Share Ownership Guidelines Share ownership guidelines have been adopted that encourage Executive Directors and those reporting directly to the Chief Executive to build up the following levels of share ownership: Chief Executive 150% of salary Finance Director 100% of salary Other direct reports 50% salary 44 British Energy Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 08 M M6005 BE midd.

However, because of Model Code rules, the Executive Directors are currently unable to participate in the Groups share-based Performance Share Plan Service Contracts The Committees policy is to set service contract notice periods at one year or less without any express provision in respect of termination.
If it is ever necessary to offer longer notice or contract period to new Executive Directors who are externally recruited, it is the Committees position to reduce these as soon as possible after the initial contract has expired.
Stephen Billingham has a 12 month rolling contract and Bill Coley has a six month rolling contract.
The same notice period applies if the Group or Executive Director serves notice.
The dates of the current service contracts are: Bill Coley, 13 September 2005 and Stephen Billingham, 13 October 2004.
External Non-Executive Appointment The Committee permits Executive Directors to accept external non-executive directorships provided they do not cause a con ict or inhibit the Directors ability to work for the Group.
It is recognised that those appointments increase the Directors commercial knowledge and business expertise to the general bene t of the Group and the wider public interest.
Each such appointment, including the details of emoluments is subject to Board approval.
The Board has determined that any compensation receivable in respect of these appointments is paid directly to, and retained by, the Executive Director.
During the year Bill Coley held Non-Executive Directorships with Peabody Energy Corporation, receiving fees of $143,106, CT Communications Inc, receiving fees of $172,438: and Jahna Management receiving fees of $15,000.
All fees relate to the year ended 31 December 2007.
Stephen Billingham held no external appointments.
Non-Executive Directors The remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board without the participation of the Director concerned.
Appointed for three years the Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts, they are not eligible to participate in any of the Groups share schemes and they do not receive any pension provision from the Group.
The expiry dates of the Chairman and the current Non-Executive Director appointments are: Name Expiry date A Montague 30 11 2008 P Colombani 31 05 2009 J Delucca 31 01 2010 B Davies 30 04 2009 I Harley 31 05 2009 D Pryde 31 08 2010 R Walmsley 31 07 2009 R Walvis 31 08 2010 The fee structure, which was effective from 1 September 2004, remained in place throughout the year and applied to all Non-Executive Directors except Sir Adrian Montague.
The fees shown for the Non-Executive Directors in the Directors Emoluments table include 13,000 for each director with the exception of Robert Walvis which was paid in Shares in the Company.
As a result of dealing restrictions since his appointment Robert Walvis has not received his initial 10,000 in Shares or 7,583 worth of Shares as part of his basic fee.
Instead the amount was settled in cash with the expectation that he will, when circumstances permit, use the net proceeds to purchase Shares.
These sums are included in the emoluments table on page 46.
