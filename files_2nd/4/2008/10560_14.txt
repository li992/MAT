The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual report 2008 Overview 59 Business review Governance Financial statements Remuneration report The Directors Remuneration report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee the Committee and has been approved by the Board.
Shareholders will be given the opportunity to approve the report at the Annual General Meeting on 17 April 2009.
The report has been drawn up in accordance with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance, Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 and the UK Listing Authority Listing Rules.
The Remuneration report is divided into two parts.
The first part contains commentary on remuneration policy, which is not required to be audited.
The second part contains the remuneration tables that have been audited in accordance with the relevant statutory requirements.
The Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is responsible for developing Group policy on executive remuneration and for determining, on behalf of the Board, specic remuneration packages for the executive Directors and the Chairman.
The Committees terms of reference are available on our website.
During the year the members of the Committee were: Simon Heale who is the Chairman of the Committee, Martin Flower, Joe MacHale, Tim Stevenson and Andrew Given.
Joe MacHale retired from the Board and from the Committee following the AGM on 18 April 2008.
Each of the non-executive Directors is regarded by the Board as independent.
Tim Stevenson was independent at the time of his appointment as Chairman to the Board.
The Committee met on five occasions during the year.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
The Chief Executive officer and the Director of Human Resources attend meetings of the Committee by invitation.
No executive Director or other attendee is present when his or her own remuneration is under consideration.
Deloitte LLP was appointed by the Committee as its retained advisers in February 2007 and has provided advice on market practice and remuneration policy as well as Total Shareholder Return TSR analysis.
During the financial year, Deloitte LLP has also provided unrelated tax and corporate finance services to the Company.
During the year, Imbucon provided Total Shareholder Return TSR analysis relating to the Companys share plans.
Imbucon did not provide any other services to the Company.
Additionally, the Committee had access to advice from the Chief Executive officer, the Chief Financial officer, the Company Secretary, and the Director of Human Resources.
Remuneration policy The Remuneration Committee aims to ensure that remuneration packages offered are competitive and designed to attract, retain and motivate executive Directors and senior executives of the right calibre in order to run the Company successfully and to create value for shareholders.
The policy of the Committee is to ensure that a significant proportion of the total remuneration opportunity is performance related and based on the achievement of measurable targets which are relevant to and support the business strategy.
This is in order to create a strong link between performance and reward which should be beneficial to shareholders, employees and the Company.
In assessing all aspects of pay and benets, the Committee takes into account the packages offered by similar companies to ensure the remuneration packages for executive Directors are competitive against the market in which we compete for talent.
For the purposes of such analysis, comparator companies are chosen having regard to: the size of the company e. g. market capitalisation, turnover and number of people employed : the diversity and complexity of its businesses: and the geographical spread of its businesses.
In 2007, the Committee undertook a comprehensive review of the current incentive arrangements in order to ensure that the executive remuneration policy and practices continue to support the business.
This led to the introduction of the Deferred Bonus Share Matching Plan for which shareholder approval was obtained at the 2008 Annual General Meeting.
The Committee believes that the current remuneration structures continue to be relevant.
The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual report 2008 Overview 60 Business review Governance Financial statements Remuneration report continued Main components of remuneration The table below summarises the Companys policies in respect of each of the key elements of executive Directors remuneration as they applied during the year.

This is based on the current incentive arrangements, assuming maximum deferral under the Deferred Bonus Share Matching Plan.
Target 50% 25% 25% Stretch 20% 20% 60% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Salary Bonus Long term incentives Calculated on a projected value basis assuming 10% pa share price growth at Target performance and 15% pa share price growth at Stretch.
Base salary The basic salary for each executive Director is determined by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the performance of the individual and having regard to practice in companies of comparable size and complexity in the FTSE 350.
Salaries are normally reviewed on an annual basis.
The current base salaries for executive Directors are as follows: 3 Mark Robertshaw 440,000 effective from January 2008.
3 Kevin Dangereld 255,000 effective from January 2008.
At the request of the executive Directors, there was no increase in base salaries in January 2009.
The next salary review will take place in January 2010.
Base salary is the only element of the remuneration package that is pensionable.
Annual bonus The targets for the annual bonus are set by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the short and long-term requirements of the Company.
Challenging goals are set, which must be met before any bonus is paid.
This approach is intended to align executive reward with shareholder return by rewarding the achievement of stretch targets and fostering the continued development of inter-divisional co-operation and collaboration.
The bonus scheme provides the opportunity for executive Directors to earn a bonus of up to 100% of basic salary if stretching performance targets are achieved.
For 2008, 90% of the bonus related to financial targets and 10% related to the achievement of personal objectives.
The financial element for executive Directors was based on underlying operating profit performance up to 80% of salary and operating cash ow up to 10% of salary.
For 2009, the bonus will be based wholly on financial performance.
The targets for the awards will be set to address the new demands placed on the business in the current economic climate and will be based on underlying operating profit performance up to 60% of salary and cash conversion up to 40% of salary.
In considering the awards, the Committee will also take into account the quality of the overall performance of the Company.
The bonus targets set for 2008 were considered to be very stretching, and the bonus awarded to executive Directors who served during the year was as follows: 3 Mark Robertshaw 60% of salary 100% in 2007.
3 Kevin Dangereld 30% of salary 98% in 2007.
The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual report 2008 Overview 62 Business review Governance Financial statements Remuneration report continued Long-term incentive arrangements The Committee believes that share ownership by the executive Directors and senior executives helps align their interests with those of the shareholders.
Accordingly the Company operates a number of share schemes for the executive Directors and other senior employees, details of which are set out below.
Deferred Bonus Share Matching Plan In 2008 shareholder approval was gained for the introduction of a new long-term incentive plan, the Deferred Bonus Share Matching Plan.
This Plan now operates alongside other long-term incentive arrangements.
The Plan offers executive Directors and senior executives the opportunity to ordinarily defer up to 50% of their annual bonus into Company shares.
Participants must hold the deferred shares for three years to be eligible for a matching award.
Matching shares may be earned at the end of three years in the event that stretching EPS targets have been met.
The performance conditions for awards to be made under the plan in 2009 are as follows: EPS performance Matching shares 15% pa 3x match 10% pa 1.75x match 7.5% pa 1x match 5% pa 0.5x match 4% pa 0.25x match 4% pa 0x match There is straight-line vesting in between each point above.
The performance conditions for awards made in 2008 were as above but referenced growth above RPI.
Given the change in the economic climate, the Committee considers the targets for the 2009 awards above to be stretching.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP was approved at the 2004 Annual General Meeting and offers executive Directors and other senior executives the opportunity to receive shares as a reward for outstanding performance.
The scheme allows awards of up to 150% of basic salary, although in exceptional circumstances the Committee is able to make awards of up to 200% of basic salary.
The vesting of the awards is subject to the achievement of performance targets measured over the three-year period from the start of the year in which the award is made.
For awards made under the LTIP in 2007 and 2008, the Committee set the targets so that 50% of awards be based on TSR against a tailored comparator group and 50% based on real EPS growth.
The vesting schedule for the awards is as follows: % of the Award which vests % of the Award which vests TSR performance against the sector comparator group EPS growth Upper quartile ranked performance 50% RPI 10% pa 50% Median ranked performance 15% RPI 4% pa 15% Below median ranked performance 0% RPI 4 % pa 0% Straight-line vesting applies between each point for both vesting schedules.
The Committee must also be satisfied that the Companys underlying financial performance justifies the level of vesting.
The TSR comparator group is set out below : Bodycote International Rotork Charter Senior Chemring Group Spectris Cobham Spirax-Sarco Cookson Group Tomkins Halma TT Electronics IMI Ultra Electronics Laird Group Weir Group Meggitt The original comparator group also included FKI and Foseco which have subsequently delisted.
The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual report 2008 Overview 63 Business review Governance Financial statements During the year, an award over 220,000 shares was made to Mark Robertshaw and an award over 120,000 shares was made to Kevin Dangereld.
Awards to be made in 2009 will be based 100% on TSR against the comparator group on page 62.
This approach reects the challenges around setting robust EPS targets over the next three years and provides a clear focus on shareholder value creation.
Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The ESOS was also approved at the 2004 Annual General Meeting and offers executive Directors and other senior executives the opportunity to receive options granted at the market price of the Companys shares at the time of the grant.
Option awards are subject to a measure based on the comparative TSR performance of the Company measured over the three-year period from the start of the year in which the option is granted.
TSR is measured against a comparator group comprising the FTSE 350 at the date of grant.
If the Companys TSR performance places it at the median of the comparator group, 30% of the options will be exercisable, with 100% of the options being exercisable for upper quartile performance.
For performance between median and upper quartile, options are exercisable on a straight-line pro-rata basis.
The Committee must also be satisfied that the level of vesting is justied by the Companys underlying financial performance over the period.
No awards were made under the ESOS in 2007 or 2008 and there is currently no intention to make awards under the option plan in 2009.
The details of options and awards held by all Directors are shown on page 66.
Savings-related Share Option Scheme SAYE As UK employees, the executive Directors may also participate in the Savings-related Share Option Scheme on the same basis as other eligible employees and subject to UK legislation.
Scheme members save a xed amount per month over three years and options have been granted with an exercise price at 80% of the market price at the date of grant.
Those Directors who received options under this scheme are shown in the table on page 67.
No performance conditions apply to these options as they are a tax-efficient mechanism for all employees to acquire shares in the Company at their own cost.
Other benets Executive Directors are eligible to receive certain benets including a cash allowance in lieu of a company car, health insurance and, where appropriate, relocation and other expenses.
Shareholding guidelines In order to encourage alignment with shareholders, individual shareholding guidelines are operated for executive Directors and senior executives.
Under such guidelines, executive Directors are encouraged to build and maintain over time a shareholding in the Company equivalent to at least 100% of basic salary.
This policy is supported by the Deferred Bonus Share Matching Plan under which participants are encouraged to invest their bonus into Company shares.
Chairman and non-executive Directors Tim Stevenson was appointed as Chairman on 1 December 2006 and during the year he received an annual fee of 125,000.
Non-executive Directors receive a basic fee of 40,000.
Additional payments of 4,500 per annum are made to the Senior Independent Director, 7,500 to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and 5,000 to the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
The Chairman and non-executive Directors are also entitled to reimbursement of expenses incurred in attending Board, strategy and other meetings.
No changes were made to non-executive fees during the year.
Annual fees paid to the Chairman and non-executive Directors are reviewed on a biennial basis.
A review was held in 2008, while no increases were recommended for the non-executive Directors an increase for the Chairman was recommended based on market data but, at the request of the Chairman, has been deferred for 12 months and will be reviewed again in December 2009.
None of the non-executive Directors has a service contract with the Company although they do have letters of appointment which contain no obligations relating to any notice period.
There are no obligations on the Company to make any payments in lieu of notice to any non-executive Director.
The non-executive Directors do not participate in any of the incentive, share or share option plans.
Each of the non-executive Directors is subject to re-election by shareholders every third year after their initial conrmation by shareholders as a Director.
Should any non-executive Director serve for nine or more years they would be subject to annual re-election.
The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual report 2008 Overview 64 Business review Governance Financial statements Remuneration report continued Service contracts In 2008, Mark Robertshaw and Kevin Dangereld signed new service agreements.
The Companys policy remains unchanged such that executive Directors are employed on contracts subject to 12 months notice at any time.
Contracts may be terminated on 12 months notice given by the Company or on six months notice given by the Director concerned.
Contracts end on each Directors anticipated normal retirement date.
The following table shows the date of the contract for each executive Director who served during the year.
Date of Date of Executive Director appointment service agreement Kevin Dangereld 3 August 2006 15 August 2008 Mark Robertshaw 4 August 2006 15 August 2008 Both service agreements for Mark Robertshaw and Kevin Dangereld do not contain specic termination provisions.
In the event of early termination, the Company may be liable to pay an amount in damages having regard to salary, bonus and other benets that would have been received had they served out their notice period.
Company pensions policy The executive Directors participate in The Morgan Group Senior Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme which is a contributory, HMRC-registered, dened benefit, funded occupational pension scheme.
With effect from 6 April 2006 the basis of the scheme changed from final salary to career average and the normal pension age increased by five years.
Its main features are now: 3 A normal pension age of 65.
3 Pension at normal pension age of two-thirds career average pensionable salary, subject to completion of 20 years employment 26 years and eight months for new members.
3 Life assurance of four times basic salary.
Pensionable salary is the members basic salary restricted to a scheme earnings cap of 117,600 for the 2008-9 tax year.
In addition, executive Directors receive a pension allowance derived from employer contributions based notionally on the registered scheme pensionable salary in excess of the earnings cap as at 5 April 2006.
The value of the pension allowance for each executive Director is set out in the Directors emoluments table on page 65.
External directorships With the approval of the Board in each case, and subject to the overriding requirements of the Company, executive Directors may accept external appointments as non-executive Directors of other companies and retain any fees received.
The total amounts of fees received by Mark Robertshaw in respect of a non-executive Directorship was 35,000.
Performance graph The following graph shows the cumulative total shareholder return TSR for the Company for the five-year period to 4 January 2009 against the FTSE 350.
Both are rebased to 100 as at 5 January 2004.
The FTSE 350 is considered to be appropriate for comparison as a broad market index and the Company forms part of that index.

Mark Robertshaw and Kevin Dangereld voluntarily deferred 50% of their 2007 bonus awards into the Bonus Deferral Share Matching Plan as set out in the table on page 66.
2 Other benets include private medical insurance, the provision of a company car and fuel.
3 Joe MacHale retired from the Board on 18 April 2008.
4 71,499 of the Other payments made to Warren Knowlton in 2008 relate to the reimbursement by the Company to Warren Knowlton of US employer social costs in respect of his time with the Company.
Warren Knowltons liability to make such payments resulted from a change in his tax residence in December 2005.
The social security liability discharged by him was properly an employer cost and there was therefore no material benefit to him resulting from this payment.
The balancing gure of 12,725 relates to the cost of providing professional tax advice to Warren Knowlton in accordance with the Companys agreement with him on his retirement.
5 The payment made to Mark Lejman relates to the provision by the Company of life assurance and private medical insurance until December 2008 as agreed as part of his leaver provisions.
