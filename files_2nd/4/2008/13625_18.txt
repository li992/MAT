The figures shown for the increase in accrued pension over the year exclude any increase for inflation.
The accumulated accrued pension is that which would be paid annually on retirement from normal pension age, based on service to 31 December 2008.
A lump sum death benefit of four times basic annual salary is payable on death in service.
A dependants pension of one half of prospective pension is payable on death in service, and of one-half of pre-commutation pension on death in retirement.
Post-retirement increases are applied at the rate of increase of the Index of Retail Prices up to a maximum of 5% per annum, except that for pension benefits in respect of pensionable service up to 15 May 2000 the minimum inflationary increase is 4.5% per annum.
PI Frances pensionable salary used to calculate benefits in the defined benefit scheme is restricted to a Scheme specific earnings cap which is currently 117,600.
In addition PI France receives a cash payment of 22.5% of salary above the earnings cap.

The figures shown for the increase in accrued pension over the year incorporate the increase for inflation.
The transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the Actuarial Guidance Note GN 11 published by the Board for Actuarial Standards.
The increases in transfer values over the year are net of directors contributions if any.
The method used to calculate the transfer values has been revised since 31 December 2007.
Hence, the transfer values of the accrued pension as at 31 December 2007 have been disclosed on both the previous transfer value method i. e. that which would have been applicable at the start of the year and the current method.
The increases in transfer values over the year have been calculated consistently using the current method at both the start and the end of the year.
The increase in accrued pension and the increase in transfer value over the year for RH Arnold are relatively large due to movements in the US dollar relative to sterling.
In US dollars, the accrued pension for RH Arnold increased from $125,991 pa at 31 December 2007 to $141,276 pa at 31 December 2008 and the transfer value increased from $1,642,000 at 31 December 2007 to $1,793,000 at 31 December 2008.
The transfer value of accrued pension for RH Arnold reflects the benefits provided by the US scheme together with a US valuation of these benefits and is therefore not directly comparable with the transfer values for directors in the UK scheme.
WH Whiteley retired from the Scheme on 2 May 2008.
The increase in accrued pension for WH Whiteley is based on his pension entitlement at retirement, before cash commutation.
The transfer value at 31 December 2008 on the new transfer value method for WH Whiteley is based on his pension entitlement at retirement, before cash commutation, and market conditions at retirement.
