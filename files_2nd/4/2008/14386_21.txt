The report complies with the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations.
A resolution will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 18 November 2008 inviting them to approve this report.
Remuneration policy and arrangements The Remuneration Committee Responsibilities of the Committee include making recommendations to the Board on the Groups executive remuneration policy and determining, on behalf of the Board, specific remuneration packages for the executive directors and Chairman.
The Committee operates within agreed terms of reference which are available for inspection on the Companys website.
The Company complied with the provisions of the Combined Code 2006 on Corporate Governance relating to directors remuneration throughout the financial year except as is disclosed on page 43.
In 2007 08 the Committee consisted of: Mr S. J.
Chambers Chairman of the Committee : Mr D. H. Brydon: Mr D. J. Challen: Mr P. J. Jackson member from 16 April 2008 : Mr P. H. Loescher resigned on 4 April 2008 : and Sir Kevin Tebbit member from 16 April 2008.
Mr Brydon is absent when his own remuneration as Chairman of the Company is under consideration.
The Chief Executive attends meetings of the Committee by invitation: he is absent when his own remuneration is under consideration.
During the year, the Committee received material assistance and advice from the Chief Executive, the General Counsel who was also Secretary to the Committee until 3 June 2008 and the HR Director who was also Secretary to the Committee from 3 June 2008.
During the year, the Committee received advice from Kepler Associates, who succeeded Towers Perrin as the independent executive remuneration advisers to the Committee in March 2008, and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP.
Kepler Associates did not provide any other advice to the Group.
Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP, who were appointed by the Company, also advised the Group on various legal matters during the year.
Remuneration policy The Committee applies a remuneration policy which has at its core the following objectives: to align the interests of executives with those of shareholders to focus on top line growth, improving margins and capital discipline to link a significant proportion of remuneration to financial and individual performance, both in the short-term and long-term to provide strong linkage between remuneration and performance to ensure remuneration is market-competitive and helps attract and retain executives of the highest calibre.
Remuneration arrangements The remuneration of senior executives balances fixed, variable, short-term and long-term remuneration, and is reviewed each year to ensure that they are appropriately incentivised to achieve the Groups objectives.
For 2007 08, executive directors remuneration comprised basic salary, benefits in kind, annual bonus and pension benefits.
In addition, executive directors and senior executives participated in share-based incentive schemes, which in 2007 08 included the Smiths Group Sharesave Scheme, the Smiths Group Performance Share Plan PSP and the Smiths Group Co-Investment Plan CIP.
During the year, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the Groups senior executive remuneration arrangements with a view to ensuring that they support the new strategy of focusing on value creation at both Group and Divisional levels.
On 28 July 2008, shareholders approved the Value Sharing Plan VSP, a one-off long-term incentive plan rewarding executives for value creation at Group and Divisional levels over three-year and four-year periods commencing with the financial year 2008 09.
The two executive directors and any other Corporate participants will be rewarded under the VSP for value creation at a Group level, whereas the executives with divisional responsibilities will be rewarded for value creation within the division for which they are responsible.
The CIP will continue to operate with some amendments, also approved by shareholders.
The participants in the VSP including executive directors will not be eligible for awards under the Performance Share Plan in 2008 09 or 2009 10.

The fixed element is salary, which remains unchanged for both the Chief Executive and Finance Director, as described above: the variable elements assume that target annual bonuses will be achieved in respect of each year and include fair-value assessments of the long term incentive components of the packages awarded in each year.
Approximately 60% of the executive directors total remuneration for 2007 08 is expected to come from the variable elements of their packages: the changes outlined above for 2008 09 are anticipated to increase the proportion of their remuneration that is derived from variable elements to approximately 70%.
49 Smiths Group plc Annual report, year ended 31 July 2008 Elements of Remuneration Base salary and benefits Executive directors salaries have typically been reviewed annually, taking into account individual performance and experience, the size and nature of the role, the relative performance of the Company, remuneration policy within the Company and salaries at comparator companies.
The salaries for all participants in the Value Sharing Plan, including executive directors, will be frozen at current levels until 2010.
Executive directors base salaries for 2008 09 are, therefore, unchanged from 2007 08 at the following levels: Executive director Salary last reviewed 2008 09 salary Mr P Bowman 10 December 2007 800,000 Mr J Langston 1 August 2007 424,000 Benefits include a fully expensed company car, or an allowance in lieu, and health insurance.
Annual bonus 2007 08 Executive directors were eligible to participate in an annual bonus plan based on a combination of corporate financial goals Group and Divisional profit and cashflow and individual performance.
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for the Chief Executive was 120% of salary and for other executive directors was 100% of salary.
Bonuses to be paid to executive directors in respect of the 2007 08 financial year are set out in the emoluments table on page 51.
2008 09 Maximum annual bonus opportunities will be increased to 180% of salary for the Chief Executive and 150% of salary for any other executive director.
Targets will be made commensurately more demanding, and one-third of the bonus opportunity will be linked to the achievement of personal objectives.
50% of any net bonus earned must be invested in Smiths shares under the rules of the CIP.
Co-Investment Plan CIP 2007 08 Executive directors and selected senior executives were invited to participate in the CIP.
Participants were able to invest up to 100% of their net earned annual bonus or, if greater, 25% of salary into Smiths shares.
Invested amounts were eligible for a 1-for-1 matching share award after three years based on the pre-tax amount of salary or deferred bonus in question, subject to continued employment in the Group and the Companys average return on capital employed ROCE over the performance period exceeding the Companys weighted average cost of capital WACC over the same period by an average margin of at least 1% per annum.
2008 09 Executive directors and selected senior executives will be required to invest 50% of any net bonus earned in respect of 2008 09 in Smiths shares.
The maximum matching opportunity will be increased to 2-for-1, subject to the average ROCE exceeding the WACC by at least 3% p. a. over three years with a 1-for-1 match if ROCE is between WACC 1% and WACC 3% p. a.. As a change to 2007 08, notional dividends will be paid on matching shares that vest.
The Committee continues to regard ROCE as an appropriate performance condition for reflecting the operating efficiency of the Company.
Value Sharing Plans VSPs The Group and Divisional VSPs are one-off, long-term incentive plans, designed to reinforce Smiths strategy of focusing on shareholder value creation at the Group and Divisional levels.
Group VSP Messrs Bowman and Langston are participants in the Group VSP, which rewards executive directors and selected senior executives with a pre determined number of shares for every 5m of value created above a hurdle over the three-year and four-year performance periods from 1 August 2008 or until a vesting event, if earlier.
On 28 July 2008 Mr Bowman was granted an award under which he will be entitled to receive 1,250 Smiths Group shares for each 5m of surplus value created in respect of each performance period.
On the same date Mr Langston was granted an award under which he will be entitled to receive 500 Smiths Group shares for each 5m of surplus value created in respect of each performance period.
TSR Element One-third of the award will depend on the growth, over each performance period, in Smiths market capitalisation plus net equity cashflows to shareholders i. e. dividends plus share buybacks less share issues over and above the median total shareholder return of the FTSE100 companies excluding financial services companies.
Earnings Element The remaining two thirds of each award will be determined by the growth, over each performance period, in adjusted Profit Before Tax PBT 2007 08: 338.6m times a fixed multiple of 12 plus net equity cashflows to shareholders over and above a cost of equity hurdle return of 9.5% p. a.
Participants will only be entitled to a vesting of shares under the TSR Element if the Committee is satisfied that this is justified by the underlying financial performance of the Company over the Performance Period.
No retesting of either performance condition is permitted.
50 Smiths Group plc Annual report, year ended 31 July 2008 Directors remuneration report continued Divisional VSPs In addition to the Group VSP, the Committee has introduced Divisional plans for each of the five divisions Smiths Detection, Smiths Medical, John Crane, Smiths Interconnect, and Flex-Tek.
The plans are along the same lines as the Group VSP to help focus the most senior Divisional executives on maximising the value of their divisions and returning surplus cash.
Further details on the Divisional VSPs are contained in the Circular Letter to Shareholders dated 4 July 2008.
Performance Share Plan PSP No awards will be made under the PSP to executive directors or any other participants in the VSP in 2008 09 and 2009 10.
Grants to executive directors in 2007 08 were between 112.5% and 133.3% of salary.
An award of 150% of salary was made to Mr Bowman on his appointment.
Awards vest after three years, subject to performance conditions.
One-third of the award vests based on the Companys TSR performance relative to the FTSE100 companies excluding financial services companies : the remaining two-thirds of the award vests subject to an earnings per share EPS growth target measured before exceptional items.
Sharesave Scheme The Smiths Group Sharesave Scheme, which is open to all UK employees with at least 12 months service, is subject to UK legislation as to the amount that can be saved.
Participants save a fixed sum per month for three or five years and may use the sum generated by their savings contracts to exercise the options which are usually granted at a 20% discount to the market price.
Share ownership guidelines It is the Committees policy that executive directors should, over time, acquire a shareholding with a value equal to at least one and a half years gross salary and retain at least 50% of any net vested share awards after sales to meet tax liabilities until those values are achieved.
In 2008 09, the share ownership guideline will be increased to two years gross salary for the Chief Executive.
Share scheme dilution limits The Company follows the guidelines laid down by the Association of British Insurers.
These restrict the issue of new shares under all the Companys share schemes in any 10-year period to 10 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital and under the Companys discretionary schemes to 5 per cent in any 10-year period.
As at 31 July 2008, the headroom available under these limits was 3.8% and 0.1%, respectively excluding the conditional share awards granted under the VSP on 28 July 2008.
Pension The Company operates appropriate pension arrangements for executive directors.
In the case of Mr Bowman, the Company pays a monthly salary supplement of a percentage of salary approved by the Committee to enable him to make his own pension provision.
In the case of Mr Langston, a final salary scheme provides a pension of up to two-thirds of final pensionable salary.
The Company continues to apply an earnings cap, on a basis similar to the pre-2006 statutory limit, to determine the proportion of overall pension payable by the regulated pension scheme, with the balance of pension provided by the Company.
This arrangement substantially represents a continuation of pre-2006 practice and involves no additional cost for the Company.
In appropriate cases, the Company permits the waiver of salary and pension supplement entitlements where the arrangement does not involve additional cost for the Company.
Where such waivers are made, incentives and pension entitlements continue to be calculated by reference to salaries prior to these reductions.
Details of the salary supplements, waiver and other pension provisions are set out in the tables on pages 51 and 52.
Five-year historical TSR performance The following graph shows the Companys total shareholder return TSR performance over the past five years compared to the FTSE100 Index.
The FTSE100 Index, of which the Company has been a member throughout the period, has been selected to reflect the TSR performance of other leading UK-listed companies.

Under the arrangements approved by the Remuneration Committee, Mr Butler-Wheelhouse waived entitlements to certain of his emoluments in return for the Company making equivalent amounts of contributions to the Smiths Industries Pension Scheme to provide money purchase benefits, which does not involve additional cost for the Company.
Under these arrangements, Mr Butler-Wheelhouse waived 38,905.79 during the year.
The amounts waived would otherwise have been paid to Mr Butler-Wheelhouse as payments in lieu of pension contributions and are included in the table above.
In common with other UK employees participating in the relevant pension schemes, the salaries of Messrs Langston and Lillycrop were each reduced by 8,580 and the Company paid the same amount directly to the pension schemes during the year.
The salaries shown in the table above for these directors are the amounts they would have been paid if they had not given up these salary entitlements.
Mr Butler-Wheelhouse retired on 10 December 2007.
The salary, benefits and pension contribution information in the table above relates to his employment from 1 August 2007 to 10 December 2007.
Further information on Mr Butler-Wheelhouses termination arrangements, including his bonus payment for 2007 08, is set out below.
Mr Lillycrop remained in service on his existing terms and conditions following his resignation from the board.
The information in the table reflects salary and benefits up to his resignation and the proportion of the 2007 08 bonus attributable to his period of service as a director within that year.
During the period 4 June to 31 July 2008, Mr Lillycrop received 63,388 in salary and benefits to the value of 13,164 as an employee: the proportion of his 2007 08 bonus attributable to that period was 53,395.

An executive directors normal retirement age is 60.
An early retirement pension, based on actual service completed, may be paid after age 50 and may be subject to a reduction on account of early payment.
On death, a spouses pension of two-thirds of the directors pension or for deathin-service his prospective pension at age 60 is payable.
All pensions in excess of the Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMP are guaranteed to increase at the lesser of i 7% per annum compound and ii the annual increase in the Retail Prices Index.
There has, however, been a long-standing practice of granting additional discretionary increases on pensions in excess of the GMP to bring them into line with price inflation.
The benefits provided under the relevant pension schemes were not affected by these arrangements.
Transfer values of the accrued benefits have been calculated in accordance with actuarial guidance GN11, and represent the amount that the pension scheme would pay to another pension provider if the member elects to transfer all of his benefits out of the scheme.
The transfer values do not represent sums payable or due to the individual directors and therefore cannot be added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The transfer basis changed with effect from August 2007 and therefore the transfer value at 31 July 2007 is shown on the revised basis for comparison purposes see Column C in the table above.

Service contracts The Companys policy is that executive directors are normally employed on terms which include a one-year rolling period of notice and provision for the payment of a predetermined sum in the event of termination of employment in certain circumstances but excluding circumstances where the Company is entitled to dismiss without compensation.
Mr Bowman is employed under a service contract with the Company dated 15 November 2007 and effective from 10 December 2007.
The service contract is for an indefinite term expressed to end automatically on his anticipated normal retirement date age 60, but may be terminated by 12 months notice given by the Company save that during the first 12 months of employment, the notice period shall expire on the second anniversary of the effective date or six months notice given by Mr Bowman.
The Company may elect to terminate the contract by making a payment in lieu of notice equal to 150% of Mr Bowmans basic salary in respect of the unserved notice period.
In this event, the contract provides that Mr Bowmans bonus entitlement for the financial year in which termination occurs and for the unserved notice period will be the subject of a separate, good faith discussion between Mr Bowman and the Chairman: the contract also specifies that Mr Bowman will be treated as a good leaver for the purposes of relevant share plans.
In certain constructive dismissal events, Mr Bowman is entitled to resign and be treated in the manner set out above.

In addition, the Company has given its irrevocable consent to early payment of Mr Langstons pension from age 50 and without actuarial reduction from age 55.
Mr Lillycrop, who resigned as a director on 3 June 2008, remains employed under a service contract dated 26 September 2001.
Under a compromise agreement dated 14 August 2008, it has been agreed that Mr Lillycrop will remain in service until 30 November 2008 serving six months of his notice period, continuing to receive normal salary and benefits until that date.

Mr Butler-Wheelhouse, who resigned as a director on 10 December 2007, was employed under a service contract with the Company dated 26 September 2001, as varied by a letter dated 31 July 2007.
Although it had been anticipated that Mr Butler-Wheelhouse would be retiring on 31July 2008, such that no compensation would have been payable to him under his service contract on retirement, his employment was, in fact, terminated on 10 December 2007 in order to facilitate handover arrangements to his successor as Chief Executive.
He was accordingly entitled under his contract to receive a termination payment of 833,055, representing his entitlement to salary, pension allowance and benefits in kind for the period from 11 December 2007 to 31 July 2008, and a cash bonus of 915,363 being an amount equal to the average of the annual bonuses paid to him over the three financial years 2004 05, 2005 06 and 2006 07.
He was also entitled to the continuation of private healthcare for his and his spouses lifetimes and to life cover and car benefits until 31 July 2008.
In relation to Mr Butler-Wheelhouses share awards under the PSP and matching share awards under the CIP, the Committee agreed to provide him with the most favourable treatment under the rules, so that his awards will be preserved and capable of vesting on the normal vesting dates without application of time prorating.

Options and awards which lapsed during the financial year ended 31 July 2008 are indicated in the table above by a hash mark # : no other options or awards held by any director lapsed during the period 1 August 2007 to 31 July 2008.
No other Director held any options over the Companys shares during the period 1 August 2007 to 31 July 2008.
No options or awards have been granted to or exercised by directors or have lapsed during the period 1 August to 19 September 2008.
Executive directors received their final grants of options under the 95 ESOS in October 2003.
From 2004 to 2007, senior executives, including directors, received awards under the PSP.
The final grant of options under the DSS was issued in December 2004: the DSS has been replaced by the CIP.
PSP awards will be released after three years to the extent a performance condition is met.
One-third of the award is subject to a TSR target relative to other FTSE 100 companies excluding financial companies and investment trusts.
For full vesting, the Companys TSR must be at or above the 75th percentile over the three year performance period.
25% of the award will vest if the Companys TSR is at median.
Awards will vest on a straight-line pro rata basis between median and 75th percentile.
The remaining two-thirds of the award will be subject to an earnings per share EPS growth target measured before exceptional items.
For each of the three year cycles commencing in 2005 06, 2006 07 and 2007 08 full vesting will occur if the compound annual growth in EPS is equivalent to 12% per annum.
25% vesting will occur if the compound annual growth in EPS is equivalent to 5% per annum, with vesting on a straightline basis between 5% and 12%.
The Committee considered the use of two measures, in these proportions, to be appropriate.
The TSR performance measure is dependent on the Companys relative long-term share price performance and, therefore, brings a market perspective to the Performance Share Plan.
This is balanced by a key internal measure, EPS growth, which is critical to our long-term success and ties in with the Groups strategic goals.
The Committee determined the threshold and maximum vesting levels operated to date after considering the Companys historic performance and future plans, and on the basis of external advice.
There will be no retesting of the TSR and EPS performance measures.
The VSP had replaced the PSP and no awards will be made under the PSP in 2008 09 or 2009 10.
The performance criterion for EPS-element of the PSP Awards granted on 7 December 2004 was exceeded and the PSP-element of the Awards vested in full on 7 December 2007.
The performance criterion for the TSR-element of the 2004 PSP Awards was not passed and the TSR-element of all those Awards lapsed on 7 December 2007.
The performance tests for options granted the 95 ESOS up to and including December 2004 have all been passed with the sole exception of the grant on 9 April 2002, which failed its initial test and two annual retests.
No further retests of the April 2002 grant will be undertaken.
The April 2002 grant can now only be exercised in the event of a change in control of the Company or by certain good leavers, in which circumstances the performance tests will be waived.
Under the DSS executive directors were able to use their after tax bonus to purchase the Companys shares at the prevailing market price.
At the end of a three year period, if the Director is still in office, he can exercise an option granted to him over matching shares, in respect of any shares retained for that period.
The number of matching shares awarded was determined by the Committee at the end of the year in which the bonus was earned by reference to annual bonus, and other corporate financial criteria.
The last grant under the DSS was made on 7 December 2004, in respect of bonus earned in the year to 31 July 2004, and matched shares purchased in the market by the grantee on that day.
At 31 July 2008 the trustee of the Employee Share Trust held 1,095,965 shares of which 18,582 shares were held for the benefit of senior executives with extant DSS options none of the directors had an interest in these shares at 31 July 2008, as disclosed above.
The market value of the shares held by the trustee on 31 July 2008 was 11.47m and dividends of approximately 291,114 were waived in the year in respect of the shares held by the trustee during the year.
There are no performance criteria for the SAYE, DSS or the TI 90 ESOS.
Special provisions permit early exercise of options and vesting of awards in the event of redundancy, death, etc.
