Remuneration Committee The Company has established a Remuneration Committee the Committee which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Combined Code.
The current members of the Committee, all of whom are independent Non-Executive Directors, are given on page 22.
The Chairman of the Committee is Mr R J Harrison OBE.
The Group Company Secretary acts as its secretary.
The role of the Committee is to decide on all aspects of the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and the Chairman.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is a matter to be agreed between the Chairman and the Chief Executive.
The Committee reviews and retains a right of veto on all aspects of remuneration for all direct reports of Executive Directors and all members of the senior management team.
1 Remuneration Policy The Group aims to provide competitive salary and benefit packages for all employees.
As far as is practicable it pursues a consistent policy of terms and conditions across the Divisions.
In that context benefits such as share options and pension scheme membership are open to all qualifying employees.
In assessing all aspects of pay and benefits, comparison is made with the packages offered by companies of similar size and business diversity and after considering general pay and employment conditions in the Group.
The Committee has access to New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, who as independent consultants, provide external research on market data and trends.
1 Executive Directors The Committee aims to ensure that remuneration packages are competitive and designed to attract, retain and motivate the Executive Directors to maintain the profitable growth of the business.
As far as possible, it is the Committees intention to align Executive Directors interests with those of the shareholders.
The main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors are as follows: Basic salary Benefits in kind Annual bonus scheme Pension arrangements Share incentive schemes.
The Groups policy is that a substantial proportion of the remuneration of the Executive Directors should be performance related.
The targeted composition of each Executive Directors annual remuneration is for performance related remuneration to be more than 50% of the total.
Executive Directors, subject to Board approval, may hold an external non-executive directorship of businesses that do not compete with The BSS Group plc.
Directors may retain payments received in respect of these positions.
Basic salary Basic salary for each Executive Director is determined by the Committee annually after a review of individual performance and having regard to competitive practice.
Pay rises take effect from 1 April each year unless an individual changes role, when pay changes take effect from the date of change.
Benefits in kind The Executive Directors receive certain benefits in kind, which in the main relate to the provision of a company car.
Annual bonus scheme All of the Executive Directors are eligible to participate in a short term incentive scheme for which targets are set annually by the Remuneration Committee.
The targets are designed to encourage individual performance, operating efficiencies and profitable growth.
During 2007-2008 these related to improvements in profit before taxation after allowance for bonuses 55% of basic salary and the achievement of working capital targets 10% of basic salary.
Therefore the maximum payable under the scheme during 2007-2008 was 65% of basic salary.
For the financial year 2008-2009, the maximum payable under the scheme will be 100%.
The targets for 2008-2009 are again based upon the achievement of working capital targets 10% of basic salary and improvement in profit before taxation after allowance for bonuses.
The profit before taxation is based upon growth in percentage terms above the budget profit before taxation for the Group.
Bonuses are paid out in June following the announcement of the results for the financial year.

The maximum number of shares granted to any Director in any one year is equivalent to one year of basic salary.
The Plan is structured to reward performance where the Group achieves strong growth in earnings per share EPS in excess of growth in the Retail Prices Index RPI.
The third award under the Plan was made on 21 June 2007: performance for this award will be measured over three financial years ended 31 March 2008, 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2010.
The principal features of the Plan are as follows: participants will receive a promise of free shares subject to meeting specific performance conditions: and vesting of awards will only take place once the performance conditions have been satisfied With a view to linking rewards to performance, average EPS growth per annum for the awards made shall result in vesting as follows: Growth in EPS average per annum over RPI Vesting Less than 5% EPS No part of the award will vest Between 5% and 10% inclusive Straight line proportionate vesting between 30% and 100% inclusive More than 10% EPS 100% of the award will vest The 100% vesting EPS targets for the previous three years' grants are shown in the table below.
Where RPI information is not available yet, a rate of 3% has been assumed.
All targets for the years ending March 2006, March 2007 and March 2008 have been met.
