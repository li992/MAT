Directors Remuneration Report The Directors submit this report in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.
An Ordinary Resolution for the approval of this report will be put to members at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The law requires the Companys Auditors to audit certain of the disclosures provided.
Where disclosures have been audited they are indicated as such.
Remuneration and Nomination Committee The Remuneration Committee which existed until 30 July 2008 comprised all the Directors of the Company other than the Chairman and was chaired by Mr JP Williams.
The Remuneration and Nomination Committee which was formed on 31 July 2008 incorporates the duties of the former Remuneration Committee and Nomination Committee and comprises all of the Directors of the Company and is chaired by Mr JP Williams.
The Board considers that creating a combined Committee is a natural and efficient way to deal with the recruitment and remuneration of the Companys Directors.
The Remuneration Committee met once during the year to consider the Directors remuneration and in the context of the increased workload imposed by the Companys new investment strategy and an increased level of Board, Committee and informal meetings of Directors it has decided to restructure the Directors remuneration.
The basic Directors fee for each Director is now 35,000 per annum with an additional fee of 115,000 per annum for the Chairman of the Company.
An additional fee of 6,000 per annum is payable to the Chairman of the Audit, the Valuations and the Remuneration and Nomination Committees.
Separate additional fees of 3,000 per annum are payable to the non-Chairman members of the Valuations Committee.
There were no meetings of the new Remuneration and Nomination Committee in the period to 30 September 2008.
Policy on Directors Remuneration The policy of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee is that remuneration of non-executive Directors should be fair and sufficient to attract Directors to properly oversee the affairs of the Company and should reflect the specific circumstances of the Company, the duties and responsibilities of the Directors and the value and amount of time committed to the Companys affairs.
It is intended that this policy will continue for the year ended 30 September 2009 and subsequent years.
Non-executive Directors are not eligible to receive bonuses, pension benefits, share options or other benefits.
The Remuneration and Nomination Committee relies mainly on general salary surveys in respect of its consideration of the level of Directors remuneration.
The total remuneration of the Directors is determined by the provisions in the Articles of Association and by shareholders resolutions.
Directors Service Contracts None of the Directors has a service contract with the Company.
No arrangements have been entered into between the Company and the Directors to entitle any of the Directors to compensation for loss of office.
Total Shareholder Return Pursuant to the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, the Company is required to show a graph of total shareholder return against a suitable benchmark index in its Directors Remuneration Report.
The graph below compares the Companys total shareholder return over the five financial years to 30 September 2008 with the FTSE All-Share Index.
The Directors consider that, since the Company invests in a broad range of commercial sectors, the FTSE All-Share Index was the most appropriate index against which to compare the Companys performance for these five years.
