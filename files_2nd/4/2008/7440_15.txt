Overview Business review Directors Governance Financial statements remuneration report Further information Introduction This Directors remuneration report sets out information on the remuneration of the Directors of Hochschild Mining plc for the year ended 31 December 2008.
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985 and the requirements of the Financial Services Authoritys Listing Rules.
As required by legislation, the information provided in the table in the section entitled Long-Term Incentive Plan and the table on Directors total remuneration and accompanying notes has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP as it contains the information upon which the auditors are required to report to the Companys shareholders.
Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Jorge Born Jr. and its other members are Sir Malcolm Field and Nigel Moore.
All the members of the Remuneration Committee are independent Non-Executive Directors.
The duties of the Remuneration Committee are to determine and agree with the Board the broad policy for the remuneration of the Executive Directors, the other members of the Executive Committee and the Company Secretary, as well as their specific remuneration packages including pension rights and, where applicable, any compensation payments.
In determining such policy, the Remuneration Committee shall take into account all factors which it deems necessary to ensure that members of the senior executive management of the Group are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage strong performance and are rewarded in a fair and responsible manner for their individual contributions to the success of the Group.
The composition of the Remuneration Committee and its terms of reference comply with the provisions of the Combined Code and are available for inspection on the Companys website at www.
The Remuneration Committee was advised during the year on remuneration matters generally by Kepler Associates and most notably, on a review of the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and senior management, and the structure of the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP which was put to shareholders for approval at the 2008 AGM.
Kepler Associates did not provide any other services to the Group during the year.
Remuneration policy The Remuneration Committee continued to implement in 2008, and intends to implement in 2009, its agreed policy on executive remuneration as previously disclosed.
The principal objectives of the Groups policy are to attract, retain, and motivate its executives and senior management and to align management incentives with the creation of shareholder value.
It is considered critical that this alignment is achieved over both the short and long-term and this is done through the use of annual performance-related bonuses which reward the achievement of a balanced mix of financial and operational performance measures, and the Total Shareholder Return TSR related performance conditions attached to awards under the Long-Term Incentive Plan.
2008 Remuneration Review In the early part of 2008, the Remuneration Committee undertook a review of the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors and of senior management within the following parameters: total compensation shall be weighted in favour of variable compensation, in order to provide the appropriate level of incentive to perform.
total cash compensation shall be in the lower quartile of the Groups peers, with total remuneration in the upper quartile.
During the review, the Committee made reference to pay levels of other international mining companies of comparable size.
The benchmarking exercise was completed at the end of February 2008 and revised packages, where appropriate, were put in place from 1 March 2008.
Fixed and variable pay The following chart sets out the split between fixed and variable pay at both target and maximum performance.
The maximum bonus percentages are set out in each Executive Directors service contract and have been set to ensure that the majority of the remuneration is performance based.

Basic salaries As stated above, the remuneration packages of the Executive Directors were reviewed in early 2008 resulting in revised salaries being paid with effect from 1 March 2008.
Base salaries for each Executive Director are paid 20% by the Company and 80% by Compania Minera Ares S. A. C. a wholly owned subsidiary.
The review of remuneration packages carried out during the year sought to ensure that the Executive Directors were paid in line with comparable companies taking into account individual contribution and scope of responsibility.
Short-term incentives Each year the Remuneration Committee approves objectives for each of the Executive Directors based on individual roles and responsibilities and are intended to reward strong financial performance of the Group and achievement of key operational targets within the individuals scope of responsibilities.
The level of bonus paid depends on performance against these objectives and are subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.

Initial awards under the LTIP were made subject to shareholders approving the Plan at the 2008 AGM.
Awards made under the Plan to Executive Directors are subject to a normal limit, capping awards to a value not exceeding six times salary at the date of grant excluding interest on the deferred proportion of the award.
52 Hochschild Mining plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008 As at 31 December 2008, Eduardo Hochschild was the only Executive Director participating in the Plan and details of his award are given in the table below.
Interests in the Maximum awards Awards vested Interests in the LTIP at 31 12 2007 made during the year during the year LTIP at 31 12 2008 Eduardo Hochschild $4m $4m Going forward, the Committee intends to make LTIP awards no less than every three years, subject to the limit specified above.
The vesting of initial awards under the Plan is subject to the Companys TSR over a three year period to 31 December 2010, relative to a tailored peer group of listed international gold and silver mining companies the Comparator Index.
These companies are Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd, Alamos Gold, AngloGold Ashanti Ltd, Apex Silver Mines Ltd, Barrick Gold Corp, Cia des Minas Buenaventura SA, Couer dAlene Mines Corp, Eldorado Gold Corp, Gold Fields Ltd, Goldcorp Inc, Highland Gold Mining Ltd, Iamgold Corp, Kinross Gold Corp, Minefinders Corp, Newmont Mining Corp, PAN American Silver Corp, Peter Hambro Mining Plc, Polymetal and Silver Standard Resources Inc. 25% of the maximum cash payment vests if the Company achieves median TSR performance, 75% of the maximum cash payment vests at upper quartile TSR performance and the whole award vests at upper decile TSR performance.
Vesting occurs on a straight-line basis for TSR performance between median and upper quartile and between upper quartile and upper decile.
Awards are subject to two clawbacks in relation to a whole, or part of an, award : firstly, if based on a discretionary assessment by the Remuneration Committee, the overall underlying business performance of the Company during the performance period is not satisfactory: and secondly, if there are failures relating to safety, environment, community and legal compliance that the Remuneration Committee considers would entitle it to exercise its discretion.
On a change of control, awards made under the LTIP may vest early unless a replacement award is made, but would be pro-rated to take account of the proportion of the period from the award date to the normal vesting date completed prior to the change of control, and the extent to which performance conditions applying to the award have been met.
In respect of the year ended 31 December 2008, the Companys TSR was below the median of that of the Comparator Index.
Directors service contracts The Executive Directors are employed under contracts of employment with the Company and Compaa Minera Ares S. A. C. a Group company, dated 16 October 2006 as subsequently amended.
The contracts have no fixed terms and may be terminated on 12 months notice in writing.
In setting the notice period for termination at 12 months, the Remuneration Committee has reduced the likelihood of having to pay excessive compensation in the event of poor performance and to this end, a provision for immediate dismissal with no compensation payable in the event of unsatisfactory performance is included in each Directors contract.
External appointments The Group recognises that certain Executive Directors are, in addition, Directors of other companies and that such appointments can bring benefits to the Group.
Details of the directorships of those Executive Directors in office as at 31 December 2008 are given in the table below, together with the amounts received by them during the year under review.
