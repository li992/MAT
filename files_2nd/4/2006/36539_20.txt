Remuneration report The Directors submit their report on remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2006.
This report has been approved and adopted by the Board and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of s234B of the Companies Act 1985 as amended by The Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 the Regulations and the Listing, Prospectus and Disclosure Rules.
The information, the headings of which have been noted with an asterisk, is subject to audit in accordance with the Regulations.
the remuneratiOn cOmmittee The Remuneration Committees responsibilities are set out in its terms of reference which are available on request to shareholders and on the Companys website.
These responsibilities include determination of company policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors and approval of the composition and level of remuneration of Executive Directors and certain senior executives.
This includes an annual review of all incentive plans to ensure that they remain appropriate to the Companys current circumstances and prospects.
The Board has accepted, without amendment, the Committees recommendations relating to remuneration policy.
cOmmittee membership The Committee currently comprises John Barton Chairman, John Clare, John Nelson and Tony Watson.
John Nelson was appointed on 21 July 2006 following a revision to the Combined Code permitting company chairmen to be members of remuneration committees.
John Nelson was considered independent on his appointment as Chairman in 2005 and the Board considers each of the other members of the Committee to be independent.
The Committee met on five occasions during 2006.
Following John Bartons retirement on 3 May 2007, John Clare will become Chairman of the Committee.
remuneratiOn pOlicy In determining an appropriate remuneration policy for recommendation to the Board, the Committees objective is to ensure that the Company continues to attract, retain and motivate experienced individuals, capable of making a major contribution to Hammersons success.
Remuneration for Executive Directors and senior executives takes account of performance through an annual performance-related bonus scheme and, for longterm performance, by the award of shares under a long term incentive plan.
The Boards intention is that Executive Directors and senior executives should build a shareholding in the Company with a value equivalent to at least their annual basic salary.
In implementing the policy, following its approval by the Board, the Committee takes into account remuneration packages available within other comparable companies, the Companys overall performance, achievement of corporate objectives, individual performance and published views of investors and their representatives.
advisers As referred to below, New Bridge Street Consultants LLP were appointed by the Committee during the year to assist in a review of remuneration policy.
They have provided no other services to the Company during 2006.
John Richards attends all meetings of the Committee by invitation, except when his own remuneration is being discussed, to provide information and advise on strategy and performance and on remuneration strategy for senior executives.
The groups Director of Human Resources attends certain meetings by invitation.
remuneratiOn cOmmittee revieW OF the year During the year, the Remuneration Committee appointed New Bridge Street Consultants LLP to undertake a review of the Companys remuneration policy, with particular reference to its application to Executive Directors and senior management.
This review concluded that variable remuneration, in the form of bonus and long-term incentive plans, was low compared to market levels, the consequence of which was to depress total remuneration below median levels.
It is the Committees objective, having regard to the views of investors, that the Companys remuneration policy should provide for median, or below median, basic salary but with the opportunity to increase total potential remuneration for superior performance through variable remuneration in the form of bonus and long-term incentives.
In conjunction with New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, the Committee has therefore designed a Long-Term Incentive Plan which will initially use a combination of total shareholder return and total property return as performance measures in order to provide a challenging target which will enable an appropriate level of reward to be paid for superior performance.
The Companys leading institutional shareholders and their representative bodies were consulted prior to these proposals being finalised and they have indicated that they are supportive of them.
The proposed new Long-Term Incentive Plan, which will replace the existing Deferred Share Plan, provides for conditional awards of Performance Shares worth up to 200% of salary with a 300% limit in exceptional circumstances although the Committee has no current intention to make awards worth more than 150% of salary.
60 Annual Report 2006 The Committee has considered various performance measures and has concluded that a combination of Total Shareholder Return TSR performance thus aligning the interests of Directors with shareholders and Total Property Return TPR to focus on the underlying property returns is appropriate.
For Executive Directors, one half of the award will be based on each of these performance measures over a single three year performance period.
TPR performance will be measured over three financial years commencing with the year of grant and will be compared to a composite index comprising Investment Property Databanks IPD Annual UK Index and Annual France All Property Index, the relative composition of which will potentially vary with each grant to ensure that it reflects the Companys portfolio.
For the initial grant it is intended that the ratio will be 70% UK and 30% France.
Vesting under the TPR performance condition will be as follows: less than index 0% equal to index 25% index 0.5% average p. a.
100% Vesting for intermediate performance will be pro-rata on a straight-line basis.
Prior to each grant, the Committee will consider this range of targets to ensure they remain appropriate in the light of experience and anticipated future performance.
TSR performance will be measured over a single three year period from the date of grant, in comparison with a comparator group currently comprising 17 entities, including some European real estate companies.
Vesting under the TSR performance condition will be as follows: Below TSR of median-ranked entity 0% Equal to TSR of median-ranked entity 25% Equal to TSR of upper quartile-ranked entity 100% Awards between median and upper quartile entities will be on a sliding scale between 25% and 100%.
The level of threshold vesting will apply only for awards with a face value of up to 150% of salary i. e. with a maximum threshold vesting of 37.5% of salary and for larger awards other than when used on recruitment the vesting at threshold will not exceed 37.5% of salary.
The Committee has also reviewed the existing Executive Share Option Scheme and has concluded that awards to certain UK employees, except Directors, under a Restricted Share Plan would provide a more appropriate reward and an opportunity to build up a shareholding in the Company for those employees who currently participate in the Executive Share Option Scheme.
Accordingly a Restricted Share Plan, under which grants of conditional share awards which will vest on the third anniversary of grant subject to continued employment will be introduced for certain UK employees at the same time as the new Long Term Incentive Plan.
For French employees, a scheme appropriate to French legislation governing share schemes under which awards vest two years after grant, subject to the satisfaction of a performance target, has been introduced following approval at the Companys 2006 Annual General Meeting.
The Committee also reviewed the effect of A Day on the pensions of Executive Directors.
Details of pension arrangements are set out on page 66 of this report.
remuneratiOn OF executive directOrs and seniOr executives The remuneration packages for senior staff, including Executive Directors, consist of the following elements and are structured to reward corporate and individual performance.
Details of all payments to Executive Directors, which are disclosed in the table on page 65, show the relative values of basic and performance-related elements of remuneration.
basic salary and beneFits Basic salaries for Executive Directors and other senior executives are reviewed by the Committee, normally annually or otherwise on promotion, having regard to responsibility, competitive market practice, company and individual performance and independently compiled salary survey information.
Benefits include the use of a company car or the provision of a car allowance, medical insurance and life assurance cover.
Annual Report 2006 61 [Section 06] Remuneration report continued annual perFOrmance-related bOnus scheme Full-time staff throughout the Company, including Executive Directors, participate in a performance-related bonus scheme.
Payments under the scheme, which are not pensionable, are based on the achievement of profit, net asset value and operational targets.
The amount payable to Executive Directors in any one year could be up to 100% of their basic salary, with 60% of the payment receivable in shares in the Company of which half vest immediately and half vest two years after the date of grant.
Between 1 January 2006 and 1 March 2007 the following shares were issued to Executive Directors under the bonus scheme, based on the achievement of performance targets in respect of the previous financial year: Number of shares Date of grant 1 March 2006 1 March 2007 John Richards 4,669 4,686 David Atkins 694 789 John Bywater 2,847 Peter Cole 2,935 3,276 Grard Devaux 2,310 1,827 Simon Melliss 3,095 3,276 deFerred share plan Provided the recommendation for the introduction of the Hammerson plc 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan referred to above is approved by shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, no further options will be granted under the existing Deferred Share Plan.

The Committee approves awards under the Plan by way of nil cost options.
The annual value of awards under the Plan are set to a maximum of 95% of salary.
Under the terms of the Plan, the actual number of shares received by participants is based on the comparative total shareholder return performance of the Company against a peer group of the eight largest quoted UK property companies, including Hammerson.
There will be no vesting of shares unless the Companys performance is in the top half of the comparator group and there will be a progressive vesting schedule according to the Companys ranking within the top half of the comparator group as follows: % of Ranking shares vesting 1st 100.00 2nd 83.33 3rd 66.67 4th 50.00 The Plan is administered by a Trustee which has acquired shares, financed by drawing down interest-free loan facilities from the Company, to satisfy the issue of shares to participants under the Plan and other share incentive schemes.
During the year, the Company financed the purchase of 300,000 shares for the Trust by a loan of 3,951,943.
At 31 December 2006 the Trustee held 735,137 shares, 304,946 shares having been used during the year for payments under the Plan and other share incentive schemes.
Under the terms of the Trust, the Trustee is obliged to waive dividends on this holding of shares, except for a nominal amount.
At 31 December 2006 the maximum number of shares that could be awarded to Executive Directors under all grants made under the Plan to date was as follows: Maximum number of shares Date of grant 11 May 2004 8 March 2005 1 March 2006 John Richards 55,165 46,685 38,700 David Atkins 13,273 13,600 10,934 John Bywater 31,523 26,600 21,183 Peter Cole 33,672 28,771 27,701 Grard Devaux 32,956 27,685 22,813 Simon Melliss 38,687 32,571 27,701 62 Annual Report 2006 executive share OptiOn scheme Employees, including Executive Directors prior to the introduction of the Deferred Share Plan in 2000, have been granted share options under the Hammerson plc 1995 Approved and Unapproved Share Option Schemes.
No payment is made by participants in consideration for the grant of options.
The Unapproved Scheme was established to allow the grant of options where the cumulative value of subsisting options as at the date of their grant is in excess of 30,000.
The Committee approves grants, which are phased, of share options under the Schemes.
Both Schemes are subject to performance targets.
Options granted between 1995 and 2004 can be exercised only if the rate of increase in the Companys earnings per share over any three year period is at least 6% in excess of the rate of increase in the Retail Price Index during that period.
Following renewal of the schemes in 2005, options granted since 2005 can be exercised only if earnings per share over three years exceed the Retail Price Index over the same period by 9%.
During the year, John Richards exercised options granted on 4 October 1999 over 63,081 ordinary shares at an exercise price of 4.80.
The market prices on the dates of exercise were 11.83 in respect of 33,081 of the resultant shares sold and 12.95 in respect of 30,000 of the resultant shares sold resulting in a total gain of 447,059.

Pension entitlements are based on basic salary.
In previous years, members who joined the Scheme on or after 1 June 1989 namely John Bywater and Simon Melliss were subject to restrictions imposed by the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
Following the introduction of the Finance Act 2004, these restrictions no longer apply for service accrued on or after 6 April 2006.
In the case of John Bywater, provision is made by way of an unfunded commitment to ensure a pension of 1 30th of final salary for each year of pensionable service prior to 6 April 2006.
In the case of Simon Melliss, provision in respect of pensionable salary above the restriction was paid to a money purchase arrangement prior to 6 April 2006.
Although this unapproved fund will remain active, no further provision will be made.
Grard Devaux also participates in the unfunded pension scheme to obtain the same overall level of pension provision as other Executive Directors.
No pension arrangements are made by the Company for Non-Executive Directors.
Since 6 April 2006 an individuals benefits under the Companys pension scheme would be subject to additional tax should those benefits exceed certain defined limits.
The Remuneration Committee has agreed that, in these circumstances, a Director may elect to receive a Pension Compensation Payment rather than further contributions being made to the Scheme.
Such compensation payments will be subject to income tax and national insurance contributions and will not qualify for annual bonus purposes or entitlements under long-term incentive plans.
These compensation payments will not result in the Company incurring any greater cost than would have been the case prior to the changes introduced with effect from 6 April 2006.
The following tables set out information on Directors defined benefit pension entitlements, including funded and unfunded arrangements: Increase Total Increase in accrued Years accrued in accrued benefit during Age at service at benefit at benefit the year 31 December 31 December 31 December during excluding 2006 2006 2006 the year inflation 000 000 000 John Richards 50 25 235 31 23 John Bywater 59 9 76 13 10 Peter Cole 47 17 135 36 32 Grard Devaux 58 20 129 41 38 Simon Melliss 54 15 59 10 9 For each Director, the total accrued benefit at 31 December 2006 represents the annual pension that is expected to be payable on eventual retirement, given the length of service and salary of each director at 31 December 2006.
The increase in accrued benefit earned during the year represents the increase in this expected pension, including the effect of inflation, when compared with the position at 31 December 2005.
The increase in accrued pension excluding the effect of inflation over the year is also shown.

In 2006, the Scheme Actuary has considerably strengthened the Transfer Value basis to reflect the move by the Company to bring the Scheme back to full funding.
This has resulted in an increase in benefit accrual greater than the increase in members entitlements.
The transfer value of the increase in accrued benefits, required by the Listing, Prospectus and Disclosure Rules, more closely discloses the current value of the increase in accrued benefits that the Director has earned in the period.
The total accrued benefit at 31 December 2006 for David Atkins, who was appointed a Director on 1 January 2007, was 16,657.
The transfer value of this benefit at 31 December 2006 was 136,720.
