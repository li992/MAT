The Remuneration Committees Report Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee of the Board the Committee, which met four times in 2006, comprises the nonexecutive Directors of the Company.
George Helland chairman, Iain Paterson and Hector McFadyen all served throughout the year.
The Committee is responsible for determining in particular the remuneration of the Chairman and executive Directors, including the setting of annual performance targets and participation in the executive share option plans.
During the year Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow, who were appointed by the Committee, provided advice and assistance on Directors remuneration, executive incentive plans and Share Scheme matters.
The Company also received advice on various remuneration matters during the year from Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow and Buck Consultants Limited.
The Board determines fees payable to the non-executive Directors who do not participate in the Groups share plans or receive any other benefits.
The constitution and operation of the Committee during the year has complied with the Combined Codes guidance on Directors remuneration, except for the recommended period of notice for executive Directors as referred to below.
Remuneration Policy The Companys policy on remuneration aims to ensure that the individual rewards and incentives are competitive and appropriate to attract, motivate and retain executives of high ability, experience and commitment.
The executive Directors remuneration packages consist of an annual salary, health cover, and where appropriate, car and fuel benefits, life and disability insurance, an annual performance linked cash bonus plan, pension contributions, participation in performance-linked share plans and a performance-linked long term incentive plan.
Performance targets are established to achieve consistency with the interests of shareholders with an appropriate balance between long and short-term goals.
Basic salaries are reviewed annually.
In considering appropriate salary levels, the Committee takes into account the remuneration paid by comparable companies in terms of asset size, revenues, profits, the number of employees, market capitalisation and the complexity and international spread of the Groups operations as well as applicable rates of inflation.
The Companys practice is to target basic salaries at the mid-market level in the appropriate market for the executive position.
In determining executive salaries consideration is given to their experience and general performance level.
The Company operates an executive share option scheme to provide longer term incentives for executives and executive Directors.
This reflects market practice, provides longer term focus and aligns the interests of executives and shareholders.
The award of options under the scheme are performance related and are principally aligned to the basic salary of the Director.
The right to exercise an option is subject to the growth performance of the Companys basic earnings per share BEPS over a three year period in comparison to that of comparator companies, who comprise UK, US and Canadian oil and gas services companies.
No shares are exercisable if the growth in BEPS does not exceed the rate of inflation by at least 3% per annum over the three year period.
The number of shares exercisable, expressed as a percentage, by a Director can range from nil if the Companys performance is below the median level, to 40% at the median level and up to 100% if the Companys performance is between the median and upper quartile levels of the comparator group.
The Companys Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP is intended to link key executives remuneration to the long-term success and performance of the Group.
24 2006 annual report & accounts The Remuneration Committees Report continued The LTIP is a performance-linked plan with an incentive pool which for 2006 is calculated using the sum of the Groups after tax operating income after deducting a charge for the after-tax costs of capital at a rate of 7% on average shareholders funds.
The incentive has two components, the first being 2% of the absolute value added, and the second being 5% of the incremental value added.
These performance conditions align the interests of the executives with those of the Group and its shareholders and will only produce value to the participants if value is created for the Group.
Awards are determined for each participant at the beginning of a three-year performance cycle and will be settled at the end of each cycle either in shares or in cash.
The award for each participant is calculated as a percentage of the incentive pool resulting from the performance of the business over the performance cycle.
To phase in the LTIP, three performance cycles began in April 2004, being a one-year, two-year and a normal threeyear cycle.
The measurement period started with effect from 1 January 2004, with awards vesting on 31 December 2004, 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2006.
For awards granted in 2005 and going forward, each cycle is a period of three years.
At 31 December 2006 the pools available for distribution in respect of these performance cycles had increased from 1,638,091 to 4,526,761 following the increase of the pool of 2,888,670 in respect of the award granted in April 2006.
Following vesting, the amount payable under any single award may not exceed a certain multiple of the basic annual salary of each participant as at the relevant award date.
The maximum award levels under the LTIP rules as a multiple of base salaries are 3.5 times annual salary for the Chief Executive and 1.75 times annual salary for other executive Directors.
As the pool was greater than these maximum levels, the awards were restricted to these multiples.
The amount of the pool awarded to all participants as a result of this restriction was 3,550,154.
In 2006 an annual performance-linked cash bonus scheme was in place for the executive Directors.
The scheme, which is not pensionable, is designed to provide an incentive and reward for performance and reflects the competitive markets in which the Group conducts its business.
Dennis Proctor and Dennis Clark are eligible for a bonus under the scheme when 80% of the Group budgeted pre tax profit is achieved.
Below this level no bonus is payable.
The amount payable under the scheme when performance achieves the budgeted profit before tax and return on capital targets, is 65% of base salary for Dennis Proctor and 50% of base salary for Dennis Clark.
When actual results achieve 120% of these performance targets Dennis Proctor and Dennis Clark are entitled to a maximum cash bonus of 130% and 100% of base salary respectively.
Terry Gomke has a similar scheme based on the same percentages as set out above for Dennis Clark.
However his entitlement is based on the results of Gibson Energy.
Richard Hunting has no bonus entitlement and his remuneration and that of the non-executive Directors is wholly non-performance related.
The current balance between fixed and variable remuneration is approximately 24% deriving from salary and benefits and 76% from variable incentives.
2006 annual report & accounts 25 The Remuneration Committees Report continued Performance graph The graph below compares the total shareholder return for an investment in Hunting PLC Ordinary shares with the return for the same investment in the FTSE Oil and Gas index commencing on 31 December 2001.

Directors Service Contracts The Companys policy on executive Directors contracts is to comply with the guidance in the Combined Code.
The contracts of Richard Hunting, Dennis Proctor and Dennis Clark are in compliance with that guidance.
Terry Gomkes contract pre-dates this policy and presently the Remuneration Committee does not consider it appropriate to seek to amend his contract which is in accordance with Canadian practice.
All the Directors Service Agreements contain standard provisions allowing the Company to terminate summarily for cause, such as gross misconduct.
Dennis Proctor entered into an Employment Agreement with Hunting Energy Services Holdings Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, on 7 February 2001.
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA.
Under the terms of the Agreement both Hunting Energy Services Holdings Inc and Dennis Proctor are required to give one years notice of termination.
The Agreement contains a pay in lieu of notice clause which provides for payment of base salary, performance bonus and vacation pay based on an annual entitlement of four weeks.
There are special provisions on a change of control.
These provide for payment of one years base salary together with an amount equal to the average performance bonus paid in the previous two years.
In addition, Dennis Proctor would be entitled to continue to participate in the group insurance programmes for one year following the change of control and, unless otherwise provided in the relevant option agreement, all stock options and stock based awards granted to him will become exercisable at the date of the change of control and will remain exercisable for one year.
26 2006 annual report & accounts The Remuneration Committees Report continued Richard Hunting and Dennis Clark both entered into Service Agreements with the Company on 15 December 1989.
These were amended effective 1 March 2004 whereby both the Company and the Directors are required to give one years notice of termination.
Under the terms of the Service Agreements, the Company reserves the right to pay them in lieu of notice whether given by the Company or by them.
The payment in lieu comprises salary only for Richard Hunting and salary and bonus only for Dennis Clark.
The Company also has the option to put Richard Hunting and Dennis Clark on paid leave of absence on payment of a sum equivalent to salary for Richard Hunting and salary and bonus for Dennis Clark based on the previous 12-month period, subject to them complying with the terms of the Service Agreement.
These conditions also apply on termination following a change of control.
Terry Gomke has an Employment Contract with Gibson Energy Ltd Gibson entered into on 20 May 1999.
This contract is governed by the laws of the Province of Alberta and the federal laws of Canada.
Under the terms of the contract, Terry Gomke is generally required to give 180 days notice of termination.
However, if he resigns to join an organisation which is not a direct competitor of Gibson, he is only required to give 90 days notice.
If, at the time he resigns, a bonus has been declared but not paid to him, he shall be entitled to be paid such bonus.
If the bonus has not been declared at the date of resignation, he shall have no entitlement to it.
Gibson may terminate the contract at any time without prior notice.
However, Gibson would have to pay Terry Gomke twice his annual salary, being his base salary, vehicle allowance, regular remuneration excluding health insurance benefits and bonus and a 10% gross up on his base salary in lieu of benefits.
If the bonus has been declared at the date of termination, but not paid, it remains payable.
In addition, he would be entitled to receive two further years bonuses.
These would be payable at the same time as bonuses for those years are paid to other executives and shall be calculated using the same percentage of pre-tax profits applied to him in the year prior to the termination of his employment.
Any payments made under these provisions will be subject to mitigation.
Special termination provisions apply where there is a change of control or where Terry Gomke terminates the contract within 90 days of a material breach or material change to the terms of his contract without his consent.
In such circumstances, he would be entitled to twice his annual salary as described above and twice the average bonus paid to him in the previous two years.
No reduction for mitigation would be applied in this case.
Non-executive Directors are initially appointed for a fixed term of three years and thereafter, subject to approval of the Board, for a further three-year term.
In the event of early termination by the Company non-executive Directors are not entitled to receive compensation for loss of office.
Iain Paterson was reappointed for a third three year term from 6 June 2006.
