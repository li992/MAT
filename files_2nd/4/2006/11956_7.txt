DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Remuneration Committee The remuneration policy is determined by the Board and is described below.
During 2006, the composition of the Remuneration Committee changed, with Mr M J Le May and Mr D A L Joyce joining the Committee following their appointment to the Board on the 1 March 2006, and Mr N G Hannah and Mr W W Rhodes retiring from the Committee immediately following the 2006 Annual General Meeting.
At the 31 December 2006, the Remuneration Committee of the Board was composed of the non-executive directors Mr M T Davies Chairman, Mr J H Holt, Mr M J Le May and Mr D A L Joyce the Committee.
In February 2007, Sir Nigel Rudd rejoined the Committee as a member.
The Committee recommends to the Board the specific remuneration packages for executive directors.
All of its recommendations made to the Board during the year were accepted.
The Committee meets as often as necessary to discharge its duties, which during 2006 was four times.
Details of members attendance are set out in the Corporate Governance report on page 18.
Advisers New Bridge Street Consultants LLP, who are independent remuneration consultants continue to provide specialist advice to the Committee.
They provided no other type of services to the Pendragon group.
During 2006, Sir Nigel Rudd and Mr T G Finn, provided internal advice to the Committee but not in respect of their own pay.
The secretary to the Committee is Hilary Sykes.
Remuneration Policy A summary of the Committees conclusions and policies implemented during the year were: Annual bonuses will be linked with corporate performance targets, and capped at 100% of salary for exceptional performance: Introduction of a new Long Term Incentive Plan following approval by shareholders at the 2006 AGM, with a matching element of share based incentives: A cost-neutral alternative of a salary supplement in lieu of continued membership of the company pension scheme was offered to executive directors.
The Committee reviewed its remuneration policy at its February 2007 meeting and concluded that it remains appropriate and supports the corporate strategy.
The Companys policy on non-executive directors remuneration is reviewed annually by the Board.
Remuneration for non-executive directors is confined to basic salary without a performance related element.
Non-executive directors may elect to receive all or part of their remuneration in the form of benefits in kind, typically the provision of a motor vehicle for their use.
The Company did not remunerate the Chairmanship of Board committees during 2006.
For 2007, the Chairmen of the Board committees will be remunerated commensurate with the extra time commitment and responsibility involved.
During 2007, the Renumeration Committee will review the fees payable to the Chairmen to ensure that these are consistant with the size of the Company and the time commitment required.
Total remuneration The Companys policy in respect of executive directors remuneration recognises the need to attract and retain directors with levels of remuneration that are arrived at responsibly and reflect their individual contribution and value to the Company.
The remuneration policy places great emphasis on ensuring that the executive directors incentive arrangements have the potential to provide a greater reward than base salary.
Combined with an approach that requires all incentive arrangements to be linked directly to business specific measures, this ensures that rewards will be based on the continued creation of shareholder value.
Further, in order to promote retention and sustained corporate performance, an equal emphasis will normally be placed on short-term and longterm rewards.
Importance of share ownership The company recognises the importance and value of having executive directors who are significant shareholders in the company.
To promote this goal for the next generation of executive directors, during 2005, the company adopted share ownership guidelines.
These guidelines encourage executive directors to hold shares worth 100% of salary 200% of salary for the chief executive within three years of being appointed to the Board.
Other than the acquisition of 100,000 shares by Sir Nigel Rudd on 15 February 2007 not reflected above, there were no changes to the directors interests shown above between 31 December 2006 and the date of this report.
The table above displays interests in shares following the share split on the 22 December 2006.
Base salary Base salaries are reviewed annually and are set by reference to the individuals skill, experience and contribution.
The 2006 salaries were provisionally set on this basis and then New Bridge Street Consultants were then asked to review them against the market.
The Committee was reassured by this exercise and is satisfied that the variable pay opportunity outweighs the salary positioning.
2007 salaries are to be reviewed by the Remuneration Committee in early 2007, again with appropriate benchmarking and with reference to individuals skill, experience and contribution.
Benefits Life assurance, private health cover, professional subscriptions, contribution to home telephone costs and the provision of two cars, one of which is fully expensed, are provided to the executive directors.
Pensions During the course of 2006, and in response to the A-Day pension reforms, the Committee offered the executive directors the choice of withdrawing from the Pendragon Pension Plan in respect of future pension accrual and instead receive a payment in lieu of pension contribution.
By 31 December 2006 all of the executive directors had decided to leave the Pendragon Pension Plan.
In calculating the level of the payment in lieu of pension contribution the Committee was mindful to ensure that the net effect would be broadly cost neutral for the company, with the payment based on the expected cost of funding the current defined benefit pension promise.
This has translated to a payment of circa 26% of salary for executive directors who opt for this choice.
The payment will not be consolidated into base salary for the purposes of future annual bonus payments and long term incentive awards, but will be maintained as a percentage of base salary.
Annual bonus For 2006, the Committee concluded that the executive directors annual bonus potential will be based on corporate financial measures.
The executive directors can earn up to 100% of salary in any one year on a sliding scale with 50% being awarded for achieving expected results and a further 50% for outstanding performance.
Bonus awards at the highest available percentage of salary are made only upon achievement of outstanding performance.
For 2006, the corporate financial measures used in determining bonus were adjusted profit before tax weighted at 40%, gearing weighted at 30% and a measure of the success of the integration of Reg Vardy plc weighted at 30%.
For 2007, the corporate financial measures used in determining bonus will be adjusted profit before tax weighted at 40%, gearing weighted at 30% and a personal performance objective specific to each executive director weighted at 30%.
"28 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Equity incentives At the Annual General Meeting, shareholders approved the adoption of a new Long Term Incentive Plan ""LTIP""."
"The key features are: each year, commencing with bonuses paid in 2006, an executive director may choose to re-invest his annual bonus in purchasing Pendragon shares or buy shares from his own personal resources of an amount up to 100% of salary referred to as Investment Shares, which will then be matched with an award over shares with the same pre-tax value as the monies used to buy the shares: matching share awards will vest on the third anniversary of their grant date a provided the executive is still employed by Pendragon: b to the extent that a performance condition has been satisfied: and c to the extent that the associated shares purchased by the executive have been retained for the three years: the performance condition or conditions will be tailored to the long-term performance of the company and, for the 2006 and 2007 awards, adjusted earnings per share ""EPS"" growth targets will be used: EPS growth per annum Vesting percentage less than RPI 4% 0% RPI 4% 30% RPI 10% or more 100% between RPI 4% and RPI 10% straight-line vesting between 30% and 100% the Company has chosen adjusted EPS on the performance measure because:- - the Company has relatively few direct competitors and therefore choosing a total shareholder return peer group would be problematic - EPS is the most common internal performance measure used in the market by companies of a similar size to Pendragon - the EPS performance condition is considered to be very stretching additionally, under the LTIP, the executive may be granted performance share awards worth up to 100% of base salary per annum: the vesting of performance share awards will occur on the third anniversary of the grant date, provided that the executive is still employed by the company and the same performance conditions as described above have been satisfied: and the adjusted EPS growth targets for 2006 are underpinned by a requirement that the companys total shareholder return TSR outperforms the FTSE 350 total return index over the performance period, with TSR calculations being averaged over a three monthly period prior to both the beginning and end of the performance period."
On the 9 May 2006 the executive directors each invested their total post tax bonus for 2005 in Pendragon shares, in each case at a purchase price of 1.24 per share.
The number of shares acquired is as follows, and forms part of the total shares held by each director as detailed in the table at page 28 above.
Number of Investment Shares Acquired T G Finn 196,270 M S Casha 96,825 D R Forsyth 75,890 H C Sykes 51,390 29 Also on the 9 May 2006, matching and performance share awards were granted to the executive directors, as below.
Future vesting of both matching and performance share awards is subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions explained above.
Matching Shares Awarded Performance Shares Awarded T G Finn 329,100 359,020 M S Casha 162,355 199,455 D R Forsyth 127,250 139,620 H C Sykes 86,000 99,725 Share Options Executive directors have historically participated in the Pendragon 1999 Approved Executive Share Option Scheme, which is an HM Revenue and Customs approved scheme, and the Pendragon 1999 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme the Executive Schemes, each of which was approved at the companys 1999 Annual General Meeting.
Options become exercisable between three and ten years after grant subject to fulfilment of the performance conditions set out in the notes to the table on page 29 of this Report.
No variation has been made during the financial year in the terms and conditions of the share options or the Executive Schemes.
Going forward, grants will only be made under the Executive Schemes in exceptional circumstances.
Changes from previous year The LTIP has now replaced the grant of executive share options to the executive directors.
The executive directors will continue to be eligible to participate in the company's all-employee sharesave scheme.
There have been no changes in directors share options outstanding or exercised since the 31 December 2006.
Sharesave options granted under the Pendragon 1998 Sharesave Scheme that have no performance conditions.
Discretionary share options granted under the Executive Schemes the exercise of which is conditional on the Companys adjusted earnings per share over the three consecutive financial years beginning with the financial year in which the option is granted exceeding by at least 3 per cent per annum compound the increase in the Retail Prices Index over the same period.
When determining the extent to which the EPS performance targets have been met under the Executive Schemes, the Remuneration Committee will seek guidance from external advisors on the effect of the move to Internal Financial Reporting Standards and will endeavour to ensure consistency of measurement over the relevant performance period.
The aggregate gain made by the directors on share options exercised during 2006 was 7,214,775.
The aggregate gain made by the directors on share options exercised during 2005 was 7,080.
Share price information and performance not subject to audit There are no other share option or long term incentive schemes for which the directors are eligible.
The middle market price of Pendragon PLC ordinary sales at 31 December 2006 was 1.00 and the range during the year was 0.94 to 1.31.
Pursuant to a special resolution passed on the 22 December 2006, a share split was approved such that the trading price of the companys ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange was approximately one-fifth of the price of an ordinary share prior to the split.
Following the share split, shareholders will also own five times as many shares.
Directors service contracts All four of the executive directors have service contracts that commenced on 20 December 1999 and do not have an expiry date but can be terminated on giving one year's notice.
The appointment to the Board of any further executive directors would be expected to be on similar terms.
Each of the executive directors' contracts includes protection for the director in the event of a termination arising from a change of control.
Compensation of one year's salary and benefits, together with the value of the maximum annual bonus is payable if the director or the acquirer serves notice of termination within six months of a change of control.
Bearing in mind the consolidation being witnessed in the motor retailing sector at present, the company continues to believe that these provisions are appropriate.
These provisions will be reviewed annually and it is not necessarily the case that any executive director appointed to the Board in the future would be afforded this protection.
Copies of the individual contracts of appointment are available for inspection by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
31 Non-executive directors Each non-executive director has a fixed two year contract, renewable upon expiry at the company's discretion.
When making a decision on reappointment, the Board reviews the non-executive director's attendance and performance at meetings and the composition and skills of the Board as a whole.
Individual details of contracts are: Name Commencement Expiry Sir Nigel Rudd 01.01.06 31.12.07 W W Rhodes 01.01.06 31.12.07 N G Hannah 01.01.05 31.12.06 J H Holt 01.01.06 31.12.07 M T Davies 01.01.07 31.12.08 D A L Joyce 01.03.06 27.04.07 M J Le May 01.03.06 27.04.07 Retired on 31 December 2006 Consistent with the policy for executive directors, the contracts include a provision that the non-executive director will be entitled to a year's total fees and benefits if the contract is terminated by either party following a change of control.

All the above pension benefits exclude any additional pension purchased by additional voluntary contributions.
Total shareholder return not subject to audit The graph below shows the growth in total shareholder return on the Companys shares in comparison to the FTSE 350 Index excluding investment companies.
For the purposes of the graph, total shareholder return has been calculated as the percentage change during the relevant period in the market price of the shares, assuming that any dividends paid are reinvested.
The relevant period is the five years ending 31 December 2006.
A more detailed description of the total shareholder return calculation is set out in the Notes.
Total shareholder return Source: Datastream Pendragon PLC FTSE 350 Index 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 31-Dec-02 31-Dec-03 31-Dec-04 31-Dec-05 31-Dec-06 32 This graph shows the value, by 31 December 2006, of 100 invested in Pendragon PLC on 31 December 2002 compared with the value of 100 invested in the FTSE 350 Index.
The other points plotted are the values at intervening financial year-ends.
This report is required, pursuant to the Regulations, to contain this graph as a visual interpretation of the share price performance against a comparator stock market index.
Total Shareholder Return TSR is calculated over the period of five years ended on 31 December 2006 and reflects the theoretical growth in the value of a shareholding over that period, assuming dividends are reinvested in shares in the company.
The price at which the dividends are reinvested is assumed to be the amount equal to the closing price of the shares on the ex-dividend date plus the gross amount of annual dividend.
The calculation ignores tax and reinvestment charges.
For each company in the index the TSR statistics are normalised to a common start point, which gives the equivalent to investing the same amount of money in each company at that time.
The percentage growth in TSR is measured over the chosen period.
To obtain the TSR growth of the relevant index over the chosen period, the weighted average TSR growth for all the companies in the index is calculated.
In this case, it is the FTSE 350 Index excluding investment companies as explained in Note 3.
The weighting is by reference to the market capitalisation of each company in the index in proportion to the total market capitalisation of all the companies in the index at the end of the chosen measurement period.
The FTSE 350 Index has been selected because the company clearly falls within the criterion reported on by that index, namely, market capitalisation not less than circa 340 million.
Whilst reporting on remuneration issues, I am pleased to advise that below Board level, 24% of the companys costs of employing its team members related to team incentives, reflecting the performance culture that exists throughout the company.
In addition as at 31 December 2006, 18% of the companys team members were participants in one or more of its share based incentive plans.
