DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT for the year ended 31 December 2006 The report on remuneration of the Directors for the year ended 31 December 2006 is set out below and has been prepared in accordance with the applicable statutory regulations.
Certain sections of this Report are subject to statutory audit, as required by the Companies Act 1985.
Those sections are indicated in the section title.
All other sections have not been audited.
1 THE WORK OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE The Board has appointed a Remuneration Committee that comprises James Dean Chairman and Keith Harris who are both considered to be independent Non-Executive Directors.
The remit of the Committee is to consider and recommend to the Board: a.
The remuneration of the Executive Directors, including any performance related awards b.
The administration of the Companys share option schemes The Committee has maintained the same membership throughout the year, and has held five formal meetings during the period.
In addition, the members of the Committee have had informal contact as necessary throughout the year.
The Committee received advice from the Executive Chairman, Sten Mortstedt.
The Committee is able to obtain independent professional advice where necessary, at the Companys expense.
2 REMUNERATION POLICY The Companys policy on remuneration is to set overall remuneration packages at a level sufficient to attract, retain and incentivise high calibre staff with a view to enhancing long-term shareholder value.
Executive Directors Consistent with this policy, emoluments awarded to Executive Directors are intended to be competitive and comprise a mix of both performance and non-performance related remuneration and include discretionary awards.
This is designed to incentivise Directors and to align their interests with those of shareholders, whilst adhering to the goals of Corporate Governance.
Non-discretionary awards are not made.
The Remuneration Committee conducts an annual analysis of the remuneration and emoluments of the Directors against a group of appropriate quoted real estate companies.
In all cases, this analysis showed that, whilst the performance of CLS was in the median to upper quartile of the review group, the remuneration of the Directors was in the lowest quartile for salary and other discretionary awards.
CLS does not operate any long term incentive plans.
The criteria used for judging the Executive Directors fees are: Their own personal performance measured against specific targets The financial performance of the Group as measured against budget, and Total return to shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee believes in incentivising the Directors taking account of the overall emoluments paid, having carefully reviewed these to ensure that they are not paid excessively in comparison to peer group companies.
The Board does not anticipate any significant change to its remuneration policy in the year ending 31 December 2007.
Non-Executive Directors The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is reviewed and determined by the Board, having received the recommendations of the Executive Directors.
Their remuneration consists of fees for their services to the Board and any additional services such as chairing Board Committees.
Thomas Lundqvist also receives a fee as a Non-Executive Director of CLS Capital Partners Limited, the investment division.
Basic salaries The basic salaries of the Executive Directors are reviewed annually as at 1 January.
The annual review takes account of similar positions in a range of comparable companies as indicated above.
Performance-Related Remuneration The performance-related element, if any, of each Executive Directors remuneration is determined after taking into account the performance of the individual and the performance of the Company, together with the emoluments of the individual, compared to those in the comparator group mentioned above.
Sten Mortstedt does not receive a performance-related element in respect of his remuneration as the Remuneration Committee considers that the size of his shareholding in the Company gives an adequate link to performance.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors does not include a performance-related element.

It is policy not to provide share options to Non-Executive Directors.
The exercise of share options granted under the Schemes is conditional upon the satisfaction of performance criteria, namely the growth in the net assets of the Group over a period of three years being at least equivalent to the growth of the All Properties Capital Growth Index maintained by Investment Property Databank Limited.
Details of options held by Directors are set out below.
None of the terms or conditions of the share options were varied during the year.
The notional gain on the exercise of options during 2006 by Tom Thomson was 481,374, this calculated on the difference between the option price and the mid-market price on the date of the option exercise, having deducted broker fees.
The highest, lowest and average mid-market share price in the year are detailed under Share Capital on page 23.
