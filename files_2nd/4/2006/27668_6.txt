In line with the South African BEE transactions, these plans will be used in Namibia to enable primarily black management and staff to participate in ownership of shares in the Company and to incentivise and retain eligible employees of the Old Mutual Groups wholly-owned Namibian businesses.
The Committee has reviewed the operation of the current share incentive schemes, including how discretion is exercised and the grant levels currently applicable, and considers these to be appropriate to the Companys current circumstances and prospects.
The existing share incentive schemes, which were adopted in 1999, expire in 2009.
During 2007, consideration will be given to the types of share incentive schemes that might be required by the Company, outside South Africa and Namibia, with a view to presenting a new scheme for adoption at the AGM in 2008.
Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 66 Employee Share Ownership Trusts The Group operates a number of Employee Share Ownership Trusts ESOTs, through which it collateralises some of its obligations under employee share schemes relating to the Companys shares.
As there are no remaining obligations under the former Old Mutual Group Achievements OMGA Share Incentive Scheme for Senior Managers, the outstanding shares held in the OMGA share trusts were sold during 2006.
The Old Mutual plc Employee Share Trust is used to satisfy awards under the Old Mutual Restricted Share Plan around the Group excluding South Africa, Namibia and Zimbabwe and the strategy is to hold shares approximately equal to the number of shares awarded, but not yet vested, at any time.
Any surplus shares held in trust because of non-vesting are taken into account when purchasing shares in respect of future awards.
There are various trusts in existence in South Africa and Namibia relating to current and historic share incentive schemes.
The strategy for each scheme has historically been to ensure that sufficient shares are acquired to match at least 90% of the obligations of each share incentive grant.
However, as a result of the requirements of the BEE transactions in South Africa and Namibia, it was necessary to place shares allotted as part of the transactions in trust immediately, to cover the total annual share grant allocations likely to be made to black participants in the normal course of business up to 2014 and 2016 respectively.
The general practice of the ESOTs shown in the table below save for the BEE-related trusts is not to vote shares held at shareholder meetings, although beneficiaries of restricted shares may in principle give directions for those shares to be voted.
The Trustees of the OMSA Broad-Based Employee Share Trust, the OMSA Management Incentive Share Trust, the Old Mutual Namibia OMN Broad-Based Employee Share Trust and the OMN Management Incentive Trust may vote any unallocated shares held in these trusts.
At 31 December 2006, the following shares in the Company were held in ESOTs.
